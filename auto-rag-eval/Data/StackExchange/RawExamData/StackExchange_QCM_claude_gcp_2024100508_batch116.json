They aren't even improved from in the previous games, where through them out was completely free.\n\nGuard Impacts were a big part of my game, and now I am having trouble figuring out how to initiate an attack against an aggressive opponent. **Are there any generic strategy changes that would help me, being an old player of the Soul Calibur franchise, adapt to this new system?** Are there any new tricks that were added to the game to compensate for the decreased utility of Guard Impacts?\n\n**Edit**: After playing a bit more, I have noticed I seem to be blocking too much. My health bar is often flickering yellow or red, and it's because I don't know exactly how to deal with an aggressive offense without Guard Impacts.\n\n**Edit 2**: All the answers so far are focusing on how to use the new Guard Impact. While this is good information, it's not what I'm primarily asking for in the question. I want to know what my *other* options are that don't require any soul meter to employ, with a specific emphasis on strategy.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Maxx already gave a good answer for when to use Guard Impact so I'll focus on how to play without it.\n\nThis is coming from someone who played semi\\-seriously for months before starting to incorporate GI in SC4\\.\n\nThe first thing to know is **your character's fastest moves**. It's often just a straight horizontal hit. After that it's a matter of knowing your opponent's attacks and knowing when there's going to be an opening. There's always going to be some time interval either in between or at the end of a combo where you can get in a quick swing,by which I mean you can safely do attack, not necessarily that it will land unblocked. Even if your counter attack is blocked, at least now you're on the offensive.\n\nI've only played SC5 once so far, but it seems like Just Guard gives you a slight edge where you might be able to get in a quick attack before the opponent has a chance to block in some cases, but it comes down to **knowing your opponent's moves and how to react to them**.\n\nAlso some moves have a higher tendency to supersede the opponent's attack than others. I know in general a vertical hit usually cancels out a horizontal hit. Some moves are also faster than the initially appear. I know personally I've found moves that I previously disregarded as not useful turned out to quite useful as they are faster than their animation would make it appear. I think it's an issue of our mind typically watching the time between the start and end of a swing, rather than the time between the start and the time of impact, which may happen well before the end of a swing.\n\nFinally there's a rule of any pretty much any competitive game that has a meta\\-game component: **Set up expectations, then break them.** Repeat a pattern until the opponent figures it out, then break the pattern with something that counters what the opponent's going to do to counter you. For example, lots of characters usually have variations on combos, so there's mid\\-mid\\-low, repeat that a couple times, then occasionally throw in mid\\-mid\\-mid. They'll go to block the low and get slammed with the mid at the end (bonus points if it's a ring out!). It's like in Starcraft, making your opponent over\\-commit to anti\\-air, then coming in with a big ground army instead."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Soul Calibur 5, with the changes to Guard Impact mechanics, what is the most effective strategy for an experienced player to adapt their playstyle and deal with aggressive opponents?\n\nA) Rely heavily on Just Guard to create openings for quick counterattacks\nB) Focus on mastering the new Guard Impact system that requires a full soul meter\nC) Learn and utilize the character's fastest moves, study opponent patterns, and set up expectations to break them\nD) Block more frequently to avoid taking damage from aggressive attacks\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation emphasizes several key points for adapting to the new system without relying on Guard Impacts:\n\n1. Learn your character's fastest moves, often straight horizontal hits, to counter openings in opponent combos.\n2. Study and understand opponent attack patterns to identify safe moments for counterattacks.\n3. Utilize the strategy of setting up expectations and then breaking them, such as repeating a combo pattern and then changing it unexpectedly.\n\nOption A is partially correct but not the most comprehensive strategy. Just Guard is mentioned as potentially useful but not as the primary focus.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the question specifically asks for strategies that don't rely on the new Guard Impact system.\n\nOption D is explicitly mentioned as an ineffective strategy, as the user notes blocking too much leads to a flickering health bar.\n\nThe correct answer provides a more holistic approach to adapting playstyle without relying on the changed Guard Impact mechanics."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/08/08", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/296828", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/29036/"], "docs_id": 296828, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have seen this term come up a fair amount in machine learning. My guess would be that gold data is data which has been manually tagged, rather than learned by some process. However, I'm not too sure. So, what is the meaning of this phrase?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you're probably referring to ***gold standard*** data. This refers to data of very high quality, which is more or less as close as you can get to the ground truth. For example, Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed through behavioral tests, but it's not a perfect diagnosis and can be confused with other types of dementia. A definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's can be made by performing an autopsy on the brain, resulting in an unambiguous diagnosis about which there is no uncertainty. In this case, the autopsy diagnosis represents the gold standard test.\n\nGold standard data is great for machine learning tasks, since it is known to be of high quality, and avoids the \"garbage in, garbage out\" problem. If you want to build a model to predict Alzheimer's disease, you'd much rather have the brain autopsy data, since there will be virtually no mislabeled data. Gold standard data may be hard to come by, however, due to it being difficult or expensive to obtain. I'll also note that while gold standard data represents the highest possible data quality, it still may not be perfect."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In machine learning, what is the primary characteristic of \"gold standard\" data, and why is it particularly valuable for training models?\n\nA) It's data that has been processed using advanced algorithms\nB) It's data that has been collected over an extended period of time\nC) It's data that is as close as possible to the ground truth\nD) It's data that has been approved by industry experts\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Gold standard data in machine learning refers to data that is as close as possible to the ground truth. This type of data is highly valuable for several reasons:\n\n1. Quality: Gold standard data is of very high quality, minimizing errors and uncertainties in the dataset.\n\n2. Reliability: It provides a reliable benchmark against which other data or model outputs can be compared.\n\n3. Model Performance: Training models on gold standard data can lead to better performance, as it reduces the \"garbage in, garbage out\" problem.\n\n4. Reduced Mislabeling: There is minimal risk of mislabeled data, which is crucial for supervised learning tasks.\n\n5. Benchmark: It serves as the best available reference for evaluating the accuracy of other methods or models.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while gold standard data may be processed, its defining characteristic is its closeness to ground truth, not the processing method.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the duration of data collection doesn't necessarily correlate with its quality or accuracy.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while expert approval can be valuable, it's not the defining characteristic of gold standard data. Experts may approve data that isn't necessarily the closest to ground truth.\n\nThe example of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis in the text illustrates this concept well: while behavioral tests (approved by experts) can diagnose Alzheimer's, the autopsy results represent the gold standard as they provide unambiguous, ground truth data."}, "3": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/08/09", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/385501", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/140949/"], "docs_id": 385501, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have such tables in many places of my document:\n\n```\nMy table is $ R = \\raisebox{1.5ex}{{\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n\\textit{x}             & \\textit{y}             &   \\\\ \\cline{1-2}\n\\multicolumn{1}{|l}{a} & \\multicolumn{1}{l|}{A} & 1 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{1}{|l}{a} & \\multicolumn{1}{l|}{B} & 2 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{1}{|l}{b} & \\multicolumn{1}{l|}{C} & 4 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{1}{|l}{b} & \\multicolumn{1}{l|}{D} & 7 \\\\ \\cline{1-2}\n\\end{tabular}}} $\n\n```\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zezmp.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zezmp.png)\n\nIt is an inlined table, which contents are framed, while a header (a first row) and a last column are both standing out like in the picture above.

The Cauchy distribution is continuous. Second, your response variable is non\\-negative. The Cauchy distribution with the parameters you specified puts about 1/5 of its mass on negative values.

Points falling close to the line is evidence of normality, not evidence in favor of being Cauchy distributed (EDIT: Disregard these last 2 sentences; a QQ Cauchy plot \\- not a QQ norm plot \\- was used, which is fine.) The Poisson distribution, used for modeling count data, is inappropriate since the variance is much larger than the mean. The Binomial distribution is also inappropriate since theoretically, your response variable has no upper bound. I'd look into the negative binomial distribution. \n\nAs a final note, your data does not necessarily have to come from a well known, \"named\" distribution.

The negative binomial distribution is suggested as a potentially more appropriate choice because it is discrete and only allows non-negative integers, which aligns with the nature of the data collected.

However, in constructive mathematics, there are multiple Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered fields, which are not provable to be equivalent to each other: one cannot in general prove that the Dedekind real numbers embeds into the initial Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field. (By Cauchy complete we mean complete by Cauchy sequences, not Cauchy nets.)\n\nThe principal square root function is a function defined on the non\\-negative elements $\\[0, \\\\infty)$ of a Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field $\\\\mathbb{R}$ such that it is a two\\-sided inverse of the square function $x^2$ when $x^2$ is restricted on the domain and codomain to $\\[0, \\\\infty)$.\n\nIn classical mathematics, one could prove that the principal square root function exists by proving the fundamental theorem of algebra for any Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field. However, in constructive mathematics, the fundamental theorem of algebra cannot in general be proven for Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered fields.\n\nIn classical mathematics, there is an alternative to proving that the principal square root function exists: by first proving that zero has a square root, and that there exists a two\\-sided inverse function of $x^2$ on the positive elements $(0, \\\\infty)$ of $\\\\mathbb{R}$. The square root of zero is zero in any integral domain, and because in any Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field the square function $x^2$ is continuously differentiable on the open interval $(0, \\\\infty)$ and its derivative $2x$ is always positive on the open interval $(0, \\\\infty)$, by the inverse function theorem, there exists a two\\-sided inverse defined on $(0, \\\\infty)$. (In constructive mathematics, the inverse function theorem still holds for $x^2$ because $x^2$ is uniformly differentiable on every closed subinterval of $(0, \\\\infty)$. Then we use excluded middle to show that if the principal square root function is defined at $0$ and defined on the domain $(0, \\\\infty)$, then it is defined on $\\[0, \\\\infty)$. However, in constructive mathematics, by definition there is no excluded middle, so we cannot prove the last step.\n\nThe exponential function is defined by a particular Taylor series, and the logarithm function could be defined by an analytic continuation of a particular Taylor series. Thus, one could try to define the square root as the function\n$$e^{\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln(x)}$$\nHowever, because $\\\\ln(x)$ is undefined at $x \\= 0$, that function is only defined on the open interval $(0, \\\\infty)$. Similarly to the previous attempt, in classical mathematics, one could use excluded middle to extend the function to $\\[0, \\\\infty)$, but that isn't possible in constructive mathematics.\n\nIs there a way of proving that the principal square root function on the non\\-negative elements of a Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field actually exists? I might be missing something very obvious. Or is it not provable in constructive mathematics that such a function exists in all Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered fields?\n\nThis is fairly important because it is one of the functions used in defining the Euclidean metric in finite\\-dimensional vector spaces over Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered fields. If the latter is the case, then one might have to equip Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered fields with the additional structure of a principal square root function in order to do constructive Euclidean geometry.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think see how this is related to your other questions. These are not resolved last I checked, but the following will answer this question whichever way the other questions end up going.\n\nI believe the following are constructively equivalent for any notion of $\\\\mathbb R$ which is Cauchy complete assuming that unique choice is valid:\n\n1. There are lattice functions $\\\\min/\\\\max:\\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$.\n2. There is an an absolute value function $\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\[0,\\\\infty)$.\n3. There is square root function $\\[0,\\\\infty)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$.\n\nThe equivalence of 1 and 2 follows from these relations:\n$$\\|x\\| \\= \\\\max(x,\\-x), \\\\qquad \\\\max(x,y) \\= \\\\frac{x \\+ y \\+ \\|y \\- x\\|}{2}, \\\\qquad \\\\min(x,y) \\= \\\\frac{x \\+ y \\- \\|y \\- x\\|}{2}.$$\nThat 3 implies 2 follows from $\\|x\\| \\= \\\\sqrt{x^2}$.\n\nThe fun part is that 1 \\& 2 implies 3\\. As you have observed, there is a square root function $(0,\\\\infty)\\\\to(0,\\\\infty)$ by the Inverse Function Theorem.\n\nWith this apparatus, we can define continuous functions $f\\_n:\\[0,\\\\infty)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$:\n$$f\\_n(x) \\= \\\\begin{cases}\n1/2^n \\& \\\\text{when $0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 1/4^n$} \\\\\\\\\n\\\\sqrt{x} \\& \\\\text{when $x \\\\geq 1/4^n$} \\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{cases}$$\nAs stated, that requires knowing whether $x \\\\leq 1/4^n$ or $x \\\\geq 1/4^n$, but we can work around this by patching two functions together:\n\n* $f^{\\-}\\_n:\\[0,1/4^n)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$ is the constant function with value $1/2^n$,\n* $f^{\\+}\\_n:(0,\\\\infty)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$ is defined as $\\\\max(1/2^n,\\\\sqrt{x})$.\n\nSince these functions agree on their overlap, and their domains comprise all of $\\[0,\\\\infty)$ we do get a total function $f\\_n:\\[0,\\\\infty)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$ as a result. (This is where unique choice is used.)\n\nNow the sequence of functions $(f\\_n)\\_{n\\=0}^\\\\infty$ so defined converges uniformly on any closed bounded interval to a continuous function $f:\\[0,\\\\infty)\\\\to\\[0,\\\\infty)$. It is easily seen that this is indeed the square\\-root function: $(f(x))^2 \\= x$ for all $x \\\\geq 0$.\n\n---\n\nIn the above, I discreetly used the fact that a uniformly Cauchy sequence $(f\\_n )^\\\\infty\\_{n\\=0}$ of continuous functions on a closed bounded interval converges to a continuous function on that interval. This is a straightforward consequence of Cauchy completeness and unique choice, so nothing to worry about... but it just occurred to me that this is enough to prove the existence of the absolute value function. To do this without circular reasoning, we need to pick a sequence $(f\\_n)\\_{n\\=0}^\\\\infty$ whose definition doesn't involve min/max, absolute values, square root.

This is just OK since we are only concerned with the potential differences rather than the actual potentials; and also your question is asking the voltage across a resistor, not potentials at its terminals.  \n\nNext, we define another node (X \\- the top red point), and call its potential Vx.

While /etc/resolv.conf was traditionally used for DNS configuration, modern Ubuntu systems use a more complex setup involving dnsmasq and NetworkManager.\n\nOption D is close but not quite accurate.

Then $\\\\gamma$ is the average treatment effect (ATE) conditional on $X$.\n\nNow let $Y\\=TY^T\\+(1\\-T)Y^C$, where $Y^T$ is the outcome in treamtent group and $Y^C$ is the outcome in control group. The primary assumption, which is exploited by ANCOVA, is that the outcome variables $Y^T$ and $Y^C$ are independent from $T$ conditional on $X$. This is also called 'unconfoundedness' written as:\n\n$$P(T\\|Y^T,Y^C,X)\\=P(T\\|X)$$\n\nOtherwise outcome variables and treatment assignment are confounded and (conditional) mean differences on $Y^T$ and $Y^C$ may be caused by other factors than the manipulation (i.e., *even given* $X$). If $T$ and $Y^C$ and $Y^T$ are unconfounded conditional on $X$, the ATE estimate $\\\\gamma$ from ANCOVA will be unbiased given that also all other model assumptions are met. \n\nYou may ask when it is clear whether there is unconfoundedness: this can never be assessed with absolute certainty and it represents the key weakness of adjustment for bias in observational studies. It is recommended (see ref. below) that you include all covariates that are even in tendency (p\\<.10\\) statistically associated (correlated) with either $T$, $Y^C$ or $Y^T$. This suggests that it is not problematic, rather desirable, that $X$ and $T$ are correlated when using ANCOVA (**your first question**). \n\nIn fact, the correlation of covariate(s) with dependent variable 'within the groups' (i.e., $X$ with $Y^C$ or $Y^T$) is an indication that the unconfoundedness assumption holds or is more plausible (**your second question**). But correlation with $T$ likewise indicates this. However: an 'ideal' $X$ covariate is associated to, both, treatment indicator and outcome variables. Since ANOVA does not include $X$ (**your third question**), it would assume unconfoundedness unconditional $X$, i.e., $$P(T\\|Y^T,Y^C)\\=P(T)$$which is a very strong assumption and dependence of $X$ and $T$ would point to its potential violation. It is therefore not recommended in your hypothetical situation and should be preserved to fully randomized experiments, in which any $X$ by definition is independent of treatment and criterion variables.\n\nIt is important to note that meeting all of the **other model assumptions** of ANCOVA is required to find unbiased ATE estimates (e.g., using least squares estimators). Chiefly, this suggests that there is **no interaction** between $T$ and $X$. This is sometimes referred to as effect homogeneity (as opposed to hetorogenous effects, if there is an interaction). Therefore, the model should at least include the interactions as well, which is not standard in ANCOVA models. Furthermore, you assume linearity (inspect residuals to check this assumption) and you also assume that the Y\\-model is correct (i.e., that you included all relevant $X$ to model $Y$). \n\nSometimes, propensity score methods and nonparametric matching methods are superior to ANCOVA because they do not feature the linearity assumption and can include interactions 'on the go'. Moreover, so\\-called double\\-robust methods combine Y\\-modeling with propensity score methods. They guarantee unbiased effect estimates even if the model for $Y$ is incorrect (assuming the propensity score model is correct). Still all of these methods make the unconfoundedness assumption.\n\nFor an excellent treatment of ANOCVA adjustment for selection bias (and also other methods) see: \n\nSchafer, J. L., \\& Kang, J.

What I don't understand is Google's claim that converting from the longhand form to the matrix form *\"is helpful for computational efficiency\"*\n\nWhen, why, and how would it be possible to gain performance improvements in software by expressing calculations as matrix multiplications? If I were to calculate the matrix multiplication in the second (matrix\\-based) image myself, as a human, I'd do it by sequentially doing each of the distinct calculations shown in the first (scalar) image. To me, they are nothing but two notations for the same sequence of calculations. Why is it different for my computer? Why would a computer be able to perform the matrix calculation faster than the scalar one?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This may sound obvious, but computers don't execute **formulas**, they execute **code**, and how long that execution takes depends directly on the code they execute and only indirectly on whatever concept that code implements. Two logically identical pieces of code can have very different performance characteristics. Some reasons that are likely to crop up in matrix multiplication specifically:\n\n* Using multiple threads. There is almost no modern CPU that doesn't have multiple cores, many have up to 8, and specialized machines for high\\-performance computing can easily have 64 across several sockets. Writing code in the obvious way, in a normal programming language, uses only *one* of those. In other words, it may use *less than 2%* of the available computing resources of the machine it's running on.\n* Using SIMD instructions (confusingly, this is also called \"vectorization\" but in a different sense than in the text quotes in the question). In essence, instead of 4 or 8 or so scalar arithmetic instructions, give the CPU *one* instruction that performs arithmetic on 4 or 8 or so registers in parallel. This can literally make some calculations (when they're a perfectly independent and fit for the instruction set) 4 or 8 times faster.\n* Making smarter [use of the cache](https://stackoverflow.com/q/16699247/395760). Memory access are faster if they are *temporally and spatially coherent*, that is, consecutive accesses are to nearby addresses and when accessing an address twice you access it twice in quick succession rather than with a long pause.\n* Using accelerators such as GPUs. These devices are very different beasts from CPUs and programming them efficiently is an whole art form of its own. For example, they have hundreds of cores, which are grouped into groups of a few dozen cores, and these groups share resources \u2014 they share a few KiB of memory that is much faster than normal memory, and when any core of the group executes an `if` statement all the others in that group have to wait for it.\n* [Distribute the work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) over several machines (very important in supercomputers!) which introduces a huge set of new headaches but can, of course, give access to vastly greater computing resources.\n* Smarter algorithms. For matrix multiplication the simple O(n^3\\) algorithm, properly optimized with the tricks above, are often faster than [the sub\\-cubic ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication_algorithm#Sub-cubic_algorithms) for reasonable matrix sizes, but sometimes they win. For special cases such as sparse matrices, you can write specialized algorithms.\n\nA lot of smart people have written very [efficient code for common linear algebra operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAS), using the above tricks and many more and usually even with stupid platform\\-specific tricks. Therefore, transforming your formula into a matrix multiplication *and then implementing that calculation by calling into a mature linear algebra library* benefits from that optimization effort. By contrast, if you simply write the formula out in the obvious way in a high\\-level language, the machine code that is eventually generated won't use all of those tricks and won't be as fast. This is also true if you take the matrix formulation and implement it by calling a naive matrix multiplication routine that you wrote yourself (again, in the obvious way).\n\nMaking code fast *takes work*, and often quite a lot of work if you want that last ounce of performance. Because so many important calculations can be expressed as combination of a couple of linear algebra operations, it's economical to create highly optimized code for these operations. Your one\\-off specialized use case, though? Nobody cares about that except you, so optimizing the heck out of it is not economical."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A machine learning practitioner is implementing a neural network and needs to optimize the performance of matrix multiplication operations.

For example, the resistor is often put AFTER the LED, or the diode is put the opposite way. **Why is the direction of flow often disregarded in electronics?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Electrons have a negative charge. Current is Coulombs per second. Coulombs are positive, so a coulomb moving one direction is actually caused by electrons moving the other direction in meta.\n\nWhen we discuss current we are discussing the flow of positive charge particles. If the flow of current is actually made up of negative particles flowing in the opposite direction it makes no difference, that is two negatives which cancel. It is just a case of math and sign convention.\n\nThe only time you pay attention to the actual carriers is in something like a semiconductor where you need to know what is happening as you travel from electron carriers in the conduction band \"holes\" in the carrier band. The holes are positive charge carriers, but that is because we are counting the absence of an electron, the actual current is still made up of many many electrons slowly drifting.\n\n**### Is current always electrons?**\n\nActually if you ever model electrical systems in the body you will find that you can accurately [model a neuron](http://www.bem.fi/book/10/10.htm) using a transistor network and such. Much of the current relates to ions like potassium. This means that you really do have motion of positive charge articles. It still is just drawn as a schematic because it does not matter what the charge carrier is as long as your schematic models the electrical properties well.\n\n**### Is the electron moving the power?**\nOften people think that your power you are sending is the electron. In reality you are sending electromagnetic signals. You can slow the speed of your signal(ie. the power) propagating down a long pair of wires(one the signal and one the signal return) by changing the dielectric between them. This means two unshielded copper wires just sitting in space will actually have their signal travel near the speed of light. Your coax cable will probably travel very close to two thirds the speed of light. The electrons drifting are a function of the electric field that is present. If you were to measure how fast the electrons are drifing you would find it on the order of a few meters per second."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrical engineering student is designing a circuit and notices that the direction of current flow is often disregarded in schematics.

I could not find any resources which discuss/compare the merits of these two approaches.\n\nMy intuition is that with fewer observations it would be preferable to fit the absolute lower order moments which will be a more stable estimation (just a guess). In practice (in industry not academia) I have seen both methods used (usually the method that is easier to solve analytically...).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Partial answer \\-\\-\\- for the reader to complete.*\n\nWe can simplify the question a bit by considering the relationship between the moments. Consider a random variable $X$ and $m\\_r \\\\equiv \\\\mathbb{E}(X^r)$ denote the $r$th raw moment and let $a\\_r \\\\equiv \\\\mathbb{E}(\\|X\\|^r)$ denote the $r$th absolute moment. For simplicity, we will assume that all the required moments exist.

The lower absolute moments are usually going to be more robust, and may have lower variance, but estimators on the lower order absolute moments are also often biased. There may be a trade\\-off between bias and variance in such cases, and you will need to derive the bias and variance of your estimators in the case under consideration to be sure.\n\nUltimately, the relative merits of two competing estimators is assessed by their statistical properties (e.g., bias, variance, MSE, consistency, other asymptotic properties). Usually this process entails looking at the moments of the estimator (or even its full distribution in some cases) in a class of problems under consideration and seeing how the estimator performs at different sample sizes under different parametric inputs.

It is extremely deadly and I've seen potions with it that can go much higher. The [wiki](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Jarrin_Root) says that jarrin root and deathbell can make a poison of 2400 damage.\n\nYou should have saved it as there's no way to obtain a second jarrin root except through the console.\n\nThrough normally obtainable ingredients, the highest damage poison I was able to make (while wearing 5 pieces of fortify alchemy gear, including usage of the falmer helmet glitch, all necessary alchemy perks and alchemy skill at 100\\) was this:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wPI5G.jpg)\n\nThis was done with these ingredients: \n\n* [Crimson Nirnroot](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Crimson_Nirnroot)\n* [Deathbell](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Deathbell)\n* [Small Antlers](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Small_Antlers)\n\nFor some reason, crimson nirnroot makes the strongest damage health effect @221, all other combinations do not come close.\n\nAssuming the target has no poison resistance, this will end up being roughly 384 instant damage.

Define a new category $\\\\textsf{C}\\_A$ as follows\n> \n> \n> * $\\\\text{Obj}(\\\\textsf{C}\\_A)$ are morphisms $f\\\\in \\\\text{Hom}\\_\\\\textsf{C}(Z,A)$, for any $Z \\\\in \\\\text{Obj}(\\\\textsf{C})$.\n> * Morphisms $f\\_1\\\\to f\\_2$ are commutative diagrams corresponding to morphisms $\\\\sigma: Z\\_1 \\\\to Z\\_2$ such that $f\\_1 \\= f\\_2 \\\\sigma$.\n\nHe then mostly verifies this a category (leaving some exercises for the reader). When introducing this category, he said that the way morphisms are defined here are the \"most natural choice\". I'm curious perhaps then if this would work as a category as well:\n\n* $\\\\text{Obj}(\\\\textsf{C}^\\*\\_A)$ are morphisms $f\\\\in \\\\text{Hom}\\_\\\\textsf{C}(Z,A)$, for any $Z \\\\in \\\\text{Obj}(\\\\textsf{C})$.\n* Morphisms $f\\_1\\\\to f\\_2$ correspond to morphisms $\\\\sigma: A \\\\to A$ (so the diagram looks like a \"U\")\n\nI don't really have a paper and pencil on me to meticulously look into this \\-\\- but it seems this satisifies almost every property of a category:\n\n1. Every object has an identity, namely $1\\_A$.\n2. You can compose morphisms, as they're just identities and $\\\\textsf{C}$ is a category. (Also, wouldn't composition be commutative here?)\n3. Identities respect composition.\n4. Composition is associative, follows from $\\\\textsf{C}$ being a category.\n\nWhat makes me believe this isn't a category though is it fails this fifth requirement:\n\n> $$\\\\text{Hom}\\_{\\\\textsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(A,B)\\\\cap \\\\text{Hom}\\_{\\\\textsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(C,D)\\= \\\\emptyset$$\n>  unless $A\\=C$ and $B\\=D$.\n\nSince in this category essentially every set of morphisms between objects is the set $\\\\text{End}\\_\\\\textsf{C}(A)$. So does this mean $\\\\textsf{C}^\\*\\_A$ doesn't form a category?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's something not written but implicit in your definition: in order for $\\\\sigma f\\_1$ and $f\\_2$ to be equal, they must have the same domain, i.e. morphisms $f\\_1\\\\to f\\_2$ only exist in your (prospective) category when $f\\_1$ and $f\\_2$ are both maps $Z\\\\to A$ for the *same* $Z$.\n\nThat is, an element of $\\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$ is *a commutative triangle* made up of the maps $f\\_1: Z\\\\to A$, $f\\_2: Z\\\\to A$ and $\\\\sigma: A\\\\to A$ (I don't know how to draw commutative diagrams on here, so you can do it yourself!). In particular, elements of the set $\\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$ \"remember\" their domain and codomain $f\\_1$ and $f\\_2$ by definition: these elements aren't just maps $\\\\sigma$, but maps $\\\\sigma$ *along with* domain $f\\_1$ and codomain $f\\_2$. The domain and codomain are *built into* these commutative triangles.\n\nIn practice, people will usually write these maps as $\\\\sigma\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$, but strictly speaking that's not quite true. A better notation, capturing *all* of the information in the commutative triangle, would be $(\\\\sigma, f\\_1, f\\_2\\)\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$.\n\nLong story short: if $\\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$ and $\\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(g\\_1,g\\_2\\)$ intersect \\- say, the element $(\\\\sigma,f\\_1,f\\_2\\)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$ can also be written as $(\\\\tau,g\\_1,g\\_2\\)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(g\\_1,g\\_2\\)$ \\- then *the whole commutative triangle* this element represents must be the same. That is, $\\\\sigma \\= \\\\tau, f\\_1 \\= g\\_1, f\\_2 \\= g\\_2$.\n\n---\n\nTo address something you said about \"naturality\": there's nothing wrong with your category at all. I wouldn't call it \"unnatural\". It's just that it doesn't crop up all that often in mathematics. Aluffi's category $\\\\mathsf{C}\\_A$ does crop up a lot, though; it's even got its own special name, the *slice* category. It's a particular way of viewing how objects in $\\\\mathsf{C}$ behave \"relative to\" $A$. In this case, the notion of \"being relative to $A$\" is a part of the structure of an object $Z\\\\to A$, and if you want to study objects with a certain standing relative to $A$, then it's *natural* to ask for the morphisms to *preserve* that structure. I think this was the sense in which Aluffi used the word."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the category C*_A as described, where objects are morphisms f \u2208 HomC(Z,A) for any Z \u2208 Obj(C), and morphisms f1 \u2192 f2 correspond to morphisms \u03c3: A \u2192 A, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The category C*_A is always well-defined and satisfies all axioms of a category.\n\nB) The category C*_A fails to be a category because morphism sets between different objects may intersect.\n\nC) The category C*_A is isomorphic to the slice category CA described by Aluffi.\n\nD) The category C*_A is well-defined, but the morphisms between objects f1 and f2 should be represented as triples (\u03c3, f1, f2) rather than just \u03c3 to properly capture all necessary information.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because while C*_A can form a valid category, it's crucial to represent the morphisms as triples (\u03c3, f1, f2) rather than just \u03c3. This representation ensures that the domain and codomain information is preserved, which is essential for maintaining the category structure. The triples capture the complete commutative triangle, preventing issues with intersection of morphism sets between different objects.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while C*_A can be a category, it requires careful definition of morphisms as explained in D.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the issue of intersecting morphism sets is resolved by properly defining morphisms as triples.\n\nOption C is incorrect because C*_A is distinctly different from Aluffi's slice category CA.

CloudFlare on the free plan can't do port translation. If you make a request on port 80, CloudFlare will send it to your origin on port 80\\. CloudFlare is essentially invisible. On the enterprise plan CloudFlare may be able to do this for you.\n\nIf your server is on port 8080 you should install a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy). This can be on the same server as the application server, or on a different server. On a different server, with appropriate firewall rules, you can make a [DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)), which increases security.\n\nNginx is very commonly used as a reverse proxy, either on the same server as your app server or a different server. Nginx can easily accept requests on port 80 then pass them on to an app server running on port 80\\. It's very lightweight, requiring very little CPU or RAM.\n\nNginx can also cache pages, based on rules you define, to accelerate serving static resources or anonymous pages. Serving a page from a cache takes much less work than generating the page again. Nginx reverse proxy [guide here](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/reverse-proxy/). I also have an [Nginx/Wordpress guide](https://www.photographerstechsupport.com/tutorials/hosting-wordpress-on-aws-tutorial-pt1-introduction-configuration-downloads/#wpmu-nginx-configuration-files) that will give you some more examples on how to cache pages for anonymous users, but not logged in users.\n\n**Update based on comments**\n\nApparently on Linux you can use iptables to redirect ports. So for example a server running on port 8080 can respond on port 80\\.

While the following is not a complete answer, here is what I would try.\n\n---\n\nConsider the operator $$L u(x) \\= \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (a(x) \\\\nabla u(x)),$$ where $$a(x) \\= (\\\\operatorname{dist}(x, \\\\partial \\\\Omega))^{\\-p}$$ for some $p \\> 0$.

On the stochastic processes side the argument might be the following: there is a diffusion process $X\\_t$ with values in $\\\\Omega$ corresponding to $L$, and $u(x)$ is simply the expected value of $f(X\\_{\\\\tau\\-})$, where $\\\\tau$ is the life\\-time of $X$.\n\nClearly $u$ satisfies the (strong) maximum principle, so it has no local extrema in $\\\\Omega$, unless constant. The question is whether $u$ is continuous at the boundary.\n\nA standard approach in potential theory is to find *barriers*: superharmonic functions which vanish continuously at the boundary. In our case $$h(x) \\= \\\\operatorname{dist}(x, \\\\partial \\\\Omega)$$ appears to be a barrier at every boundary point. It clearly vanishes continuously at the boundary, so let us see if it is superharmonic.\n\nFix $x \\\\in \\\\Omega$ and choose $z \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega$ so that $\\|x \\- z\\| \\= \\\\operatorname{dist}(x, \\\\partial \\\\Omega)$.

As @whuber pointed out in the comments, you need $b \\\\approx \\-200 a$ to get a graph like above.\n\nAs to how people have been fitting this curve up to this point: it seems that people generally cut off the vertical asymptote until they find a good fit. The cutoff choice is still arbitrary, though, making the fitting procedure unreliable and unreproducible.\n\n**Edit 3\\&4** Fixed graph.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The methods we would use to fit this manually (that is, of Exploratory Data Analysis) can work remarkably well with such data.\n\n**I wish to reparameterize the model slightly** in order to make its parameters positive:\n\n$$y \\= a x \\- b / \\\\sqrt{x}.$$\n\nFor a given $y$, let's assume there is a unique real $x$ satisfying this equation; call this $f(y; a,b)$ or, for brevity, $f(y)$ when $(a,b)$ are understood.\n\nWe observe a collection of ordered pairs $(x\\_i, y\\_i)$ where the $x\\_i$ deviate from $f(y\\_i; a,b)$ by independent random variates with zero means. In this discussion I will assume they all have a common variance, but an extension of these results (using weighted least squares) is possible, obvious, and easy to implement. Here is a simulated example of such a collection of $100$ values, with $a\\=0\\.0001$, $b\\=0\\.1$, and a common variance of $\\\\sigma^2\\=4$.\n\n![Data plot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FnfOa.png)\n\n**This is a (deliberately) tough example,** as can be appreciated by the nonphysical (negative) $x$ values and their extraordinary spread (which is typically $\\\\pm 2$ *horizontal* units, but can range up to $5$ or $6$ on the $x$ axis). If we can obtain a reasonable fit to these data that comes anywhere close to estimating the $a$, $b$, and $\\\\sigma^2$ used, we will have done well indeed.\n\n**An exploratory fitting is iterative.** Each stage consists of two steps: estimate $a$ (based on the data and previous estimates $\\\\hat{a}$ and $\\\\hat{b}$ of $a$ and $b$, from which previous predicted values $\\\\hat{x}\\_i$ can be obtained for the $x\\_i$) and then estimate $b$. Because the errors are in *x*, the fits estimate the $x\\_i$ from the $(y\\_i)$, rather than the other way around. To first order in the errors in $x$, when $x$ is sufficiently large, \n\n$$x\\_i \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{a}\\\\left(y\\_i \\+ \\\\frac{\\\\hat{b}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\hat{x}\\_i}}\\\\right).$$\n\nTherefore, we may update $\\\\hat{a}$ by fitting this model with least squares (notice it has only one parameter\\-\\-a slope, $a$\\-\\-and no intercept) and taking the reciprocal of the coefficient as the updated estimate of $a$.\n\nNext, when $x$ is sufficiently *small,* the inverse quadratic term dominates and we find (again to first order in the errors) that\n\n$$x\\_i \\\\approx b^2\\\\frac{1 \\- 2 \\\\hat{a} \\\\hat{b} \\\\hat{x}^{3/2}}{y\\_i^2}.$$\n\nOnce again using least squares (with just a slope term $b$) we obtain an updated estimate $\\\\hat{b}$ via the square root of the fitted slope.\n\n**To see why this works,** a crude exploratory approximation to this fit can be obtained by plotting $x\\_i$ against $1/y\\_i^2$ for the smaller $x\\_i$. Better yet, because the $x\\_i$ are measured with error and the $y\\_i$ change monotonically with the $x\\_i$, we should focus on the data with the *larger* values of $1/y\\_i^2$. Here is an example from our simulated dataset showing the largest half of the $y\\_i$ in red, the smallest half in blue, and a line through the origin fit to the red points.\n\n![Figure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JBsZQ.png)\n\nThe points approximately line up, although there is a bit of curvature at the small values of $x$ and $y$. (Notice the choice of axes: because $x$ is the measurement, it is conventional to plot it on the *vertical* axis.) By focusing the fit on the red points, where curvature should be minimal, we ought to obtain a reasonable estimate of $b$. The value of $0\\.096$ shown in the title is the square root of the slope of this line: it's only $4$% less than the true value!\n\nAt this point the predicted values can be updated via\n\n$$\\\\hat{x}\\_i \\= f(y\\_i; \\\\hat{a}, \\\\hat{b}).$$\n\n**Iterate** until either the estimates stabilize (which is not guaranteed) or they cycle through small ranges of values (which still cannot be guaranteed).\n\nIt turns out that $a$ is difficult to estimate unless we have a good set of very large values of $x$, but that $b$\\-\\-which determines the vertical asymptote in the original plot (in the question) and is the focus of the question\\-\\-can be pinned down quite accurately, *provided there are some data within the vertical asymptote.* In our running example, the iterations do converge to $\\\\hat{a} \\= 0\\.000196$ (which is almost twice the correct value of $0\\.0001$) and $\\\\hat{b} \\= 0\\.1073$ (which is close to the correct value of $0\\.1$). This plot shows the data once more, upon which are superimposed (a) the *true* curve in gray (dashed) and (b) the *estimated* curve in red (solid):\n\n![Fits](https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5mmA.png)\n\n**This fit is so good that it is difficult to distinguish the true curve from the fitted curve:** they overlap almost everywhere. Incidentally, the estimated error variance of $3\\.73$ is very close to the true value of $4$.\n\n**There are some issues with this approach:**\n\n* The estimates are biased. The bias becomes apparent when the dataset is small and relatively few values are close to the x\\-axis. The fit is systematically a little low.\n* The estimation procedure requires a method to tell \"large\" from \"small\" values of the $y\\_i$. I could propose exploratory ways to identify optimal definitions, but as a practical matter you can leave these as \"tuning\" constants and alter them to check the sensitivity of the results. I have set them arbitrarily by dividing the data into three equal groups according to the value of $y\\_i$ and using the two outer groups.\n* The procedure will not work for all possible combinations of $a$ and $b$ or all possible ranges of data. However, it ought to work well whenever enough of the curve is represented in the dataset to reflect both asymptotes: the vertical one at one end and the slanted one at the other end.\n\n---\n\n### Code\n\nThe following is written in *Mathematica*.\n\n```mathematica\nestimate[{a_, b_, xHat_}, {x_, y_}] := \n  Module[{n = Length[x], k0, k1, yLarge, xLarge, xHatLarge, ySmall, \n    xSmall, xHatSmall, a1, b1, xHat1, u, fr},\n   fr[y_, {a_, b_}] := Root[-b^2 + y^2 #1 - 2 a y #1^2 + a^2 #1^3 &, 1];\n   k0 = Floor[1 n/3]; k1 = Ceiling[2 n/3];(* The tuning constants *)\n   yLarge = y[[k1 + 1 ;;]]; xLarge = x[[k1 + 1 ;;]]; xHatLarge = xHat[[k1 + 1 ;;]];\n   ySmall = y[[;; k0]]; xSmall = x[[;; k0]]; xHatSmall = xHat[[;; k0]];\n   a1 = 1/\n     Last[LinearModelFit[{yLarge + b/Sqrt[xHatLarge], \n          xLarge}\\[Transpose], u, u][\"BestFitParameters\"]];\n   b1 = Sqrt[\n     Last[LinearModelFit[{(1 - 2 a1 b  xHatSmall^(3/2)) / ySmall^2, \n          xSmall}\\[Transpose], u, u][\"BestFitParameters\"]]];\n   xHat1 = fr[#, {a1, b1}] & /@ y;\n   {a1, b1, xHat1}\n   ];\n\n```\n\nApply this to data (given by parallel vectors `x` and `y` formed into a two\\-column matrix `data = {x,y}`) until convergence, starting with estimates of $a\\=b\\=0$:\n\n```mathematica\n{a, b, xHat} = NestWhile[estimate[##, data] &, {0, 0, data[[1]]}, \n                Norm[Most[#1] - Most[#2]] >= 0.001 &,  2, 100]\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a biophysics experiment, data is collected that follows the model y = ax - b/\u221ax, where x has additive noise.

In `TimedTriggerManager` should I just override the method to throw an error if the argument (`t`) is not a `TimedTrigger`. If so, What error should I throw? If not, what should I do?\n\n2\\) Should I add another method `getTimedTrigger` to work alongside the supper class's `getTrigger` so that I don't have to keep type casting? (Since the latter would return a `Trigger` object)\n\n3\\) Is there anything else I'm forgetting, or some common practice that I'm not doing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your situation reeks of the classic Shape hierarchy where a Square inherits from Rectangle (and adds the constraint that both dimensions are the same). This is generally regarded as failing the [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle), because the added constraint makes that the base\\-class operations are not always appropriate for the derived class.\n\nIf the `getTrigger` method is only meant for use within the hierarchy, then you could turn the inheritance between `TriggerManager` and `TimedTriggerManager` around (making `TimedTriggerManager` the base class), as a derived class may weaken the requirements placed on method parameters but not strengthen them.\n\nIf `getTrigger` is also meant for outside use, then `TriggerManager` and `TimedTriggerManager` can't have an inheritance relation with each other without violating the LSP.\nIn that case, it might be best to make `TriggerManager` and `TimedTriggerManager` sibling\\-classes that both inherit from a `AbstractTriggerManager`. The `AbstractTriggerManager` provides all the common functionality, but no public methods where `TriggerManager` and `TimedTriggerManager` place different requirements on the parameters (such as `addTrigger`)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Java project, you have a class hierarchy where TimedTriggerManager is a subclass of TriggerManager.

By creating an AbstractTriggerManager and having TriggerManager and TimedTriggerManager as sibling classes, we avoid violating LSP. This approach allows for common functionality in the abstract class while allowing each subclass to implement its specific requirements without compromising the behavior expected from the base class.

We can then always be sure of only using validated values by using this `struct` type.\n\nWe can also provide cast operators from and to the underlying built\\-in type so that values can seamlessly enter and exit as the underlying type.\n\nTake as an example a situation where we need to represent the name of a domain object, and valid values are any string which is between 1 and 255 characters in length inclusive. We could represent this using the following struct:\n\n```\npublic struct ValidatedName : IEquatable<ValidatedName>\n{\n    private readonly string _value;\n\n    private ValidatedName(string name)\n    {\n        _value = name;\n    }\n\n    public static bool IsValid(string name)\n    {\n        return !String.IsNullOrEmpty(name) && name.Length <= 255;\n    }\n\n    public bool Equals(ValidatedName other)\n    {\n        return _value == other._value;\n    }\n\n    public override bool Equals(object obj)\n    {\n        if (obj is ValidatedName)\n        {\n            return Equals((ValidatedName)obj);\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public static implicit operator string(ValidatedName x)\n    {\n        return x.ToString();\n    }\n\n    public static explicit operator ValidatedName(string x)\n    {\n        if (IsValid(x))\n        {\n            return new ValidatedName(x);\n        }\n        throw new InvalidCastException();\n    }\n\n    public static bool operator ==(ValidatedName x, ValidatedName y)\n    {\n        return x.Equals(y);\n    }\n\n    public static bool operator !=(ValidatedName x, ValidatedName y)\n    {\n        return !x.Equals(y);\n    }\n\n    public override int GetHashCode()\n    {\n        return _value.GetHashCode();\n    }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return _value;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe example shows the to\\-`string` cast as `implicit` as this can never fail but the from\\-`string` cast as `explicit` as this will throw for invalid values, but of course these could both be either `implicit` or `explicit`.\n\nNote also that one can only initialize this struct by way of a cast from `string`, but one can test whether such a cast will fail in advance using the `IsValid` `static` method.\n\nThis would seem to be a good pattern to enforce validation of domain values which can be represented by simple types, but I don't see it used often or suggested and I'm interested as to why.\n\nSo my question is: what do you see as being the advantages and disadvantages of using this pattern, and why?\n\nIf you feel that this is a bad pattern, I would like to understand why and also what you feel is the best alternative.\n\n**NB** I originally asked [this question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27799135/pros-cons-of-using-struct-to-enforce-validation-of-built-in-type) but it was put on hold as primarily opinion\\-based (ironically subjective in itself) \\- hopefully it can enjoy more success here.\n\nAbove is the original text, below a couple more thoughts, partly in response to the answers received there before it went on hold:\n\n* One of the major points made by the answers was around the amount of boiler plate code necessary for the above pattern, especially when many such types are required. However in defence of the pattern, this could be largely automated using templates and actually to me it doesn't seem too bad anyway, but that is just my opinion.\n* From a conceptual point of view, does it not seem strange when working with a strongly\\-typed language such as C\\# to only apply the strongly\\-typed principle to composite values, rather than extending it to values which can be represented by an instance of a built\\-in type?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is fairly common in ML\\-style languages like Standard ML/OCaml/F\\#/Haskell where it's much easier to create the wrapper types. It provides you with two benefits:\n\n* It allows a piece of code to enforce that a string has undergone validation, without having to take care of that validation itself.\n* It allows you to localize the validation code in one place. If a `ValidatedName` ever contains an invalid value, you know the error is in the `IsValid` method.\n\nIf you get the `IsValid` method right, you have a guarantee that any function that receives a `ValidatedName` is in fact receiving a validated name.\n\nIf you need to do string manipulations you can add a public method that accepts a function that takes a String (the value of the `ValidatedName`) and returns a String (the new value) and validates the result of applying the function. That eliminates the boilerplate of getting the underlying String value and re\\-wrapping it.\n\nA related use for wrapping values is to track their provenance. E.g. C\\-based OS APIs sometimes give handles for resources as integers. You can wrap the OS APIs to instead use a `Handle` structure and only provide access to the constructor to that part of the code. If the code that produces the `Handle`s is correct, then only valid handles will ever be used."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the primary advantages of using a custom struct like ValidatedName to enforce validation of domain values?\n\nA) It improves performance by reducing the number of type conversions needed in the application.\n\nB) It allows for automatic data persistence and serialization of validated values.\n\nC) It ensures type safety and localizes validation logic, guaranteeing that validated types always contain valid values.\n\nD) It simplifies the implementation of equality comparisons and hash code generation for custom types.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe correct answer is C. The primary advantages of using a custom struct like ValidatedName to enforce validation of domain values are:\n\n1. It ensures type safety by creating a distinct type for validated values. This prevents mixing of validated and unvalidated values in the code.\n\n2. It localizes validation logic in one place (the IsValid method and constructor), making it easier to maintain and update validation rules.\n\n3. It guarantees that any instance of the validated type always contains a valid value, reducing the need for repeated validation checks throughout the codebase.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the struct may involve some type conversions, improving performance is not its primary purpose.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the struct doesn't inherently provide automatic data persistence or serialization. These would need to be implemented separately if required.\n\nOption D, while partially true (the struct does implement equality and hash code methods), is not the primary advantage of this pattern. These implementations are more of a best practice for custom types rather than the main benefit of the validation struct."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/06/20", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/413997", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/35131/"], "docs_id": 413997, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Update (2019\\-06\\-25\\):** changing title from *\"Do non\\-invertible MA models make sense?\"* to distinguish it from [Question 333802](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/333802/why-do-we-care-if-an-ma-process-is-invertible).\n\nWhile reviewing MA($q$) models, I came across [these slides](http://www.etsii.upm.es/ingor/estadistica/Carol/TSAtema4petten.pdf) (Alonso and Garcia\\-Martos, 2012\\).

If so, does that make the models unfit for describing real world phenomena?\n\n**Update (2019\\-11\\-09\\)** Found this in the text *Time Series Analysis and Its Applications* (Shumway and Stoffer, page 85\\) which also supports the case that it doesn't really matter if an MA model in non\\-invertible, but we may want to chose the non\\-invertible version of the model for convenience.\n[![Time Series Analysis and Its Applications Page 85](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ubSuA.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ubSuA.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: #### Not a big deal \\- it is strongly stationary and approaches white noise\n\nThe non\\-invertible $\\\\text{MA}(1\\)$ process makes perfect sense, and it does not exhibit any particularly strange behaviour. Taking the Gaussian version of the process, for any vector $\\\\mathbf{y} \\= (y\\_1,...,y\\_n)$ consisting of consecutive observations, we have $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim \\\\text{N}(\\\\mathbf{0}, \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma})$ with covariance:\n\n$$\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{1\\+\\\\theta^2} \\\\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\+\\\\theta^2 \\& \\-\\\\theta \\& 0 \\& \\\\cdots \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n\\-\\\\theta \\& 1\\+\\\\theta^2 \\& \\-\\\\theta \\& \\\\cdots \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& \\- \\\\theta \\& 1\\+\\\\theta^2 \\& \\\\cdots \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\vdots \\& \\\\vdots \\& \\\\vdots \\& \\\\ddots \\& \\\\vdots \\& \\\\vdots \\& \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& \\\\cdots \\& 1\\+\\\\theta^2 \\& \\-\\\\theta \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& \\\\cdots \\& \\-\\\\theta \\& 1\\+\\\\theta^2 \\& \\-\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& \\\\cdots \\& 0 \\& \\-\\\\theta \\& 1\\+\\\\theta^2 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n\nAs you can see, this is a strongly stationary process, and observations that are more than one lag apart are independent, even when $\\|\\\\theta\\|\\>1$. This is unsurprising, in view of the fact that such observations do not share any influence from the underlying white noise process. There does not appear to be any behaviour in which \"past observations increases with the distance\", and the equation you have stated does not establish this (see below for further discussion).\n\nIn fact, as $\\|\\\\theta\\| \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty$ (which is the most extreme case of the phenomenon you are considering) the model reduces asymptotically to a trivial white noise process. This is completely unsurprising, in view of the fact that a large coefficient on the first\\-lagged error term dominates the unit coefficient on the concurrent error term, and shifts the model asymptotically towards the form $y\\_t \\\\rightarrow \\\\theta \\\\epsilon\\_{t\\-1}$, which is just a scaled and shifted version of the underlying white noise process.\n\n---\n\n**A note on your equation:** In the equation in your question you write the current value of the observable time series as a geometrically increasing sum of past values, plus the left\\-over error terms. This is asserted to show that \"the effect of past observations increases with the distance\". However, the equation involves a large number of cancelling terms. To see this, let's expand out the past observable terms to show the cancelling of terms:\n\n$$\\\\begin{equation} \\\\begin{aligned}\ny\\_t \n\\&\\= \\\\epsilon\\_t \\- \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{t\\-1} \\\\theta^i y\\_{t\\-i} \\- \\\\theta^t \\\\epsilon\\_0 \\\\\\\\\\[6pt]\n\\&\\= \\\\epsilon\\_t \\- \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{t\\-1} \\\\theta^i (\\\\epsilon\\_{t\\-i} \\- \\\\theta \\\\epsilon\\_{t\\-i\\-1}) \\- \\\\theta^t \\\\epsilon\\_0 \\\\\\\\\\[6pt]\n\\&\\= \\\\epsilon\\_t \\- ( \\\\theta \\\\epsilon\\_{t\\-1} \\- \\\\theta^2 \\\\epsilon\\_{t\\-2} ) \n\\\\\\\\\\[6pt]\n\\&\\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\- ( \\\\theta^2 \\\\epsilon\\_{t\\-2} \\- \\\\theta^3 \\\\epsilon\\_{t\\-3} ) \\\\\\\\\\[6pt]\n\\&\\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\- ( \\\\theta^3 \\\\epsilon\\_{t\\-3} \\- \\\\theta^4 \\\\epsilon\\_{t\\-4} ) \\\\\\\\\\[6pt]\n\\&\\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\- \\\\ \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\[6pt]\n\\&\\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\- ( \\\\theta^{t\\-1} \\\\epsilon\\_1 \\- \\\\theta^t \\\\epsilon\\_0 ). \\\\\\\\\\[6pt]\n\\\\end{aligned} \\\\end{equation}$$\n\nWe can see from this expansion that the geometrically increasing sum of past values of the observable time series is there solely to get the previous error term:\n\n$$\\\\epsilon\\_{t\\-1} \\= \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{t\\-1} \\\\theta^{i\\-1} y\\_{t\\-i} \\+ \\\\theta^{t\\-1} \\\\epsilon\\_0\\.$$\n\nAll that is happening here is that you are trying to express the previous error term in an awkward way. The fact that a long cancelling sum of geometrically weighted values of the series is equal to the desired error term does not demonstrate that past observations are having \"an effect\" on the present time\\-series value. It merely means that if you want to express $\\\\epsilon\\_{t\\-1}$ in terms of $\\\\epsilon\\_0$ then the only way you can do it is to add in the geometrically weighted sum of the observable series."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider a non-invertible MA(1) process given by yt = \u03b5t - \u03b8\u03b5t-1, where |\u03b8| > 1.

He retrieves recordset for a intersect query from the web service published in house.

Prove once and for all to everyone that the problem is unquestionably server\\-side:** \n\nIf I were the Flex dev, I would use [Fiddler](http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/) (or any other traffic sniffer) and show you a screenshot *proving* the errant values are emitting from your service layer *before they get into Flex*. In other words, make them prove it. ( ..surely they've already done this, right? But if they haven't, they may very well prove *to themselves* that the problem occurs when the data hits Flex. I hope you're not in that situation. :/ )\n\n**2A. Cast the id values as String, server\\-side:** My recommendation? Just do this and be done with it. Assuming you prove Flex is the bad guy in \\#1, I'd cut to the chase and cast your `id` values to String server\\-side, like [this guy](http://abadjimarinov.net/blog/2010/06/24/ActionScript3NumberDataTypeProblemWithLongIntegerValues.xhtml), and [this guy](http://www.curiousfind.com/blog/183). If you do that, it eliminates every variety of \"Flex\\-wierd\\-number\\-stuff\". \n\n**2B. Configure return data types, client\\-side:** ..alternatively, your Flex dev can \"[configure the return data type](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Flex/4.0/AccessingData/WSbde04e3d3e6474c4-668f02f4120d422cf08-7ff7.html)\" for the `id` values, forcing the Flex client to receive them as String values. This saves you some trouble server\\-side, but personally, I'm not a big fan of this approach for the reason that if I have to delete/recreate my service connection in Flex, I have to remember all the specific return types I've configured. (And sometimes this is necessary if anything is refactored or heavily revised server\\-side.) But this is just personal preference based on my experiences.\n\n**2C. Implement a unique solution, client\\-side, to handle large integer values:** This is an option, but it's not necessary to get where you want to be. Nevertheless your Flex dev could experiment with [this so\\-called `BigInt` class](http://kingtut666.wordpress.com/2011/04/19/bigint-in-actionscript-3-0/) (or anything else like it, plucked from the web). I rank this as option 2C because, well\u2014you'd be involving a class someone created and put on their blog. :) Nothing wrong with that, but casting to `String` removes all guess\\-work.\n\nThe truth is I love Flex for the stuff it does well, like rendering rich, visual content\u2014and that's perfect for online maps. But I avoid doing serious arithmetic or buisness logic in Flex. Not to be pessimistic, but if you see clean data when you poll the service layer directly, I automatically suspect the issue begins when the data hits Flex. There's just no shortage of [conversation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7568449/as3-number-type-logic-issues-with-large-numbers) about [this and similar issues](http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?318942-Number-type-acting-whacky-storing-incorrect-number) if you do [some looking](https://www.google.com/search?q=actionscript%20Big%20Number)..\n\nBest of luck. /E"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is experiencing issues with a Flex application where some IDs are being received as negative random numbers instead of positive integers.

This approach eliminates any potential issues with Flex handling large integer values incorrectly, and it doesn't require any changes to the Flex application itself.

The RAID array has unexpectedly split into two separate arrays, which is not a normal behavior. The recommended solution is to remove one of the newly created arrays and then add that drive back to the other array before rebuilding it. This approach addresses the root cause of the problem without unnecessarily replacing hardware or ignoring the issue.

The \\-B flag can be used to slow it down, I'm not sure how it works with the mk2, though.\n2. Target has no clock \\- fuses have been bungled, crystal isn't installed if it is set to crystal, no external clock if it is set to external clock.\n3. Some peripheral you have it hooked up to it is overloading / driving the SPI lines, causing bus contention. Or your reset circuit won't let reset be pulled low, or low fast enough.(too much capacitance, too stiff of a pull up, etc).\n4. More fuse bungling \\- ISP can be disabled, as can the reset pin (which also disables ISP). This may have happened in the past. Not on a new one, though. You'll need a high voltage programmer to get around this one.\n\nAnd lastly, it could be blown.
