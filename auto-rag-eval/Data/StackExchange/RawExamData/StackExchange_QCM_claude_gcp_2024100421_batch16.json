According to Bonferroni, for making sure that you have a probability of smaller than 5% to find a significant result if in fact nothing is going on, you've got to run every single test at level 0\\.05/7\\. This is smaller than the p\\-value for 3 children. From this point of view nothing significant is going on in either situation. You may well keep all categories, but this doesn't give you a meaningful significance. (Obviously you could find that p\\-value suspicious and collect much more data to see whether it becomes even more significant, but it may not be worth the hassle.)\n\nAdded later: There was some discussion about whether it is wrong to treat the number of children as categorical, actually being a number, and what to do instead.\n\nGenerally I agree with the view that it makes sense to use the numerical meaning of the data. However this will usually involve assumptions about the functional form of the relationship. An important principle is that all available subject\\-matter knowledge should be used *before* actually analysing the data, as making modelling decisions based on the data will often produce selection bias effects and runs counter to theory behind some standard methods such as the significance tests for the coefficients.\n\nSo that first step *before seeing the data* should be to ask what kind of functional relationship could make sense here. The easiest assumed relationship would be linearity, but linearity may not be realistic, particularly because there may be a much bigger difference between 0 and any number of children than between two nonzero numbers of children (of course I can't tell without knowing the exact background). Also the relationship may be non\\-monotonic.\n\nAn additional problem is the question what can be identified from the data at what precision. Standard errors for 5, 6, 7 (maybe even 4\\) children suggest that there is not much data for these and whatever can be said will be very imprecise. In fact one could know this already from the plain numbers of observations falling into these categories (taking those into account will hardly bias later analyses as they don't imply information about the regression relationship).\n\nThis means that there may not be enough information to nail down confidently any relationship more complex (i.e., requiring more parameters) than a linear one, and making assumptions that require only a low number of parameters to be estimated is certainly desirable. This also means that treating the larger numbers of children as autonomous categories doesn't give useful information either. The standard errors of about 19 suggest that there is hardly any power to detect anything; for sure shown results cannot even exclude the possibility that there is a monotonic or even linear relationship (or none at all), even though the latter may not be realistic.\n\nIf relationships don't follow simple functional forms, in fact aggregation of categories can be a sensible choice; depending on the background comparing zero with existing children may be justifiable, and in general even something like \"zero\", \"one or two\", \"more than two\" can work better than either using all numbers as separate categories (particularly with very thin numbers on some categories) or assuming linearity or a more complex functional form. As said before, optimally such decisions should be made before seeing the data (or at least the regression relationship); however looking at the data may reveal a *striking* specific deviation from an initial assumption/decision, in which case model selection bias is probably less bad than sticking to an inappropriate initial decision at any cost.\n\nFrom the numbers I currently see, I suspect however that clear evidence for any influence of this variable whatsoever cannot be found in the given data, and I'd be very skeptical if any of the ideas above applied at this time point would lead to a just about significant p\\-value, which in that case may well be explained by model selection bias.\n\nNote also, as discussed elsewhere, that looking at p\\-values often isn't a very good way of doing variable selection."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An analysis is conducted to determine if the number of children is associated with treatment outcome. The researcher finds no significant effect when dichotomizing the variable into \"children\" and \"no children\", but observes a significant association with having 3 children when keeping all levels (0-7). Given this scenario and the information provided, which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation and course of action?\n\nA) The significant result for 3 children is likely valid and should be reported as a key finding.\n\nB) The analysis should be limited to the dichotomized version (children vs. no children) as it's more straightforward and avoids multiple comparisons.\n\nC) The researcher should keep all categories but apply a correction for multiple comparisons, such as the Bonferroni correction, which would likely render the result for 3 children non-significant.\n\nD) The number of children should be treated as a continuous variable and analyzed using a linear regression model.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to keep all categories but apply a correction for multiple comparisons. The answer highlights several important points:\n\n1. Running separate tests for each number of children (0-7) results in multiple comparisons, increasing the risk of Type I errors.\n\n2. Applying the Bonferroni correction (0.05/7) would likely make the p-value for 3 children non-significant, suggesting the finding might be due to chance.\n\n3. Dichotomizing the variable (A and B) is generally not recommended as it can lead to loss of information.\n\n4. Treating the variable as continuous (D) might be an option, but it requires assumptions about the functional relationship that may not be justified without prior knowledge.\n\n5. Keeping all categories while correcting for multiple comparisons allows for a more nuanced analysis without inflating the Type I error rate.\n\nThis approach balances the need for detailed analysis with statistical rigor, addressing the multiple comparison problem while retaining all available information."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/07/24", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/1180508", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 1180508, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Word 2003 one can save as WEB PAGE and get document translatted into HTML coding.\nYou can use VIEW and see SOURCE CODE to get the HTML coding for that file.\n\nIn Word 2007 you can save as web page but I can't find how you VIEW the source code that was created with it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you need to do is right\\-click on the file and select **`Open With...`** and use notepad to view the HTML.\n\nShield your eyes; it's ugly, ugly code.\n\n**EDIT**: To alleviate some of the bloat and make things more legible, I suggest <http://textism.com/wordcleaner/> \\- I've had pretty good results with it in the past, but it only works for files up to 20kb.\n\nFor SO bonus points, check out Jeff's C\\# code here: [Cleaning Word's Nasty HTML](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000485.html)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You have created a complex document in Microsoft Word 2007 and need to convert it to a web page format.

Then the flow will equilibrate and the density will become become stationary but during this time anything can happen. One can build a counter example simply by choosing appropriate initial conditions.\n\nIf your are asking about a stationary state, I can not prove anything but I can argue that the answer is no as well: A stationary flow along the tube, must be driven by a pressure gradient. The definition of a homoentropic fluid is that, up to an additive constant, the pressure and the density are proportional to each other (and the proportionality constant is positive). Then there is as well a gradient of density along the tube. The density is greater upstream and lower downstream. The mass flux is the product of the density and velocity and must be the same at both ends of the tube. If not the system is gaining or loosing particles and is not stationary. Then if there is a high density at the inlet and a low density at the outlet the velocity must compensate in order for the mass fluxes to be the same.

For a homoentropic fluid, pressure and density are proportional to each other. This results in a density gradient along the pipe, with higher density upstream (inlet) and lower density downstream (outlet). \n\nTo maintain a constant mass flux throughout the pipe (which is necessary for a stationary state), the velocity must compensate for the change in density. Since the density is higher at the inlet and lower at the outlet, the velocity must be lower at the inlet and higher at the outlet to ensure the same mass flux at both ends.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the velocities are not the same due to the density gradient.

Usually one surface will be flat, the other has a groove for the o\\-ring.\n\nRead the technical description from any of the vacuum system suppliers in order to get correct specifications for your machining for a given type of seal.\n\nE.g., [https://www.pfeiffer\\-vacuum.com/en/know\\-how/mechanical\\-components\\-in\\-vacuum/connections/detachable\\-flange\\-connections/o\\-ring\\-seals\\-and\\-grooves/](https://www.pfeiffer-vacuum.com/en/know-how/mechanical-components-in-vacuum/connections/detachable-flange-connections/o-ring-seals-and-grooves/)\n\nAlso note that it may be more effective to by a new port that meets your requirements, but it is always fun to make stuff."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A vacuum system engineer is designing a flange for a vacuum port with an 8.75\" diameter.

At 10^-5 Torr, the vacuum is considered High Vacuum (HV), not Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV). This level of vacuum can be achieved using an o-ring seal, typically made of a material like viton, with light vacuum grease to seal imperfections. One surface should be flat while the other has a groove for the o-ring. A high-temperature bake-out is not necessary for this vacuum level. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while copper gaskets with knife edges can be used, they are not the only option and are typically used for higher vacuum levels or high-temperature applications. \n\nOption B is wrong because only one surface needs a groove for the o-ring, not both. \n\nOption C is incorrect on two counts: 10^-5 Torr is HV, not UHV, and a high-temperature bake-out is not required for this vacuum level."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/03/03", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/122950", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/71960/"], "docs_id": 122950, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Automator newbee question here.

Install the program system\\-wide, in a place where your system does **not** put any files installed from packages. On most systems, such \"safe\" folders include `/usr/local/bin/` and `/opt/bin/` \\- those should already be in your `PATH`. (Look inside these folders and if there are many files in them, then it is the *wrong* place to put your own program and you have to look at other folders listed in your `PATH`.)\n2. Modify your `PATH` variable. This is less secure, because it defines additional folders where programs can be kept and someone might play a trick on you, putting his own program there for you to run. \n\nYou can modify the `PATH` variable either temporarily, using\n\n```\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/path/to/your/executable\"\n\n```\n\n(mind the `$PATH` **after** `=`), or permanently by adding the above line to your `.bashrc` file (assuming you use `bash`)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You have developed a custom command-line tool named \"mycmd\" located in \"/home/user/projects/mycmd\".

Here's why:\n\n1. Version 2 clearly implies Version 1 because if every element of X is < every element of Y, then every element of X is certainly \u2264 every element of Y.\n\n2. To show that Version 1 implies Version 2, we consider two cases:\n   a) If there is no element in both X and Y, then every element of X is actually < every element of Y, so Version 1 applies directly.\n   b) If there is an element a in both X and Y, we can choose c = a. This c will satisfy the conditions because it's greater than or equal to every element in X and less than or equal to every element in Y.\n\nThus, the two versions are equivalent as they can be proven to imply each other.

I've spent quite a bit of time reading the Subversion book and feeling like I'm getting no where.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When dealing with multiple projects, I usually switch common libraries code from directly editable to versionned binaries. This way, I can have releases of this libraries, and it let me choose between updating or **not updating** the projects that depend on it. You generally don't want to force an update on a project if you can avoid it, and breaking a build is certainly the worst way to force an update. Stability comes to the price of relatively quick edition. But at the end of the day the time you loose managing your library is far less than the time and energy you would loose handling unhappy programmers with their builds broken.\n\nThis method implies that the common code is relatively stable, and that's where unit testing and even TDD really pays. It's possible to debate about their Return On Investment in small projects, but in my opinion, they really worth it when you're dealing with code that is used across multiple projects, because you cannot just go around and compile/test every project that use it.\n\nRegarding SVN, If you go the binary way, each library should become a distinct project, and each release implies a label, and optionally a branch if maintenance is preferable to update. Avoid the monster library that rule them all. You would have to update it every time there's a minor change, making it impossible for projects to follow the versions. That's where it takes a bit of architecture, to organize your libraries, if they have dependencies on each others.\n\nAs for the binaries, some people upload them in SVN, some people use scripts to download them from a network repository. It really depends on the binaries size, the update frequences, your network architecture, and your personnal preferences.\n\nThat's my experience with this specific issue, but I mainly worked in C/C\\+\\+ and .Net, so there might be other ways to combine editability and stability that I'm not aware of :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A development team is working on multiple projects that share internal libraries.

A better solution would be to move the database configuration to a separate service.\nD) The approach may cause excessive processing on the server and make testing difficult. A better solution would be to only set object creation-related items in the constructor and potentially use a Singleton pattern if the check is absolutely necessary.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The primary concern with the given approach is that it performs potentially heavy operations (file I/O and database checks) in the constructor, which is called every time a page or method is invoked. This can lead to unnecessary processing overhead, especially if multiple classes inherit from this Controller. \n\nAdditionally, this approach can make unit testing more difficult, as it tightly couples the object creation with database operations.\n\nA better solution, as suggested in the top answer, would be to only set things in the constructor that are directly related to creating the object. Database checks and configurations should be handled separately, perhaps in a dedicated method or service.\n\nIf the check must be done in the constructor for some reason, using the Singleton pattern could help by ensuring the heavy operation is only performed once, rather than on every object creation.

It is a label name and is required only if the equation needs to be referenced.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EeR6X.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EeR6X.png)\n\nThe new code\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{array}\n\\usepackage{etoolbox}\n\\newcommand\\addtag[1][]{%\n  \\refstepcounter{equation}\\hfill(\\theequation)%\n  \\notblank{#1}{\\label{#1}}{}}\n\\counterwithin[\\arabic]{equation}{section}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\section{First section}\n\\begin{table}[tbh]\n  \\renewcommand*{\\arraystretch}{1.5}\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{Equations}\\label{tab:equations}\n  \\begin{tabular}{| *2{>{\\(}p{5cm}<{\\)}|}}\n    \\hline\n    \\textbf{Solved for $x$} & \\textbf{Solved for $y$} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    x = a + b          \\addtag[a] & y = d + e \\addtag[b] \\\\ \n    x = d + b \\times k            & y = j^2   \\addtag[c] \\\\ \n    \\hline\n  \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nReferences: Euqation~\\ref{a}, Equation~\\ref{b}, and Equation~\\ref{c}.\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nEDIT.  \n\nNote the equation numbers.

Such edits should be subject to the same review cycle as the original post (in this case the first post, late answer and LQP queues). This would (hopefully) allow spam attempts like this to be caught before being released into the wild.\n\nFor those who can't see it, here's the original answer (it has been deleted as spam now so this is from the edit history):\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kJbBL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kJbBL.png)\n\n1Sadly, the post made it through the first post *and* late answer queues successfully despite not being an attempt to answer the question, but that's another story.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The reason is mostly historical. This functionality came about because as far as the system knows, review\\-deleted posts [don't attribute the deletion to anyone](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/220465/377214), and the author can undelete any deleted post that doesn't have its deletion attributed in the history ([see another example case where this was so](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/327697/377214)). (The \"post deleted from review\" event isn't an actual deletion attribution, just a separate entry, as if you were to query SEDE for delete voters, that column would be empty).\n\nThis behavior was discussed a while back, but it was decided to retain it at the time due to [three main factors](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/227112/377214):\n\n* There were very few such cases: only 849 out of 39,368 review\\-deleted posts, or about 2%, were undeleted afterwards by their authors. Of those, a significant amount were improved by their authors before or after undeleting and weren't subsequently re\\-deleted.\n* It would have been hard at the time (and would still be hard today) to stuff reviewer names into the post's deletion record, as is done with trusted user delete votes.\n* Attributing the deletion to the Community user was considered, but at the time, there was no [explicit exception](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/235254/377214) allowing posts deleted by the Community user to be voted for undeletion; that is, as it's a moderator, it would only allow moderators to undelete. It was decided not to add an exception at the time because of the small number of affected posts; it was only added later (a few months later) for an entirely different reason.\n\nAn apparent compromise was implemented, where the author undeleting their review\\-deleted answer [would raise an automatic moderator flag](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/228479/377214), but that has a couple major issues: first, moderators tend to not look at automatic flags as much, and second, if the author re\\-deletes and undeletes their post again, [the flag will be cleared](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/305603/dont-automatically-clear-the-disputed-low-quality-flags-when-a-post-is-deleted).\n\nAs far as today's situation, it would be nice to have updated statistics for the first bullet above, to see if it's still as small of a problem today as it was at the time or if it's a bigger problem today.\n\nIf it is a bigger problem (not only relatively by percentage but also absolutely by number of posts) I think the responsible thing to do here would be to **attribute review deletions to the Community user** \\- given the feature changes that took place a couple months after the decision above, such posts can now be voted for undeletion, which completely resolves that reason for not implementing at the time. But I'm not entirely sure if the volume is large enough to justify such a change."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason why posts deleted from review queues can be undeleted by their authors without requiring edits or additional review?\n\nA) The system was intentionally designed this way to give authors a second chance.\nB) There's a technical limitation in attributing deletions from review queues to specific users.\nC) The number of such cases was historically very low, making it a low-priority issue.\nD) Attributing deletions to the Community user would prevent any undeletion.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The primary reason is historical and technical. The system doesn't attribute review-queue deletions to specific users, making it difficult to prevent author undeletion. While the low number of such cases (option C) was a factor in not changing this behavior, it wasn't the root cause.

Unfortunately, I've tried several variants of this inequality (together with some additional conditons), but fails.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You did not specify in what terms do you need a necessary and sufficient condition.\nPresumably in terms of the coefficients. One such condition can be obtained as follows: $f(z)$ is univalent if and only if\n$$F(z,w)\\=\\\\frac{f(z)\\-f(w)}{z\\-w}$$\nhas no zeros in the unit polydisk, which is equivalent to\n$$\\\\log F(z,w)$$\nto be convergent in the unit polydisk. And for this, there is a formula generalizing the Cauchy Hadamard's formula for the radius of convergence. So this property is (in principle)\nexpressed in terms of the coefficients. Further conditions of this sort can be found in the book of Goluzin, Geometric theory of functions of a complex variable.\n\nAnother criterion of univalence is Milin's criterion, see, for example\n[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10\\.1070/SM1967v003n01ABEH002364](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1070/SM1967v003n01ABEH002364),\nTheorem 1\\. I believe that some version of Milin's criterion was used in\nde Branges original proof."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes a necessary and sufficient condition for a holomorphic function f(z) = z + \u03a3(n=2 to \u221e) a_nz^n to be univalent in the unit disk?\n\nA) |a_n| \u2264 n for all n \u2265 2\n\nB) log[(f(z)-f(w))/(z-w)] is convergent in the unit polydisk\n\nC) f'(z) \u2260 0 for all z in the unit disk\n\nD) \u03a3(n=1 to \u221e) n|a_n|^2 \u2264 1\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option A is de Branges's theorem, which provides a necessary but not sufficient condition for univalence. Option C is a necessary but not sufficient condition for local univalence. Option D is related to Nehari's univalence criterion but is not a necessary and sufficient condition in general.\n\nOption B is correct because it states that log[(f(z)-f(w))/(z-w)] is convergent in the unit polydisk, which is equivalent to (f(z)-f(w))/(z-w) having no zeros in the unit polydisk. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for f(z) to be univalent in the unit disk, as mentioned in the top answer of the StackExchange post.\n\nThis question tests understanding of univalence conditions for holomorphic functions and distinguishes between necessary, sufficient, and necessary and sufficient conditions."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/13", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/351087", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/220587/"], "docs_id": 351087, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a file and its content looks like:\n\n```\nabc=123|qwer=432|reiw=2344|xyz=123 445|tyu=23 rows\n\n```\n\nI have tried using `tr` and `sed` but I will need to use `awk`\n\nThe desired output should look like:\n\n```\nfile2:\n123|432|2344|123 445|23 rows\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n```\nperl -F'=|\\|' -pe '$_ = join \"|\", grep { $k++ % 2 } @F'\n\nsed -e 's/[^=|]*=//g'\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Given a file with content in the format \"key=value|key=value|...\", which of the following commands will correctly extract only the values, preserving the original delimiter structure?\n\nA) awk -F'=' '{for(i=2;i<=NF;i+=2) printf \"%s%s\", $i, (i<NF ? \"|\" : \"\\n\")}'\n\nB) sed 's/[^=|]*=//g'\n\nC) tr '=' '\\n' | awk 'NR%2==0' | tr '\\n' '|'\n\nD) cut -d'=' -f2- | tr '|' '\\n' | paste -sd'|' -\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanations:\n\nA) This awk command is close but would fail for values containing the '|' character.\n\nB) This sed command correctly removes everything up to and including each '=' character, preserving the original structure including any '|' characters within values.\n\nC) This combination of commands would fail for values containing newlines or '|' characters.\n\nD) This approach using cut and paste would not work correctly for values containing the '|' character.\n\nThe correct answer (B) uses sed to globally remove all characters that are not '=' or '|', followed by any '=' character.

Virtual particles can have any value of invariant mass allowed within the limits of integration, where they are defined.\n\nHere is the definition of a virtual particle, in this pictorial representation of the integration that must be carried out to get the crossection of e\\-e\\- scattering.\n\n[![e-e-](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PEgRj.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PEgRj.gif)\n\nVirtual particles live only within integration limits, they have the quantum numbers of the named particle but their mass is off shell, within the limits of the implied integration.\n\n> When they pop back out of existence do their mass disappear instantly?\n\nThey do not exist outside integration limits, which supply the energy for the interaction. If you are thinking of vacuum loops of pair produced particle antiparticle, they can only exist in corrections to real particle interactions. If no real particles supply four vectors for the interaction, there are no observable virtual particles.\n\n> BTW what is the heaviest virtual particle ever found?\n\nVirtual particles cannot be observed.
