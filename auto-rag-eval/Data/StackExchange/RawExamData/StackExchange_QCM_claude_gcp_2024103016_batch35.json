But who really cares for RAW numbers anyway? Folks are really only concerned about comparative performance, and that's why they check out benchmarks.\n\nIf we start doing this kind of benchmarks, we might finally arrive at the conclusion that server comparisons are moot as there aren't significant performance differences between competing products and that there are other items in the infrastructure/setup that need much more optimization attention. \n\nI am sure that folks who run benchmarks are smart and know all of the above...so how come we still continue getting worthless \"small static file\" benchmarks?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The most important benchmarks are the ones you take against your application before making some changes, then re\\-running them, on your own hardware in your own server environment.\n\nThis won't help if you're trying to choose whether to use framework X versus framework Y for your application or configuration, unless you are in a position to test your servers with multiple configurations before going into production. \n\nBut you're right in that when you look at published benchmarks, there's many factors that can affect the results. Are they worthless? Maybe not completely; if a particular framework or server is performing well in multiple tests, it'll probably perform well for you. If it's slow, it'll probably be relatively slow.\n\nYou may still have other factors to consider. What good is a fast framework if you're not experienced with it and you have to roll out a product on a deadline? Will the people maintaining it have experience on that platform, or be able to learn it quickly? Maybe you have in\\-house experience with a particular language or server that would reduce maintenance overhead or adding modules or features. Maybe you need to have a platform that is actively maintained so you can be confident bugs will be fixed in a timely manner, or when you need help there is an active community to offer advice. The fastest server isn't much help if you can't get it configured and tuned in the first place, after all."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is tasked with choosing a web server and framework for a new e-commerce project.

Pulling the sliver or repairing the fault is more economical, but time consuming. Light sets are so inexpensive today its often worth it to buy a new set.\n\nI tend to keep a few laying around that I can use for spare bulbs. Many bulbs nowadays can blow and still allow the set to work, but this isn't entirely perfect. A bad bulb, or a poorly seated bulb, or a broken bulb lead, or a lead not centered well, or a wire pulled out of the socket is usually the culprit. You can bulb swap unknown bulbs 1 at a time with a single socket you know is working.\n\nWhile you can rewire a set, you'd now have to tape it, and also ensure you arent increasing the voltage so much that you overpower the remaining bulbs and blow them too. 100 light sets are usually using bulbs for 100 light sets. Turn that into a 50 or 25, and the voltage goes up.\n\nNot worth messing with,and if it is, its more useful to keep the set intact.\n\nThe 3 wire part is leading the hot and neutral to another section of the lights, so if it is a 100 set, it is already 50 and 50 :)\n\nDecide if you want the outlet, measure it from end to end with an ohmmeter, and cut and repair the last socket with the outlet if being used, re measure everything before plugging it in, and be sure to keep hot hot, and neutral neutral.\n\nDont both attempting it if you arent able to do this."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When dealing with a set of Christmas lights where half of the set doesn't work, which of the following approaches is most recommended according to the expert's advice?\n\nA) Cut the non-working half and solder the remaining wire ends together to create a shorter, functional string of lights.\n\nB) Replace all the bulbs in the non-working section one by one until the problem is fixed.\n\nC) Purchase a new set of Christmas lights, as it is often more economical and safer than attempting repairs.\n\nD) Rewire the entire set to convert it from a 100-light set to a 50-light set, adjusting for voltage differences.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The expert advises against rewiring or cutting the light set, citing potential issues with voltage and safety. They suggest that buying a new set of lights is often more economical and practical, given the low cost of modern Christmas lights.

This statement accurately reflects the information provided, which indicates that a tax return must be filed if either condition is met: paying income tax during the year or expecting a refund. This use of \"or\" is crucial because it includes both groups of taxpayers without requiring both conditions to be true for any individual.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses \"and,\" which would wrongly limit the filing requirement to only those who both paid tax and expect a refund. \n\nOption C is too broad, as not all individuals are required to file a return.\n\nOption D is too narrow, focusing only on those expecting a refund and ignoring those who paid taxes but may not be due a refund.\n\nThe key is understanding that \"or\" in this context is inclusive, covering all cases where either or both conditions are true, which accurately represents the U.S. tax filing requirements."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/12/27", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/310249", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/269532/"], "docs_id": 310249, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm planning to buy standard 13\\-inch MacBook Pro (2017\\) without Touch Bar or Touch ID features; I plan to use this for basic computing task and web development/programming.\n\nDoes connecting a monitor to MacBook Pro via display adapter lower the refresh rate, or should I just find a non apple monitor that has thunderbolt port?

I'd like to work out where these resets originate from; either it's the router/telnet server on the other side of a VPN or whether it is in fact the ASA5505 my side that the application server is behind. I've read about the ASA series dropping connections due to a low default timeout and am hoping this is the issue.\n\nI've captured packets on the app server to identify the resets. I've now captured packets on the inside interface of the firewall and the resets are there too. What I'm unable to do is capture the packets coming out of the VPN tunnel to see if they're there too. I've tried capturing all packets on the outside interface but there are no any packets at all, so I'm guessing the VPN data cannot be captured via the outside interface. Does anyone know how I can capture the packets as soon as they come out of the VPN tunnel?\n\nTo capture the packets on the inside I've matched on the telnet server as source:\n\n```\ncapture capture1 interface Inside match tcp 171.28.18.50 255.255.255.255 any\n\n```\n\nIn an attempt to capture packets on the outside I've matched any source/dest that's not the ssh connection I've established to monitor the capture:\n\n```\ncapture capture2 interface Outside match tcp any neq 22 any neq 22\n\n```\n\nThe timeout conn line in the config is:\n\n```\ntimeout conn 1:00:00 half-closed 0:10:00 udp 0:02:00 icmp 0:00:02\n\n```\n\nUpdate: \nFollowing the suggestion by Shane Madden I captured ESP packets and have now established that the reset is definitely generated by the ASA. I'm now going to try to increase the `timeout conn`\n\nUpdate:\nI've not yet increased the `timeout conn` but have monitored the VPN connection using the graph in ASDM and it seems that when it's been idle for 30 minutes the tunnel is closed. I'm suspecting the when it's closed the TCP connection is broken and upon sending more data on the connection after an hour the ASA responds with the reset. 30 minutes is the default for `vpn-idle-timeout`. When I run `show run | include vpn-idle-timeout` I get nothing back so hopefully just need to work out how to set the `vpn-idle-timeout` variable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ESP packets should capture just fine \\- they just won't be very helpful in terms of seeing whether there's a reset, since they're still encrypted (what's the ACL or match statement on your `capture` look like?).\n\nTrying to match ESP packet timestamps to reset packet timestamps is the best way I can think of to determine if the ASA's generating the resets.\n\nDumb question: what's your `timeout conn` command on the ASA set to?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An administrator is troubleshooting TCP reset issues on an ASA 5505 firewall.

In short, I calculated my velocity to be about 150m/s. However, I wanted a more realistic speed. I looked up the drag equation and tried to apply it to get a more realistic speed, but I don't think my answer is right.

Considering that the force on the bb from the air pressure is 14N, the air friction would only slow down the bb less than 1%. Is there something I'm doing wrong because it seems that a bb slows down significantly with the distance it travels? Also, is there any way to account for the increasing external air pressure pushing back on the bb as it compresses the air while it accelerates through the barrel? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If we idealize the scenario enough, this is a simple exercise in differential equations, so let's get to work. First, we know that it's *initial* speed is $150 \\\\text{ m/s}$, but that is by no means its final speed \\- obviously, the bb slows down as it travels through air! Let's suppose that the moment the bb exits the barrel, it is no longer being pushed (as Steevan pointed out). So, the only force acting on it is air resistance. So the question is, why does the bb slow down significantly with distance traveled \\- we can determine this exactly, assuming the model is correct.\n\nNow, the model you are using (apparently) for air resistance is given as\n\n$$F\\_d \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} pv^2C\\_DA.$$\n\nWe want to see how the velocity changes as a function of distance! But we know Newton's second law, so we can write that\n\n$$F \\= m \\\\frac{dv}{dt} \\= m \\\\frac{dv}{dx} \\\\frac{dx}{dt} \\= m v' v$$\n\nwhere $v$ is now a function of distance (this uses the chain rule \\- hope you're comfortable with that!).\n\nNow, we can write our differential equation:\n\n$$mv'v \\= \\-\\\\frac{1}{2} pv^2 C\\_DA.$$\n\nNote \\- there is a negative sign there because the force opposes the direction of motion. That is, the force points backwards, and the particle has a positive (forward) velocity. Simplifying, we get\n\n$$v' \\= \\-\\\\frac{1}{2m} pC\\_DAv.$$\n\nNow this is a simple differential equation to solve: we separate variables, i.e. $\\\\frac{v'}{v} \\= \\-\\\\frac{1}{2m}pC\\_DA,$ and then doing some more chain rule magic, we end up with\n\n$$\\\\frac{dv}{v} \\= \\-\\\\frac{1}{2m}pC\\_DA \\\\, dx.$$\n\nNow we can integrate both sides and find our solution:\n\n$$\\\\int\\_{v(0\\)}^{v(x)} \\\\frac{dv}{v} \\= \\-\\\\frac{1}{2m} pC\\_DA \\\\int\\_0^x dx,$$\nor\n$$v(x) \\= v(0\\)\\\\exp{\\\\left(\\-\\\\frac{1}{2m} pC\\_DA x\\\\right)}.$$\nFinally, we can plug in the initial condition, that at $x\\=0$, the speed is $150 \\\\text{ m/s}$:\n\n$$v(x) \\= (150 \\\\text{ m/s}) \\\\exp{\\-\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2m} pC\\_DA x\\\\right)}.$$\n\nFinally, for a numerical answer, you may want to plug in your known constants. Unfortunately, for this you need to know the mass of the bb! For the sake of argument, let's assume a mass of $0\\.12 \\\\text{ g}$, the most common mass for airsoft bbs, according to [Wiki \\- Airsoft Pellets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airsoft_pellets). So, we can now calculate the speed of the bb as it travels, knowing that $\\\\frac{1}{2} pC\\_D A \\= 0\\.00817 \\\\text{ g/m}$!\n\nSo now we have a function for velocity:\n\n$$v(x) \\= (150 \\\\text{ m/s}) \\\\exp{(\\-0\\.0681x)}.$$\n\nFor example, to find the distance at which the speed drops by half, we would solve \n\n$$75 \\\\text{ m/s} \\= (150 \\\\text{ m/s}) \\\\exp{(\\-0\\.0681x)},$$\n\nwhich yields a distance of approximately 10 meters.\n\nNow you see why the bb slows down significantly with distance \\- it's exponential decay, which tends to decrease the quantity a large amount at first, with the amount of decrease decreasing over time (or in this case, distance)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A 0.12g airsoft BB is fired from a gun with an initial velocity of 150 m/s.

You should generally have very technical requirements when the client is also a tech person, e.g. a developer. Like in your case. \n\nIn cases when the client is a non\\-technical person, you'll usually have requirements that go something like: *We want the dialog box to have the round loading thingy, rounded corners and look pretty*. They will rarely set you any constraints related to which library you should use, and in these cases that is completely your choice and responsibility and no explanations are satisfactory.\n\nThere are also rare cases that a very non\\-technical gives you very technical requirements (rare, but it happens). In these cases you should try talking to them to understand what they *want* instead of what they *say* they want and only then suggest a technology which can accomplish the goal in the best way. \n\nOh, yes.

I am familiar with conducting meta\\-analyses and will be undertaking my calculations in R (using the `metafor` and `lme4` packages). To provide greater context, the studies in question ask research subjects to make a binary decision with respect to a personal preference across one of two conditions. In some cases, each participant is assigned to a single condition (making only a single binary response); in others, each subject takes part in both conditions (making two binary responses). For now, presume I have the raw data in all cases. The issue I face is how best to calculate an OR that is comparable across design and whether I should take the correlation between conditions into account for the within\\-subject designs.\n\n**My Current Approach**\n\nI presently use logistic regression to estimate the OR for between\\-subject designs. The slope represents the OR and the sampling variance can be calculated by squaring the SE of the slope coefficient. Using this approach produces estimates comparable to equations reported in common texts such The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta\\-Analysis, 2nd Edition (p. 243\\). I then extend this approach to use a multilevel logistic regression model including a random intercept by subject to estimate the OR for within\\-subject designs while account for the dependency between conditions. The OR and sampling variance are otherwise calculated in the same fashion. \n\n**My Questions:**\n\nWith this in mind, I would like to ask:\n\n1. Is it reasonable to meta\\-analytically aggregate OR calculated using standard and multilevel logistic regression?\n2. Would it be better to use standard logistic regression for both designs (ignoring the correlation between conditions for the within\\-subject designs)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'll focus in my answer purely on the question on how to compute a (log) OR based on a within\\-subjects design that is comparable to that from a between\\-subjects design.\n\nSuppose you have a within\\-subjects design with these data:\n\n```\n                                condition2\n                         decision1   decision2   total\ncondition1   decision1   s           t           a\n             decision2   u           v           b\n             total       c           d           n\n\n```\n\nNote that this is the 'paired\\-subjects' 2x2 table based on `n` subjects. This table can be rearranged into a 'between\\-subjects' 2x2 table:\n\n```\n             decision1   decision2   total\ncondition1   a           b           n\ncondition2   c           d           n\n\n```\n\nThen you can compute what is often called the \"marginal OR\" with the usual equation for computing an odds ratio with:\n\n$$OR \\= \\\\frac{ad}{bc}$$\n\nAnd for meta\\-analytic purposes, we usually work with the log(OR), so just take the log of that. This value is then comparable to that obtained from a between\\-subjects design.\n\nHowever, note that the same `n` subjects are used to compute the cell entries under `condition1` and `condition2`, so the data are not independent. This needs to be taken into consideration when computing the sampling variance of the marginal log odds ratio. Based on Becker and Balagtas (1993\\) (see also: Elbourne et al., 2002, and Stedman et al., 2011\\), we can compute (or to be precise: estimate) the sampling variance of the marginal log(OR) with:\n\n$$Var(log\\[OR]) \\= \\\\frac{1}{a} \\+ \\\\frac{1}{b} \\+ \\\\frac{1}{c} \\+ \\\\frac{1}{d} \\- \\\\frac{2\\\\Delta}{n},$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\\\\Delta \\= n^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{ns \\- ac}{abcd}\\\\right).$$\n\n(Recall that $s$ is the upper\\-left cell count from the paired\\-subjects table.)\n\n**References**\n\nBecker, M.

What I have done in these instances is to take the cut off bottom piece and then reclaimed the inner block for re\\-use. If a table saw is available it is quick work to set the fence just right so that a couple of rip direction passes cleanly cuts off the outer laminations. Alternatively the laminations can be removed using a plane. \n\nOnce the block is nicely cleaned up it can be glued and slipped right up into the open bottom of the door. Use a couple of 1x4 boards on either side of the door and some good sized C\\-Clamps to tighten up the glue joint so that the glue can dry without any gaps. \n\nNote that often the inside of hollow core doors has an internal webbing of cardboard material to bridge the gap between the two lamination skins of the door. Sometimes it is necessary to use a chisel inside the cut open bottom of the door to scrape back the glue joint of this web material on the laminated panel. If this is not smoothed out the re\\-claimed bottom block will make the laminated sides bulge out when trying to glue the block in place."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When cutting down a hollow core door to fit a non-standard frame height, what is the recommended method to maintain the door's structural integrity?\n\nA) Simply cut off the excess from the bottom and leave the door as is\nB) Fill the cut end with expanding foam insulation\nC) Reclaim the inner block from the cut-off portion, clean it, and reinsert it into the door\nD) Add a new piece of solid wood to the bottom of the door after cutting\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, when cutting a hollow core door, the recommended method is to reclaim the inner block from the cut-off portion. This block should be cleaned up, possibly by using a table saw or plane to remove the outer laminations. The cleaned block can then be glued and inserted back into the open bottom of the door. This method helps maintain the door's structure and prevents issues like bulging or instability.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply cutting the door without reinforcing it could compromise its integrity.

Cleanup the hole area. Then take one or more more pieces of strapping and attach to existing wall to serve as foundation for the replacement piece of drywall.

For the top and bottom, you will have to cut some strapping or framing so the the replacement piece can be secured to the top and bottom as well, otherwise the seem will crack. Once the framing is in place, cut the replacement piece and secure to studs and new framing. Tape, mud and sand around the edges of your new piece. Paint.

I know I could do part of this by using `year_numeric*species`, but: **what would be the syntax for the random effects?**\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, you create an additional column containing a factor, `species`, which contains as levels the different species. Next, you have to decide which effects you want to be common for all species and which should be species\\-specific. E.g., if you want the linear effect of year\\_numeric to be species\\-specific, in your formula you have to replace `year_numeric` with `year_numeric*species`, as you have already suggested:\n\n```\nglmmTMB(count ~ year_numeric*species + (1|year_factor) + (1|site), \n              family = \"poisson\", data = data)\n\n```\n\nNote, that with this formula you will get e.g. the same random `site` effect for all species, while, when fitting a new model for each species `i` as before, you would usually get for each species a different random `site` effect.\n\nFinally, if you want to use a *random* effect for `year_numeric` for each species, you replace this term with `(0 + year_numeric|species)`:\n\n```\nglmmTMB(count ~ (0 + year_numeric|species) + (1|year_factor) + (1|site), \n              family = \"poisson\", data = data)\n\n```\n\nThe added zero `0 +` in `(0 + year_numeric|species)` indicates that no species\\-dependent random effects *offset* is to be computed. If you do want that, leave out the `0 +`  and just use `(year_numeric|species)`.\n\n---\n\nTo be more precise: the term `(year_numeric|species)` implicitly means `(1 + year_numeric|species)`, i.e each species would have its own extra offset, a **random effect offset**, and those offsets would be *coupled*, both with each other and with the **random effect slope** of `year_numeric`. If you don't want this *implicit* `1 +`, you have to *explicitly* say `0 +`.\n\nIn the equation:\n\n```\ny = a*year_numeric + b\n\n```\n\nthe parameter `a` is a *slope* and the parameter `b` is an *offset*. And in this situation here we have a different offset for each species, e.g. we have one offset $b\\_{hippo}$ for hippos and one offset $b\\_{lion}$ for lions.\n\nFinally, to get a random offset for each combination of `site` and `species` (both I presume to be factors), I would suggest the term\n\n```\n(1 | species:site )\n\n```\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the main danger with those mixed effect models is that one is easily tempted to overdo it, creating unnecessarily complex models that are not easily interpretable anymore."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a multi-species Poisson GLMM using glmmTMB, which of the following formulas would correctly specify a model where:\n1) The effect of year_numeric is species-specific\n2) There is a random effect for year_factor\n3) There is a random effect for site\n4) There is a random slope for year_numeric for each species, without a species-dependent random effects offset\n\nA) glmmTMB(count ~ year_numeric*species + (1|year_factor) + (1|site), family = \"poisson\", data = data)\n\nB) glmmTMB(count ~ year_numeric + (1|species) + (1|year_factor) + (1|site), family = \"poisson\", data = data)\n\nC) glmmTMB(count ~ year_numeric*species + (0 + year_numeric|species) + (1|year_factor) + (1|site), family = \"poisson\", data = data)\n\nD) glmmTMB(count ~ (year_numeric|species) + (1|year_factor) + (1|site), family = \"poisson\", data = data)\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because:\n1) year_numeric*species allows for species-specific effects of year_numeric\n2) (1|year_factor) specifies a random effect for year_factor\n3) (1|site) specifies a random effect for site\n4) (0 + year_numeric|species) specifies a random slope for year_numeric for each species without an offset\n\nOption A is incorrect because it lacks the random slope for year_numeric by species.\nOption B is incorrect because it doesn't allow for species-specific effects of year_numeric and doesn't include the random slope.\nOption D is incorrect because (year_numeric|species) would include both a random slope and intercept, which wasn't specified in the requirements."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/09/26", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/226002", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/102283/"], "docs_id": 226002, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What does the phrase \"The horse has left the barn\" mean? \n\nI'm asking this question because I was watching the live testimony of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire before a congressional committee and he said this phrase at the end of the meeting.

This option addresses the customer's primary concern (keyboard problems) without incurring additional costs for an extended warranty.

Using the discriminant condition:\n\n$(\\frac{m^2}{9} - \\frac{1}{16})x^2 + (\\frac{-2m^2 - 2m}{9})x + (\\frac{4m^2 + 8m + 4}{9} - 1) = 0$\n\nThe discriminant should be zero:\n$(\\frac{-2m^2 - 2m}{9})^2 - 4(\\frac{m^2}{9} - \\frac{1}{16})(\\frac{4m^2 + 8m + 4}{9} - 1) = 0$\n\nSolving this gives us $m = 3$ or $m = -\\frac{3}{4}$. The positive slope gives us the upper tangent line.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent line is $y = 3x - 8$."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/02/28", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/10820", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/1235/"], "docs_id": 10820, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am designing a device that automatically adjusts it's physical position as temperature changes. If the device it shut off or power is disconnected the device needs to remember it's last temperature and position. I have the ability to store these values in EEPROM but the problem is the position and temperature could be changing very rapidly. If I were to write the temp and pos to EEPROM after every time they changed that would (1\\) slow down the firmware a bit, and (2\\) likely kill the EEPROM after a year or two. So as I see it my options are as follows...\n\n1\\) use a capacitor/battery to keep the device powered for a short time after power is lost so that I can write the values to EEPROM at that time only. I don't like this because the board is kinda power hungry and this would require a big cap. And I don't have a ton of free space. And I don't want the added cost of a battery and battery holder / or a big cap.\n\n2\\) use F\\-RAM instead of EEPROM so that I can write to it trillions of times without wearing it out. I don't like this option because FRAM is quite a bit more expensive than EEPROM and this is for a production product (not just one).\n\n3\\) Only write the position and temperature every 5 minutes or so. That way I always have a fairly recent position/temp recorded but I am not writing every second so my program is not slowed down and the EEPROM won't die as fast. This seems like my best option.\n\nDoes anyone else have any suggestions that I'm not thinking of?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you need is a technique called **wear leveling**. It doesn't write your data every time at the same location in the EEPROM, but uses some algorithm to use different locations. I've read about complex wear leveling algorithms, but I wouldn't know why the following simple method wouldn't work. \n\nAdd to your data a 24\\-bit counter, so that your data block is for instance 8 bytes long. Pages on a [24AA64](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21189S.pdf) are 32 bytes long, so a 64kb EEPROM holds 256 pages. From the datasheet: \n\n> \"When doing a write of less than 32 bytes\n>  the data in the rest of the page is refreshed\n>  along with the data bytes being written.\n>  This will force the entire page to endure a\n>  write cycle, for this reason endurance is\n>  specified per page.\"\n\nso it doesn't make sense to use data blocks smaller than a 32 bytes page.\n\nLook at the counter of the first page. If it's zero you used the maximum number of write cycles for that page, so you move on to the next page and check that counter. Repeat until you find a counter \\> zero. That's the page you're currently using. Microchip's EEPROMs have a 1 million cycles endurance, which you can increase to 256 million with the given example of maximum 32 bytes per block in a 64kb EEPROM. That should be enough to outlast your product: 40 years if you write once every 5 seconds(!). \n\nYou'll want to initialize your EEPROM on first use. How do you know when that is. Use the last page to write a unique signature upon initialization. Check at each power\\-up if the signature is there. If it isn't the device has to be initialized. You can preset the counter in each page with 0xF4240 (for 1 million) or clear everything to 0xFF and write the 0xF4240 when you first use the page.  \n\nInitializing an EEPROM is needed because sometimes a certain pattern is written to it in the production/test process. \n\n**edit**  \n\nThe wear leveling should solve your problems, but I still want to comment on the capacitor solution. You say the board is rather power\\-hungry, but maybe you can isolate the microcontroller/EEPROM's power from the rest of the board with a diode. So you'll probably need only a few mA when main power is gone. The 24AA64 writes a page in less than 5ms, then at 10mA and an allowable voltage drop of 100mV you'll need \n\n> \\\\$ C \\= \\\\dfrac{I \\\\cdot t}{\\\\Delta V} \\= \\\\dfrac{10mA \\\\cdot 5ms}{100mV} \\= 500\\\\mu F \\\\$\n\nEasy with a small supercap. \n\n**further reading**  \n\n[datasheet 24AA64](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21189S.pdf)  \n\n[EEPROM Endurance Tutorial](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/appnotes/01019A.pdf)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a device that needs to frequently update and store position and temperature data, even when power is lost.

Lately my MacBook Pro uses swap memory, when it has enough free memory. Is this normal and can I do something about it? Also when I only have safari and let's say Xcode open it uses 99% of the RAM. Is this normal behavior?\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/grdd6.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is normal behavior. You are not experiencing any memory issues in your screenshot above. What I suspect is happening is that OS X is creating some placeholder of sorts to enable swap memory, rather than actually using swap memory here. I have never seen a zero in the swap memory section, unless I have just restarted and open the Activity Monitor window fresh, and even then, I rarely see zero. \n\nWith Mavericks and Yosemite, the way the OS uses memory changed a bit. Essentially, the OS takes all the memory, and then manages it out as needed. So, our traditional way of looking at the memory report in Activity Monitor is not really valid. Due to this, Mavericks added the 'Memory Pressure' gauge, to give you an idea of when you have a limitation caused by memory. In your screenshot, you have a green memory pressure. For more [see this answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/128802/imac-with-8gb-ram-memory-always-almost-full/128807#128807).\n\nArs Technica has a nice description of this 'memory compression' in their Mavericks review:\n\n[http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os\\-x\\-10\\-9/17/](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/17/)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user with a late 2013 MacBook Pro 13\" with 8 GB of memory notices that their device is using swap memory even when there appears to be free memory available.

The OS may create a placeholder for swap memory, which doesn't necessarily mean it's actively using swap. The presence of some swap memory, even when free memory is available, is not indicative of a problem. The key indicator of memory issues is the 'Memory Pressure' gauge, which in this case shows green, suggesting no memory limitations.

I've narrowed that down to a problem where PostGIS can not select a Spatial Reference System using Proj4 text.\n\nOne of the main limitations is that I'm dealing with many geospatial locations, and I don't actually know which CRS I'm working with for each one; I only know that they're using the MGA UTM datum, they're located in Australia, and they have a northing, easting and zone which I am given.\n\nI figure I should be able to use the Proj4 text string in order to get the correct CRS like this, because the Proj4 string is consistent for these CRSs except for the zone:\n\n```\nfrom django.contrib.gis.gdal import SpatialReference\nproj = \"+proj=utm +zone=%d +south +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs\" % zone\nsrs = SpatialReference(proj)\n\n```\n\nIs this a reasonable approach?

This eliminates the use of a flag argument, which is considered a pattern to avoid according to the documentation. It improves code readability and maintainability by clearly separating the two different behaviors (safe execution with error handling vs. dangerous execution without error handling) into distinct methods. This approach aligns with the principle of having methods with clear, single responsibilities and avoids the antipattern of using a boolean flag to significantly alter method behavior."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/06/21", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/170101", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/63572/"], "docs_id": 170101, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Please see the sentance below\n\n*Composed* of heavy\\-textured clay *soil*, adobe *has* great elasticity when moist, but when dry is able *of holding* its shape\n\nI'm practising spotting the error in sentences and the answer key says that \"of holding\\* is wrong.

Improving insulation and air sealing is a fundamental step in reducing energy consumption and should be prioritized before considering more complex and costly solutions like solar panels. This aligns with the pyramid's approach of addressing basic efficiency measures first.\n\nOption A (smart home technology) can be helpful but is not as fundamental as insulation. Option B (passive solar design) is important but may not be feasible for existing homes. Option C (geothermal heat pump) is a more advanced and costly solution that should be considered after basic efficiency measures are in place."}}
