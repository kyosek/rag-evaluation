The ~/.Private directory is typically used in older implementations or for encrypting only specific folders, not the entire home directory. The presence or absence of this directory doesn't definitively indicate whether the whole home directory is encrypted.

The development from *shillaber* to *shill* does not prove that the longer word had initial stress: cf. *prof* from *professor* and, conversely, *'burbs* from *suburbs*.

An article published in 1915, when both terms were in active use, explicitly describes them as alternative words used to describe the same thing.\n\nUsage seems to have spread fairly rapidly across the United States. By 1915, instances of *shillaber* and/or *shill* had appeared in periodicals in Los Angeles (1908\\), New York (1911\\), San Francisco (1913\\) and Chicago (1915\\)\u2014but also in Grand Forks, North Dakota (1910\\).\n\nUnfortunately, none of the early matches for *shillaber* gives any hint of where the term came from and what earlier word or person (if any) the term is based on. A New England humorist named [Benjamin Shillaber](http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/tomsawye/shillaber.html) had invented a character named Mrs. Partington, who became famous for such remarks as that she never worried about the price of flour because whenever she bought 50 cents worth, it always cost the same\u2014but Shillaber died in 1890, and he seems to have contributed nothing toward the bunco arts.\n\nLeo Rosten, who isn't shy about asserting Yiddish influences on U.S. English speech patterns and vocabulary, makes no claim for an association between *shill* or *shillaber* and any Yiddish word. I think this is another case where \"origin unknown\" continues to be the safest call."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the origins and early usage of the terms \"shill\" and \"shillaber\" is most accurate?\n\nA) The term \"shill\" first appeared in print in 1916, while \"shillaber\" was first recorded in 1926 in a circus glossary.\n\nB) Both terms originated in Yiddish and were adopted into American English in the early 20th century.\n\nC) The earliest known printed use of \"shill\" dates to 1911, while \"shillaber\" appeared in print as early as 1908.\n\nD) The terms were coined by Benjamin Shillaber, a New England humorist who died in 1890.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The passage provides evidence that \"shill\" appeared in print as early as 1911 in a short story in The Metropolitan Magazine.

It has to do with interpreting Pearson's *r*, and I've never quite seen it expressed this way:\n\n*\"The correlation coefficient expresses relationship in terms of z scores (standard deviations). For instance, the correlation of \u2212.609 conveys that as the independent variable X goes up by one standard deviation, the dependent variable Y is predicted to decrease by .609 standard deviations.\"*\n\nI'm wondering if this is\n\na) accurate (is *r* literally a z\\-score?)\n\nand if\n\nb) someone can flesh out what this *is*, in fact, trying to say.\n\nIt's not that I'm unfamiliar with Pearson's r \\- far from it, in fact. But I didn't really learn to interpret them in terms of z\\-scores. I'm aware that r can be calculated as the sum of the products of each pair of z\\-scores (for X and Y, that is) divided by the sample size, but I'm not quite sure what they're getting at. The bit I've quoted makes me think of the good ol' explanation of regression betas that you always get in intro stats, but I'm otherwise a bit stumped. (And embarrassed, too \\- seems so basic!)\n\nAnyone want to take a crack at this?\n\nThanks!\n\nl\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Pearson sample correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient#For_a_sample) can be written as:\n\n$$r \\= \\\\frac{1}{n\\-1} \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n z\\_{1,i} \\\\cdot z\\_{2,i} \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad z\\_{k,i} \\= \\\\frac{x\\_{k,i} \\- \\\\bar{x}\\_k}{s\\_k}.$$\n\nThis result means that the sample correlation of two vectors $\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\_1$ and $\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\_2$ is equivalent to the sample correlation of their z\\-scores $\\\\boldsymbol{z}\\_1$ and $\\\\boldsymbol{z}\\_2$ (i.e., sample correlation is determined through the z\\-scores). Hence, it is accurate to say that the correlation coefficient expresses a relationship between the z\\-scores of the two sample vectors.\n\nThe second part of the statement, about the predictive effect of a change in one variable, is not true in general, but is true in the special case where the underlying data is jointly\\-normal (so long as we interpret the statement without conflating correlation and cause$^\\\\dagger$). If we have an underlying normal distribution $(X\\_1, X\\_2\\) \\\\sim \\\\text{N}$ then the expected difference in $Z\\_2$ conditional on an \"increase\" from $Z\\_1 \\= x$ to $Z\\_1 \\= x\\+k$ is:\n\n$$\\\\text{Expected difference } (\\\\Delta \\= k) \\= \\\\mathbb{E}(Z\\_2 \\| Z\\_1 \\= x \\+ k) \\- \\\\mathbb{E}(Z\\_2 \\| Z\\_1 \\= x) \\= \\\\rho \\\\cdot k.$$\n\nHence, replacing the true correlation with the sample correlation you would have the predictive result:\n\n$$\\\\text{Predicted change}(\\\\Delta \\= k) \\= \\\\mathbb{E}(Z\\_2 \\| Z\\_1 \\= x \\+ k) \\- \\\\mathbb{E}(Z\\_2 \\| Z\\_1 \\= x) \\= r \\\\cdot k.$$\n\nNow, taking $k\\=1$ yields an interpretation of $r$ as the predictive change in this case:\n\n$$\\\\text{Predicted change}(\\\\Delta \\= 1\\) \\= r \\\\cdot 1 \\= r.$$\n\nHence, we see that for data from an underlying joint\\-normal distribution, an \"increase\" of one standard deviation for one of the variables, leads to a predictive change of $r$ standard deviations for the other variable.

If the value of one variable increases by 2 standard deviations, what is the expected change in the other variable, and what does this tell us about the interpretation of Pearson's r?\n\nA) The other variable is expected to increase by 1.4 standard deviations. This demonstrates that r can be interpreted as the expected change in one variable's z-score given a one standard deviation change in the other variable's z-score.\n\nB) The other variable is expected to increase by 0.7 standard deviations. This shows that r represents the proportion of variance in one variable explained by the other variable.\n\nC) The other variable is expected to increase by 2.8 standard deviations. This illustrates that r is the slope of the regression line when both variables are standardized.\n\nD) The other variable is expected to increase by 0.49 standard deviations. This indicates that r squared is the expected change in one variable's z-score given a one standard deviation change in the other variable's z-score.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: For bivariate normal data, an increase of k standard deviations in one variable is associated with an expected increase of r * k standard deviations in the other variable, where r is the correlation coefficient. In this case, k = 2 and r = 0.7, so the expected increase is 0.7 * 2 = 1.4 standard deviations.\n\nThis interpretation of r as the expected change in one variable's z-score given a one standard deviation change in the other variable's z-score is valid for bivariate normal data. It's important to note that this is a predictive relationship, not necessarily a causal one.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while r^2 does represent the proportion of variance explained, that's not what's being asked here. Option C overstates the change and incorrectly describes r as a slope.

As thus, a variety of leakage sources can trip them:\n\n* Cable leakage due to water in non\\-wet\\-rated cables, degraded insulation, or physical damage\n* Faulty or intentionally leaky appliances or fixtures\n* Capacitive leakage on long lines\n* Water in splices and boxes causing leakage currents to flow\n* Miswiring that routes current around the GFCI\n\nIn your case, even with 350' of cable, you should be fine \\-\\- you'd need a cable running at 200\\-300pF/foot of capacitance to get into trip territory from capacitive leakage alone. (I can't find any figures for UF, and only a passing mention online of 20\\-30pF/foot for NM, nor do I have a capacitance meter and cable samples otherwise I'd test it myself.)\n\nSo, once you rule out a miswire, I'd have your nearest friendly electrician *megger* the cable hot\\-ground and neutral\\-ground to make sure the insulation is good \\-\\- make sure to disconnect the cable at both ends when doing so though!

The documentation states that even at 350 feet, capacitive leakage alone (B) is unlikely to cause tripping. The 250-foot recommendation (A) is not a hard limit and exceeding it slightly shouldn't cause immediate tripping with no load. Miswiring (D) is possible but less likely given that a single-pole GFCI worked fine previously.

From the histogram it looks quite close to a [Pearson Type VI distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_distribution#The_Pearson_type_VI_distribution) with positive excess kurtosis and possibly some slight positive skew. Fitting the distribution to this family would probably give a reasonable fit.\n\nDeviation from normality of errors is not fatal for a regression model, since many of the results are robust to deviations from this distributional assuption. This deviation from normality means that your underlying error distribution is probably slightly leptokurtic. Your coefficient estimates should still be fine, but you will want to take the excess kurtosis into account if you construct prediction intervals for individual values.

The information provided suggests that the residual distribution is leptokurtic (higher peak, lower shoulders, and fatter tails than a normal distribution) with a possibility of slight positive skew. This is evident from the histogram and the mention of positive excess kurtosis (2.489) and slight positive skewness (0.291) in the updated information.\n\nWhile the distribution deviates from normality (as confirmed by Shapiro and Kolmogorov tests), this doesn't invalidate the regression analysis entirely. The top answer states that \"Deviation from normality of errors is not fatal for a regression model, since many of the results are robust to deviations from this distributional assumption.\" It also mentions that \"Your coefficient estimates should still be fine.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the residuals are clearly not perfectly normal. Option B is wrong because the skewness is positive, not negative, and it doesn't invalidate the entire analysis. Option D is too extreme, as the answer suggests that regression can still be performed, but with some considerations for the non-normal distribution when interpreting results or constructing prediction intervals."}, "12": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/04/26", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/223805", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/55236/"], "docs_id": 223805, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I add the controller in my local but it not working.\n\ndi.xml\n\n```\n <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> \n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"../../../../../lib/internal/Magento/Framework/ObjectManager/etc/config.xsd\">\n    <preference for=\"Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost\" type=\"Tychons\\Registration\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost\" />\n </config>\n\n```\n\nmodule.xml\n\n```\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!--\n/**\n * Module configuration.\n */\n-->\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:Module/etc/module.xsd\">\n        <module name=\"Tychons_Registration\" setup_version=\"1.0.0\" />\n</config>\n\n```\n\nCreatepost.php\n\n```\n    namespace Company\\Custom\\Controller\\Catalog\\Product;\n\nclass View extends Tychons\\Registration\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost\n\n{\n    public function execute()\n    {\n        echo \"create post\";exit;\n\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\ncomposer.json\n\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"tychons/registration\",\n    \"description\": \"Manage Registartion\",\n    \"type\": \"magento2-module\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"license\": [\n        \"OSL-3.0\",\n        \"AFL-3.0\"\n    ],\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"files\": [\n            \"registration.php\"\n        ],\n        \"psr-4\": {\n            \"Tychons\\\\Registartion\\\\\": \"\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nregistratio.php\n\n```\n<?php\n/**\n * Module configuration\n */\n\\Magento\\Framework\\Component\\ComponentRegistrar::register(\n    \\Magento\\Framework\\Component\\ComponentRegistrar::MODULE,\n    'Tychons_Registation',\n    __DIR__\n);\n\n```\n\nPlease anyone can help me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You did the mistake at Createpost.php\n\nThe over\\-rewritten class `Tychons\\Registration\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost` definition is totally wrong.\n\n```\n<?php \nnamespace Tychons\\Registration\\Controller\\Account;\n\nclass CreatePost extends \\Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost\n\n{\n    public function execute()\n    {\n        echo \"create post\";exit;\n\n    }\n}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following correctly represents the namespace and class declaration for overriding the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost controller in a custom module named Tychons_Registration?\n\nA) namespace Company\\Custom\\Controller\\Catalog\\Product;\n   class View extends Tychons\\Registration\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost\n\nB) namespace Tychons\\Registration\\Controller\\Account;\n   class CreatePost extends \\Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost\n\nC) namespace Tychons\\Registartion\\Controller\\Account;\n   class CreatePost extends \\Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost\n\nD) namespace Tychons_Registation\\Controller\\Account;\n   class CreatePost extends Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is correct because it accurately represents the namespace and class declaration for overriding the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost controller in the Tychons_Registration module. \n\nThe namespace should match the module's structure (Tychons\\Registration\\Controller\\Account), and the class should extend the original Magento class (\\Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\CreatePost).\n\nOption A is incorrect as it uses the wrong namespace and class name.\nOption C is incorrect due to a typo in the namespace (Registartion instead of Registration).\nOption D is incorrect because it uses an underscore in the namespace, which is not the correct PSR-4 format, and it's missing a backslash before Magento."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/12/31", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/129938", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/34873/"], "docs_id": 129938, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So we're about to have a cold snap (20 degrees, cold for us here in Central Texas). I have old windows on the house in need of replacement, but for now, I did a hack for the next week/month: I placed 2\\.5 mil plastic over the window banks (groups of 2 windows) and securely duct taped the edges. The gap is about 2 1/2 inches.\n\nThe windows themselves are standard 1/16\" thick single pane windows, double hung, been around forever.\n\nMy question is, how much value is there in doing this? I am doing this for approximately 140 square feet of window surface. Is there an estimated flow differential between with and without in terms of BTU's/hour, assuming an outside air temperature of 20 degrees farenheit, a an inside air temperature of 78 degrees farenheit? Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A 0\\.0025 inch thick sheet of any solid has negligible R\\-value in\\-and\\-of\\-itself (for purposes of home insulation).\n\nThe (relatively) calm air next to it does have some R\\-value, on the order of R 0\\.7\\.\n\nHeat flow is calculated using conductivity (U\\-value). U\\-value is the inverse of R\\-value. R\\-value has units of (square foot)(hour)(Fahrenheit degree)/(British Thermal Unit). A British Thermal Unit is enough heat to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one Fahrenheit degree, or about 1055 Joules. 1 BTU/hour is about 1055 Joules / 3600 seconds, or about 0\\.3 Watts.\n\n**If** you have pulled your sheet of plastic tight against the window, then you have not trapped any air between the plastic and the window. Thus, you have not improved the R\\-value of the window.\n\n**If** you have pulled your sheet of plastic taut, but with a layer of still air between the plastic and the window, then you have replaced an air\\-pane assembly (with a total R\\-value of about 1\\.2\\) with an air\\-pane\\-air\\-plastic assembly with a slightly higher R\\-value (perhaps 1\\.9\\). If the effective R\\-value of the original assembly was higher, your savings would be less.\n\nHere are the \u0394U\\-value calculations for going from an R\\-value of 1\\.2 to 1\\.9, and from an R\\-value of 2\\.2 to 2\\.9:\n\n* 1/1\\.2 \\- 1/1\\.9 \\= U 0\\.83 \\- U 0\\.53 \\= \u0394U 0\\.30\n* 1/2\\.2 \\- 1/2\\.9 \\= U 0\\.45 \\- U 0\\.35 \\= \u0394U 0\\.10\n\nSuppose you reduced the heat conduction by 0\\.10 \\- 0\\.30 BTU/sf/hr/F\u00b0.

This change in R-value corresponds to a \u0394U-value of about 0.30 BTU/sf/hr/F\u00b0. With 140 square feet of window area and a temperature difference of 58\u00b0F (78\u00b0F - 20\u00b0F), the energy savings can be calculated as:\n\n140 sf * 0.30 BTU/sf/hr/F\u00b0 * 58\u00b0F = 2436 BTU/hour\n\nThis falls within the range given in answer B (800-2400 BTU/hour).

See the enum [Environment.SpecialFolder](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.environment.specialfolder%28v=vs.110%29.aspx). This is the best place to store your values because you have all the right permissions to read/write files there.\n\nNow you are ready to create a file in that folder using the common StreamWriter class\n\n```\nusing(StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(dataFile, true))\n{\n   ....\n\n```\n\nIn the above statement, the StreamWriter is created inside a using block to ensure its closing and destroying at the end of the enclosing block.\n\nNow you could build the buffer to store your variables. Here I show just one variable and I suppose that these variables are available in this point of the code\n\n```\n   StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n   sb.Append(\"HP=\" + valueForHPToSave.ToString();\n   .... other variables follow this line\n\n```\n\nWrite the buffer to the stream and close and dispose the stream\n\n```\n    sw.Write(sb.ToString());\n}\n\n```\n\nThe inverse operation (read back the values when your app starts) is just a matter to use a StreamReader, ReadAllLines and split every line at the equals sign to recover the original values\n\nAnother approach is to use the built\\-in [serialization mechanism](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Vstudio/ms233843%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) provided by the framework.  \n\nIn this scenario you build a class named `AppState` and you mark it with the `Serializable` attribute\n\n```\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary;\n\n[Serializable()]\npublic class AppState\n{\n     public int HPValue {get; set;}\n     .... other variables to store/read from the serialization stream\n}\n\n```\n\nThe intent is to have an instance of this class written and loaded from disk where you store all the variables needed to restore the state of your application. \n\nNow you could declare in your main class a global instance of the `AppState` class and you start to store the values during the execution of your app.\n\n```\npublic class Program\n{\n     public static AppState stateVariables = new AppState();\n\n     public static void Main()\n     {\n          // read back the values of stateVariables here... (see later)\n          ...\n          stateVariables.HPValue = 100;\n          ...\n     }\n}\n\n```\n\nWhen the application closes you write the instance of your class using code like this\n\n```\nstring folder = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData);\nstring folder = Path.Combine(folder, \"myappNameDataFolder\");\nDirectory.CreateDirectory(folder);\nstring dataFile = Path.Combine(folder, \"myappNameDataFile\");\nusing(Stream stateStream = File.Create(dataFile))\n{\n    BinaryFormatter serializer = new BinaryFormatter();\n    serializer.Serialize(stateStream, stateVariables);\n}\n\n```\n\nWhen the application starts you read the values back using a similar approach\n\n```\npublic class Program\n{\n     public static AppState stateVariables = new AppState();\n\n     public static void Main()\n     {\n          string folder = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData);\n          string folder = Path.Combine(folder, \"myappNameDataFolder\");\n          Directory.CreateDirectory(folder);\n          string dataFile = Path.Combine(folder, \"myappNameDataFile\");\n          if (File.Exists(dataFile))\n          {\n              using(Stream stateStream = File.OpenRead(dataFile))\n              {\n                  BinaryFormatter deserializer = new BinaryFormatter();\n                  stateVariables = (AppState)deserializer.Deserialize(stateStream);\n              }\n          }\n     }\n}\n\n```\n\nPlease, take note that I haven't tested this code, and to fully understand, read more about [Serialization on MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Vstudio/ms233843%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A game developer is creating a console-based RPG and needs to implement a save system.

Is it that the treatment was actually effective in the group of patients we analyzed? Some deeper inference?\"\n\nI think you are confusing the terms of art with the discussion. One of the challenges of talking about things in multiple paradigms is that the different paradigms may use the same words to define different things, or they may not directly discuss something that is of critical importance to one paradigm, but not the other. Both Frequentists and Bayesians, for example, have a concept called an \"expectation,\" but they both define it in a manner that is nonsensical in the other paradigm.\n\nI think this is what is happening here. Sampling statistics have to concern themselves with the \"population,\" precisely because they work in the sample space. It isn't that a Bayesian does not care, it is that it doesn't impact their calculation on anything as directly.\n\nA second problem is that Bayesian statistics isn't one field as there are multiple axiomatic structures you could use. How you discuss reality may change if you use de Finetti's axioms instead of Cox's. It also could depend upon whether you are an objectivist Bayesian who believes as Frequentists do that population parameters are fixed points, but whose location is unknown, versus subjectivist Bayesians who believe that the population parameter is a distribution that nature draws from and not a fixed point.\n\nSomeone like Jaynes, who uses Cox's postulates, would create hypothesis in terms of logical assertions. For example, hypothesis one could be that a drug is non\\-harmful. Hypothesis two would be that it is harmful. Implicitly, this is a universal statement and hence a population statement. The population is never mentioned.\n\nBoth methods depend upon the sample for inference, but a Bayesian can have an infinite number of hypothesis. It is more important for a Bayesian to be clear in what they are asserting and why.\n\nThere is one other difference that is important. When you use a Frequentist method you are concerned with the sampling distribution of the statistic and not the sampling distribution of the data. Infinitely many distributions will have a population mean and they will all use either a t\\-test or z\\-test. The Bayesian is concerned with the sampling distribution of the data, but not the parameters. \n\nConsider a set of independent events that map to a probability over the set \\[0,1] in $d$ dimensions. It will be approximately multivariate normal as the sample size becomes large enough. Now let us assume that although the events are independent, the components that make up the dimensions are not. They are part of a system. Let us also assume they share a common variance, $\\\\sigma^2\\_i\\=\\\\sigma^2\\_j,\\\\forall{i,j}\\\\in{D}$, and that information about any one mean exists in the other means. \n\nThe Bayesian posterior for the set $\\\\mu\\_i,i\\\\in{1\\\\dots{d}}$ for independent dimensions with independent variances and no shared information on the means would look very different from one where you assume a common variance $\\\\sigma^2$ and shared information. The Frequentist tests would be no different but the Bayesian posteriors would be.\n\nBayesian methods are concerned about the population through the likelihood function because it models how the data is generated in the first place in nature. That is why Bayesian model selection methods are so important, because you may not know the true model in nature that the population uses."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided text:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is comparing Bayesian and Frequentist approaches to statistical inference.

If the application code were the limiting factor, we would expect to see similar performance regardless of the server configuration, which is what we observe. However, this doesn't explain why Nginx isn't distributing load effectively.\n\nThe correct approach would be to investigate and optimize the Nginx configuration to ensure it's effectively distributing requests to the backend Apache servers."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/06/11", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/120064", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/49961/"], "docs_id": 120064, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I got the \"SKSE\" and \"SkyUI\" mod for Skyrim, but launching Skyrim causes errors.

According to the documentation, there is no way to use the default Skyrim launcher to run SKSE. The SKSE mod requires its own custom launcher (skse_loader.exe) to function properly. Options A and B are incorrect because the default Skyrim launcher cannot be modified or reconfigured to launch SKSE directly.

For all resultant points not satisfying inequality \\#3, they are reflected along x1 \\+ x2 \\< 0\\.9 (or, alternatively, discarded).\n\nThis should result in a uniform distribution for the triangular area.\n\n---\n\nMy question is whether this is the most efficient algorithm. Can I somehow modify the simulation to simulate the triangle directly? i.e. eliminating the need to do the reflection or to discard any simulated point.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The uniform distribution on the simplex $y\\_1\\+y\\_2\\+y\\_3\\=1$, all $y\\_i\\\\ge 0$, is known as the [Dirichlet$(1,1,1\\)$ distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution). By setting $x\\_i\\=(1\\-3\\\\times 0\\.1\\)y\\_i \\+ 0\\.1$ you will achieve a uniform distribution on the simplex $x\\_1\\+x\\_2\\+x\\_3\\=0\\.7$, because it shrinks everything with a constant scale factor and therefore preserves relative areas.\n\nValues from a Dirichlet distribution can be obtained by generating independent Gamma variables and dividing them by their sum. The $(1,1,1\\)$ means each of these Gamma variables must have a Gamma$(1\\)$ distribution (which is an exponential distribution).\n\nHere is sample `R` code:\n\n```\nn <- 1e3\nalpha <- 1\nx <- matrix(rgamma(n*3, alpha), ncol=3)\nx <- x / rowSums(x) * 0.7 + 0.1\n\n```\n\nIncidentally, an alternate way to generate the raw coordinates (on the third line) is with a uniform distribution\n\n```\nx <- matrix(-log(runif(3*n)), ncol=3)\n\n```\n\nbecause the distribution of $\\-\\\\log(U)$, for $U$ Uniform, is Exponential. Thus this method requires no special statistical functions to carry out.\n\nBut how to confirm the result is correct? One way is to rotate the simplex into the plane and plot the points. This `R` code computes such a rotation matrix, confirms it is a rotation matrix by verifying its cross product is the identity, and plots the points.\n\n```\nbeta <- apply(contr.helmert(3), 2, function(y) y / sqrt(crossprod(y)))\ncrossprod(cbind(beta, 1/sqrt(3))) # Outputs the 3 x 3 identity matrix\nz <- x %*% beta\nplot(z)\n\n```\n\nThey look pretty uniform.\n\n[![Figure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aps5G.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aps5G.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher wants to simulate a uniform distribution of three random real numbers (x1, x2, x3) that satisfy the constraints x1 + x2 + x3 = 1 and each xi > 0.1. Which of the following methods would be the most efficient and accurate way to generate these numbers?\n\nA) Generate x1 and x2 from U(0.1, 0.8), then reflect points not satisfying x1 + x2 < 0.9 along this line.\n\nB) Use a Dirichlet(1,1,1) distribution to generate (y1, y2, y3), then transform to (x1, x2, x3) using xi = 0.7yi + 0.1.\n\nC) Generate three random numbers between 0.1 and 1, then normalize them to sum to 1.\n\nD) Use rejection sampling: generate (x1, x2, x3) from U(0.1, 1) until a set satisfying x1 + x2 + x3 = 1 is found.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most efficient and accurate method. The Dirichlet(1,1,1) distribution generates points uniformly on the standard 2-simplex (y1 + y2 + y3 = 1, all yi \u2265 0). The transformation xi = 0.7yi + 0.1 then scales and shifts this distribution to meet the given constraints. This method is direct, requires no rejection or reflection steps, and preserves the uniformity of the distribution.\n\nOption A is less efficient as it requires rejecting or reflecting points, which adds computational overhead.\nOption C would not produce a uniform distribution on the constrained simplex.\nOption D is highly inefficient due to the low probability of randomly generating three numbers that sum exactly to 1."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/20", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/381461", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/139272/"], "docs_id": 381461, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have got this result.

If this Creeper becomes charged (powered:1), it indicates that lightning has struck nearby.

It is what it is, and it's usually small.\n\nTo calculate the temperature rise, you need to know many things, **some of which vary.** In particular, the insulation (resistance to heat flow) of the structure, and the external temperature. The thermal mass of the building and contents also come into play, as does air leakage and/or deliberate ventilation; air leakage will generally vary with wind speed and direction outside the house.\n\nThe net effect in practice is that the furnace works longer as it gets colder (and/or windier) outside. If you monitor how much the furnace (burner) runs in an hour, you can infer the rate of heat delivery required to maintain temperature for that hour (If it runs for 30 minutes and is a 60,000 BTU/Hr furnace, the house needed 30,000 BTUs for that hour.) An ideally sized furnace will run 100% of the time on the coldest day you get (and maintain temperature in the house while doing that.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A 2000 sq ft home has a 60,000 BTU/hr furnace.

The information provided tells us that the furnace runs for 45 minutes (3/4 of an hour) every hour to maintain temperature. Since the furnace capacity is 60,000 BTU/hr, we can calculate that it's providing 45,000 BTU/hr (3/4 of 60,000) to maintain the temperature. This implies that the home is losing heat at a rate of approximately 45,000 BTU/hr.\n\nA is incorrect because if the furnace were oversized, it would run for shorter periods to maintain temperature.\n\nC is incorrect because the question doesn't provide information about the thermostat's hysteresis, and most home thermostats don't have user-configurable hysteresis settings.\n\nD, while possible, cannot be definitively inferred from the given information.

Inserting the narrative present into a narrative that is otherwise in past tense has to be handled *very* carefully with good transitions between. Usually, you want something to indicate that you are now going to tell *a story within a story* of sorts. And after you switch to the present tense, you want to stick with it for the entire story. For example:\n\n> I had the strangest experience with my mother the other day. We're walking down the street and she's holding my hand tighter than usual. I don't know why. An expensive car pulls up right next to us, and I look at it. My mother looks at me looking at it and slaps me.\n\nThe first sentence sets the stage for telling the story about your experience. Then the experience itself is related in present tense to give it a sense of immediacy. Some writers would insist that you shouldn't make a tense switch like this one, either, but in my opinion it can sometimes be an effective tool (when used sparingly). You might, especially, see it used to relate dreams within a story, for example.\n\nIn spoken language, however, people mix up tenses all the time, and I can easily imagine someone mixing their tenses in speaking the way you did in your mother story (although not the way you did in your bus one\u2014that one's too extreme even for speech). But it's not necessarily purposeful, it's just a question of mouth moving faster than brain\u2014and possibly of the person telling the story switching in and out of a personal sense of immediacy. For example, the person is possibly living in the memory of the story when saying \"she's been holding my hand tighter than usual\" and then coming back to the true present to reflect on it with \"I didn't know why she did that.\"\n\nThe reason the bus example feels too extreme is simply that it's just too short to support the tense change. There's isn't a separate subnarrative there. It's only two sentences, and each is in a different tense."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In narrative writing, which of the following best describes the appropriate use of tense shifting?\n\nA) Freely alternating between past and present tense throughout a story to create a dynamic narrative flow\n\nB) Switching to present tense for brief moments of action, then immediately returning to past tense\n\nC) Using present tense for the main narrative and past tense for flashbacks or memories\n\nD) Maintaining a consistent tense throughout, with careful transitions to present tense for distinct sub-narratives or story-within-a-story segments\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The documentation emphasizes that good writing generally maintains consistent tense usage. Tense shifts, particularly from past to present, should be handled carefully and used sparingly. When employed, such shifts typically indicate a distinct sub-narrative or story-within-a-story, and should be maintained for the duration of that segment. The text specifically mentions that abrupt or frequent tense changes, as suggested in options A and B, are generally discouraged in written narratives (though they may occur in spoken language). Option C reverses the typical usage, as main narratives are usually in past tense with potential shifts to present for immediacy.

Why is this assumption wrong?\n\n**In other words:** the simplest prototypical examples of integrable billiards (rectangular, circular, elliptical) have some obvious symmetries allowing us to find two independent integrals of motion. What if, in some other billiard, such integrals do also exist, but are not so obvious and have no simple analytical form? How can we distinguish two situations:\n\n1. there exist two independent integrals of motion, so the system is integrable, but their form is very complicated,\n2. the only integral of motion is $E$ and other independent integrals are absent?\n\n*I'm not a specialist in dynamical systems and related complicated mathematics, so any simple explanations will be appreciated. I've found the related questions [Idea of integrable systems](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/97706/) and [Non\\-integrability of the 2D double pendulum](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/142238/) but didn't get any simple answer.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think one must distinguish between chaotic \"Hamiltonian\" systems and chaotic dissipative systems. In the latter, the phase space volume is not conserved, so it is much more difficult to find \"integrals of motion\" because Liouville's theorem is broken. Remember, a quantity \"A\" is an integral of motion if \n\n$\\\\frac{dA}{dt} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial t} \\+ \\\\{A,H\\\\} \\= 0$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian. For dissipative chaotic systems, you can't even write down $H$, so it is difficult to see how one could generally find integrals/constants of motion of the system. \n\nHowever, there is an important class of systems that show up in cosmology for example where you have Hamiltonian \"chaos\", where essentially the trajectories of the system exhibit all of the properties of chaos: sensitive dependence on initial conditions, diverging trajectories over time, but, the system still has attractors: a famous example is the dynamics of a closed anisotropic universe / Bianchi IX, in shameless self\\-promotion here: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311\\.0389\\.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0389.pdf) (in particular, see Page 27\\)\nThis has of course led to wide debates for years in the cosmology community of whether this is \"Really\" chaos, since, in principle, the trajectories are predictable, but, I hope this answers your question.\n\nFurther, with respect to your Billiards problem / the famous Hadamard billiards, as you can see it is the same as the diagram on Page 27\\. Therefore, the billiard problem is also an example of *Hamiltonian* / deterministic / non\\-dissipative chaos. The phase space has an asymptotic attractor. This hopefully demonstrates that integrals of motion such as the one you found above ($E$ is the total energy of the system, and in this case, is the Hamiltonian, $H$) are only really possible if one can write down a Hamiltonian by Liouville's theorem."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of chaotic systems and integrals of motion, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) All chaotic systems, including dissipative ones, can have multiple integrals of motion that are easily identifiable.\n\nB) For Hamiltonian chaotic systems like the stadium billiard, the energy E is always the only possible integral of motion.\n\nC) Hamiltonian chaotic systems can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions while still possessing attractors and conserved quantities.\n\nD) The existence of chaos in a system automatically precludes the possibility of any integrals of motion.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided discusses Hamiltonian chaotic systems, such as the stadium billiard and certain cosmological models, which can exhibit properties of chaos (sensitive dependence on initial conditions, diverging trajectories) while still possessing attractors and conserved quantities like energy. This demonstrates that chaos and the existence of integrals of motion are not mutually exclusive in Hamiltonian systems.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overgeneralizes to all chaotic systems, including dissipative ones, where finding integrals of motion is much more difficult due to the violation of Liouville's theorem.\n\nOption B is too restrictive, as it states that energy is always the only possible integral of motion in Hamiltonian chaotic systems, which is not necessarily true for all such systems.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it wrongly suggests that chaos and integrals of motion are mutually exclusive, which the given information contradicts, especially for Hamiltonian chaotic systems."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/08/08", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/130461", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/42842/"], "docs_id": 130461, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am new with magento and odoo.

The solenoid is actuating at about 3 Hz.\n\nThe relay is good for a few million actuations. And then, it mysteriously stops working. Replacing the relay works, for another few million actuations. I conclude that the problem is not the transistor or the solenoid.\n\nThe nature of the failure is somewhat peculiar. At first, it appears to be a stuck closed failure; the relay will not open when the transistor is not driven. When power is removed from the relay, it then opens. When power is re\\-applied, the relay stays open, until the transistor drives it, at which point it becomes stuck closed again.\n\nI tested one of the \"dead\" relays. The coil exhibits the correct resistance, 250 ohm. The reed switch is also open.\n\nI would have expected this to be a failure where the contacts are welded together, but the fact that a \"dead\" relay is open and that it only sticks after it has first been energized lead me to believe there is something else going on. Does anyone have an explanation for this failure?\n\nEDIT: Addressing some comments\n\nUsing the reed relay because that's what we have already, this is a small one\\-off project. The relay is a Radio Shack relay, SPST 5VDC 20 mA nominal, rated for 500 mA 125 VAC/60VDC. I believe the equivalent relay (OMR\\-106H) can be found on digikey here [http://www.digikey.com/product\\-detail/en/OMR\\-106H,V000/PB886\\-ND/1095211](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/OMR-106H,V000/PB886-ND/1095211). The DC power supply for the solenoid (12V) shows about 400 mA peak current. The datasheet lists 5 million \"operations\" at 24V 400 mA. Two relays have now died around 3 million at 12V.\n\nThe diode is across the coil, not the switch.

The documentation indicates that relays have a finite life expectancy, typically measured in number of operations. The failure mode described is consistent with contact wear, which is a normal end-of-life condition for relays. The graph in the documentation shows that even for a generic relay, the maximum life expectancy is around 1.5 million operations at low loads. The question states the relay is failing at about 3 million actuations, which is well within the expected lifespan for a typical relay operating at 3 Hz.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that replacing the relay temporarily solves the problem, indicating the transistor is not the issue.\n\nAnswer B is unlikely because a faulty flyback diode would typically cause issues with the driving transistor, not the relay contacts themselves.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because welded contacts would remain closed even when power is removed, which contradicts the described behavior."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/08/24", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/575314", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/190315/"], "docs_id": 575314, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If technology allowed it one day, would it be possible to physically photograph how quarks are arranged inside a nucleus?  \n\nWhat would you see?\n\nFor example, would it be possible to distinguish a neutron from a proton by taking an image inside the nucleus?

Direct imaging of quarks inside a nucleus is not possible with current technology. Instead, scientists use high-energy particle collisions to study subatomic structures. These collisions cause the particles to fragment, creating debris. By analyzing this debris and performing complex calculations, researchers can infer the original arrangement of quarks. The current model suggests that quarks form a stable triangular shape within protons and neutrons, held together by a cloud of virtual gluons. The distinction between protons and neutrons is also made through calculations based on the charge and parity of the collision debris, rather than through direct observation."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/01/04", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/328781", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/81147/"], "docs_id": 328781, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to show all the on sale product on one page.\nCan any one help me with the code to get the products collection which are on Sale i.e which has special price assigned in magento 2\n\nThis is my block code\n\n```\n<?php\n\n namespace Vidushi\\Contact\\Block;\n\n use Zend_Db_Expr;\n\n class OnSaleProduct extends AbstractSlider\n   {\n     /**\n       * @inheritdoc\n    */\n  public function getProductCollection()\n  {\n      $visibleProducts = $this->_catalogProductVisibility- \n     >getVisibleInCatalogIds();\n    $collection = $this->_productCollectionFactory->create()- \n>setVisibility($visibleProducts);\n    $collection = $this->_addProductAttributesAndPrices($collection)\n        ->addAttributeToFilter(\n            'special_from_date',\n            ['date' => true, 'to' => $this->getEndOfDayDate()],\n            'left'\n        )->addAttributeToFilter(\n            'special_to_date',\n            ['or' => [0 => ['date' => true,\n                                               'from' => $this- \n  >getStartOfDayDate()],\n                                         1 => ['is' => new Zend_Db_Expr(\n                                             'null'\n                                         )],]],\n            'left'\n        )->addAttributeToSort(\n            'news_from_date',\n            'desc'\n        );\n    return $collection;\n}\n\n}\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Just follow:\n\n[https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/setup/first\\-time\\-setup\\-import\\-import.html](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/setup/first-time-setup-import-import.html)\n\nAnd,\n\nFor PHP:\nAnd increase default\\_socket\\_timeout in your php.ini\n\nFor MariaDB ( so probably you have to change this one only)\n\n```\nSELECT @@wait_timeout;\n\nSET GLOBAL wait_timeout=600;\n\nSELECT @@max_allowed_packet;\n\nSET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=107374182\n\n```\n\nThen restart the server and try importing again.

Specifically, increasing the wait_timeout and max_allowed_packet values in MariaDB can help prevent timeout issues during large data imports. The documentation suggests executing the following SQL commands:\n\nSET GLOBAL wait_timeout=600;\nSET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=107374182\n\nAfter making these changes, restarting the server is recommended to ensure the new settings take effect. This approach directly addresses the database-level timeout issues that can occur during large imports in Magento 2.\n\nWhile the other options might seem plausible, they don't directly address the specific solution provided in the documentation.

What about \n\n1. definable subsets of $\\\\mathbb N$ in the language of Skolem arithmetic and\n2. would it be sensible to seek programming constructs that with 'decidable portions of Skolem' leads to (if I am not wrong then atomic formulae here might be of form $a\\\\prod\\_{i\\=1}^nx\\_i^{b\\_i}\\\\leq b$ or $a\\\\prod\\_{i\\=1}^nx\\_i^{b\\_i}\\=b$)?\n\nMy background is not logic and not sure if I make sense however if there is reasonable way to salvage the post it will be nice. I am trying to see if fixed dimension linear integer programming that runs in polynomial time has an analogy in Skolem arithmetic where variable addition is disallowed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: $\\\\def\\\\mr{\\\\mathrm}$As it happens, quantifier elimination for Skolem arithmetic came up recently in my research. The concise description is that every formula $\\\\phi(x\\_1,\\\\dots,x\\_k)$ is in $(\\\\mathbb N^{\\>0},{\\\\cdot})$ equivalent to a Boolean combination of formulas expressing\n$$\\\\tag1\\\\bigl\\|\\\\{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb P:\\\\psi(v\\_p(x\\_1\\),\\\\dots,v\\_p(x\\_k))\\\\}\\\\bigr\\|\\\\ge n,$$\nwhere $\\\\psi(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k)$ is a formula of Presburger arithmetic, and $n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N$.\n\nIn the special case of formulas in one variable with parameters that you are interested in, this boils down to the following: definable subsets are Boolean combinations of sets defined by\n\n* $v\\_q(x)\\=n$,\n* $v\\_q(x)\\\\equiv a\\\\pmod m$,\n* $\\\\bigl\\|\\\\{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb P:v\\_p(x)\\=n\\\\}\\\\bigr\\|\\\\ge b$,\n* $\\\\bigl\\|\\\\{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb P:v\\_p(x)\\\\ge n,v\\_p(x)\\\\equiv a\\\\pmod m\\\\}\\\\bigr\\|\\\\ge b$,\n\nfor some $q\\\\in\\\\mathbb P$, $n,b\\\\in\\\\omega$, $0\\\\le a\\<m\\<\\\\omega$.\n\nThat all definable relations in $(\\\\mathbb N^{\\>0},{\\\\cdot})$ are equivalent to Boolean combinations of (1\\) follows from the results of Mostowski \\[1]. I will sketch how to prove the other direction, that all sets of the form (1\\) are first\\-order definable.\n\nUsing $\\\\cdot$, we can define the divisibility, coprimeness, and primality predicates as\n$$\\\\begin{align\\*}\nx\\\\mid y\\&\\\\iff\\\\exists z\\\\,(y\\=x\\\\cdot z),\\\\\\\\\nx\\\\perp y\\&\\\\iff\\\\forall z\\\\,(z\\\\mid x\\\\land z\\\\mid y\\\\to z\\=1\\),\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mr{Prime}(x)\\&\\\\iff x\\\\ne1\\\\land\\\\forall z\\\\,(z\\\\mid x\\\\to z\\=1\\\\lor z\\=x).\n\\\\end{align\\*}$$\nThen, we can define the set of powers of a prime by\n$$\\\\mr{Power}(p,x)\\\\iff\\\\mr{Prime}(p)\\\\land\\\\forall z\\\\,(z\\\\perp p\\\\to z\\\\perp x).$$\nFinally, we can define for a given $x$ and a prime $p$ the power of $p$ that appears in the factorization of $x$ by\n$$\\\\mr{Val}(p,x,y)\\\\iff\\\\mr{Power}(p,y)\\\\land\\\\exists z\\\\,(x\\=y\\\\cdot z\\\\land z\\\\perp p).$$\nNow, for each prime $p$, $(\\\\{x:\\\\mr{Power}(p,x)\\\\},{\\\\cdot})$ is a model of Presburger arithmetic (which I assume to be formulated in a language with just a single binary function symbol $\\+$). Thus, if $\\\\psi(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k)$ is a formula of Presburger arithmetic, let $\\\\psi^p(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k)$ (with an extra free variable $p$) denote the formula of Skolem arithmetic obtained by replacing all occurrences of $\\+$ with $\\\\cdot$, and relativizing all quantifiers to $\\\\{x:\\\\mr{Power}(p,x)\\\\}$. Then (1\\) is defined by the formula\n$$\\\\exists^{\\\\ge n}p\\\\,(\\\\mr{Prime}(p)\\\\land\\\\exists y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k\\\\,(\\\\mr{Val}(p,x\\_1,y\\_1\\)\\\\land\\\\dots\\\\land\\\\mr{Val}(p,x\\_k,y\\_k)\\\\land\\\\psi^p(y\\_1,\\\\dots,y\\_k))).$$\n\nEDIT: I defined $\\\\psi^p$ for formulas written in the language with $\\+$ only to keep the definition succinct, but in practice, it is more convenient to define it directly for a richer language: specifically, we may translate the constants $0$ and $1$ to $1$ and $p$, respectively, and $x\\\\le y$ to $x\\\\mid y$.\n\nTo put it differently, any Presburger formula $\\\\psi(\\\\vec y)$ is equivalent to a Boolean combination of integer inequalities $n\\+\\\\sum\\_{i\\<k}n\\_iy\\_i\\\\le m\\+\\\\sum\\_{i\\<k}m\\_iy\\_i$, and congruences $y\\_i\\\\equiv a\\\\pmod m$. We may translate the former to $p^n\\\\prod\\_{i\\<k}y\\_i^{n\\_i}\\\\mid p^m\\\\prod\\_{i\\<k}y\\_i^{m\\_i}$, and the latter to $\\\\exists z\\\\,(y\\_i\\=p^az^m)$.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n\\[1] Andrzej Mostowski, *On direct products of theories*, Journal of Symbolic Logic 17 (1952\\), no. 1, pp. 1\u201331\\."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes definable subsets of \u2115 in the language of Skolem arithmetic?\n\nA) They are exactly the eventually periodic sets, similar to Presburger arithmetic.\n\nB) They are Boolean combinations of sets defined by conditions on prime factorizations and their frequencies.\n\nC) They are defined solely by linear inequalities of the form a\u220f(i=1 to n)x_i^(b_i) \u2264 b.\n\nD) They are equivalent to mixed integer linear programming problems.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, definable subsets in Skolem arithmetic are Boolean combinations of sets defined by conditions on prime factorizations (such as v_q(x) = n or v_q(x) \u2261 a (mod m)) and the frequency of primes satisfying certain conditions (like |{p \u2208 \u2119 : v_p(x) = n}| \u2265 b). \n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes Presburger arithmetic, not Skolem arithmetic. Option C is too restrictive and doesn't capture the full complexity of definable subsets in Skolem arithmetic. Option D is incorrect as it relates to integer programming, which is more closely associated with Presburger arithmetic rather than Skolem arithmetic.\n\nThe key distinction of Skolem arithmetic is its focus on multiplication and prime factorizations, rather than addition as in Presburger arithmetic. This leads to a different characterization of definable subsets, involving prime valuations and their frequencies."}}
