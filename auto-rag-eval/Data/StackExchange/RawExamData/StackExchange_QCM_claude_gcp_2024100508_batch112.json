I am a big fan of the open\\-source concept \\- especially in research, where transparency and reproducibility is already a big part of the culture. I gladly contribute as much as I can to the community, and releasing my code for anyone to use is part of that.\n\nHowever, in research there is always a certain measure of uncertainty about what the stuff you produce will be used for. I fully understand that I can't copyright any results or conclusions \\- but I can protect how others use my code, and I would like to make sure that there is no (legal) way to incorporate software I produce in military applications.\n\nI've read through a few of the shorter ones of the common OSS licenses, and summaries of some more, but they all seem to focus solely on the questions \"do you earn money on my code?\" and \"do you make my code available with your program?\" \\- nothing about what the program actually does with the code.\n\nAre there any good open\\-source licenses that explicitly prohibit all kinds of military applications?\n\n### Update:\n\nAfter reading up some more on how OSS works, I've realized that a license that meets my needs by definition will not be open\\-source, since open\\-source licenses cannot discriminate against fields. Thus, I'm rather looking for a license that is *like* an open\\-source license, except that it prohibits military use. I want this license to be already existing, authored or at least reviewed by someone who actually knows licensing, since I don't.\n\nAlso, in response to a couple of remarks that this will be difficult to enforce: yes, I realize that. But this is more for myself than for the legal implications; if I use a license like this, and a military organization uses my code anyway, they are breaking the law and they are doing it despite my explicit instructions not to. Thus, the potentially gruesome things that they do with applications that include software I've written are no longer \"on my conciousness\", since they stole the software from me. (And somewhere I have a na\u00efve hope that if they need something I've done, and my license prohibits them from using it legally, they'll get someone elses program that does the same thing and allows them to use it. Not that governments always do, but they always *should* abide by the law...)\n\nIt's a moral safeguard, so to speak, rather than something I actually expect to bring up in court (if my mediocre code is ever used by CIA...)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How would one enforce such a license?\n\nWould you prohibit *any* military use? If the software checks air pressure in tires, and someone decides to use it on a military Hummer, is that a prohibited use? Can people in the military industrial complex use it to plan their monthly picnic?\n\nWould it be an acceptable use if the software improved ballistic missile trajectories, and the improved accuracy of the weapon prevented civilians from being killed? Or would any use in a weapon be prohibited?\n\nThese are the kinds of questions you have to ask yourself, if you want to make a software license that satisfies your sensibilities.\n\nNevertheless, I'd try an keep it simple. [Yahoo's Terms of Use](http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/desktopsearch/desktopsearch-300.html) state that their software must not be used \n\n> *\"to operate nuclear facilities, life support or other mission critical applications where human life or property may be at stake.\"*\n\nThat's probably as good a clause as any, if you add the word \"weapons\" to the prohibited list of uses."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher wants to release their code as open-source but prohibit its use in military applications.

However, the researcher could potentially create or use a custom license that is similar to open-source licenses but includes a specific clause prohibiting military use. This would not be considered a true open-source license, but it could achieve the researcher's goals. Options A and B are incorrect because standard open-source licenses cannot include such restrictions. Option D is incorrect because enforcing such restrictions is complex and not common in software licensing, as evidenced by the difficulties in defining and enforcing \"military use\" discussed in the documentation."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/11", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/143887", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/51683/"], "docs_id": 143887, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I intend to make a web application that displays 3d environments that can be navigated by dragging(with a finger or mouse depending on the platform).

Can Google maps create custom 3d maps?*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As Raynos has mentioned, [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) is one way to provide 3D functionality in a browser. The downsides seem to be that there's very little to no IE support, and I've also heard of people having difficulties with different implementations across browsers. I also am not sure if WebGL would \"provide speed in development\", but I guess that depends on how familiar you are with 3D concepts and OpenGL.\n\nI found [this article at Opera's dev site](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/an-introduction-to-webgl/) to be one of the better introductions to WebGL, although it might be a bit outdated by now.\n\nAnother alternative might be [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/), which has a web player supported on the major desktop OSes and browsers (edit: Linux excluded, AFAIK), but needs to be installed as a plugin. This would prohibit its use as the technology on public\\-facing sites, since you would lose most of your users right there. Also, I don't think they have support for the smart phone browsers, but the do have iOS and Android native app export facilities (so, you code once, and compile for the different platforms). If your users are going to be primarily paying customers, I think there's a chance they would be willing to install the web player or native apps, but you'll have to make that call. You can't get a much more rapid 3D development environment however, Unity 3D is an extremely slick game engine with many things done for you, out of the box."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to develop a cross-platform 3D web application for visualizing construction sites, including terrain contours and underground utilities.

It provides native 3D rendering capabilities in web browsers without plugins, works across most modern desktop and mobile browsers, and offers the power needed for rendering 3D environments. While it may have some implementation differences across browsers, it provides the best balance of compatibility, performance, and development potential for a web-based 3D application.\n\nC) Unity 3D, while powerful for 3D development, requires a plugin for web browsers. This would significantly limit adoption for a public-facing web application. Additionally, it doesn't natively support mobile web browsers, which is a key requirement for the project.\n\nD) HTML5 Canvas, while versatile, is primarily a 2D rendering technology. While it's possible to implement basic 3D rendering with Canvas, it would be much more complex and less performant than using WebGL for a full 3D environment."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/05/10", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/96532", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/23588/"], "docs_id": 96532, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The trace theorem says that the restriction of a $W^{1,p}(\\\\Omega)$ function $u$, $Tu$ belongs to $W^{1\\-1/p,p}(\\\\partial\\\\Omega)$ if $\\\\Omega$ satisfies some smooth condition, for example, $\\\\Omega$ is convex. \nNow my question is the inverse of the Trace Theorem.

According to the research by Marschall (1987) mentioned in the documentation, for a Lipschitz domain \u03a9, the trace operator from W^(s,p)(\u03a9) to a Besov space on the boundary \u2202\u03a9 has a bounded linear right inverse when s - 1/p is not an integer.

Option C is wrong because when the extension operator exists, it does have a bounded norm.

I like the job for many reasons:\n\n* I do interesting work on a cool product\n* I solve challenging problems and use a lot of high\\-level skills (quantitative, creative, writing, presenting)\n* It pays well\n\nThe problem is that I feel I need a more relaxed atmosphere (shorter hours, less performance pressure, and more flexibility), in order to free up time for other pursuits and reduce stress. The ideal would be a job that's around 30\\-35 hours a week, where there is flexibility to work more or less in a given week. **Can anyone suggest where to look for a job like this, where I wouldn't have to sacrifice too much on the above points?** (Obviously I would have to sacrifice pay.) My employer does not generally offer part\\-time employment.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of is when I did summer internships at my university's CS department. The work was very intellectually challenging, but if I needed to go home a couple hours early or get flexibility on a due date, nobody batted an eyelash. However, I'd like to find out if there are alternatives to academia since from what I've seen the pay there is a gigantic drop from what I'm currently making.\n\nI've done freelance development before, but I do like that as an employee of a large company I have a lot of things taken care of for me (e.g. benefits and guaranteed stable employment).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm doing 30hrs/week jobs for more than a decade now. In my experience you will not find a niche in the industry where part\\-time jobs are waiting for you to grab one. Instead, you will have to carve such a job out of the common job market. That's not easy, because many only bargain for money when they interview, so companies are not used to employers wanting to work less, but it's not impossible.\n\nI have found the following important when looking for a part\\-time job:\n\n* ***Be good at what you do.*** When you are good, they will want you, and are prepared to pay for it. Some candidates will want more money, some will want more holidays, a few will want fewer working hours.\n* In an interview, explicitly ***ask about a company's overtime policy***. Is overtime something normal at the shop, that's done by everyone regularly? Unpaid? If so, you will be unlikely to really be working less than 40hrs, no matter what contract you sign.\n* If you have the feeling they might be hard to convince to let you work 30hrs, ***start out offering less*** (20hrs?) and then let yourself be \"persuaded\" to work 30hrs. `:)` I did this with my first part\\-time job.\n* ***Don't expect too much pay*** or other benefits when you first do this. Under these conditions you are closer to a junior job than you used to be. Once you can show excellent references for two or three such jobs over the last decade it will be easier to convince employers that your special needs are worth the hassle.\n\nOnce you have such a job, be sure to follow these rules:\n\n* I usually explain upfront, right in the interview, that ***I am never working for free***. I clock every hour I work for the company, and certainly clock overtimes I put in, and I expect to take leave the same amount of hours for compensation. (I have, twice over more than a decade, accepted money instead. But that was me accepting it, rather than them pressing me to do it.)\n* ***Do not let them press you*** into doing more hours without compensation. You might have relinquished other benefits (like money) for doing 30hrs/week. There is no point in relinquishing what you got for that. (The others wouldn't give up that money even if pressed hard, right?)\n* Remind everyone that you only have 75% of the time others have. Make sure that your team leader, when ***planning resources***, remembers that. If they have never worked with such an employee, then this will need constant reminding in the beginning.\n* We all know that in this industry crunch time is a common phenomena. When others work overtime, you might have to do that, too. However, be sure to make it absolutely clear that ***for you, 40hrs/week already is overtime***."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer working at a major tech company wants to transition to a part-time role of 30-35 hours per week while maintaining challenging work and reasonable compensation.

Does it mean then this OS cannot be configured by sudoers forever? Is there any method to set new administrator?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What Would Happen\n=================\n\nIf you configure your system so that no users are administrators, then no one will be able to perform administrative tasks as `root` with [`sudo`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/sudo.8.html) (or its graphical frontends, such as [`gksu`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/gksu.1.html), [`gksudo`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/gksudo.1.html), and [`kdesudo`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/kdesudo.1.html)) or [PolicyKit](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/polkit.8.html). Assuming the `root` account remains disabled, you will not be able to log in as `root` (even from a virtual console) or [`su`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/su.1.html)\\-to\\-`root` either. Barring possible security vulnerabilities, **this would prevent anyone from performing administrative tasks in the running system.**\n\nFixing the Problem\n==================\n\nHowever, if you did this, **the problem would still be easily fixed**, assuming you have physical access to the machine. Fixing this problem is similar to resetting a forgotten password, except you add the user to the `sudo` and/or `admin` groups with [`usermod`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/usermod.8.html), rather than resetting their password with [`passwd`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man5/passwd.5.html).\n\nHere's one method:\n\n1. Boot into recovery mode by holding `Shift` while booting and selecting it. Select the option for a `root` shell. You'll get a shell with a `#` prompt (rather than the usual `$`). This means it's a `root` shell. Any command you run here is run as `root`.\n2. *If you know your username, skip this step.* To find out your username, run `ls /home`. This is a pretty reliable way to list the usernames of the human users of your system (while omitting user accounts like `www-data` and `nobody` which are used internally but don't represent real people).\n3. Run these commands to add **`username`** to the necessary group(s) to be an administrator. (Replace **`username`** with the actual username.)\n\n```\nusermod -a -G sudo username\nusermod -a -G admin username\n```\n\nThis separately attempts to add the user to the `sudo` and `admin` groups. In Ubuntu releases up to Ubuntu 11\\.10, administrators were in the `admin` group. In Ubuntu 12\\.04 (and in future releases), administrators are in the `sudo` group; if a 12\\.04 system was upgraded from a previous release, both groups will exist.\n\nSo you can put the user in just one, if you know which one, or you can just run those two commands and put them in whichever exists. I advise doing this with two commands so that if one group doesn't exist, the error doesn't stop `usermod` from attempting to add the user to the other group.\n\nRecovery mode is usually accessible. But occasionally it may be broken, disabled, or require a password, in which case you can boot from a live CD, `chroot` into the installed system, and run the `usermod` commands. Here's a procedure for doing that, adapted from [my considerably more general answer here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/121698/how-do-i-reset-a-lost-password-using-recovery-mode-requires-me-to-type-the-pass/147023#147023):\n\n1. If you don't already have one, burn an Ubuntu live CD/DVD (on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/burn-a-cd-on-ubuntu), [Windows](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/burn-a-cd-on-windows), or [Mac OS X](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/burn-a-cd-on-mac-osx)) or write an Ubuntu live USB flash drive (on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu), [Windows](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows), or [Mac OS X](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx)).\n2. In your Ubuntu system (not the live CD/DVD/USB system), run the following command in the Terminal (`Ctrl`\\+`Alt`\\+`T`). *You do not need to be an administrator to do this.*\n\n```\nmount | grep ' on / '\n\n```\n\nYou should include the spaces before `on` and after `/`.\n3. That command produces something like `/dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro,commit=0)` as the output. The text before `on` (not including the space) is the device name of the partition that contains your Ubuntu system's root filesystem. Remember it (or write it down).\n4. Boot the computer from the live CD/DVD/USB and select `Try Ubuntu without installing` (not `Install Ubuntu`).\n5. Run these commands, replacing **`/dev/sda1`** with the device name of the partition containing your Ubuntu system's root filesystem, if different (and **`username`** with the name of the user account you wish to give administrative abilities).\n\n```\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo chroot /mnt\nusermod -a -G sudo username\nusermod -a -G admin username\nexit\nsudo umount /mnt\n```\n\nAs with the other method, you can use `ls /home` (run this *after* the `chroot` command) to see a list of users on the machine, if you don't know the username.\n\nAlternatives to Eliminating Administrators\n==========================================\n\nOn Ubuntu, when you're an administrator, you still need to authenticate with `sudo` or PolicyKit to perform actions as `root`. This is considered to be at least as secure as using `su` to perform actions as root, since anyone who can compromise your account in such a way to read your own password (for `sudo`) can also read `root`'s password (for `su`). Furthermore, there are some substantial advantages ([explained here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo)) of `sudo` over `su`, and enabling the `root` account, while quite possible, is neither recommended nor officially supported in Ubuntu.\n\nIf you decide that even though `sudo` and PolicyKit require your password to perform actions as `root`, you still want yourself and all other human users on your machine to run as a standard user (and not as an administrator who can run commands as `root`), you have two easy options:\n\n1. You can **enable the `root` account**, but this is discouraged as explained above. Also, by default you will not be able to log in to a *graphical session* as `root`, and you *should not configure your system to allow this*, as it's particularly dangerous to run an entire graphical desktop environment as `root` (a security bug in any part of it could compromise your system). Also, most GUI programs are not tested as `root` so there may be substantial usability bugs. If you do enable `root`, you should only ever log on as root from a virtual console (or use `su`).\n2. The better option is to **just create another user account for administrative purposes.** Make this account an administrator. Having a non\\-`root` account that can perform administrative tasks with `sudo` and PolicyKit does not force you to use that account for day\\-to\\-day, non\\-administrative tasks.\n\nHowever, most users are best off with the default\\-\\-where at least one user account is an administrator and can perform administrative tasks, but must (re)enter their password to do so."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator accidentally removed all users from the sudo and admin groups on an Ubuntu system without setting a root password.

The points in question are the mutual intersections of *three* spheres: a sphere centered beneath location x1 (on the earth's surface) of a given radius, a sphere centered beneath location x2 (on the earth's surface) of a given radius, and the earth itself, which is a sphere centered at O \\= (0,0,0\\) of a given radius.\n2. The intersection of each of the first two spheres with the earth's surface is a circle, which defines two planes. The mutual intersections of all three spheres therefore lies on the intersection of those two planes: a *line*.\n\nConsequently, the problem is reduced to intersecting a line with a sphere, which is easy.\n\n---\n\nHere are the details. The inputs are points P1 \\= (lat1, lon1\\) and P2 \\= (lat2, lon2\\) on the earth's surface, considered as a sphere, and two corresponding radii r1 and r2\\.\n\n1. Convert (lat, lon) to (x,y,z) geocentric coordinates. As usual, because we may choose units of measurement in which the earth has a unit radius,\n\n```\nx = cos(lon) cos(lat)\ny = sin(lon) cos(lat)\nz = sin(lat).\n\n```\n\nIn the example, P1 \\= (\\-90\\.234036 Degree, 37\\.673442 Degree) has geocentric coordinates x1 \\= (\\-0\\.00323306, \\-0\\.7915, 0\\.61116\\) and P2 \\= (\\-90\\.953669 Degree, 36\\.109997 Degree) has geocentric coordinates x2 \\= (\\-0\\.0134464, \\-0\\.807775, 0\\.589337\\).\n2. Convert the radii r1 and r2 (which are measured along the sphere) to angles along the sphere. By definition, one nautical mile (NM) is 1/60 degree of arc (which is pi/180 \\* 1/60 \\= 0\\.0002908888 radians). Therefore, as angles,\n\n```\nr1 = 107.5 / 60 Degree = 0.0312705 radian\nr2 = 145 / 60 Degree = 0.0421788 radian\n\n```\n3. The *geodesic* circle of radius r1 around x1 is the intersection of the earth's surface with a *Euclidean* sphere of radius sin(r1\\) centered at cos(r1\\)\\*x1\\.\n4. The plane determined by the intersection of the sphere of radius sin(r1\\) around cos(r1\\)\\*x1 and the earth's surface is perpendicular to x1 and passes through the point cos(r1\\)*x1, whence its equation is x.x1 \\= cos(r1\\) (the \".\" represents the [usual dot product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Algebraic_definition)); likewise for the other plane. There will be a unique point x0 on the intersection of those two planes that is a linear combination of x1 and x2\\. Writing x0 \\= a*x1 \\+ b\\*x2 the two planar equations are\n\n```\ncos(r1) = x.x1 = (a*x1 + b*x2).x1 = a + b*(x2.x1)\ncos(r2) = x.x2 = (a*x1 + b*x2).x2 = a*(x1.x2) + b\n\n```\n\nUsing the fact that x2\\.x1 \\= x1\\.x2, which I shall write as q, the solution (if it exists) is given by\n\n```\na = (cos(r1) - cos(r2)*q) / (1 - q^2),\nb = (cos(r2) - cos(r1)*q) / (1 - q^2).\n\n```\n\nIn the running example, I compute a \\= 0\\.973503 and b \\= 0\\.0260194\\.\n\nEvidently we need q^2 !\\= 1\\. This means that x1 and x2 can be neither the same point nor antipodal points.\n5. Now all other points on the line of intersection of the two planes differ from x0 by some multiple of a vector n which is mutually perpendicular to both planes. The cross product\n\n```\nn = x1~Cross~x2\n\n```\n\ndoes the job provided n is nonzero: once again, this means that x1 and x2 are neither coincident nor diametrically opposite. (We need to take care to compute the cross product with high precision, because it involves subtractions with a lot of cancellation when x1 and x2 are close to each other.) In the example, n \\= (0\\.0272194, \\-0\\.00631254, \\-0\\.00803124\\).\n6. Therefore, we seek up to two points of the form x0 \\+ t\\*n which lie on the earth's surface: that is, their length equals 1\\. Equivalently, their *squared* length is 1:\n\n```\n1 = squared length = (x0 + t*n).(x0 + t*n) = x0.x0 + 2t*x0.n + t^2*n.n = x0.x0 + t^2*n.n\n\n```\n\nThe term with x0\\.n disappears because x0 (being a linear combination of x1 and x2\\) is perpendicular to n. The two solutions easily are\n\n```\nt = sqrt((1 - x0.x0)/n.n)\n\n```\n\nand its negative. Once again high precision is called for, because when x1 and x2 are close, x0\\.x0 is *very* close to 1, leading to some loss of floating point precision. In the example, t \\= 1\\.07509 or t \\= \\-1\\.07509\\. The two points of intersection therefore equal\n\n```\nx0 + t*n = (0.0257661, -0.798332, 0.601666)\nx0 - t*n = (-0.0327606, -0.784759, 0.618935)\n\n```\n7. Finally, we may convert these solutions back to (lat, lon) by converting geocentric (x,y,z) to geographic coordinates:\n\n```\nlon = ArcTan(x,y)\nlat = ArcTan(Sqrt[x^2+y^2], z)\n\n```\n\nFor the longitude, use the generalized arctangent returning values in the range \\-180 to 180 degrees (in computing applications, this function takes *both* x and y as arguments rather than just the ratio y/x; it is sometimes called \"ATan2\").\n\nI obtain the two solutions (\\-88\\.151426, 36\\.989311\\) and (\\-92\\.390485, 38\\.238380\\), shown in the figure as yellow dots.\n\n![3D figure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/C13dY.png)\n\nThe axes display the geocentric (x,y,z) coordinates. The gray patch is the portion of the earth's surface from \\-95 to \\-87 degrees longitude, 33 to 40 degrees latitude (marked off with a one degree graticule). The earth's surface has been made partly transparent to show all three spheres.

That's what was causing your initial problem.\n\nSecondly the file upload input returns a data frame with a `datapath` column which is where the file has been dropped. So in your code you would have been trying to read from `input$layer` which is a dataframe of upload data rather than `input$layer$datapath` which is the column with the file name you want.\n\nThirdly it is hard to make shapefiles work with shiny uploads. Shapefiles must have a `.shp` and a `.shx` component for `readOGR` to work, and possibly a `.dbf` and `.prj` component too. You can upload several files in a shiny upload widget (is that why you have `multiple=T`?) but the server renames them so that the data frame of `input$shape` contains the names `0.shp`, `1.shx`, `2.dbf` and so on. It might be possibly to rename these back together, but most shapefile upload solutions require users to upload a ZIP file of everything which is then extracted by the server.\n\nMy solution above, and in order to show how the reactive stuff works which was your first problem, is to load a GML file instead of a shapefile. In my test code I did `writeOGR(pts, \"pts.gml\",\"pts\", driver=\"GML\")` just to get something I could upload to shiny and plot over a raster."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Shiny app, when uploading and plotting a raster file and a vector file, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The file input for shapefiles should always use multiple=TRUE to allow uploading all necessary files (.shp, .shx, .dbf, etc.)\n\nB) The server function should directly read the uploaded files without using reactive expressions\n\nC) The file path for uploaded files can be accessed using input$filename instead of input$filename$datapath\n\nD) Reactive expressions or renderers should wrap all data processing and plotting code in the server function\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) While shapefiles consist of multiple files, using multiple=TRUE in fileInput doesn't solve the issue of file renaming in Shiny uploads.

It is probably called **Input Leakage Current I/O pin** and will be near **1\u03bcA**.\n\n[Here is a typical ATmega datasheet used on Uno / Duemilanove / ...](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-8271-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega48A-48PA-88A-88PA-168A-168PA-328-328P_datasheet.pdf) , you can find the parameter on page 304\\. Check [the datasheet for your specific controller](http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/avr/megaAVR.aspx) for accurate details.\n\nIf you use a 3\\.7V battery and a step up converter to supply 5V to the controller, you can connect the battery directly to your controller analog input. However when the output voltage of the step up converter drops below the voltage of the battery (for whatever reason) then your entire Arduino will be fed through the analog input pin and that is what you *don't* want. All input pins have protection against overvoltage which enables this behaviour, but the diodes are not rated for continuous currents. In conclusion: it is best to include a series resistor between battery and input pin.\n\nBut now your measurement relies on the accuracy of the 5V power supply. Depending on which exact controller you have, there are various [internal reference voltages](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogReference) available which are far more accurate than the power supply voltage. If you add an extra resistor to ground (R2\\) you can use such a reference to accurately measure the input voltage. This is called a (resistive) voltage divider.

It uses a voltage divider to reduce the input voltage to a safe level for the Arduino's ADC.\n2. The resistor values (10k\u03a9 and 3.9k\u03a9) create a ratio that scales 3.7V to approximately 1V, which is suitable for measurement with internal reference voltages.\n3. Using an internal reference voltage for ADC measurements provides more accurate readings than relying on the 5V power supply voltage, which may fluctuate.\n4. The series resistor (R1) protects the Arduino's input pin from excessive current in case the step-up module's output drops below the battery voltage.\n\nOption A is unsafe as it doesn't protect against potential reverse current flow.

Nearly every pair of outlets has one of the outlets connected to a light switch. Sometimes that switch is quite far from the outlet even when there are other closer switches that seem to control nothing at all. Sometimes that switch also controls overhead lighting, which makes no sense to me from a design standpoint. Sometimes that switch is a dimmer switch, which is a really horrible idea as if you plug anything other than a light bulb into it, like some electronics, the dimmer switch could do them a lot of damage. One such dimmer switch is also connected to a ceiling fan, and setting the switch to anything less than full does not change the speed of the fan, it just makes it a lot noisier (AC induction motor, obviously).\n\nThere are light fixtures that don't seem to have any power to them and aren't controlled by any switch, though I could believe the switch might just be hiding somewhere. There are also switches that seem to control absolutely nothing, though I could believe I just haven't found what they're connected to.\n\nThe oddest thing I have found though has to do with the circuit breakers around overhead lighting. I have a chandelier in my dining room that is connected to a dimmer switch. When I moved in, all of the bulbs were incandescents, and I wanted to be more energy efficient, so I replaced them all with dimmable LED bulbs. Now however, I could not turn the chandelier fully off, with the dimmer switch all the way down, the lights still dimly shone. This had never been an issue before, but I thought it probably meant the dimmer switch was faulty, and it was just the different voltage response curves of the incandescents versus the LEDs that meant it had never been noticed before, so I set out to replace the switch.\n\nNow there are two circuit breakers that are relevant to this chandelier. One is labeled \"dining room,\" the other is labeled \"lights.\" As far as I can tell, the dining room breaker controls all of the outlets in the dining room area, while the lights breaker controls all of the overhead lighting in the house.\n\nHere's where the odd part comes in. If I turn off the dining room breaker, the lights stay lit. I have turn off the lights breaker to switch off the lights. However, if I only turn off the lights breaker, and go into the switch panel with my voltmeter, I am still detecting 100V AC across the switch (with it off), even though the lights stay off when I turn the switch on.

It might even go away if you were to attach an analog voltmeter (which is more of a load because current from the line to move the needle) instead of a digital one (which typically has a 1 M\u03a9 input impedance that presents almost no load)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is troubleshooting a home's wiring system and encounters a situation where 100V AC is detected across a light switch even when the corresponding circuit breaker is off.

The phenomenon described is likely due to inductive and capacitive coupling between parallel wire runs in the home's electrical system. This can occur in houses with unusual wiring configurations, especially where there are long runs between outlets and switches. When wires run parallel to each other for significant distances, electromagnetic coupling can induce a voltage in a disconnected wire from a nearby powered wire. This induced voltage typically has no significant current capacity and would disappear if a load were connected. The other options are less likely explanations: A) A faulty breaker would typically still allow full voltage and current; B) A secondary power source would provide full voltage and current, not just a phantom voltage; D) While possible, a malfunctioning voltmeter is less likely than the coupling phenomenon in this scenario."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/04/23", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/245297", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/5652/"], "docs_id": 245297, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As **judo** and **karate** both originate in Japan, probably one way to refer those athletes who practice these martial arts would be using the Japanese expressions as follows:\n\n> * **\"karateka\"** (\u7a7a\u624b\u5bb6?) \\[karate practitioner]\n> * **\"judoka\"** (\u67d4\u9053\u5bb6) \\[Judo practitioner]\n\nBut I'm quite confident most native speakers have not even heard those terms once!\n\nI know more people who do karate / judo are called:\n\n> * \"**karate / judo practitioners**\"   \n> \n>  or\n> * \"**somebody does karate / judo**,\" \\[which is a description rather than a name like: \"wrestler: who practices wrestling!\"]\n\nI would like to ask if one really wants to use an English expression how they should normally refer to someone who practices these sports in everyday idiomatic speech and common English?\n\nMaybe:\n\n> * Karate / judo player\n> * Karate / judo athlete\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This depends on the audience.

Here is a crude diagram of how this is set up now.\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9gUVz.png)\n\nEach number indicates a 3 way switch. 2 questions:\n\n1. Can I replace each switch with [these sensors](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003ZDNMW2)?\n2. The \\#1 switch on the left with the asterisk is in the first floor apartment and I'd like to disable it, so that the first light only comes on from motion in the hallway when a door is opened. How do I take this switch out of the loop?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can probably replace the switches with those sensors, but you're going to have to do some creative wiring to work around the fact that they're not 3\\-way switches, but the switches you're replacing with them are. You'll likely end up with the light being on whenever either of the switches is on. You also might run into trouble if they ran the 3\\-way switches as a switch loop (no neutral in box), because \"smart switches\" like these require a neutral so they can use power for themselves to decide when to switch on and off.\n\nHere's what the difference between these wiring schemes looks like if you draw it out:\n\n![3-way switches, with neutral and as switch loop](https://i.imgur.com/wcUGG.jpg)\n\nAlso note that those occupancy sensors still have a hard\\-on switch, so your tenants can still just leave the lights on. You might want to look instead at vacancy sensors. (An example vacancy sensor is [Cooper Wiring Devices K01\\-400RW\\-L](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000ZOCSX8), but note that it does not handle CFLs, just incandescents.) These, you tap to turn them on, and they turn themselves *off* automatically when everyone's gone. That sounds more like what you want.\n\nThe how for switch \\#1 depends again on how they wired your \\#1 switches and the light they control together. If you diagram out the connections, it becomes straightforward. Until you have enough info to diagram it out, you don't have enough info to rewire it, either.\n\nAs an aside, all the exterior stairwell lights I've seen in apartment complexes were on timers. They'd come on around dark and flip off in the morning. I knew they were timers rather than photosensors because a couple times a year they'd end up slightly out of sync with actual daylight hours, but if these are in fact exterior lights, putting them on a photosensor and disabling the switches entirely might be an option."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An apartment building owner wants to replace 3-way switches in the stairwells with motion sensor switches to save energy.

If the existing switches are wired as a switch loop without a neutral, the new sensors may not work.\n\nC is incorrect because vacancy sensors, not occupancy sensors, would be more effective in this case.

Since in both approaches you select one baseline category (reference) with regard to which the odds ratios of all other categories are expressed, it usually does not matter if you have the one or the other if the reference category remains equal.\"\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while multinomial models do allow for simultaneous parameter restrictions, this is presented as an advantage, not as a reason why they are always superior.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the documentation specifically advises against using random effects with only 13 countries as level-2 units.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the documentation actually suggests using fixed effects models with country dummies as an alternative approach."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/12/24", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/602876", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/283632/"], "docs_id": 602876, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: At same AoA,will flow separation starts earlier (point of separation more upstream) at higher airflow speeds (\\=higher air inertia) compare to lower airflow speeds?\n\nHigh speed airflow has more air inertia so it seems inuitevly that air will harderd follow curved surface and leave surface earlier?\n\nQuestion referes to subsonics speeds,but you can expand your answer at supersonic speeds as well.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KccxW.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KccxW.jpg)\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gdvGe.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gdvGe.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, flow separation does not start earlier at higher airflow speeds.\n\nThe Reynolds number (a dimensionless parameter equal to Density \\* Speed \\* Chord / Viscosity) plays a central role in any discussion of flow separation (or other viscous effects). It can be thought of as a ratio of inertial forces (which tend to keep the flow attached), and viscous forces (which help trigger separation).\n\nThe Mach number can also be important, but the flows shown in the question appear to be common low\\-speed flows for which it can be assumed constant (or even zero).\n\nWhen the speed of the oncoming flow is increased, the Reynolds number increases by the same factor. As the Reynolds number gets larger, boundary layers get thinner and viscous effects diminish, and eventually vanish. Inviscid flow solutions can be thought of as the\nlimiting solutions as the Reynolds number approaches infinity.\n\nThe figure below shows the computed pressure distributions about a conventional airfoil at a large angle of attack and two values of the Reynolds number (plus the inviscid result). Instead of plotting the dimensional values of the pressure (which would vary by large factors), I've shown the dimensionless pressure coefficients, which are more commonly used and are more useful for comparisons. The regions of nearly constant pressure in the aft regions are indicative of trailing\\-edge separation, and the one with higher Reynolds number has a much smaller separated region. (And of course, the separation is entirely absent in the inviscid solution.)\n\nIt can also be seen that the gradients in the pressure coefficients get smaller as the Reynolds number increases. This tendency plays a key role in the resulting change in separation. It would not make sense to use the trends in the dimensional pressure distributions to explain these tendencies, because opposite trends would be observed if the Reynolds number were increased by changing the size of the airfoil, instead of the speed of the flow.\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rZKD4.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rZKD4.jpg)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: As the Reynolds number increases for airflow over an airfoil at a given angle of attack, what effect does this have on flow separation?\n\nA) Flow separation occurs earlier and over a larger region of the airfoil\nB) Flow separation occurs later and over a smaller region of the airfoil\nC) Flow separation remains unchanged regardless of Reynolds number\nD) Flow separation occurs earlier but over a smaller region of the airfoil\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: As the Reynolds number increases (which occurs with higher airflow speeds), the boundary layer becomes thinner and viscous effects diminish. This results in flow separation occurring later and over a smaller region of the airfoil. The pressure distribution graphs in the given information show that at higher Reynolds numbers, the region of nearly constant pressure (indicating separation) is smaller compared to lower Reynolds numbers. Additionally, the explanation states that \"the one with higher Reynolds number has a much smaller separated region.\" This corresponds to option B, where flow separation occurs later and over a smaller region of the airfoil as Reynolds number increases."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/25", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/702384", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/210876/"], "docs_id": 702384, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have many files in directory(with folders so i think solution must be recursive in deep)\n\n* root\\-folder\n\t+ file\\-1\\.png\n\t+ file\\-2\\.png\n\t+ file\\-3\\.png\n\t+ file\\-4\\.png\n\t+ file\\-5\\.png\n\t+ folder\\-1\n\t\t- file\\-1\\.png\n\t\t- file\\-2\\.png\n\t\t- file\\-3\\.png\n\nI need to rename all files, which contains `-` character to `_`. \n\n```\nfile-1.png -> file_1.png\n\n```\n\nBut.
