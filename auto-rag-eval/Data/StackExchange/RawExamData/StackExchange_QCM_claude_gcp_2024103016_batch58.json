The number of songs that they play on a given day has a Poisson\ndistribution, with an average of 5 songs per day. Regardless of how many songs\nthey will play that day, Helen and Joe always flip a coin at the start of each song, to decide who will play the solo on that song. If we know that Joe plays\nexactly 4 solos on a given day, then how many solos do we expect that Helen\nwill play on that same day?\n\nMy attempt:\nIf the average is $5$ songs a day and Joe performs $4$ solos on one day. I thought we should expect Helen to perform $1$ solo on the same day $(5\\-4\\=1\\)$\n\nBut The answer given to me is: $2\\.5$ solos we expect Helen to play\n\nMy question is why? What is the way of thinking that gives me $2\\.5$? Is it cause of the coin flip? so $5 \\\\cdot .5 \\= 2\\.5$? What does Joe's $4$ solos have to do with anything then?\n\nThank You for any help.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While Matthew Pilling and tommik provide answers that show the mathematics of getting the answer, I will provide the intuition involved.\n\n1. We know that, on this specific day, Joe played 4 solos. This provides a minimum number of songs \\- specifically, there must have been at least 4 songs. Note that it is very possible for the Poisson distribution to produce 0 songs or 1 song. However, we have been given information that constrains the set of possible numbers of songs \\- it must be at least 4\\.\n2. We know that Joe played *exactly* 4 solos \\- this is a lot more likely if there are 8 songs (\\~27%) than if there are 4 songs (\\~6%). This changes the likelihoods of each of the possibilities, compared with the basic Poisson distribution, given this information.\n3. How many solos we expect Helen to have played can then be worked out from the new probabilities, which have incorporated the additional information (that Joe played 4 solos).\n\nTo see why the 50% information can't be directly used to conclude that Helen is expected to have played 4 solos as well, consider a slightly modified version of the problem. Rather than the number of songs following a Poisson distribution, we will assume that they follow a uniform distribution of between 1 and 7 songs.\n\nNow, we know that Joe played 4 solos. How many solos do we expect Helen to have played? Well, it can't be 4, because that would mean they may have played 8 songs, which can't have happened \\- the maximum is 7 songs.\n\nTo work out the correct answer, we turn to Bayes' Theorem, which is explicitly used in Matthew's answer, and is hidden by proportionality in tommik's answer. Think of the fact that Joe played 4 solos as a \"new piece of information\". Bayes' Theorem (at least by Bayesian thinking) lets you update your probabilities given the new information."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Helen and Joe play guitar together daily at lunch.

This problem requires applying Bayes' Theorem and conditional probability. The key points are:\n\n1. Joe playing 4 solos provides information that affects the probability distribution of the total number of songs played that day.\n2. The fact that Joe played 4 solos doesn't mean the total number of songs was exactly 5 (the average). It could have been more.\n3. Each song has a 50% chance for either Helen or Joe to play the solo, but this is applied to the updated probability distribution of the total number of songs, given the information about Joe's solos.\n4. The expected number of Helen's solos is calculated using this updated distribution, not simply by subtracting Joe's solos from the average, or by assuming an equal split of the average.\n\nA) is incorrect because it assumes the total number of songs was exactly 5.\nC) is incorrect because it assumes Helen must have played the same number of solos as Joe.\nD) is incorrect because it ignores the information about Joe's solos and just uses the average number of songs."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/19", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/36456", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/6549/"], "docs_id": 36456, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How do you remove the newsletter link from the customer account navigation in Magento?\n\nWe have started using the Advanced Newsletter extension and now have two newsletter links in our customer account navigation, one for the the default newsletter and the other for the default newsletter.\n\nI can see that the default newsletter link is added to customer account nav in *app/design/frontend/base/default/layout/newsletter.xml* on ln 48 with:\n\n```\n<customer_account>\n    <!-- Mage_Newsletter -->\n    <reference name=\"customer_account_navigation\">\n        <action method=\"addLink\" translate=\"label\" module=\"newsletter\"><name>newsletter</name><path>newsletter/manage/</path><label>Newsletter Subscriptions</label></action>\n    </reference>\n    <remove name=\"left.newsletter\"/>\n</customer_account>\n\n```\n\nI've tried removing this link in our theme's local.xml with:\n\n```\n<reference name=\"customer_account_navigation\">\n    <!--<action method=\"removeLinkByName\"><name>newsletter</name></action>-->\n    <!--<remove name=\"newsletter\"/>-->\n    <action method=\"removeLinkByUrl\"><url helper=\"newsletter/manage/\"/></action>\n</reference>\n\n```\n\nNone of these methods have worked for me \\& I get an error when I try to remove them with an action method.\n\n`<action method=\"removeLinkByName\"><name>newsletter</name></action>` gives this error: `Invalid method Mage_Customer_Block_Account_Navigation::removeLinkByName(Array`\n\n`<action method=\"removeLinkByUrl\"><url helper=\"newsletter/manage/\"/></action>` gives this error: `Fatal error: Class 'Mage_Newsletter_Helper_Manage' not found in /app/Mage.php on line 546`\n\nWhile `<remove name=\"newsletter\"/>` gives no error but does not remove the link\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You need to rewrite Magento's Customer Mage\\_Customer\\_Block\\_Account\\_Navigation Block class.\n\ncreate config.xml file in the app/code/local/Neo/CustomerNavigationLinks/etc\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config>\n    <modules>\n        <Neo_CustomerNavigationLinks>\n            <version>0.0.1</version>\n        </Neo_CustomerNavigationLinks>\n    </modules>\n    <global>\n        <blocks>\n            <customer>\n                <rewrite>\n                    <account_navigation>Neo_CustomerNavigationLinks_Block_Account_Navigation</account_navigation>\n                </rewrite>\n            </customer>\n        </blocks>\n        <helpers>\n            <customernavigationlinks>\n                <class>Neo_CustomerNavigationLinks_Helper</class>\n            </customernavigationlinks>\n        </helpers>\n    </global>\n</config>\n\n```\n\nin Neo/CustomerNavigationLinks/Block/Account/ careate a file called Navigation.php with the following content in it\n\n```\n<?php\n\nclass Neo_CustomerNavigationLinks_Block_Account_Navigation extends Mage_Customer_Block_Account_Navigation\n{\n    public function removeLinkByName($name)\n    {\n        unset($this->_links[$name]);\n        return $this;\n    }\n}\n?>\n\n```\n\nin app/etc/modules create a file called Neo\\_CustomerNavigationLinks.xml with the following content\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config>\n    <modules>\n        <Neo_CustomerNavigationLinks>\n            <active>true</active>\n            <codePool>local</codePool>\n        </Neo_CustomerNavigationLinks>\n    </modules>\n</config>\n\n```\n\nNow in local.xml add following content\n\n```\n<customer_account>\n        <reference name=\"customer_account_navigation\">\n            <action method=\"removeLinkByName\">\n                <name>newsletter</name> \n            </action>\n        </reference>\n</customer_account>\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided Magento documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Magento e-commerce system, you need to remove the default newsletter link from the customer account navigation.

Define a new category $\\\\textsf{C}\\_A$ as follows\n> \n> \n> * $\\\\text{Obj}(\\\\textsf{C}\\_A)$ are morphisms $f\\\\in \\\\text{Hom}\\_\\\\textsf{C}(Z,A)$, for any $Z \\\\in \\\\text{Obj}(\\\\textsf{C})$.\n> * Morphisms $f\\_1\\\\to f\\_2$ are commutative diagrams corresponding to morphisms $\\\\sigma: Z\\_1 \\\\to Z\\_2$ such that $f\\_1 \\= f\\_2 \\\\sigma$.\n\nHe then mostly verifies this a category (leaving some exercises for the reader). When introducing this category, he said that the way morphisms are defined here are the \"most natural choice\". I'm curious perhaps then if this would work as a category as well:\n\n* $\\\\text{Obj}(\\\\textsf{C}^\\*\\_A)$ are morphisms $f\\\\in \\\\text{Hom}\\_\\\\textsf{C}(Z,A)$, for any $Z \\\\in \\\\text{Obj}(\\\\textsf{C})$.\n* Morphisms $f\\_1\\\\to f\\_2$ correspond to morphisms $\\\\sigma: A \\\\to A$ (so the diagram looks like a \"U\")\n\nI don't really have a paper and pencil on me to meticulously look into this \\-\\- but it seems this satisifies almost every property of a category:\n\n1. Every object has an identity, namely $1\\_A$.\n2. You can compose morphisms, as they're just identities and $\\\\textsf{C}$ is a category. (Also, wouldn't composition be commutative here?)\n3. Identities respect composition.\n4. Composition is associative, follows from $\\\\textsf{C}$ being a category.\n\nWhat makes me believe this isn't a category though is it fails this fifth requirement:\n\n> $$\\\\text{Hom}\\_{\\\\textsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(A,B)\\\\cap \\\\text{Hom}\\_{\\\\textsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(C,D)\\= \\\\emptyset$$\n>  unless $A\\=C$ and $B\\=D$.\n\nSince in this category essentially every set of morphisms between objects is the set $\\\\text{End}\\_\\\\textsf{C}(A)$. So does this mean $\\\\textsf{C}^\\*\\_A$ doesn't form a category?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's something not written but implicit in your definition: in order for $\\\\sigma f\\_1$ and $f\\_2$ to be equal, they must have the same domain, i.e. morphisms $f\\_1\\\\to f\\_2$ only exist in your (prospective) category when $f\\_1$ and $f\\_2$ are both maps $Z\\\\to A$ for the *same* $Z$.\n\nThat is, an element of $\\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$ is *a commutative triangle* made up of the maps $f\\_1: Z\\\\to A$, $f\\_2: Z\\\\to A$ and $\\\\sigma: A\\\\to A$ (I don't know how to draw commutative diagrams on here, so you can do it yourself!). In particular, elements of the set $\\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$ \"remember\" their domain and codomain $f\\_1$ and $f\\_2$ by definition: these elements aren't just maps $\\\\sigma$, but maps $\\\\sigma$ *along with* domain $f\\_1$ and codomain $f\\_2$. The domain and codomain are *built into* these commutative triangles.\n\nIn practice, people will usually write these maps as $\\\\sigma\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$, but strictly speaking that's not quite true. A better notation, capturing *all* of the information in the commutative triangle, would be $(\\\\sigma, f\\_1, f\\_2\\)\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$.\n\nLong story short: if $\\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$ and $\\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(g\\_1,g\\_2\\)$ intersect \\- say, the element $(\\\\sigma,f\\_1,f\\_2\\)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(f\\_1,f\\_2\\)$ can also be written as $(\\\\tau,g\\_1,g\\_2\\)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Hom}\\_{\\\\mathsf{C}^\\*\\_A}(g\\_1,g\\_2\\)$ \\- then *the whole commutative triangle* this element represents must be the same. That is, $\\\\sigma \\= \\\\tau, f\\_1 \\= g\\_1, f\\_2 \\= g\\_2$.\n\n---\n\nTo address something you said about \"naturality\": there's nothing wrong with your category at all. I wouldn't call it \"unnatural\". It's just that it doesn't crop up all that often in mathematics. Aluffi's category $\\\\mathsf{C}\\_A$ does crop up a lot, though; it's even got its own special name, the *slice* category. It's a particular way of viewing how objects in $\\\\mathsf{C}$ behave \"relative to\" $A$. In this case, the notion of \"being relative to $A$\" is a part of the structure of an object $Z\\\\to A$, and if you want to study objects with a certain standing relative to $A$, then it's *natural* to ask for the morphisms to *preserve* that structure. I think this was the sense in which Aluffi used the word."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of category theory, consider a category C and an object A in C.

C*_A fails to be a category because it violates a fundamental property of categories: that morphism sets between different objects should be disjoint unless the objects are the same. In C*_A, all morphism sets are essentially End_C(A), regardless of the source and target objects.

In the slice category, morphisms f1 \u2192 f2 correspond to morphisms \u03c3: Z1 \u2192 Z2 such that f1 = f2 \u2218 \u03c3, which is not the case in C*_A.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it misinterprets the definition of C*_A.

In QM, a set of N particles are indistinguishable only if their combined wave function is either symmetric (bosons) or antisymmetric (fermions) under interchange of two particles. Why do we make this assumption for the combined wave function of the particles in the gas (whose single particle wavefunctions are given by the solutions to the particle in a 3D box problem, as usual)?\n\n2: It's found that if the number of possible single particle states at low energy is much higher than the number of particles, then you can approximate the partition function by introducing a factor of 1/(N!) (where N is the number of particles) in order to account for the indistinguishability of the particles. This is because most states of the system will be such that all the particles are found in distinct energy levels. But if we assume that the particles are fermions, then surely the particles HAVE to be in different states (due to Pauli's exclusion principle), meaning that introducing the factor 1/(N!) is exact (and not just an approximation)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> 1: Why do we assume that the particles in the gas are indistinguishable?\n\nBecause if we don't, then we find that the entropy of the system is non\\-extensive (see [the Gibbs paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_paradox)), which leads to apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics. The solution proposed by Josiah Gibbs is to treat the particles as indistinguishable by introducting an additional factor of $1/N!$ in the multiplicity function. This is one of the ways in which a fundamental quantum mechanical property is manifested in an ostensibly classical system.\n\n> 2: \\[..]But if we assume that the particles are fermions, then surely the particles HAVE to be in different states (due to Pauli's exclusion principle), meaning that introducing the factor 1/(N!) is exact (and not just an approximation)?\n\nNo, it's still an approximation. Imagine that your system has three energy levels $E\\=\\\\{0,\\\\epsilon,2\\\\epsilon\\\\}$ and three particles with a total energy of $3\\\\epsilon$.\n\n* For classical distinguishable particles, we could have each particle in a different energy level or all three particles in the second energy level. There are six ways to arrange the former and one way to arrange the latter, for a total multiplicity of 7\\. Dividing by $3!\\=6$ yields a corrected multiplicity of $7/6$.\n* For indistinguishable bosons, the aforementioned six possible arrangements of one particle per energy level all correspond to the same microstate. Therefore, the total multiplicity is $2$.\n* For indistinguishable fermions, we additionally have that the microstate with all of the particles in the second energy level is forbidden, which means that the total multiplicity is $1$.\n\nAs a side note, the probability that all three particles have the same energy is $1/7$ as computed classically, $1/2$ for indistinguishable bosons, and $0$ for indistinguishable fermions.

I just wonder how you people handle the business logic errors? Im trying to do a nice api for my business model. Some methods have quite a lot of validation and I just wonder how should I report them if something goes wrong? Returning true or false or null sometimes won't say what was the actual cause. Sometimes it works sometimes it is not enough. I read that some people use exceptions. I've thought that I could return error messages and when everything goes fine then it would be null. Somehow error codes just don't add up for me..\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are on the right track. Domain or business validation logic should do more than just report true or false. You want to enable the \"user\" of your business classes (ie the UI, or your logging system) to do something more than just report to the end\\-user that something is wrong.\n\nNow, how you do that is completely up to you.\n\nDecision to make: check everything and then report all errors/warnings/information, or stop at the first one you encounter. I would personally opt for the first one and let the UI decide how to use the info. There is a trade\\-off though: some validations may take longer than others and you may want to check these only if the \"simple\" ones succeed.\n\nI wouldn't in any case use exceptions to do this. Some people use exceptions because most development environments have a nice way of showing any unhandled exceptions to the user. I think that is just a bad/lazy choice. And not just because it is then hard to decide where the error came from (though stack traces can help there), but also because it can(will) leave your app in an unpredictable state and may cause errors further down the line that will be even harder to debug.\n\nTherefore, I tend to reserve exceptions for, well exceptional, circumstances. Things I didn't foresee. Validation doesn't fall into that category in my opinion \\- you did foresee all (current) validation concerns or you wouldn't have validated against them.\n\nAll in all, I code the validation in the domain/business classes to collect an array (or whatever I care to use) of error/warning/hint instances. They may be simple strings, they can be fully fledged classes. Usually I always return an instance to the caller and never an unassigned pointer. \"Valid\" is simplu indicated by a message count of zero."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In handling business logic errors for an API, which of the following approaches is recommended according to the top answer?\n\nA) Use exceptions to report all validation errors, as they provide detailed stack traces\nB) Return true, false, or null values to indicate the success or failure of operations\nC) Implement a system that collects an array of error/warning/hint instances, with validity indicated by a message count of zero\nD) Use error codes to represent different types of validation failures\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The top answer recommends against using exceptions for business logic validation, considering them appropriate only for unforeseen circumstances. It also discourages simple true/false/null returns as they don't provide enough information about the cause of errors. Error codes are not favored either. \n\nInstead, the answer suggests implementing a system that collects an array of error/warning/hint instances. This approach allows for comprehensive error reporting, enabling the API to communicate multiple issues at once if needed. The absence of errors (indicated by a message count of zero) signifies validity. This method provides flexibility in error handling and allows the UI or logging system to decide how to use and present the error information."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/04/13", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/393722", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/166556/"], "docs_id": 393722, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have run many versions of QGIS 2 and 3 on two Mac computers.

So plugin developer, who wanted to include third\\-party\\-modules/packages can't resolve that dependencies.\n\nThough there are functions within a python standard installation, that can be used from within python code to \"install\" third\\-party modules.

Because that package has no further dependencies, you can integrate it into your Python plugin, by copying the whole package directory as a subfolder into the plugin folder. By doing this you'll get a package containing another package. So when importing `browser_history` inside your main plugin module you'll use a relative import ([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14132789/relative\\-imports\\-for\\-the\\-billionth\\-time](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14132789/relative-imports-for-the-billionth-time)).\n\nThis looks like this, for example:\n\n```\nfrom . import browser_history\n\n```\n\nTo generalize the problem: each python module or packages which has no further dependencies, can be integrated into a Python plugin, but it is not more than a workaround with advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, if you try using pip inside your code, especially under Windows, using OSGeo4W, the use of pip may fail, when dependent modules use a C\\-Compiler for installation for example.

Is it possible to specify exactly what the difference is?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Tikhonov regularizarization is a larger set than ridge regression. Here is my attempt to spell out exactly how they differ. \n\nSuppose that for a known matrix $A$ and vector $b$, we wish to find a vector $\\\\mathbf{x}$ such that \n: \n\n$A\\\\mathbf{x}\\=\\\\mathbf{b}$.\n\nThe standard approach is ordinary least squares linear regression. However, if no $x$ satisfies the equation or more than one $x$ does\u2014that is the solution is not unique\u2014the problem is said to be ill\\-posed. Ordinary least squares seeks to minimize the sum of squared residuals, which can be compactly written as:\n\n$\\\\\\|A\\\\mathbf{x}\\-\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\\\|^2 $\n\nwhere $\\\\left \\\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\right \\\\\\|$ is the Euclidean norm. In matrix notation the solution, denoted by $\\\\hat{x}$, is given by:\n\n$\\\\hat{x} \\= (A^{T}A)^{\\-1}A^{T}\\\\mathbf{b}$\n\n**Tikhonov regularization** minimizes \n\n$\\\\\\|A\\\\mathbf{x}\\-\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\\\|^2\\+ \\\\\\|\\\\Gamma \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\\\|^2$\n\nfor some suitably chosen Tikhonov matrix, $\\\\Gamma $. An explicit matrix form solution, denoted by $\\\\hat{x}$, is given by:\n\n$\\\\hat{x} \\= (A^{T}A\\+ \\\\Gamma^{T} \\\\Gamma )^{\\-1}A^{T}{b}$\n\nThe effect of regularization may be varied via the scale of matrix $\\\\Gamma$. For $\\\\Gamma \\= 0$ this reduces to the unregularized least squares solution provided that (ATA)\u22121 exists.\n\nTypically for **ridge regression**, two departures from Tikhonov regularization are described. First, the Tikhonov matrix is replaced by a multiple of the identity matrix \n\n$\\\\Gamma\\= \\\\alpha I $, \n\ngiving preference to solutions with smaller norm, i.e., the $L\\_2$ norm. Then $\\\\Gamma^{T} \\\\Gamma$ becomes $\\\\alpha^2 I$ leading to\n\n$\\\\hat{x} \\= (A^{T}A\\+ \\\\alpha^2 I )^{\\-1}A^{T}{b}$\n\nFinally, for ridge regression, it is typically assumed that $A$ variables are scaled so that $X^{T}X$ has the form of a correlation matrix. and $X^{T}b$ is the correlation vector between the $x$ variables and $b$, leading to\n\n$\\\\hat{x} \\= (X^{T}X\\+ \\\\alpha^2 I )^{\\-1}X^{T}{b}$\n\nNote in this form the Lagrange multiplier $\\\\alpha^2$ is usually replaced by $k$, $\\\\lambda$, or some other symbol but retains the property $\\\\lambda\\\\geq0$\n\nIn formulating this answer, I acknowledge borrowing liberally from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization) and from [Ridge estimation of transfer function weights](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610919008812867)"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the following statements about Tikhonov regularization and ridge regression:\n\nI.

Currently we are being managed by a non technical person.\n\nThe new manager chose me to act as a technical leader for the rest of the team till the company hires a someone more experienced.\n\n**Problem**\n\nAlthough I'm a good developer my experience in providing solution to the company's needs is somewhat lacking. I mean I have no problem **implementing** solutions or adding new modules to the system as I have been working for 2 years already in PHP and MySql.\n\nThe problem is when we are designing a new heavy feature or building a critical module that can't tolerate trial and error.\n\nCheck this link for a design issue that I recently had to implement:\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10529459/building\\-a\\-cron\\-job\\-scheduler](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10529459/building-a-cron-job-scheduler)\n\nI can easily build all solutions that were mentioned in the post. The only problem is that I don't have enough experience to choose one of them. My ex\\-Team leader used to make the hard decisions and I really used to learn a lot from him. However, now he's gone and I'm left out all alone.\n\n**Solution**\n\nNow There is 2 solutions that I figured would be best for me:\n\n1. Leave the company ASAP :D and find a better company that can provide me with good experience and increase my knowledge (Although I can't leave the company any time soon due to various reasons).\n2. Find books, references or any available materials for large scale projects or pro web developers techniques. Basically anything beyond simple applications.

I'll be honest: a software company without an experienced technical leader is in trouble.\n\n> The problem is when we are designing a new heavy feature or building a\n>  critical module that can't tolerate trial and error.\n\nWhen you build a critical feature, you have to perform trials and errors. You have to implement proof of concepts of some solutions and see which one is the best. People who truly know what works and what doesn't are the ones that have tried things, not the one who have read an article on framework X vs framework Y.\n\nSure, books will help you. But in the end when you are facing a critical choice you have to \"loose\" some time with prototypes that you will throw away. Try to find what is adapted to your workflow. Advices from blogs and websites like Stack Overflow are great, but sometimes they are not valid because you have specific needs.\n\nSo I would suggest to be transparent about this: Say that you lack experience, and make long estimations to take prototyping into account. Say that the alternative is that your company recruit someone more experienced programmer, or that a non\\-technical person take responsibility for the technical decisions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a junior developer suddenly thrust into a technical leadership role, what is the most appropriate approach to handle designing critical features and modules?\n\nA) Immediately leave the company to find a better position with more experienced mentors\nB) Rely solely on books and online resources to make design decisions\nC) Implement the first solution that seems feasible without prototyping\nD) Be transparent about lack of experience, make longer estimates to account for prototyping, and test multiple approaches\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate approach is to be honest about the lack of experience, allow for longer timelines to prototype and test different solutions, and communicate clearly with management. This allows for learning through practical experience, reduces the risk of critical errors, and maintains transparency with the team and company leadership. While books and online resources can be helpful, they cannot substitute for hands-on experience in making complex design decisions.

Please redirect me if appropriate.\n\nMy question is very simple, and perhaps partly related to the observations made by several users in [this post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/482789/computing-statistical-significance-from-experimental-data/482958#482958).\n\nLet me explain the origin of my doubt, in two points.\n\n1. I am assuming that the most important population parameter for public health measures related Covid is the prevalence, i.e. the *percentage* of infected people in a given place.  \n\nThe higher the number of infected people you are likely find in a group of $N$ interacting people, the higher the risk that the infection is transmitted.  \n\nThis would explain why people who are *known* to be infected are subjected to quarantine in many countries, and why meetings in large groups are discouraged or even forbidden.\n2. as far as I can tell \\- and it seems confirmed by the post I linked above \\- you cannot estimate with any accuracy the prevalence of infections in a population if you take a *biased* sample.\n\n**So here is why I find media reports so far very puzzling: they *always* talk about absolute numbers of confirmed cases of infection, rather than prevalence, and *always* without any attempt to correct for bias, although the average number of tests per day has increased enormously since March, and the groups of people being tested are carefully selected by the authorities, thus highly biased.**\n\nA friend of mine, who knows a doctor working in a Covid ward, told me that he had exactly the same reaction to these data continuously being propagated by the media.  \n\nHow can you possibly consider a sentence like 'an extra 100 cases of infection were recorded in the last 24 hours' to mean the same thing, regardless of whether it is based on 10000 tests run on a fairly random population, or instead on 100000 tests run on people coming back from high risk countries?\n\nTo be even more explicit and concrete, if I wanted to know how 'risky' it is to be in an enclosed situation with 100 people (picked randomly) from the population of a city or town, I would have to estimate how many of these 100 people are likely to be infected \\- and for this I need the prevalence.\n\nHow are the figures given by the media of any relevance to this, considering that they are based on absolute numbers obtained from a biased population?  \n\nThere are some websites (sometimes even official government ones) where the number of infections, e.g. per 100000 people, is reported, often subdivided by geographical or administrative criteria. Do you think this is the 'real' prevalence, or is it still based on the biased evidence we seem to have? Do you know of any source of more reliable figures that could be consulted?\n\nI can only hope that the public health protection measures being enforced by various governments are based on real science and on correct data analysis, because frankly the impression one gets from the media is one of confusion, misrepresentation of reality, miscommunication, quite suspiciously as if the actual goal was to create fear, panic and uncertainty and leave people bamboozled into submission to anything that the governments will decide next, regardless of the facts.\n\nI am following the news from a few different European countries, and I can tell you, one day infections were 'up', the next 'down', then 'up' again, for weeks and weeks... Of course! Oscillations are expected, given the way they do tests. Don't you think that continuously switching between 'good' and 'bad' news is like providing no information at all, but just stupid chaos, in the eyes of the non\\-expert?\n\nAnd in practice, given that the authorities test 'high risk' people and quarantine them if they are found to be positive, even if one had the 'real' prevalence, the number of infected people one is likely to meet in a given group is probably lower than the one that could be estimated from it.  \n\nSo I am even less confident that any of what we are being fed by the media has any link to what is really relevant for the control of this infection.\n\nSorry, maybe I am not making sense, and in that case I would be glad if someone set the record straight and corrected me.  \n\nOtherwise, it would be interesting to know where we are going with all this, and why science isn't more prominently contributing at least to the correct representation of the facts.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: These two methods don't transform the data into normal distribution.

Consider the following Ngram: \n\n![a/the shamble/shambles](https://i.stack.imgur.com/goJpF.png)\n\nThe original phrase seems to have been \"shambles\" or \"the shambles\", almost always plural. It meant \"a place for slaughtering animals\", but later came to be also used for scenes of carnage, scenes of great disorder, and certain dangerous shoals at sea.\n\n[Etymonline](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shambles) says that \"shambles\" originally meant \"meat market\", having evolved from the word *schamil* meaning \"table or stall for vending\". I assume that it naturally started out as a plural, because there would be several butcher's stalls at a meat market.\n\nHowever, once \"shambles\" came to mean \"a scene of great disorder or carnage\", the things it referred to were more naturally singular, and so \"shambles\" slowly came to be used as a singular."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which statement best describes the evolution and current usage of the word \"shambles\" in English?\n\nA) \"Shambles\" originated as a singular noun meaning \"meat market\" and has always been used with the indefinite article \"a\".\n\nB) \"Shambles\" began as a plural noun referring to multiple butcher's stalls, but has evolved to be used as both a singular and plural noun, often preceded by \"a\" or \"the\".\n\nC) The word \"shambles\" has always been used exclusively as a plural noun and should never be preceded by the indefinite article \"a\".\n\nD) \"Shambles\" started as a singular noun meaning \"scene of disorder\" and gradually became used in plural form over time.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The word \"shambles\" originally meant \"meat market\" and was used in plural form to refer to multiple butcher's stalls.

The strings that are to become arguments need to be separated with SPC, TAB, NL (and possibly other whitespace character depending on the `xargs` implementation and locale), and if any of those characters may occur in the strings, they need to be quoted with single quotes, double quotes or backslash (except for NL that can only be escaped with backslash).\n\nbackslash and quotes also need to be escaped. And empty elements have to be enclosed in quotes so as not to be discarded.\n\nSo here, you can't use `echo` to output the list of words in the format recognised by `xargs`. More generally, `echo` can't be used to output arbitrary data anyway as it does its own processing of backslashes and/or leading arguments starting with `-`.\n\nHere, with `bash`, you could define:\n\n```\nprint-for-xargs() {\n  local nl=$'\\n'\n  if (($# > 0)); then\n    set -- \"${@//\\'/\\'\\\\\\'\\'}\"\n    printf \"'%s'\\n\" \"${@//$nl/\\'\\\\$nl\\'}\"\n  fi\n}\n\n```\n\nThat function prints its arguments in the format expected by `xargs` (putting each argument inside single quotes, with single quotes and newlines themselves quoted with backslash *outside* of the single\\-quoted strings).\n\nThen, you can do:\n\n```\nprint-for-xargs \"$USER\" \\\n                \"$PASSWORD\" \\\n                \"$RESOURCE_MACHINE\" \\\n                \"$SELECT_SQL\" \\\n                \"$TARGET_MACHINE\" \\\n                \"$INSERT_SQL\" |\n  xargs -n6 bash -c '\n    /usr/bin/clickhouse-client -u \"$1\" --password \"$2\" -h \"$3\" -q \"$4\" |\n      /usr/bin/clickhouse-client -u \"$1\" --password \"$2\" -h \"$5\" -q \"$6\"\n    ' bash\n\n```\n\nAlso remember that parameter expansions have to be quoted in `bash` like in most other POSIX\\-like shells.\n\nIf your `xargs` supports the non\\-standard `-0` option (for NUL\\-delimited records on input, 0 being the only only byte value that cannot occur in a command arguments), that can be greatly simplified to:\n\n```\nprint_for_xargs0() {\n  [ \"$#\" -eq 0 ] || printf '%s\\0' \"$@\"\n}\nprint_for_xargs0 \"$USER\" \\\n                 \"$PASSWORD\" \\\n                 \"$RESOURCE_MACHINE\" \\\n                 \"$SELECT_SQL\" \\\n                 \"$TARGET_MACHINE\" \\\n                 \"$INSERT_SQL\" |\n  xargs -0 -n6 sh -c '\n    /usr/bin/clickhouse-client -u \"$1\" --password \"$2\" -h \"$3\" -q \"$4\" |\n      /usr/bin/clickhouse-client -u \"$1\" --password \"$2\" -h \"$5\" -q \"$6\"\n    ' sh\n\n```\n\n(no need for `bash` there, standard `sh` will do as well)\n\nThat's assuming you do need to call `xargs` for some reason and that you're just showing a simplified example.\n\nHere, you could just do:\n\n```\n  bash -c '\n    /usr/bin/clickhouse-client -u \"$1\" --password \"$2\" -h \"$3\" -q \"$4\" |\n      /usr/bin/clickhouse-client -u \"$1\" --password \"$2\" -h \"$5\" -q \"$6\"\n    ' bash \"$USER\" \"$PASSWORD\" \"$RESOURCE_MACHINE\" \"$SELECT_SQL\" \\\n           \"$TARGET_MACHINE\" \"$INSERT_SQL\"\n\n```\n\nwithout invoking `xargs` at all or:\n\n```\n/usr/bin/clickhouse-client -u \"$USER\" --password \"$PASSWORD\" \\\n   -h \"$RESOURCE_MACHINE\" -q \"$SELECT_SQL\" |\n   /usr/bin/clickhouse-client -u \"$USER\" --password \"$PASSWORD\" \\\n   -h \"$TARGET_MACHINE\" -q \"$INSERT_SQL\"\n\n```\n\nwithout running a separate instance of a `bash` interpreter.\n\nAlso note that in all those examples, the value of `$PASSWORD` ends up in the arguments passed to `clickhouse-client` (and `bash` for those that run `bash`) which is bad practice as command arguments are public knowledge locally on a system (they show in the output of `ps -f` and could end up in audit logs)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about using xargs with echo to pass arguments containing special characters is correct?\n\nA) Echo can be safely used with xargs to output arbitrary data including strings with spaces, tabs, and newlines.\n\nB) When using echo with xargs, single quotes should be used to enclose all arguments to prevent interpretation of special characters.\n\nC) Echo cannot be reliably used with xargs for arbitrary data, as it does its own processing of backslashes and leading arguments starting with '-'.\n\nD) Xargs will always correctly interpret the output of echo, regardless of the presence of spaces, quotes, or backslashes in the arguments.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

LinearLayout containing two Button elements, and set their layout_gravity to \"bottom|end\"\n\nB) Add a new RelativeLayout at the end of the main LinearLayout, containing two Button elements with android:layout_alignParentBottom=\"true\" for each\n\nC) Replace the final TextView with a LinearLayout containing two Button elements, and set android:layout_weight=\"1\" on the RelativeLayout above the horizontal line\n\nD) Add a new LinearLayout with horizontal orientation at the end of the main LinearLayout, containing two Button elements with equal layout_weight values\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) Setting layout_gravity on child views within a LinearLayout won't push them to the bottom of the card.\nB) Using a RelativeLayout might work, but it's not the most efficient solution and could cause layout issues with different content lengths.\nC) Using layout_weight on the RelativeLayout won't affect the position of elements added after it.\nD) This is the correct approach. Adding a horizontal LinearLayout at the end of the vertical LinearLayout will naturally place the buttons at the bottom. Using equal layout_weight values for the buttons will distribute them evenly across the width of the card, similar to the Google Now card design.\n\nTo implement this, you would add the following after the horizontal line:\n\n```xml\n<LinearLayout\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:orientation=\"horizontal\"\n    android:layout_marginTop=\"10dp\">\n\n    <Button\n        android:layout_width=\"0dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n        android:text=\"Action 1\"\n        style=\"?android:attr/borderlessButtonStyle\"/>\n\n    <Button\n        android:layout_width=\"0dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n        android:text=\"Action 2\"\n        style=\"?android:attr/borderlessButtonStyle\"/>\n\n</LinearLayout>\n```\n\nThis solution provides the desired layout while maintaining flexibility and proper use of Android layout principles."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/05/03", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/131075", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/60036/"], "docs_id": 131075, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I type \"nau\" in the search bar of the applications\\-HUD the result is a \"Home Folder\" folder and a \"Files\" folder installed but the \"Files\" has a Home drawing in it and is recently used, whereas the \"Files\" doesn't and is not recently used.

Both \"Files\" and \"Home Folder\" in the HUD (Heads-Up Display) are different ways to launch Nautilus, typically opening it in the user's Home directory. Although they may have different icons or appear differently in search results, they all lead to the same Nautilus file browser application.

The design goal is to describe a provider API to query a system using various values. Some of them are catalogs resp. code lists. A catalog or code list is a set of key value pairs. There are different systems (at least 3\\) maintaining possibly different code lists. Each system should implement the provider API, whereas each system might have different code list for the same business entity eg. think of colors. One system know \\[(1,'red'),(2,'green')] and another one knows \\[(1,'lightgreen'),(2,'darkgreen'),(3,'red')] etc.\n\nThe access to the different provider API implementations will be encapsulated by a query service, but there is already one candidate which might use at least one provider API directly.\n\nThe current options to design the API discussed are:\n\n1. use an abstract code list in the interface definition: the web service interface defines a well known set of code list which are expected to be used for querying and returning data. Each API provider implementation has to mapped the request and response values from those abstract codelist to the system specific one.\n2. let the query component handle the code list: the encapsulating query service knows the code list set of each provider API implementation and takes care of mapping the input and output to the system specific code lists of the queried system.\n3. do not use code lists in the query definition at all: Just query code lists by a plain string and let the provider API implementation figure out the right value. This might lead to a loose of information and possibly many false positives, due to the fact that the input string could not be canonical mapped to a code list value (eg. green \\-\\> lightgreen or green \\-\\> darkgreen or both)\n\nWhat are your experiences resp. solutions to such a problem?

Then there is a fixed curve, with equation\n\n$$ y \\= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\lvert x\\\\rvert, \\& \\\\lvert x\\\\rvert \\> 2 \\\\\\\\ \\\\frac 2\\\\pi \\\\left(x \\\\arcsin\\\\frac x2 \\+ \\\\sqrt{4\\-x^2}\\\\right), \\& \\\\lvert x\\\\rvert \\\\leq 2 \\\\end{cases}$$\n\nsuch that the normalized Young diagram is very close to the curve with probability very close to 1\\.\n\nMy question: what asymptotic statements about irreducible characters of $S\\_n$ can be \"read off\" the Kerov\u2013Vershik theorem? In a sense, this isn't a question about Kerov\u2013Virshik at all, but a question about which interesting statistics of irreducible characters can be read off the shape of the Young diagram.\n\nThere are some tautological answers: for instance, if $f(\\\\chi)$ is the height of the first column of $\\\\chi$, then I guess Kerov\\-Virshik shows that\n\n$$\\\\frac{f(\\\\chi)}{\\\\sqrt n}$$\n\nis very probably very close to 2 as $n$ gets large (if I did this computation right \u2014 in any event it concentrates around a fixed value). But I don't really have in mind any representation\\-theoretic meaning for $f(\\\\chi)$.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This isn't a very general answer, but it is a convenient and significant one. You can read off the typical dimension of a random representation, by the hook length formula. Of course it is not as simple as, oh here's a formula, because you have to check whether the formula is stable. However, the hook\\-length formula is a factorial divided by a product of hook lengths. So you can check that the logarithm of the formula is indeed statistically stable. Up to normalization, it limits to a well\\-behaved integral over the Kerov\\-Vershik shape.\n\n---\n\nThe dimension of a group representation is of course $\\\\chi(1\\)$, the trace of the identity. Given the nice behavior of this statistic in a random representation, it is natural to ask about the typical value of $\\\\chi(\\\\sigma)$ for some other type of permutation $\\\\sigma$. Two problems arise. First, $\\\\sigma$ isn't really one type of permutation, but rather some natural infinite sequence of permutations. Second, the Murnaghan\u2013Nakayama formula for $\\\\chi(\\\\sigma)$, and probably any fully general rule, isn't statistically stable. The Murnaghan\u2013Nakayama rule is a recursive alternating sum; in order to apply it to a large Plancherel\\-random representation you would have to know a lot about the local statistics of its tableau, and not just its shape. For instance, suppose that $\\\\sigma$ is a transposition. Then the MN rule tells you to take a certain alternating sum over rim dominos of the tableau $\\\\lambda$. (The sign is positive for the horizontal dominos and negative for the vertical dominos.) I suspect that there is a typical value for $\\\\chi(\\\\sigma)$ when $\\\\sigma$ is a transposition, or probably any permutation of fixed type that is local in the sense that a transposition is local. But this would use an elaborate refinement of the Kerov\u2013Vershik theorem, analogous to the local central limit theorem augmented by a local difference operator, and not just the original Kerov\u2013Vershik.\n\nHowever, I did find another character limit in this spirit that is better behaved. In [On the number of rim hook tableaux](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02355806 \"J Math Sci 87, 4118\u20134123 (1997)\"), Fomin and Lulov established a product formula for the number of $r$\\-rim hook tableaux, which is also $\\\\chi(\\\\sigma)$ when $\\\\sigma$ is a \"free\" permutation consisting entirely of $r$\\-cycles (and no fixed points or cycle lengths that are factors of $r$). This includes the important case of fixed\\-point\\-free involutions. If $\\\\sigma$ acts on $mr$ letters, then according to them, the number of these is\n$$\\\\chi\\_\\\\lambda(\\\\sigma) \\= \\\\frac{m!}{\\\\prod\\_{r\\|h(t)} (h(t)/r)},$$\nwhere $h(t)$ is the hook length of the hook at some position $t$ in the shape $\\\\lambda$.\n\nHappily, this is just a product formula and not an alternating sum or even a positive sum. To approximate the logarithm of this character with an integral, you only need a mild refinement of Kerov\u2013Vershik, one that says that the hook length $h(t)$ of a typical position $t$ is uniformly random modulo $r$. (So this is a good asymptotic argument when $r$ is fixed or only grows slowly.)\n\n---\n\n**Correction:** Per a [comment](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/8776/statistics-of-irreps-of-s-n-that-can-be-read-off-the-young-diagram-and-conseque#comment12041_8778), JSE already thought of the first part of my answer, which I stated overconfidently. The estimate for $\\\\log \\\\chi(1\\)$ (and in the other cases of course) is an improper integral, I guess, so it does not follow just from the statement of Kerov\u2013Vershik that the integral gives you an accurate estimate of the form\n$$\\\\log \\\\chi(1\\) \\= C\\\\sqrt{n}(1\\+o(1\\)).$$\nHowever, it looks like these issues have been swept away by later, stronger versions of the original Kerov\u2013Vershik result. The arXiv paper [Ivanov and Olshanki \\- Kerov's central limit theorem for the Plancherel measure on Young diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0304010) establishes not just a typical limit for the dimension (and other character values), but also a central limit theorem."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Kerov-Vershik theorem and related research, which of the following statements about the asymptotic behavior of irreducible characters of the symmetric group Sn is most accurate?\n\nA) The dimension of a typical irreducible representation of Sn can be accurately estimated using the hook length formula applied to the limiting Kerov-Vershik curve.\n\nB) The character value \u03c7(\u03c3) for any permutation \u03c3 can be directly read off from the shape of the Young diagram using the Murnaghan\u2013Nakayama rule.\n\nC) The character value \u03c7(\u03c3) for a transposition \u03c3 has a typical value that can be determined solely from the Kerov-Vershik limiting curve.\n\nD) The character value \u03c7(\u03c3) for a permutation \u03c3 consisting entirely of r-cycles (where r is fixed) can be approximated using an integral over the Kerov-Vershik shape, assuming uniform randomness of hook lengths modulo r.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option A is partly true but oversimplified, as the estimate requires careful consideration of statistical stability and normalization. Option B is incorrect because the Murnaghan\u2013Nakayama rule isn't statistically stable for large random representations and requires more detailed information than just the diagram shape. Option C is also incorrect, as determining the typical value for a transposition would require elaborate refinements of the Kerov-Vershik theorem. \n\nOption D is the most accurate statement. It's based on the work of Fomin and Lulov, which provides a product formula for character values of permutations consisting entirely of r-cycles. This formula can be approximated by an integral over the Kerov-Vershik shape, requiring only a mild refinement of the theorem assuming uniform randomness of hook lengths modulo r.

The flexibility in interpretation doesn't affect the conveyed information, as Golmud's elevation and the train's starting elevation are the same in this context.

I won't speak too much to your power supply issue, but really think you should invest in a UPS to mitigate any power related damages to your equipment.\n\nNow lets correct a few mistakes in the previous answer. \n\nThe 120VAC legs of your electrical service are supplied by two separate hot feeds from the power company. The neutral is not there to split the 220VAC, but rather to supply a return path to the service panel and ultimately earth ground. \n\nThe neutral should be at the same potential as ground. An open neutral is checked by measuring neutral to ground, if line voltage appears, then in fact the neutral path to ground is open. Unless you have a situation where both 120VAC legs are in contact with one hot connection, you cannot produce more than 120VAC on any open neutral. If you were to see 140VAC on any hot to ground or neutral, or neutral to ground, then you have some serious problems and time to call the landlord before you fry all your lights, appliances, and electronics. This situation is very rare, and I don't think it is your problem. Your problem sounds more like a bad connection, either hot or neutral in some device that feeds your downstairs outlets. \n\nThis can be a frustrating and time consuming job to track down this type of problem. It may involve pulling several devices out of the boxes and testing voltages with the power on, and also testing conductivity with the POWER OFF.

This will let you more easily a) stay hidden and alive and b) get those delicious sneak attacks we all know and love. Anything to increase sneak/backstab damage is really useful, including, as @Rodrigo Guedes said in his answer, joining the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild (you get some great armour if you follow the latter through to the end).\n\nI haven't got any smithing to speak of (20 or so) and am using Mehrunes' Razor (highly recommended as it can occasionally 1\\-hit kill, saving you some hassle) and the Blade of Woe, which is useful to claw some health back mid\\-battle when needed. Remember that when you're lower level and using unenchanted daggers you can still improve them a little bit!\n\nI've also found archery to be incredibly useful. It can do a ton of damage if you level it up and use good arrows, you can start doing damage at enemies that are rushing at you once you've been spotted (the perk that slows down time when you draw is a lifesaver) and you can also increase the sneak attack damage to 3x instead of 2x. That's not as much as 30x but you don't need to be as close! :)\n\nAlso, don't forget your Thu'um.

I'm having a bit of trouble with my bridge overheating and I was wondering if smoothing the output would help. (Aside for putting a heat sink on it, which I'm in the process of doing) The bridge runs at 30A typically (rated for 100A) and starts getting hot kind of fast, but I only really use it for less than a minute anyway since the system I use it for is very efficient.\n\nEdit 0: The load is used for various electrochemical reactions done at low voltage (9V DC) and high current (30A DC). The reaction doesn't really care whether the DC is smoothed or not. The question refers to how much heat the bridge is building up, not that I'm running a heater. I'll admit, when I first saw the comment on someone thinking I was running a heater I had quite the laugh (As I suppose with how much heat the bridge builds up if not monitered or used for more than 4 minutes I probably would be!).\n\nEdit 1: Yes (Before anyone tells me), I know that it's a small spot welder essentially, and the proper fuses are in place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Adding a large capacitor will increase the heating of the bridge, assuming a constant resistance load. The average and the RMS currents through the bridge will both increase, so more heat (but also more output power). \n\nBecause the capacitor charges in sharp pulses, the heating will actually be more than you might expect from the average output current increase. That is because the diode forward voltage increases with current, and a portion is actually resistive so some component of the heating is related to the current squared and not just the current (hence RMS current)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a power supply using a bridge rectifier circuit.

Adding a large smoothing capacitor would actually increase the heating of the bridge rectifier. The capacitor causes the bridge to conduct in sharp pulses, increasing both average and RMS currents, which leads to more heat generation.\n\nB) Incorrect. While removing a smoothing capacitor might slightly reduce heating compared to having one, it doesn't address the fundamental issue and may not be the most effective solution.\n\nC) Correct. Increasing the load resistance would reduce the current flowing through the bridge rectifier. Since heat generation is proportional to the square of the current (P = I\u00b2R), reducing the current would significantly decrease heat generation.\n\nD) Incorrect. Changing the input voltage frequency would not directly address the heat generation issue in the bridge rectifier.

This, in my experience, is the actual root of your pain.\n\nImagine if your topical branches lasted a few hours and then were merged back in to the integration branch. These ephemeral branches are likely to be trivial to keep up\\-to\\-date and trivial to merge back into your integration branch. On the other hand, imagine a long\\-running topical branch that spans multiple releases of the software without integration. It would probably be quite difficult to integrate. This should lead you to conclude that short\\-running topical branches that are frequently rebased against master are easier to work with.\n\nThe question, then, becomes \"why would features be bigger than what a branch should be?\" This is probably because you're trying to do too much at once. The best way to keep topical branches short\\-lived and to make integration painless is to work in an iterative fashion where the minimum marketable feature is ruthlessly hewn down to its bare essentials and further work on that feature is added on in separate increments."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A solo developer is struggling with their Git workflow, particularly with long-running feature branches.

This distinction suggests that \"appears\" is more likely to be used when there's observable evidence for an opinion, whereas \"seems\" might be used for a more intuitive or subjective impression.\n\nOption A is incorrect because formality is not mentioned as a distinguishing factor between the two words.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it reverses the actual usage; if anything, \"appears\" is more closely tied to physical appearances.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, while the documentation notes that the words are often used interchangeably, it does highlight a subtle difference in their connotations.\n\nIt's worth noting that the documentation also mentions that despite this theoretical distinction, in practice, the words are often used interchangeably, which adds a layer of complexity to the question and reflects the nuances of real-world language usage."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/09/03", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/426583", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/203798/"], "docs_id": 426583, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In relativity, to my knowledge, the path of an object is described by its worldline in spacetime, and since time is a part of the spacetime geometry, an object's worldline\\-\\-in a sense\\-\\-always exists on this \u201cblock of time\u201d as I heard the PBS spacetime say. But in quantum mechanics (the Copenhagen interpretation), I\u2019ve heard that a particle will exist in (*superposition* of being in) multiple places at once until it is observed and the wave function collapses and it has a single position. \n\nSo my question is, how could these two viewpoints be reconciled? Apologies if I got anything wrong. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two problems here, one on the quantum mechanical side and one on the relativistic side.\n\nInterpreting quantum mechanics\n------------------------------\n\nFirst, you seem to be imagining that quantum particles \"really\" are classical, with well\\-defined trajectories which we simply can't measure because of the uncertainty principle. That is, you treat quantum mechanics as just classical mechanics viewed through a smudged lens. That is not a good way of thinking about it: nature is *much* weirder than that. (I try to give a better explanation [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/421919/quantum-made-easy-so-what-is-quantum-mechanics-all-about/421939#421939).)\n\nTo avoid confusion, you should refrain from using phrases such as \"the *actual* position of the particle\" or \"the path the particle took\". Imagine trying to explain to a blind person how a screen's color is fading from white to black, and them asking \"okay, but was it *actually* black or white right in the middle?\" It's just not a valid question; there is no answer.\n\nIn the modern formulation of relativistic quantum field theory, we define quantum fields on all of spacetime $\\\\phi(t, \\\\mathbf{x})$. So the quantum field can be defined for all times from the get go, but this does *not* mean that it represents a definite number of particles doing definite trajectories, any more than a screen having a color at any time means it's always either black or white. \n\nInterpreting relativity\n-----------------------\n\nThe second problem is with the interpretation of relativity. I think you're alluding to Putnam's [block universe argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rietdijk%E2%80%93Putnam_argument). The argument is essentially that, since things that will occur in the future in my frame have already occurred in somebody else's frame, due to [relativity of simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity), the future must \"already\" \"exist\", so it must be predetermined. However, one shouldn't confuse the mathematical formalism of a theory, i.e. the easiest way to set it up, with its ontology, i.e. what it states about reality.\n\nSome summarize this by saying \"the map is not the territory\". If you have a road map with a grid of latitude and longitude lines, that does not mean the real ground is covered in giant lines. The lines were just drawn to make the map more useful. Not everything on the map reflects reality.\n\nSimilarly, relativity pushes us to set up calculations so that everything is already defined for all times, but this is not necessary. For example, in the [ADM/3\\+1 formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM_formalism) of general relativity, things are specified only at a single time, then propagated forward in time. So in this map, the future does not exist, only the present. This is essential for numerical simulations, because how would you have a computer compute the future if it had to know it already?\n\nThe point is that there are multiple ways to set up relativity, and all of them have different features. Since they all make the same concrete predictions, science can't choose one. (This is why I get annoyed at grand statements about how relativity tells us what spacetime *really is*, when it's really just a feature of the one map the speaker has used.)\n\nIf you insist on a *particular* interpretation of relativity (the block universe) and a *particular* interpretation of quantum mechanics (Copenhagen), then there is indeed a contradiction, because the Copenhagen interpretation requires an indeterminate future. But that doesn't mean the underlying theories contradict each other, it only means that these two particular ways of talking about them don't mesh; you'll need to swap out one or the other. I apologize for not making any strong statements here, but this agnosticism is the only scientifically tenable position."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best reconciles the apparent contradiction between relativity's worldlines and quantum mechanics' superposition?\n\nA) Relativity's block universe interpretation is incompatible with quantum mechanics, proving that one of these theories must be incorrect.\n\nB) Quantum particles actually have well-defined trajectories that we simply can't measure due to the uncertainty principle.\n\nC) The mathematical formalisms used to describe relativity and quantum mechanics don't necessarily reflect the underlying reality, and alternative interpretations may be compatible.\n\nD) The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is the only valid interpretation and must be used to modify our understanding of relativity.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it acknowledges that the apparent contradiction may arise from particular interpretations of the theories rather than the theories themselves. The passage emphasizes that we shouldn't confuse the mathematical formalism or a particular interpretation with the underlying reality. It mentions that there are multiple ways to set up relativity (e.g., the ADM/3+1 formalism) that don't require a predetermined future. Similarly, it cautions against thinking of quantum particles as classical objects with definite trajectories. The answer recognizes that alternative interpretations or formalisms might resolve the apparent contradiction without invalidating either theory.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it jumps to the conclusion that the theories themselves are incompatible, which the passage does not support. Option B is explicitly rejected in the passage, which states this is not a good way of thinking about quantum mechanics. Option D is too restrictive, as the passage doesn't endorse the Copenhagen interpretation as the only valid one and suggests that different interpretations of both theories might be needed for compatibility."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/05/04", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/116223", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/44083/"], "docs_id": 116223, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Sleeping Dogs GOTY, I get all the DLCs unlocked after an hour of play, and then I get like 8 level\\-ups, 200000$ (and also cars, outfits etc...).

Here the snippet from [this page](http://www.postfix.org/MILTER_README.html#non-smtp-milters) from official documentation.\n\n> There's one small complication when using Milter applications for non\\-SMTP mail: there is no SMTP session. To keep Milter applications happy, **the Postfix cleanup(8\\) server actually has to simulate the SMTP client** CONNECT and DISCONNECT events, and the SMTP client EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO and DATA commands.\n> \n> \n> When new mail arrives via the sendmail(1\\) command line, the Postfix cleanup(8\\) server pretends that **the mail arrives with ESMTP from \"localhost\" with IP address \"127\\.0\\.0\\.1\"**. The result is very similar to what happens with command line submissions in Sendmail version 8\\.12 and later, although Sendmail uses a different mechanism to achieve this result.\n\nLooking in the logs and output of `postconf -n`, its clear that the process who reject it was milter application running via inet:127\\.0\\.0\\.1:12768\\. It's `psa-pc-remote` milter provided by Plesk.\n\nWhile I don't have any experience with Plesk, some workaround is turn off that milter for **non\\_smtpd** only. Well, I don't know this is bad or good advice because I don't know what `psa-pc-remote` do to your email. Another way, you can look some setting in Plesk to turn off this kind of rejection."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is troubleshooting an issue where emails sent using the sendmail binary are being rejected with a wrong HELO hostname of \"localhost\". What is the most likely explanation for this behavior?\n\nA) The system's hostname is incorrectly configured\nB) Postfix is misconfigured and using the wrong HELO\nC) The Plesk milter is rejecting non-SMTP mail as expected\nD) There's a conflict between Sendmail and Postfix configurations\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The issue described is actually expected behavior for non-SMTP mail when using milter applications with Postfix. As per Postfix documentation, for non-SMTP mail (such as those sent via the sendmail command), the Postfix cleanup server simulates SMTP events and pretends the mail arrives from \"localhost\" with IP address \"127.0.0.1\". This is done to keep milter applications happy, as they expect SMTP session data.\n\nIn this case, the Plesk milter (psa-pc-remote) is rejecting the mail due to the simulated \"localhost\" HELO. This is not a misconfiguration, but rather the expected behavior of how Postfix handles non-SMTP mail with milters.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the system's hostname is correctly set as shown in the provided information. Option B is also incorrect as Postfix is behaving as designed. Option D is not applicable as the issue is not related to a conflict between Sendmail and Postfix, but rather how Postfix handles non-SMTP mail with milters."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/12/14", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3039345", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/101955/"], "docs_id": 3039345, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: while trying to help the daughter of my cousin to understand Integrals, I see that I forget about some of the integral calculations.

This connection is made by recognizing that \u221b(1-x\u2077) represents y in terms of x for this curve, and \u2077\u221a(1-x\u00b3) represents x in terms of y. The integral of their difference over [0,1] is equivalent to calculating the area under this curve using a clever change of variables, as hinted in the original answer. This approach allows for a more tractable solution than direct integration or u-substitution, which would be extremely difficult or impossible for this complex expression.

I am unable to change my home page to Yahoo, Google, etc. through usual methods. How can I fix this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I do not have experience with SPEEDbit, but in general, to restore Firefox's home page settings:\n\n1. Go to `about:config`\n2. **Reset** (`Right-click -> Reset`) the following preferences:\n\n\t* `startup.homepage_override_url`\n\t* `browser.startup.page`\n\t* `browser.startup.homepage`![reset](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eeNvs.png)\n\nI suspect that you could also do a search (filter) for `speedbit` in `about:config` and **reset** any related preferences. This would hopefully restore other hijacked preferences!\n\n---\n\nUpdate:\n-------\n\n***Warning: the following was performed by a professional in a secure, virtual test environment. Do not try this at home.***\n\nTo provide a more complete answer, I went ahead and installed the SPEEDbit `Download Accelerator Plus` (DAP) and their *\"recommended\"* additions or settings: `Search Predict`, `Video Downloader`, and `Video Accelerator`.\n\n![desktop](https://i.stack.imgur.com/30J4r.png)\n\n![add-ons](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qTdtA.png)\n\n**Note:** You can **disable** these add\\-ons by going to `about:addons`.\n\n---\n\nNow, this is what my new Firefox profile looks like:\n\n![firefox profile](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KMdXP.png)\n\nAs you can see, SPEEDbit added a toolbar, changed my home page and search bar.\n\n---\n\nLet's try to reset the home page using the GUI (`Options > General > Startup`):\n\n![reset home page](https://i.stack.imgur.com/H701J.png)\n\n**Note:** if you cannot restore the home page using the GUI, you can do so by **resetting** the following preferences in `about:config`:\n\n* `pref.browser.homepage.disable_button.restore_default`\n* `browser.startup.homepage`\n\nIt seems to have worked...\n\n![about:home](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uN5Xn.png)\n\nHowever, `Download Accelerator Plus` and `Video Accelerator` are still running:\n\n![tray](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CERkI.png)\n\nSo, let's restart the computer to see if our change persists.\n\n**SUCESS!** *(I would post a screenshot, but it would be identical to the one above. You'll have to trust me.)*\n\n---\n\nYour question only covered the **home page**, but I want us to poke around `about:config` to see what else SPEEDbit has got its dirty little paws into.\n\n![about:config](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qMiKy.png)\n\nSo, to restore any other hijacked preferences, **reset** the following:\n\n* `browser.search.defaultenginename`\n* `browser.search.defaulturl`\n* `browser.search.order.1`\n* `browser.search.selectedEngine`\n* `browser.startup.homepage_override_url`\n* `keyword.URL`\n\nYour profile should now look like this:\n\n![restored](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QxrKP.png)\n\n---\n\nAnd finally, if you want to hide the Video Downloader toolbar, **uncheck**:\n\n```\nView > Toolbars > SpeedBit Video Downloader\n\n```\n\n![toolbar](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Up7N6.png)\n\n---\n\nNOT SO FAST!\n============\n\nSo, after one last reboot with `Download Accelerator Plus` and `Video Accelerator` still running, the search bar and `keyword.URL` were hijacked again. Is it one of the **add\\-ons**? Is is the aforementioned programs? Time to investigate. I'll skip the details and simply post my findings... `>:(`\n\n* **Disabling** all three add\\-ons was unsuccessful. The preferences were hijacked again after a reboot.\n* **Unchecking** `Mozilla/Firefox` integration under Download Accelerator Plus's `Options > Advanced` was unsuccessful.\n\n![browser integration](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nZMxN.png)\n* Disabling Download Accelerator Plus or Video Accelerator from **auto\\-starting** was unsuccessful.\n* Disabling the Video Accelerator **service** from auto\\-starting was unsuccessful.\n\nThe *only thing* that stopped Firefox's preferences from being hijacked was to **uninstall** Download Accelerator Plus. Once you've uninstalled the software, retracing the above steps should work properly.\n\n---\n\nConclusion:\n-----------\n\nIf you want my personal opinion on the software, I would advise you not to use it. Due to it's rogue nature and malware\\-like appearance (ads, ads, and more ads), I have a hard time believing \"265 million users\" were satisfied with the product."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following steps would be most effective in permanently removing SPEEDbit's influence on Firefox and restoring default settings?\n\nA) Resetting the browser.startup.homepage preference in about:config\nB) Disabling all SPEEDbit-related add-ons in Firefox\nC) Unchecking Mozilla/Firefox integration in Download Accelerator Plus options\nD) Uninstalling the Download Accelerator Plus software completely\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While options A, B, and C can temporarily resolve some issues, the documentation shows that SPEEDbit's Download Accelerator Plus continues to hijack Firefox preferences even after these steps are taken. The only method that completely stopped the hijacking was uninstalling the Download Accelerator Plus software. This removes the root cause of the problem, preventing further interference with Firefox settings. After uninstallation, the other steps can be used to restore Firefox to its default state without the risk of settings being changed again by the SPEEDbit software."}}
