The documentation shows that the #question-header has a width of 980px and padding of 20px on each side, resulting in a total width of 1020px. This exceeds the width of the #content container, which is only 980px wide. While this doesn't usually cause problems due to overflow: hidden on the #content, it can lead to layout issues when scrollIntoView is called on a comment, particularly in Internet Explorer.

The documentation mentions that various 32-bit systems, like Windows XP/Vista, have a kernel hard-coded limit that prevents them from addressing more than about 3.3 GB of RAM. This explains why a 4GB system might only show 3372MB as usable.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the AGP aperture can cause some memory discrepancy, it typically doesn't account for such a large difference and is more relevant to smaller amounts of RAM (like 512MB showing as 506MB).\n\nAnswer C is unlikely, as faulty RAM modules would typically cause system instability rather than a consistent reporting of less usable memory.\n\nAnswer D is also incorrect, as the BIOS is usually accurate in reporting the total amount of installed RAM.

You might be single or newly married, but I guarantee that once you've got a toddler climbing up and down the stairs, you'll fully understand why you need a railing on the near side, protecting that large gap.

Building codes and safety considerations typically require railings on both sides of a staircase, regardless of the number of steps. This is crucial for preventing falls, especially for children and elderly individuals. The question mentions the homeowner's desire for an open concept feel, which can be achieved by using glass panels for the railings. This solution provides the necessary safety while minimizing visual obstruction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it neglects the open side, which poses a significant fall risk. Option B is incorrect as it only addresses one side of the staircase, leaving the other side unsafe. Option D is incorrect because railings are required regardless of the number of steps, and the image shows more than 4 steps anyway.\n\nThe answer also aligns with the documentation's suggestion of using glass railings as a way to balance safety requirements with aesthetic preferences for openness."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/03/14", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/124269", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/35562/"], "docs_id": 124269, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sometimes my Launchpad just look like this without any app icons.

Or simply he examined the guards of the sword without touching them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Even with the context you provided, and being a native speaker, that sentence tripped me up a bit too, mostly because it's employing a unfamiliar sense of the word *guard* (which would have been more familiar to readers at the time Scott wrote *Waverly*).\n\nSo I'll tell you both what the word means and how I puzzled it out, which might help you in similar situations in the future.\n\nFirst, to answer your question directly, in this context, *guards* means:\n\n> the **posture of defence or readiness in fencing**, boxing, cricket, etc.\n\n*[Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/guard)* sense 20\n\nThe hints that this is the sense being employed are that the kid is *going through the guards* ***with*** a weapon, and that weapon usually *hangs over the chimney* (in the selfsame study), and the nephew was *surprised* at the entrance of his uncle, all of which tell us it is likely the kid took the sword off the wall and was practicing fencing with it.\n\nIn particular, he was practicing *the guards* of that kind of weapon; *guards* here meaning the **defensive positions in fencing**, similar to the images below (though these guards are specific to the longsword, not the broadsword as in the story):\n\n[![14 essential long-sword guard positions](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PgLJ5.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PgLJ5.jpg)\nimage credit: [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/explore/fencing-sword/)\n\nAnd, in case it's not clear to non\\-native speakers, *through* here is used in the sense of \"from A to Z\"; there is a fixed series of guards (as in the illustration above), and the kid was practicing each, one after another: he went *through* the series.\n\nIn short, the kid was play\\-fighting with the family's heirloom sword when his uncle walked in and nearly caught him."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Sir Walter Scott's \"Waverley,\" the phrase \"went through the guards of the broadsword\" refers to:\n\nA) The protagonist physically inspecting the protective parts of the sword's hilt\nB) The character practicing a series of defensive fencing positions with the sword\nC) The hero attempting to dismantle the sword's hilt guards\nD) The protagonist polishing the decorative elements of the sword's handle\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"went through the guards of the broadsword\" refers to the character practicing a series of defensive fencing positions with the sword. In this context, \"guards\" means the postures of defense or readiness in fencing. The passage suggests that the young hero was surprised while practicing with an heirloom sword, going through various defensive stances or positions typical in broadsword fencing. This interpretation is supported by the context of the sword being an heirloom usually displayed in the library, and the character being nearly caught in the act of using it. The other options misinterpret the meaning of \"guards\" in this context, focusing on physical parts of the sword or maintenance activities rather than the fencing practice implied by the phrase."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/04/27", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/440400", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/287066/"], "docs_id": 440400, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I launch connexion ssh to use rsync command in terminal and I would like to shutdown my computer, but I need to let run the process rsync.\n\nI executed this command on a remote host.

These F\\-test are provided by the **lmerTest** package.\n* In general it is not good to *only* look at measures like AIC or p\\-values to decide which terms to include in the model, especially the fixed effects in this case. You should also see how substantive is the difference between the additive model `chickm3` and the interaction model `chickm4`. You could more easily assess this using an effects plots \\- see, e.g., the **effects** or **ggeffects** packages.\n* Indeed the effect that the intercept of the model does not correspond to the average value you have for `Time` equal to zero and `Diet` equal to the reference level is because you fit a line, and the estimate of the slope also affects the estimate of the intercept. You could mitigate this affect but fitting a nonlinear model for the `Time` variable using, e.g., splines.\n* Finally, regarding the convergence warning message, you could ignore it in this case because it is very close to the tolerance value."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a multi-level model analysis of the ChickWeight data in R, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding model selection and interpretation?\n\nA) The model with the lowest AIC should always be chosen, regardless of other considerations.\n\nB) Formal hypothesis testing using F-tests is irrelevant when comparing nested models in this context.\n\nC) The discrepancy between the model's intercept and the actual initial chick weight indicates a fundamentally flawed model that should be discarded.\n\nD) Model selection should involve a combination of AIC comparison, hypothesis testing, and assessment of substantive differences between models, potentially using effects plots.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because while AIC is useful, it shouldn't be the only criterion for model selection. \nB is wrong because F-tests are actually relevant and useful for comparing nested models. \nC is too extreme; the intercept discrepancy is a limitation of linear models but doesn't necessarily mean the model is fundamentally flawed. \nD is correct as it advocates for a more comprehensive approach to model selection, considering multiple factors including AIC, hypothesis testing, and substantive differences between models, which aligns with the best practices suggested in the documentation."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/09/28", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1129210", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/164161/"], "docs_id": 1129210, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a mini PC connected to my TV with Windows 10\\.

By setting \"If total quantity is 10\" as the condition, the system will only apply the discount when exactly 10 items are in the cart. However, the promotion is meant to give the 11th item free. The condition should be adjusted to trigger when the quantity is 11 or more, allowing for the free item to be included.

To fix this we of course we remove the origin and then take the quotient and we get projective space as required.\n\nSo given an action of some torus on affine space, how do we know which points to remove before we take the quotient to make sure we get a toric variety? \n\nMy first naive guess is to remove the points which are fixed under the action, but Im wary it may be more subtle than that, as I know GIT can get quite technical. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You want to read Section 2 of *[The homogenous ring of a toric variety](https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9210008)*, by David Cox. Nick Proudfoot has written an expository note, *[Geometric invariant theory and projective toric varieties](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0502366)* on the projective case, which you might find helpful as well."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the construction of toric varieties as quotients of affine n-space by the action of a torus, which of the following statements is correct regarding the process of removing \"bad points\"?\n\nA) All fixed points under the torus action must be removed before taking the quotient.\n\nB) Only the origin needs to be removed in all cases before taking the quotient.\n\nC) The points to be removed depend on the specific torus action and can be determined using Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT).\n\nD) No points need to be removed if the torus action is faithful.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The process of constructing toric varieties by taking quotients of affine n-space by torus actions is more subtle than simply removing fixed points or always removing the origin. As mentioned in the documentation, the correct approach involves using Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) to determine which points should be removed before taking the quotient. This is because the set of \"bad points\" can vary depending on the specific torus action.\n\nThe example of constructing projective space as a toric variety illustrates that removing the origin is necessary in that case, but this is not a universal rule for all toric variety constructions. The references to David Cox's paper \"The homogeneous ring of a toric variety\" and Nick Proudfoot's note on \"Geometric invariant theory and projective toric varieties\" suggest that the process is more complex and requires a deeper understanding of GIT.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the process or make incorrect generalizations. The correct approach (C) acknowledges the complexity and specificity of determining which points to remove based on the particular torus action being considered."}, "32": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/06/28", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/415190", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/252404/"], "docs_id": 415190, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to test the difference between treatments.

I believe this is because\nthe formula for denominator df does not permit 0 variances.\n\nComparing H vs. HS, H vs. S, and HS vs. S, with three 2\\-sample\nWelch t tests, I get P\\-values 0\\.006, 0\\.012, and 0\\.190, respectively.\n\n```\nt.test(h, hs)$p.val; t.test(h, s)$p.val;  t.test(hs,s)$p.val\n[1] 0.00567182\n[1] 0.01266049\n[1] 0.1898282\n\n```\n\nSo, taking the data to be valid, it seems that the last two groups\ndo not differ significantly, while the first differs significantly\nfrom the other two. P\\-values are small enough that it seems OK to\ntake the two significant differences at face value.\n\nFinally, I did an experiment artificially 'unrounding' the ties\nin the third group so that `oneway.test` will run.\n\n```\nh = c(60, 57.14, 42.86)\nhs = c(85.71, 88.89, 100)\ns1 = c(99.8, 99.9, 100.1, 100.2)  # 'unrounded'\nx = c(h, hs, s1)\ng = as.factor(c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3))\noneway.test(x ~ g)\n\n        One-way analysis of means (not assuming equal variances)\n\ndata:  x and g\nF = 32.514, num df = 2.0000, denom df = 2.6686, p-value = 0.01337\n\n```\n\nThis experiment seems (a) to clarify that the zero variance was your\nproblem running `oneway.test` on your original data, and (b) to\nconfirm that there are differences among the three groups, that would\njustify the *ad hoc* t tests shown earlier."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher conducted an experiment to compare three treatments (H, HS, and S) and collected data on a variable called WG.

In the case of rules with the same priority, they will be evaluated in the order they were added. If rules are mutually exclusive this isn't much of a risk (such as two rules that match on different source IPs from other hosts).

Why do we want to add or remove reactive power onto the transmission system?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main reason for reactive power compensation is to regulate the voltage magnitude. Note that the compensation might be both positive and negative (reactive power in, or reactive power out). In a transmission system, there is a strong correlation between reactive power and voltage magnitude, whereas the active power is mainly dependent on the voltage angle. Have a look [here for a bit more information](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/139649/comparison-between-ac-and-dc-power-flow-analyses/139880#139880).\n\nIn the transmission system, a branch might have impedance `Z = R + jX`, where the reactive `X` is about 10 times the purely resistive `R`.\n\nI'm assuming you're familiar with the per unit system. Let me know if you're not and I'll explain it closer. \n\nLet's just review a few basic relationships first:\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\nS \\= V \\\\cdot I^\\*\\\\\\\\\n\\=\\> I \\= (S/ V)^\\*\\\\\\\\\n\\\\Delta V \\= I^2\\\\cdot Z\\\\\\\\\nZ \\= (R \\+ jX)\n\\\\end{align\\*}\n\nLet's assume we have a very simple power system that looks like this:\n\n```\nG ---|------------------|------------------|----->\n     3   Z = R + jX     2   Z = R + jX     1   Load               \n\n```\n\n* G is the generator\n* The verticals lines are buses, labeled 1 \\- 3\n* The load is at the end of the radial.\n* The voltage at bus 1 is assumed to be 1pu with angle 0 degrees.\n* The load is (1 \\+ j0\\.2\\) pu. (If S\\_base \\= 100MVA, this would be equal to 100MW \\+ 20MVAr)\n* Z \\= 0\\.01 \\+ j0\\.1\n\nThe current necessary to supply the load is given by:\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\nI \\= (S/ V)^\\* \\=((1 \\+ j0\\.2\\) / 1\\)^\\* \\= 1 \\- j0\\.2\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align\\*}\n\n**No compesation:**\n\nThe voltage at bus 2 is give by the voltage at bus 1 plus the voltage rise over the cable (seen from 1 to 2\\):\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\nV\\_2 \\= V\\_1 \\+ I^2 \\\\cdot Z \\= (1\\-j0\\.2\\)\\\\cdot(0\\.01 \\+ j0\\.1\\)\n\\= 1\\.054\\\\angle 5\\.01 ^{\\\\circ}\\\\;\\\\text{pu}\n\\\\end{align\\*}\n\nThis means the power injection into the cable between 1 and 2 is:\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\nS\\_2 \\= V\\_2 \\\\cdot I^\\* \\= (1\\.031 \\+ j0\\.302\\) \\\\;\\\\text{pu}\n\\\\end{align\\*}\n\nThe voltage at V3 is:\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\nV\\_3 \\= V\\_2 \\+ I^2 \\\\cdot Z \\= 1\\.11\\\\angle 9\\.50^{\\\\circ}\\\\;\\\\text{pu}\n\\\\end{align\\*}\n\nNow we can find the power output from the generator by using the first equation:\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\nS\\_{Gen} \\= V\\_3 \\\\cdot I^\\* \\= (1\\.062 \\+ j0\\.404\\) \\\\;\\\\text{pu}\n\\\\end{align\\*}\n\n**With compensation:**\n\nLet us add a capacitor that injects 0\\.3pu reactive power at bus 2\\.\n\nThe voltage at bus 2 is still given by the voltage at bus 1 and the voltage rise over the cable, so it's still \\\\$\\\\underline{1\\.054 \\\\angle5\\.01^{\\\\circ}\\\\;\\\\text{pu}}\\\\$.\n\nNow, the reactive power injection of 0\\.3pu will give a current injection of:\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\nI\\_{inj} \\= (Q / V\\_2\\)^\\* \\= 0\\.285 \\\\angle{\\-85\\.0}^{\\\\circ}\\\\;\\\\text{pu}\n\\\\end{align\\*}\n\nThe current through cable 1\\-2 is equal to the current through cable 2\\-3 plus the current injection, so:\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\nI\\_3 \\= I\\_2 \\- I\\_{inj} \\= 0\\.979\\\\angle 4\\.90^{\\\\circ}\\\\;\\\\text{pu}\n\\\\end{align\\*}\n\nYou see that the current magnitude is lower than it was without compensation. So, let's have a look at the voltage at bus 3:\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\nV\\_3 \\= V\\_2 \\+ {I\\_3}^2 \\\\cdot Z \\= 1\\.06\\\\angle10\\.22^{\\\\circ}\\\\;\\\\text{pu}\n\\\\end{align\\*}\n\nNow we can find the power output from the generator by using the first equation:\n\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\nS\\_{Gen} \\= V\\_3 \\\\cdot I\\_3^\\* \\= (1\\.037 \\+ j0\\.096\\)\\\\;\\\\text{pu}\n\\\\end{align\\*}\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n```\n       W/O comp:   W comp:\n|V1|   1.000       1.000\n|V2|   1.054       1.054\n|V3|   1.115       1.060\n\n       W/O comp:         W comp:\nGen    1.062 + j0.404    1.033 + j0.096\n\n```\n\nAs you can see from the above results, the voltage is much more stable with compensation. The current gets lower through the cable resulting in lower active losses. \n\nThe reason why the reactive power is needed in the first place is because it accounts for the magnetization of the equipment. If there's no reactive power, transformers, generator rotors/stators, machines etc. have no magnetic field. With no magnetic field, there is no torque, no magnetic coupling in the transformer etc. So, a lot of equipment have to consume reactive power in order to work. If there's too little reactive power available the equipment will try to draw more current to compensate. This will lead to higher voltage drops, which in the end might cause voltage collapse. \n\nAs Andy points out, it can also be used as power factor correction for large industrial loads. However when we're talking about reactive power compensation it's most often because of what I've described above.\n\nIn a meshed grid it can also be used to control power flow. This works because the active power flow through a cable is mainly given by the voltage angle difference over it. If you inject reactive power, the voltage and currents angles will change, thus it will affect the power flow. If you inject the right amount at the right place you can redistribute the power flow the way you want (but only to a small extent).\n\nHope this answers your question!"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A power system engineer is analyzing a simple radial transmission system with a generator, two transmission lines (Z = 0.01 + j0.1 pu each), and a load of 1 + j0.2 pu at the end.

After adding reactive power compensation:\n\n1. The voltage magnitude at the load bus (bus 3) increases from 1.115 pu to 1.060 pu. Although this is a smaller absolute value, it's closer to the ideal 1.0 pu, indicating better voltage regulation.\n\n2. The generator's reactive power output decreases significantly from 0.404 pu to 0.096 pu.\n\nThis demonstrates that reactive power compensation helps stabilize voltage levels and reduces the reactive power burden on the generator.

Among the group theory problems that made\nmy initial list were:  \n\n**(1\\) Show that there is no finite group with more\nSylow subgroups than elements.**\n(This later evolved to: Let $G$ be a finite group.\nShow that the number of nontrivial Sylow subgroups of $G$\nis at most $\\\\frac{2}{3}\\|G\\|$.)\n\n**(2\\) Call a positive integer $c$\n*curious* if there is a nontrivial finite group\n$G$ such that, for every prime $p$ dividing $\\|G\\|$,\nthe number of Sylow $p$\\-subgroups is exactly $c$.\nFind all curious integers.**\n**(3\\) You are told that, for certain $n$ and $p$,\n$S\\_n$ has exactly $n$ Sylow $p$\\-subgroups.\nWhat are the possible pairs $(n, p)$?**\n**(4\\) Prove or disprove: There is no group $G$ of\nsquare\\-free order such that, for every prime $p$ dividing\n$\\|G\\|$, the number of Sylow $p$\\-subgroups is\n$p \\+ 1$.**\n**(5\\) Let $G$ be a finite group and let $S\\\\subseteq G$\nbe a subset. Show that if $S$ has nonempty intersection\nwith each conjugacy class of $G$, then the\nsubgroup generated by $S$ is $G$.**\n**(6\\) Show that if the conjugacy classes of $G$\nhave size at most $4$, then $G$ is solvable.**\nI ultimately used Problem (6\\) on the exam. My notes to myself\nsay about (6\\): *Here $4$ can be replaced by any number up to $19$,\nbut the statement becomes false for $20$ \\-\\-\\- $A\\_5$*.\n\n---\n\nI decided Problem (1\\) was too hard for \nfirst\\-year grad students,\nso I sent it to the problems section of the Monthly.\nMy solution to Problem (1\\) was similar to\nthe one by Richard Stong, which was published by the Monthly.\nIn particular, I also used Burnside's normal complement theorem\nand the estimate $\\\\sum\\_{p}\\\\frac{1}{p^{2}} \\< \\\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n---\n\nOnce the problem was type\\-set by the Monthly, I got a chance to\nproofread it. I sent my final OK to the Monthly\non May 10, 2015\\. Strangely, the problem appeared on\nthe Art of Problem Solving website the next day, worded in exactly\nthe same way. The day after that it appeared at MSE, worded exactly\nthe same way. It did not appear in print in the Monthly for\nanother 3 months.\n\n---\n\nOne last comment about this problem. When formulating the problem\nI asked myself: is it possible to show that there is an injective\nfunction $f:\\\\textrm{Syl}(G)\\\\to G$ such that $f(P)\\\\in P$ for all $P$?  \n\nI don't know the answer to this version of the question."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about Sylow subgroups is NOT correct according to the documentation?\n\nA) The number of nontrivial Sylow subgroups of a finite group G is at most 2/3 |G|.\n\nB) There exists a finite group with more Sylow subgroups than elements.\n\nC) The problem of bounding the number of Sylow subgroups appeared on the Art of Problem Solving website before being published in the Monthly.\n\nD) For any number up to 19, if the conjugacy classes of a finite group G have size at most that number, then G is solvable.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation clearly states that there is no finite group with more Sylow subgroups than elements. This directly contradicts statement B. \n\nStatement A is correct as it's explicitly mentioned in the documentation. \n\nStatement C is correct as the documentation notes that the problem appeared on the Art of Problem Solving website the day after the author proofread it for the Monthly, which was 3 months before it appeared in print. \n\nStatement D is correct as the documentation mentions that the statement about conjugacy classes and solvability holds for any number up to 19, but becomes false at 20."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/13", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/159534", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/48923/"], "docs_id": 159534, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I need to **set limit to the compared product**, for example: `max_limit 4`, But now it is adding Number of products to compare list.\nKindly suggest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can try with Plugin.

It checks if the current count exceeds the limit (LIMIT_TO_COMPARE_PRODUCTS). If so, it adds an error message and redirects the user. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original method execution. \n\nOption B incorrectly allows adding products when the count is less than or equal to the limit, which could potentially exceed the limit.\n\nOption C adds an error message but still proceeds with the original method, potentially allowing the product to be added even when the limit is exceeded.\n\nOption D incorrectly adds a success message when below the limit and redirects when at or above the limit, without providing any error message to the user."}, "43": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/05/24", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/638657", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/300360/"], "docs_id": 638657, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it possible to have a purely resistive RC circuit?\n\n> Recently came across a question: A 130\u03a9 resistor and a 40\u03bcF capacitor are connected in series to an AC source of frequency \u03c9.

This occurs as the frequency approaches infinity. At infinite frequency, the capacitor's impedance approaches zero, effectively short-circuiting it. The phase angle between voltage and current in a purely resistive circuit is 0\u00b0.\n\nOption A is incorrect because at any finite frequency, there will always be some capacitive reactance.\nOption B is incorrect for the same reason as A, and additionally, a 45\u00b0 phase angle would indicate equal resistive and reactive components, not a purely resistive circuit.\nOption D is incorrect because while infinite frequency is correct, a 90\u00b0 phase angle represents a purely reactive circuit, not a resistive one.\n\nC is correct because it accurately describes the conditions under which an RC circuit would be closest to purely resistive: at infinite frequency with a 0\u00b0 phase angle."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/01/09", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/18595", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/5410/"], "docs_id": 18595, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am working on a DEM that in an area where there is little relief. \n\nI would like to 'burn' the river network into the DEM so I can calculate flow accumulation and flow length accurately. \n\nI am using ArcGIS Desktop 10\\.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Convert](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/Polyline_to_Raster/001200000031000000/) your stream vectors to raster with a value of 1 and the same extent and cellsize as your DEM.

It also offers more control over the burning process through parameters like the decay coefficient (k) and the maximum lowering amount (H).

It allows you to \"look over the shoulder\" of someone and address issues, or you can use it to control your own systems. There are many flavors of VNC, from free to not free. And you can set the system up with high levels of flexibility. Definitely more of a power user system.\n\nRDP (or RDC) is Microsoft's built\\-in remote desktop system. I do remote access from my iPad frequently for sys admin stuff, and RDP works very well for this. You have to turn it on on the host computer, and a compatible version has to be installed on the client to be able to reach out and connect. It has fewer settings than VNC.\n\nFor either solution, you'll need some way to get onto the same network as your host computer, either using port forwarding on a router or a VPN connection.\n\nThere are also hosted remote access systems, such as LogMeIn (really good), but these usually require subscriptions and can get expensive.

The convention is that current flows from \\+ to \\-. We now know that, in fact, the mobile charges are electrons and flow from \\- to \\+ but the convention has endured and we all use \\+ to \\- flow but keep the reality in the back of our minds.\n\nAs is universal practice in maths, physics and general engineering, \\+ is higher than \\- so we refer to the positive terminal of a battery or power supply as having higher potential.

But I've used all packages as in the original file. \n\n```\n\\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}\n\\usepackage[left=4cm, right=3cm, top=3cm, bottom=3cm]{geometry}\n\\usepackage{german}\n\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} \n\\usepackage{amsmath,amsfonts,amssymb}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\usepackage{booktabs}\n\\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{1.5}\n\\usepackage{natbib}\n\\bibliographystyle{ecta}\n\\sloppy\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\cite{InternationalUnionforConservationofNature.2017}\n\\section{Literaturverzeichnis}\n\\bibliography{Literatur1.2}\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nThanks a lot for your help \\- I'am a totally newbee and therefore thankful for every advice. Even if it's a different approach to citing properly. \nMagdalena\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The `ecta` (Econometrica, right?) bibliography style doesn't recognize fields named `url`, `urldate`, and `series` for entries of type `@misc`. Moreover, for entries of type `@misc`, it doesn't process `editor` fields either. You need to change the name of the `url` field to `note`, and you need to change the `editor` field name to `author`. If you want the information contained in the `urldate` field to be shown in the formatted bib entry as well, be sure to make it part of the `note` field. And, copy the information in the `series` field (\"Issues Brief\") to the end of the `author` field.\n\nFor the `\\url` macro to work, you must load either the `url` package and/or the `hyperref` package. If you want the citation call\\-outs and any URL strings in the bibliography to be made into hyperlinks, you should definitely load the `hyperref` package. \n\nTwo additional comments. First, the `german` and `ngerman` packages are obsolete. *Don't load them.* Instead, load the `babel` package with the option `german` or `ngerman`; use the latter option if your document is supposed to adhere to post\\-1997 (1998?) spelling and hyphenation conventions. Second, don't manipulate the low\\-level `\\baselinestretch` parameter directly. Instead, load the `setspace` package and issue a suitable `\\setstretch` directive.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OMHGs.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OMHGs.png)\n\n```\n\\RequirePackage{filecontents} % just to make this answer self-contained\n\\begin{filecontents}{Literatur12.bib}\n@misc{InternationalUnionforConservationofNature.2017,\n  author = {{International Union for Conservation of Nature}},\n  year   = {2017},\n  title  = {Deforestation and Forest Degradation (Issues Brief)},\n  note   = {\\url{https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/deforestation-forest_degradation_issues_brief_final.pdf}, \n            zuletzt gepr\u00fcft am 07.07.2018},\n  urldate = {07.07.2018},\n  series = {Issues Brief}\n}\n\\end{filecontents}\n\n\\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}\n\\usepackage[left=4cm, right=3cm, vmargin=3cm]{geometry}\n\n%%\\usepackage{german} % 'german' package is obsolete\n\\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}\n\\addto\\extrasngerman{%\n  \\renewcommand{\\refname}{Literaturverzeichnis}}\n\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} \n\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\\usepackage{amsmath,amsfonts,amssymb}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\usepackage{booktabs}\n%%\\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{1.5}  % don't modify this low-level parameter directly\n\\usepackage{setspace} % instead, use the 'setspace' package\n\\setstretch{1.5}\n\n\\usepackage[round,authoryear]{natbib}\n\\bibliographystyle{ecta}\n\n\\usepackage[hyphens]{url} % 'hyphens' option allows line breaks after \"-\" characters\n\\usepackage[colorlinks,allcolors=blue]{hyperref} % optional\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\cite{InternationalUnionforConservationofNature.2017}\n%\\section{Literaturverzeichnis} % not necessary\n\\bibliography{Literatur12}\n\\end{document}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided LaTeX documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using the `ecta` bibliography style in LaTeX, which of the following modifications is necessary to properly display a URL for a `@misc` entry?\n\nA) Change the `url` field to `hyperlink`\nB) Add the `\\usepackage{url}` command to the preamble\nC) Change the `url` field to `note`\nD) Enclose the URL in `\\href{}` tags\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The `ecta` bibliography style doesn't recognize the `url` field for `@misc` entries. To properly display a URL, you need to change the name of the `url` field to `note`. This allows the URL information to be included in the formatted bibliography entry. \n\nOption A is incorrect because `hyperlink` is not a standard BibTeX field. \nOption B, while potentially useful for URL formatting, does not address the core issue of the `ecta` style not recognizing the `url` field. \nOption D is incorrect because `\\href{}` is used for creating hyperlinks in the document body, not in bibliography entries.\n\nThe correct approach, as shown in the documentation, is to change the `url` field to `note` and include the URL information there. Additionally, loading the `url` or `hyperref` package is recommended for proper URL formatting, but this is separate from the field naming issue."}}
