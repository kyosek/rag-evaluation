Btw, `cd` in PowerShell is an alias for `Set-Location` which you can verify with `Get-Command cd`. In conclusion you can pipe your result to `cd` or to `Set-Location` and get your desired solution in one line (prompt not stripped to see the result):\n\n```\nPS C:\\> Split-Path (Get-Command ping).Path | cd\nPS C:\\Windows\\system32>\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In PowerShell on Windows 10, you want to find the location of the 'nvm' command and navigate to its parent directory.

This is the range to ensure that the humidity does not damage one's health or one's furnishings, in either direction.\n\nMy hygrometer notified me that the indoor RH was only 20%. This is the lowest figure that the hygrometer is capable of outputting, so the actual RH could be even lower than that. (I have not found an inexpensive hygrometer that is capable of displaying RH levels below 20%.) Naturally, this reading spurred me to turn on the humidifier.\n\nI have an Aprilaire central humidifier next to my furnace. It is an old unit (around 25 years old), but it still functions. The humidifier control panel has a knob with a range of 15% to 45%. Because of the guideline mentioned in the first paragraph, I set the humidifier to the maximum setting of 45%. My thermostat is set to 72\u00b0 F.\n\nHere is info I just collected with the inexpensive hygrometer device (currently at 11 PM at night):\n\n* Current indoor temperature: 70\u00b0 F\n* Current indoor humidity: 51%\n\nHere is the current info from Weather.com:\n\n* Current outdoor temperature: 9\u00b0 F\n* Current outdoor humidity: 81%\n\nNow, on to the issue...\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/1PCfpUk.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/1PCfpUk.jpg)\n\nMost of my double\\-pane windows currently have significant condensation on them. The condensation is on the inside of the windows, not between the panes. Some windows are practically coated edge\\-to\\-edge in water droplets, requiring several paper towels to absorb it all. I wipe it off, and the condensation fully returns within an hour or two.\n\nGravity makes the condensation drip down the length of the window, which gets absorbed by the surrounding wooden window trim. This has resulted in trim that is pitch black in some areas, an indicator of dry rot, I assume. I touch the wood and I can feel that it is very wet.\n\nWanting to prevent dry rot from occurring and further destroying my trim, I tried to find a fix online. I found this [article](http://www.startribune.com/fixit-what-is-the-ideal-winter-indoor-humidity-level/11468916/) from *Star Tribune*, the largest newspaper in Minnesota. Excerpt:\n\n> The following list, supplied by the Minnesota Department of Public\n>  Service, is based on a double\\-glazed window and an indoor temperature\n>  of 70 degrees. You will notice that the lower the outdoor temperature,\n>  the lower the indoor humidity should be.\n> \n> \n> \u2022 If outside temperature is 20 to 40 degrees, humidity indoors should\n>  not be more than 40 percent.\n> \n> \n> \u2022 If outside temperature is 10 to 20 degrees, humidity indoors should\n>  not be more than 35 percent.\n> \n> \n> \u2022 If outside temperature is 0 to 10 degrees, humidity indoors should\n>  not be more than 30 percent.\n> \n> \n> \u2022 If outside temperature is 10\\-below to 0, humidity indoors should not\n>  be more than 25 percent.\n> \n> \n> \u2022 If outside temperature is 20\\-below to 10\\-below, humidity indoors\n>  should not be more than 20 percent.\n> \n> \n> \u2022 If outdoor temperature is lower than 20\\-below, inside humidity\n>  should not be more than 15 percent.\n\n(The article did not specify, but I assume that the \"outdoor temperature\" is the outdoor temperature without including the windchill factor.)\n\nHuh? I thought that an RH below 40% was too dry for one's body. But, according to the above prescription, based on the outdoor weather conditions, my current indoor RH should not exceed 30%. In some extreme cases, it should be as low as 15%.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Why does condensation form on the inside of my windows in the winter?\n2. Why does the amount of condensation seem to significantly increase at night? My thermostat and humidifier settings are constant.\n3. The recommended RH range for one's health or one's furnishings contradicts the recommended RH range to prevent condensation on windows. How do you choose which guideline to abide by? In an indoor environment with an RH of 30%, I would be breathing in dry air and drying out wood furnishings. Shouldn't one's health take precedence over the development of window condensation?\n4. Is there anything I can do to stop the formation of condensation on windows, besides decreasing the indoor RH level? (I suppose that I could periodically walk from window to window, wiping off the condensation with a towel, but I'd have to do this so regularly that it would nearly be a part\\-time job.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (1\\) Condensation forms on the inside of the cold windows in the winter because warm air in the house can hold more water vapor than cool air. Once warm air in contact with the cool window is cooled below the dew point, water falls out of the air and onto the surface of the glass. An ice cold drink left out on the counter sweats for exactly the same reason.\n\n(2\\) All else being equal, condensation forms on the inside of the windows more rapidly at night because the temperature of the indoor window surface is colder at night. The colder the windows are, the more water will fall out of the air onto the surface of the glass. If you want to know the exact temperature that condensation will start to form, it can be looked up on a psychrometric chart like this one:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2WNP8.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2WNP8.gif)\n\nFind the intersection of dry bulb temperature and relative humidity, then follow the dashed diagonal enthalpy line intersecting that point left and up to the edge of the curved area on the chart (the line marked \u201csaturation temp\u201d). That is the temperature at which your air will start to deposit condensate on surfaces. As you can see on the chart, cold air with a high RH carries less water in it than warm air with a moderate RH and cold air requires even colder surfaces before the remaining water vapor will condense.\n\n(3\\) Set the humidity in the house low enough that there is little condensation on the windows. Very low humidity (\\< 20% RH) can be hard on one\u2019s skin and one\u2019s wood furniture, but 30% RH is not that bad. When you witness large amounts of condensation on the windows there may also be condensation in cold locations concealed within the walls and roof, and that moisture can lead to water damage or mold growth. Water damage and mold growth are harder on one\u2019s health and pocket book than dry air.\n\n(4\\) (a) Check that the supply registers are not aimed directly at the windows. With a central humidifier running, the air from the registers can be much more humid than the room average. There will be less condensation on the windows if the registers are aimed to mix with room air before coming in direct contact with the glass. If the registers cannot be adjusted to mix supply air into the room without directly hitting the glass, then consider adding directional covers to the registers or replacing the registers. (b) Decrease the room temperature. At any given relative humidity, cool air carries less water than warm air, leading to less condensation on the glass."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner notices significant condensation on their windows during winter.

In winter, this would introduce very cold air from outside, potentially creating more condensation as the cold air meets the warm, humid indoor air. It would also make it harder to control indoor humidity and temperature, likely exacerbating the problem.\n\nThe correct answer is D because it would likely worsen the problem rather than solve it, unlike the other options which would all help reduce condensation to varying degrees."}, "11": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/21", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/29180394", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3795861/"], "docs_id": 29180394, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I find a numeric number in the same cell after character.

You have the key `2` twice. One of the two values is going to be lost instantly when the dict is created.\n\nOk, suppose all the keys are unique. You should never rely on order of items in a dict:\n\n> CPython implementation detail: Keys and values are listed in an arbitrary order which is non\\-random, varies across Python implementations, and depends on the dictionary\u2019s history of insertions and deletions.\n\n(from [the docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html%23mapping-types-dict))\n\nThat's why there is OrderedDict. What's the next best thing after OrderedDict? I guess this:\n\n```\n>>> d = {2:3, 1:89, 4:5, 2:0, 50: 5, 6: 6}\n\n>>> d  # lost \"2:3\" pair!\n{1: 89, 2: 0, 4: 5, 50: 5, 6: 6}\n\n>>> l = d.items()\n\n>>> l\n[(1, 89), (2, 0), (4, 5), (50, 5), (6, 6)]\n\n>>> l.sort()\n\n>>> l\n[(1, 89), (2, 0), (4, 5), (6, 6), (50, 5)]\n\n```\n\nThat's a list of key\\-value pairs. It is up to you to take care of fetching values from it, etc. What's important is to **never** do `dict(l)` because that might change the order of items. Even if it seems to work, don't do it! (To be fair: you can do it, just don't rely on order of items in the resulting dict. Or in any other dict for that matter, as stated in the quote above.)\n\nYou could implement this in a class, but then you'd be reinventing the OrderedDict class, and probably not as good.\n\n---\n\nOut of curiosity: why you can't use OrderedDict?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are working with a dictionary in Python and need to maintain the order of key-value pairs.

Especially if you consider the claims made in [this article](http://www.freekpaans.nl/2015/01/dependency-injection-are-you-doing-it-wrong/) to hold water, I think it's all quite clear and straight\\-forward.\n\nAnyway there is one quote about *Ports and Adapters* that made me think about the way that I structured my classes in the past \n\n> The components in the inner hexagon have few or no dependencies on each other, while components in the outer hexagon act as Adapters between the inner components, and the application boundaries: its ports.\n\nGiven I'd like to implement some app business logic, called `App` hereinafter (not a too meaningful name, anyway), which would allow us to display a list of filtered employees. Displaying a list of employees would provided by a port\n\n```\npublic interface IEmployeeListProvider\n{\n    EmployeeList GetEmployees();\n}\n\n```\n\nand persistence would be another port\n\n```\npublic interface IEmployeeRpository\n{\n    IEnumerable<Employee> GetAllEmployees();\n    void AddEmployee(Employee employeeToAdd);\n    void UpdateEmployee(Employee employeeToUpdate);\n    // further method signatures\n}\n\n```\n\nNow I would implement my business logic\n\n```\nclass App : IEmployeeListProvider\n{\n    // most likely the filters or filter conditions would be injected.\n    // and the IEmployeeRepository anyway\n\n    public EmployeeList GetEmployees()\n    {\n        var employees = employeeRepository.GetAllEmployees();\n        var filteredEmployees = FilterEmployees(employees);\n        return EmployeeList.FromEnumerable(filteredEmployees);\n    }\n\n    private IEnumerable<Employee> FilterEmployees(IEnumerable<IEmployee> employees)\n    {\n        // elided\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nBasically this is how I understood Ports and Adapters as [proposed by Alistair Cockburn](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture). Anyway, this implementation somehow contradicts the Mark Seeman quote (see above), since `App` depends bot on the `IEmployeeRepository` *and* the `IEmployeeListProvider` ports. Of course it would be possible to restructure the design to use a filter port\n\n```\npublic interface IEmployeeFilter\n{\n    IEnumerable<Employee> FilterEmployees(IEnumerable<Employee> employees);\n}\n\n```\n\nand do something like this from the UI\n\n```\nIEmployeeFilter filter = ...; // however this is constructed\nIEmployeeRepository repository = ...; \n\n// ...\n\nvar employees = filter.FilterEmployees(repository.GetAllEmployees());\n\n```\n\nbut this feels wrong to me for several reasons: \n\n* The UI would depend on a DAL port\n* We are potentially shifting logic to the UI code\n* It's quite likely that UI will become a *\"dependency hog\"*\n\nDid I get the whole quote of Mark Seeman wrong I is there any other part that I got fundamentally wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It doesn't contradict the statement. Conceptually, your business object, App, *provides* \"ports\" (the two interfaces) so that you can hook up other components on top. The two interfaces are *owned* by the App class. Yes, it depends on those interfaces, but it does *not* depend on the components that implement or use them \\- and that's exactly the point. IEmployeeRepository is a so called *required interface* (the App class requires that other components implement this interface in order to be able to work with the App class), and IEmployeeListProvider is a *provided interface* (provided by the App class, for other components to use). You should view the three types (App, IEmployeeRepository, IEmployeeListProvider) as a single thing (and you would put them in the same package). Then, the other components that implement or use these interfaces depend on them (and, by extension, on the whole triplet). \n\nThat's what (the first part of) the dependency inversion principle states: \"High\\-level modules should not depend on low\\-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\" Here, your high\\-level module is the App class, and one of the low\\-level modules would be, say, the repository. The abstraction they both depend on is the IEmployeeRepository interface, but the key thing is that this interface is owned by the App class, *not* by the implementation of the repository. So to determine the direction of the dependency, you look at the direction of the arrow between the implementation of the repository, and the App \\+ IEmployeeRepository pair."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of Ports and Adapters architecture, which of the following statements is correct regarding the relationship between the App class, IEmployeeRepository interface, and IEmployeeListProvider interface?\n\nA) The App class should not depend on both IEmployeeRepository and IEmployeeListProvider interfaces to strictly adhere to the Ports and Adapters pattern.\n\nB) The App class, IEmployeeRepository, and IEmployeeListProvider should be considered as separate, independent components in the architecture.\n\nC) The App class, IEmployeeRepository, and IEmployeeListProvider form a cohesive unit, with the interfaces being owned by the App class and serving as ports for external components.\n\nD) The IEmployeeRepository interface should be owned by the repository implementation, not the App class, to maintain proper separation of concerns.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because in the Ports and Adapters architecture, the App class and its interfaces (IEmployeeRepository and IEmployeeListProvider) should be viewed as a single cohesive unit. The interfaces act as ports owned by the App class, allowing external components to interact with it. This arrangement adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle, where high-level modules (App) and low-level modules (repository implementation) both depend on abstractions (interfaces). The interfaces being owned by the App class is key to maintaining the correct dependency direction in the architecture."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/10/29", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/470676", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/322165/"], "docs_id": 470676, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am looking for a word describing the action of taking written lyrics (say, a poem) and composing a tune to fit.\ne.g.\n\n> The album is based on Emily Dickinson poems\n\nBut \"based on\" sounds odd to me (I'm not a native English speaker)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The expression you are looking for is ***[set something to music:](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/it/dizionario/italiano-inglese/mettere-in-musica)***\n\n\u200b\n\n> to write or provide music for a poem, story, or other words so that it can be performed:\n> \n> \n> * The poem was set to music in 1888\\.\n\n(Cambridge Dictionary)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A composer has taken a collection of Emily Dickinson's poems and created melodies to accompany them for a new album.

Even when the battery is discharged it can still have upwards of 9 volts. The fact is though that 95% of batteries are never fully discharged when they need a jump start.\n\nSo, back you your conversation with Jane: I suppose you could have said, \"I'm sorry we got cut off, my battery was completely discharged,\" or, \"my battery ran out of energy,\" but in my experience, most people **don't** say it that way.

To do this, I want to estimate the savings we realized by using an open source web application rather than building it from scratch or buying a COTS solution. One step in the process is to estimate how much it would have cost us to develop the application ourselves. Unfortunately, I'm at a loss for a really simple way to do this without going through a full estimation process. \n\nSince I have the source code, I would think there should be some heuristic that could give me a very rough estimate of developer hours needed to write it. Unfortunately, my web searches on the topic mostly turn up articles and opinions on how lines of code are not a good indicator of productivity or quality.\n\nMy best solution so far is to pick a number of lines a developer could write in a day and work out the number of developer hours from there. If I go with that method, I would like to have some (preferably research based) evidence to back up my claim of developer productivity.\n\nThe one thing I have going for me is that to generate my final metric, all I really need is a lower bound on the developer hours or cost of the project.

Say the tunes will be just as loud in my ears, and if I'm understanding this correctly we could measure the decibel and record the sounds and they would be equal as well (if we ignore the fact that certain wavelengths travel better through air than others). But a person standing a further 100m away would only hear the loudest speaker (now 200m away), and not the low volume one (101m away). The dB and the sounds wouldn't be identical anymore.To me this doesn't make sense as sound is just air, and I would believe equally loud sounds at one place would fade equally with the same distance added.\n\nSo my question, why am I wrong (why isn't it like this in reality)?\n\nPlease forgive me for my explanatory problems as English is not my native language.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can understand it in the following way, where the key is that at different positions the energies of the sound are different.\n\nSuppose a speaker generates sound wave with energy $A$ at its own position, by energy conservation, at distance $R$, the energy one receives per unit area is\n\n\\\\begin{equation}\nA/(4\\\\pi R^2\\)\n\\\\end{equation}\n\nHere I assume the space is isotropic in all directions.\n\nNow with the two speakers, suppose the louder speaker generates sound wave with energy $A\\_1$ while the quieter speaker generates sound wave with energy $A\\_2$. Here both $A\\_1$ and $A\\_2$ are the energies generated at the positions of the two speakers, respectively. Again, by energy conservation and assuming the space is isotropic, we have\n\n\\\\begin{split}\nA\\_1/(4\\\\pi R\\_1^2\\)\\=A\\_2/(4\\\\pi R\\_2^2\\)\n\\\\end{split}\nbecause these two speakers sound the same loud. When $R\\_1\\=100R\\_2$, we have \n\n\\\\begin{split}\nA\\_1/A\\_2\\=10000\n\\\\end{split}\n\nNow for an observer who stands at a position which is $200{\\\\rm m}$ from the loud speaker and $101{\\\\rm m}\\\\approx100{\\\\rm m}$, the energy produced by the loud speaker is\n\\\\begin{equation}\nA\\_1/(4\\\\pi\\\\times (200{\\\\rm m})^2\\)\n\\\\end{equation}\nand that produced by the quieter speaker is approximately\n\\\\begin{equation}\nA\\_2/(4\\\\pi\\\\times (100{\\\\rm m})^2\\)\n\\\\end{equation}\n\nBecause $A\\_1/A\\_2\\=10000$, this time \n\n\\\\begin{equation}\n\\\\frac{A\\_1/(4\\\\pi\\\\times (200{\\\\rm m})^2\\)}{A\\_2/(4\\\\pi\\\\times (100{\\\\rm m})^2\\)}\\=2500\n\\\\end{equation}\nwhich means the energy from the louder speaker at this position is much larger than that from the quieter speaker, that is why that person can only hear the louder speaker."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Two speakers are placed at different distances from an observer.

Let's say A\u2081 = E (the energy of Speaker A).\n\nSubstituting these values:\n\nE/(4\u03c0(100)\u00b2) = A\u2082/(4\u03c0(1)\u00b2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nE/10000 = A\u2082\n\nTherefore, A\u2082 = E/10000, which corresponds to option B.\n\nThis explains why the more distant speaker needs to produce much more initial energy to be perceived as equally loud as the closer speaker at the observer's position."}, "30": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/10/24", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/340584", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/307579/"], "docs_id": 340584, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: First\\-timer here.\n\nI have been experiencing several serious\\-looking problems with my MacBook (OSX Yosemite 10\\.10\\.5, model MacBookPro10,1: Mid 2012 Retina, 16GB RAM, 768GB SSD) for a while now, the major of them being *unable to restart, shutdown or log out normally*. What happens is, after quitting every app, the system is left idling at the empty desktop \u2014 no icons, no menu bar, just the wallpaper. The mouse pointer is movable, Dock and Spotlight are still operating, but Finder is \u00abNot Responding\u00bb and unable to relaunch in any way. So all I'm left with is a hard Power button reset or `sudo shutdown -h now` (another workaround is to click Restart with admin rights on the login window, I presume it's the same as the terminal command).\n\nThis problem is accompanied (and may or may not be caused) by many others:\n\n* Certain apps may refuse to quit against all measures as well, thereby hanging out in the Dock and halting the shutdown\n* Quick Preview (handy `Spacebar` thing) is showing nothing but empty white rectangles\n* Preview itself opening all files as empty windows or practicing other weird behaviours like not showing the pixel selection frame\n* Finder throwing up a self\\-conscious *\u00abThe application \u201cFinder.app\u201d is not open anymore\u00bb* in response to launching apps or opening windows through Spotlight (even though `\u2318-Enter` to show file location still works)\n* Folders appear to be empty until Finder is relaunched (manually or by itself)\n* Unable to launch some apps, notably Photos\n* Minor rare cases of graphics corruptions, like garbled windows in Mission Control\n\nAll of these get fixed by a Mac restart, but keep steadily accumulating again. It's like the more time elapses after a restart, the more ruined and deteriorated the system becomes.\n\nWhat I tried:\n\n* Resetting NVRAM\n* Resetting the SMC\n* Performing an extended Apple Hardware Test (no issues were found)\n* Verifying hard drive and repairing disk permissions\n* Booting in Safe Mode (where everything gets super slow; the problem persists)\n\nFor a positive note, this whole situation has taught me to do frequent Time Machine backups, but I would like to leave OS reinstallation as a last resort. (My drive is partitioned into two, with Windows 7 installed through Boot Camp, if that has significance.) I know that Yosemite is quite old, but I'm honestly scared of upgrading lest it becomes worse (performance loss, new glitches, feel free to reassure me).\n\nSo, could anyone provide tips on what the root of this problem may be and how to fix it? Logs I should check, tests I can do, files to wipe or redact? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you, and safe travels!\n\n---\n\n**Update 1**:  \n\nI have tried booting into Safe Mode once again, acting out some generic work and having a look at the Activity Monitor. Here is what it looks like:\n\n[![Activity Monitor within Safe Mode](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kdk4A.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kdk4A.png)\n\nInterestingly, the computer seems to shut down properly from Safe Mode. Once again though, some window animations are extremely slow to render here, producing beautiful scrolling lines.\n\nThen, I booted normally and did roughly the same manipulations. The Monitor from here:\n\n[![Activity Monitor within normal boot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/E7B7Q.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/E7B7Q.png)\n\nI also tried shutting down in normal mode *immediately* after landing on the desktop after a restart, which *works*. So one can assume there is a software gimmick that is causing this problem shortly after startup.\n\n**Update 2**:  \n\nI created a new Standard (non\\-Admin) account as was suggested, and I think that helped to uncover the exact criminal in disguise \u2014 **Finder**. It seems like everything works nicely (while launching and switching apps), until the first Finder window is open (any folder), which somehow makes Finder unresponsive on shutdown, thereby freezing the latter. This happens on both user accounts. Interestingly, switching to another user and doing a \u00abproper\u00bb shutdown (from Apple menu) before using Finder is working (although I guess the \u00abblocked\u00bb user's session is still halted abruptly and incorrectly then).\n\nNow, the **question is**: *what exactly is wrong with Finder*, and how can I help the little guy?\n\n**Update 3**:  \n\nAs suggested, I tried moving Finder cache and preference files to desktop through the Terminal while logged in as a different user, but this doesn't seem to affect the problem.\n\nI could find no crash logs for Finder apart from some short diagnostic reports, and noticed nothing unusual displayed by the Console while the faulty shutdown is in process, but here is an example of some fishy Finder\\-related events which may be happening during uptime:\n\n[![Fishy Finder-related messages in Console](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nORgO.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nORgO.png)\n\n(I do not know how significant these are; the Console spits out things like that from various processes regularly).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here's what I would try:\n\n1. Login as your 'other' user.\n2. Launch Terminal.app\n3. Type `login shortname` (where `shortname` is the username that is having problems with Finder) and enter your password when prompted. (Then type `whoami` to verify you are logged in the correct account.)\n4. Run these commands:\n\n```\nmv -v ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.finder/ ~/Desktop/\n\nmv -v ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist ~/Desktop/\n\n```\n5. Log out as your 'other' user.\n6.

This is because cubic surfaces are embedded by the anticanonical divisor, which is already defined over $k$.\n\nThis latter argument does not work however for cubic threefolds, as for a cubic threefold, the hyperplane section is half the anticanonical divisor.

The variance of s^2 is approximated by (2\u03c3^4)/(n-1), where \u03c3^2 is estimated by s^2. \n   Var(s^2) \u2248 (2 * (5^2)^2) / (100-1) = 2500 / 99 \u2248 25.25 units^4 \u2248 25 units^4\n\n2. The standard error of s can be estimated by sqrt(Var(s^2)) / (2s).\n   SE(s) \u2248 sqrt(25) / (2*5) = 5 / 10 = 0.5 units\n\n   However, a more accurate approximation is:\n   SE(s) \u2248 s / sqrt(2(n-1)) = 5 / sqrt(2*99) \u2248 0.35 units\n\nOption B provides the closest approximations to these calculated values."}, "38": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/19", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/139515", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/17229/"], "docs_id": 139515, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like typeset equation on the figure below.![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jlsva.jpg)\n\nI have problem with subsript text 1, 2, 3 and 4 under integrals.

The `\\limitint` command (defined as `\\newcommand{\\limitint}{\\mathop{\\int}}`) ensures that the integral sign behaves like a math operator with limits, allowing for proper placement of the subscripts.

Assuming that IIS7 on my server is hosting mydomain.net, I wanted to map `http://mydomain.net/music/subsonic/<xxx>` to `http://localhost:8080/<xxx>`\n\nIf you setup the subdomains in IIS, you can then use rewrite rules that are based on regular expressions at the server level to catch requests to, e.g. map app1\\.domain.com to would open 127\\.0\\.0\\.1:8000/app1"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is setting up a Windows Server 2008 R2 with IIS and DNS services to host multiple web applications developed using web2py.

Which of the following approaches would be the most efficient way to achieve this goal?\n\nA) Configure DNS to map subdomains directly to 127.0.0.1:8000/[app_name]\nB) Use IIS URL Rewrite module to map subdomains to the corresponding local addresses and ports\nC) Modify the web2py server to listen on multiple subdomains\nD) Set up separate IIS websites for each application and configure them to proxy requests to 127.0.0.1:8000/[app_name]\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most efficient approach is to use the IIS URL Rewrite module. This solution allows the administrator to:\n\n1. Set up subdomains in IIS\n2. Use rewrite rules based on regular expressions at the server level\n3. Map requests like app1.domain.com to 127.0.0.1:8000/app1\n\nThis method doesn't require modifying the web2py server or setting up multiple IIS websites.

This means that light from distant galaxies has traveled through space that has been continuously expanding since the light was emitted. \n\nThe analogy in the original answer helps illustrate this: imagine pieces flying from an explosion (like galaxies moving apart), with one piece emitting light later.

I want to create a many\\-to\\-many mapping between the fields of schema A and schema B, where schema B uses a subset of the fields from schema A. The ETL is complex and has lots of transformations where information is stored in variables and then transformed in various ways before being output to schema B. Things I have attempted so far:\n\n* Take a piece of data that consists of entirely populated set of schema A with values as \"flags\", run it through the ETL, and analyze the output of schema B for those flags to match. This doesn't take into account transformations of the values, fails on some input constraints and you cannot attach such \"flags\" to the values of boolean or enum fields.\n* Build a Scala compiler plugin that analyzes the AST for usage of types in Schema A and where they go to be inserted into Schema B. This gets me most of the way there, but the approach ends up introducing ambiguities and complexity such as where variables are stored in common functions and re\\-used in different locations and scope in the ETL code.\n* Doing something similar as previous, but in runtime with AspectJ.

It sounds like you've been stuck with an ETL project that was written by one, or very few, people who are hard to get access to, and it's now your job to sort it out and take it over.\n\nThe 100% best thing you can do is get access to as many people as you can who had something to do with this project, and fit as much of their time into your discovery period as possible. If you can speak to one of the developers that is the best\\-case scenario.\n\nI can't see why you would expect much success with tinkering with the inputs and running the ETL process like a \"black box.\" Just a few fundamental differences between the two schemas would cause lots of little quirks that would be very difficult to sort out. For the long run you would have much better insight into the execution by studying the structure of the project, its comments, object naming, etc. \n\nSurely you need to study the domain in question first on either the source or destination system, regardless of their schemas. Ask questions to stakeholders that use the systems on either end to get an idea what the source and destination schemas are trying to model. Then compare the table names and try to sort out differences in the models assumptions, using the ETL project along the way to enrich your reasoning.\n\nIn summary, you do not want to come at this as a reverse\\-engineering problem with tracing tools and watching the results of inputs and outputs. You want to come at it as a business problem and involve the stakeholders, to get a good idea of the big picture."}, "answer": "Question: You are tasked with understanding and documenting a complex ETL pipeline that transforms data from protobuf schema A to protobuf schema B.

This approach allows you to grasp the big picture, understand the reasoning behind the transformations, and potentially uncover important details that might be missed by purely technical methods. \n\nOptions A, B, and C focus on technical solutions that, while potentially useful in some contexts, have limitations and may introduce ambiguities or miss important aspects of the transformations.
