My guess is that your disk (or some other disk\\-related component, like a cable or your motherboard's disk controller circuitry) was on its last legs, and the \"exercise\" involved in installing Ubuntu caused it to fail. You don't say what prompted you to install Ubuntu, but if you were having problems with Windows reliability, it's possible that this was an earlier symptom of the problem.\n\nYou might try unplugging your disk (from both ends of the cable if it's a desktop system) and plugging it back in again. You could also try running a [SMART test](https://askubuntu.com/questions/528072/how-can-i-check-the-smart-status-of-a-drive-on-ubuntu-14-04) from an Ubuntu live CD \\-\\- but if the disk isn't detected by your firmware, it might not even show up in Ubuntu, which would make such a test impossible.\n\nIf you've got a spare disk, you could try using it instead. If it works, then you can pretty much conclude that your old disk is dead. If the replacement disk fails, too, then chances are the problem is with your computer motherboard's circuitry."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user is experiencing issues booting Ubuntu from a USB drive after installing Windows 10 on a system that previously had a dual boot of Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04.

The answer suggests that I/O errors, which are often associated with hardware failure, may be the root cause. The fact that the user recently made significant changes to the system (installing Windows 10 and attempting to boot Ubuntu) may have pushed failing hardware to its limit.

I am looking for similar functionality for QEMU.\n\nThe documentation suggests to expose a Samba server running somewhere in the network, or use the `-net user,smb=/path/to/folder` to start a samba server.\n\nI had no luck with the `-net user,smb` option of QEMU. All it does is starting `smbd` (which conflicts with another service running locally due to a port conflict). Suffice to say, this is unusable, especially with multiple guests in mind. (For Linux, `-virtfs` (Plan 9\\) can be used for easy folder sharing.)\n\nOther problems with Samba is that it is not limited to folder sharing, it also does printer sharing, user mapping and whatsnot. All I need is to share one (or more?) folders with the Windows guest.\n\nDoes there exist an alternative folder sharing method for QEMU that works with a Windows guest?\n\nOr is there a way to configure Samba to restrict itself to a very limited set of features and integrate it into QEMU? It should:\n\n* Not everyone in the network should be able to access the folder.\n* local users included (if feasible).\n* Not provide other functionality (printer sharing).\n* Use case: expose a git directory to Windows, compile it in Windows and use Linux for analysis.\n* Have an acceptable speed, Windows uses virtio\\-scsi and virtio\\-net.\n* Be able to share a folder from a Linux host with a Windows 7 guest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: QEMU's built\\-in Samba service\n==============================\n\nThe not\\-functioning `-net user,smb` option was caused by an incompatibility with newer Samba versions (\\>\\= 4\\). This is fixed in QEMU v2\\.2\\.0 and newer with these changes:\n\n* [b87b8a8 slirp/smb: Move ncalrpc directory to tmp](http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=b87b8a8) (since v2\\.1\\.0\\)\n* [44d8d2b net/slirp: specify logbase for smbd](http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=44d8d2b) (since v2\\.2\\.0\\)\n* [7912d04 slirp/smbd: modify/set several parameters in generated smbd.conf](http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=7912d04) (since v2\\.2\\.0, disables printer too)\n\n(Debian has backported the latter two patches to 2\\.1\\+dfsg\\-6 which is present in Jessie.)\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nYou can export one folder as `\\\\10.0.2.4\\qemu` when using User networking:\n\n```\nqemu-system-x86_64 \\\n    -net user,smb=/absolute/path/to/folder \\\n    -net nic,model=virtio \\\n    ...\n\n```\n\nWhen QEMU is successfully started with these options, a new `/tmp/qemu-smb.*-*/` directory will be created containing a `smb.conf`. If you are fast enough, then this file could be modified to make paths read\\-only or export more folders.\n\nMode of operation\n-----------------\n\nThe samba daemon is executed whenever ports 139 or 445 get accessed over a \"user\" network. Communication happens via standard input/output/error of the smbd process. This is the reason why newer daemons failed, it would write its error message to the pipe instead of protocol messages.\n\nDue to this method of operation, the daemon will not listen on host ports, and therefore will only be accessible to the guest. So other clients in the network and even local users cannot gain access to folders using this daemon.\n\nSince QEMU v2\\.2\\.0 printer sharing is completely disabled through the samba configuration, so another worry is gone here.\n\nThe speed depends on the network adapter, so it is recommended to use the [virtio `netkvm` driver](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/WindowsGuestDrivers/Download_Drivers) under Windows.\n\nAlso note that the daemon is executed by its absolute path (typically `/usr/sbin/smbd`) as specified at compile time (using the `--smbd` option). Whenever you need to try a new binary or interpose `smbd`, you will need to modify the file at that path.\n\nOther caveats\n-------------\n\nExecutables (`*.exe`) must be executable on the host (`chmod +x FILE`) for the guest to have execute permissions.

It could be that some fiddler in the West compared the heaviest of violin strings, the G string, to the length of sinew or gut the Indians tied around their waists to hold up their breechclouts. But even the heavies of violin strings wouldn't really do the job. Perhaps the g i is just a euphemistic shortening of \"groin,\" an indecent word at the time. The burlesque G\\-string is of course far smaller than the Indian variety and must have seemed even skimpier a century ago, considering the Brunhildean builds of yesterday's ecdysiasts. One burlesque company of the day proudly advertised \"two tons of women\" and had only 20 strippers.\n\nSo your question about the origin of *G\\-string* might actually be separated into three distinct questions: (1\\) why did U.S. settlers on the Great Plains in the 1870s call the rawhide band used to hold a Native American's loincloth in place a \"geestring\"? (2\\) why did U.S. dance\\-art enthusiasts call the genital covering used by striptease artists a *G\\-string*? (3\\) what connection is there between the nineteenth\\-century \"gee string\" and the 1930s\u2013present \"G\\-string\"?\n\nI will run some database searches into those questions and add to this answer if I find anything interesting.\n\n---\n\n***On the transition from 'geestring' to G\\-string'***\n\nWith regard to the question of the connection between *geestring* and *G\\-string*, it is noteworthy that *G string* appears as early as 1881 as spelling variant for *geestring*. From \"[Society Report](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84021913/1881-07-16/ed-1/seq-2/#words=%22a+G+string%22+%22a+g+string%22+%22a+g+string%22),\" in the *\\[Globe City] Arizona Silver Belt* (July 16, 1881\\):\n\n> Mrs. Natch\\-il\\-a\\-tilly was magnificently attired with a **g string** around her waist with some suggestions of faded magnificence suspended therefrom.\n\nAs for the transition between *geestring* as a breechclout and **G\\-string** as striptease accoutrement, a newspaper instance of \"gee string\" from 1921 may provide a missing link. From \"[Fringe Sewed on Beach Queens Who Lack Conscience](https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=CJ19210820.2.8&txq=%2522gee+string%2522),\" in the *\\[Coronado, California] Strand* (August 20, 1921\\):\n\n> Chicago.\u2014Censors at the bathing beaches in Chicago, just now densely populated with gay crowds have solved the problem of dealing with girls who are a trifle shy on clothes.

The women police go armed with a needle and thread and when a girl is discovered tastily clad in a **gee string** and a light sprinkling of tan, the coppess takes her to one side and sews on fringe.\n\nAn Elephind search also yields three matches for the odd expression \"bust a G string\"(one each from Australia, California, and Virginia) and two for \"broke a G string\" (from Colorado and Illinois)\u2014all between 1907 and 1937\\.

We currently use SVN and we're slowly porting over to Git, after everyone gets their training.\n\nCurrently our clients are the ones who \"pull the trigger\" on branch integration. Meaning that some module or feature is built and then, that feature sits in a branch until the client asks that it go live. When it goes live, we merge the branch into a staging environment and do testing. Then once the testing confirms everything is working as it should, we then merge those changes into the trunk for the live push.\n\nIt's done this way because often we have a lot of parallel development and often requirements are always changing on the fly. So, to isolate and control what goes where, we put each module or feature in its own branch.\n\nFor a long time we've been having issues for managing branches. So, for example we might build a branch with feature A. Six months will go by and finally the client or the development manager will want to move that change ahead, **if either of them remembers**. This is where my problem is. **What are some ways I can keep track of what branches have been merged? or not merged? A centralized way of keeping an eye on all these changes.**\n\nThis can be a challenge to manage, because often as a lead at my company, I'm required to do project management, code, code review, integration on several platforms. The leads here are not silo'd, we're required to be part of all development everywhere. So often, at any point I'll have up to 7\\-10 different items on my ToDo list, and integration and branch management can slip through the cracks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you have a lot of parallel development consider using a Master branch and feature toggles.\n\nIt does require some extra discipline to ensure that the build works (even if the feature toggled code is incomplete) and to create, use, and then later cleanup the feature toggles. This can be offset somewhat by having static analysis tools and automated tests to both prove functionality works, but also to ensure its unavailability when toggled off.\n\nThe benefits though are that merging is a non\\-issue, because there are very few branches and those that do exist are merged quickly. Additionally this removes much of the branch management too. It also decouples deployments from feature releases. This can be a very nice sell to your clients/marketing department assuring them of both stability, and usability enhancements as new features can be disabled if they have unforeseen issues.\n\nIf you have a risk adverse environment or need to support several release lines, use the branching mechanism to spin off a release branch. This branch can have incomplete, or non\\-releasable features removed from it. This is fine as the branch will never be merged back into the main branch. Defect fixes can be engineered on the mainline and cheery picked across to the release branch."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small company with 6 developers is transitioning from SVN to Git and facing challenges with branch management. Which of the following approaches would best address their issues of tracking merged and unmerged branches while allowing for parallel development and changing requirements?\n\nA) Implement a strict branching policy where each feature must be merged within 30 days of creation\nB) Use a Master branch with feature toggles, allowing all code to be in one branch but features to be turned on/off as needed\nC) Create a separate tracking system outside of version control to manually log all branch statuses\nD) Assign a dedicated branch manager to oversee all branch creation and merging activities\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Using a Master branch with feature toggles addresses several issues mentioned in the scenario:\n\n1. It eliminates the need to track multiple long-lived branches, as most code is in one branch.\n2. It allows for parallel development without complex merging issues.\n3. It decouples deployments from feature releases, giving more control over what goes live.\n4.

That said, if the Y variables are bimodal, you may want to think about quantile regression. I wrote about [how to do this in `SAS`](http://www.nesug.org/Proceedings/nesug11/sa/sa04.pdf) but that paper also shows some basic points not specific to `SAS`. Since evidently you use `R` you can look into the `quantreg` package. \n\nI suggest quantile regression because, if Y is bimodal, it seems likely to me that different things may be related to changes in Y at or near the different modes. \n\nI am not sure what your last sentence refers to."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In analyzing pre- and post-test survey data with a 5-point Likert scale, where the outcome variable shows a bimodal distribution, which statistical approach is recommended and why?\n\nA) ANOVA, because it's commonly used for comparing means between groups\nB) Pearson correlation, to measure the strength of the relationship between pre- and post-test scores\nC) Quantile regression, as it can handle bimodal distributions and examine effects at different points of the outcome distribution\nD) Chi-square test, since we're dealing with categorical Likert scale data\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Quantile regression is the most appropriate method in this scenario for several reasons:\n\n1. It can handle bimodal distributions, which is explicitly mentioned as a characteristic of the data in this case.\n2. It allows for examination of effects at different points of the outcome distribution, which is particularly useful when the relationship between variables may differ at different levels of the outcome.\n3. It doesn't make assumptions about the distribution of the dependent variable, only about the distribution of the error.\n4. The documentation specifically recommends quantile regression for cases where the Y variable is bimodal.\n\nANOVA (A) is not ideal because it assumes a normal distribution and homogeneity of variances, which may not hold for bimodal data. Pearson correlation (B) assumes a linear relationship and is not suitable for capturing the complexities of a bimodal distribution. The Chi-square test (D), while appropriate for categorical data, doesn't account for the ordinal nature of Likert scales or the bimodal distribution, and wouldn't provide insights into changes at different points of the distribution."}, "38": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/04", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/194332", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/108943/"], "docs_id": 194332, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Mount has the option `offset` to specify that a file system does not start at the beginning of a device but some specific amount of bytes after.\nHow can I use `resize2fs`, which does not have that option, to resize such a file system which does not start at the device's beginning?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The `offset` option of `mount` does not get passed to mount directly, but to `losetup` which sets up a loop device which refers to the offsetted location of the underlaying block device.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the selection of an appropriate step-down module?\n\nA) The switching frequency of 300KHz is too low for efficient LED driving and should be at least 1MHz.\n\nB) Non-synchronous rectification is ideal for LED applications and will result in the most efficient power conversion.\n\nC) The input voltage of the step-down module should be rated for at least 35-36V to provide a safety margin.\n\nD) As long as the output current is adjustable up to 5A, any step-down module will be suitable for this application.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As mentioned in the documentation, it's important to have a margin between the maximum input voltage of the step-down module and the actual input voltage being supplied. In this case, the power supply outputs 32V, which is the same as the maximum input voltage of the given module. To ensure longevity and reliability, it's recommended to choose a module rated for a higher input voltage, such as 35-36V or more. This provides a safety margin in case the primary power supply experiences voltage fluctuations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while switching frequency is important, 300KHz is not necessarily too low for LED driving. The statement about 1MHz is arbitrary and not supported by the given information.\n\nOption B is incorrect because non-synchronous rectification is not necessarily ideal for LED applications. In fact, synchronous rectification often provides better efficiency, especially at lower voltages.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while having an adjustable output current up to 5A is beneficial, it's not the only criteria for selecting a suitable step-down module.

Below is guidance to make coins as fast as possible (which can in turn fund treats for dragon leveling and decorations and other purchases for XP). If your goals are achievments, unique dragon collecting, park beauty, etc then of course take this guidance with a grain of salt. The spreadsheet I compiled to crunch all of this is epic in proportion, so if you've got some other nuanced question you want to know the answer to.. by all means ask.\n\nFire Habitats Good \\- Earth Habitats Bad\n----------------------------------------\n\nUp through level 8, Small Fire habitats with 2 Flower Dragons are the most economical provided you check your park around 4 times a day (which you'll be wanting to do to breed, hatch, and feed). At level 8 you unlock the even more attractive Large Fire habitat, which becomes the best habitat (full with Flower Dragons) if you are checking your park more than twice a day. For below math I assumed checks are spaced evenly throughout the day, and dragon are level 6 (see more on that below).\n\n### Before level 8:\n\n| Habitat | Dragon | Checks/day | Coins |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Small Fire | 2x Lv 6 Flower Dragons (2hr breed\\+incubate) | 4 | 30,000 |\n| Small Earth | 1x Lv 6 Moss Dragon (24hr breed\\+incubate) | 4 | 31,680\\*\\* |\n| Large Plant | 4x Lv 6 Plant Dragons (30s breed\\+incubate) | 4 | 2,000 |\n\n\\*\\* considered disadvantaged due to breeding time and risk of breeding Tree Dragon (28 hrs lost)\n\n### At level 8:\n\n| Habitat | Dragon | Checks/day | Coins |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Large Fire | 4x Lv 6 Flower Dragons (2hr breed\\+incubate) | 3 | 45,000 |\n| Small Earth | 1x Lv 6 Moss Dragon (24hr breed\\+incubate) | 3 | 30,000 |\n\nAt level 11\\-12 some options open up to you, and it becomes more about how you want to play the game. You can focus on some easily acquired dragons to start building a cash reserve, or instead start chasing the rares.\n\n**Some options to consider:**\n\n| Habitat | Dragon | Checks/day | Coins |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Large Cold | 3x Lv 6 Lichen Dragons (12hr breed\\+incubate) | 3 | 112,320 |\n| Large Earth | 3x Lv 6 Quake Dragons (12hr breed\\+incubate) | 3 | 159,840 |\n| Large Cold | 3x Lv 6 BlueFire/FrostFire Dragons (24hr breed\\+incubate, rare) | 3 | 150,000\\*\\* |\n| Sun/Moon | 1x Lv 6 Sun/Moon Dragon (4 days breed\\+incubate, rare) | 3 | 233,280 |\n| Rainbow | 1x Lv 6 Rainbow Dragon (4 days breed\\+incubate, rare) | 3 | 345,600 |\n\n\\*\\* Beat by a thin margin, but the best overall dragon/habitat combo above 3 checks/day through level 30\\.\n\nAbove level 12 the only really noteworthy unlock is the Large Metal Habitat. Once unlocked, and fully outfited with Magnetic Dragons it is the best non\\-rare 1 check per day habitat, at 115,200 / day.\n\nDragons and Leveling\n--------------------\n\n* As implied above, your first priority for spending should be hitting your habitat max for each level, and upgrading those habitats when possible.\n* Your second priority should be filling habitats with dragons. With the Fire habitats this is easy since you can buy Fire dragons and they incubate quickly. When transitioning to Cold habitats you can breed a Fire Dragon with a Lichen Dragon, which will produce Flower Dragons for your Fire Habitats and Lichen and (if you're lucky) Blue Fire Dragons for your Cold Habitats.\n* Adding dragons creates income faster than leveling individual dragons, but leveling dragons also provides a valuable income increase, especially once the dragons/habitat cap is hit. Treats/dragon\\-level are the same for all dragons, and the amount doubles for each level. With active large treat farms it is generally possible to upgrade dragons to level 5\\-6 as fast as you can produce them. These upgrades should be spread evenly across all dragons to maximize earning potential. Upgrades above level 6 climb steeply and should be more targeted towards the dragons with highest earning potential.\n\nBreeding for Cash\n-----------------\n\nThe DragonVale Wiki has a great link on this here: <http://dragonvale.wikia.com/wiki/Breeding_for_Profit>\n\nAssuming you keep your breeding cave fairly busy in the early levels, this becomes a more significant potential for revenue at higher levels. Consider:\n\n* Breeding and selling 2 Water Dragons / day (8 hours breed\\+incubate) \\= 500,000 /day\n* Breeding and selling 4 Air Dragons / day (4 hours breed\\+incubate) \\= 1,000,000 /day\n\nBoth of which are relatively easy to come by once you've unlocked them and have the cash for the eggs and habitat. If you really want to farm, some metal dragon hybrids have an even higher payout later (see the link).\n\nBreeding Opportunity Cost\n-------------------------\n\nBreeding is one of the main bottlenecks of the entire game, especially early on (unless you are buying trunks of gems with your real monies). As such, think twice about breeding mating pairs that have a potential for long cycle times. This is especially true of any earth combination, because even after such a long wait, what you get in return is typically not awe inspiring."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the DragonVale information provided:\n\nQuestion: You're a new player in DragonVale aiming to maximize coin production. Based on the information given, which of the following strategies would be most effective for rapid coin accumulation in the early game (before level 8)?\n\nA) Fill your park with Large Plant habitats housing 4 Plant Dragons each, checking 4 times per day\nB) Create as many Small Earth habitats as possible, each with 1 Moss Dragon, checking 4 times per day\nC) Focus on Small Fire habitats with 2 Flower Dragons each, checking 4 times per day\nD) Breed for rare dragons like Rainbow or Sun/Moon dragons to maximize coin production\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because Large Plant habitats with Plant Dragons produce significantly less coins (2,000 per day with 4 checks) compared to other options.\n\nB) is incorrect because while Small Earth habitats with Moss Dragons can produce good coins (31,680 per day with 4 checks), they have long breeding times (24 hours) and risk breeding Tree Dragons, which wastes 28 hours.\n\nC) is correct. Small Fire habitats with 2 Flower Dragons each, checked 4 times daily, produce 30,000 coins per day. This is the most efficient option before level 8, balancing good coin production with quick breeding times (2 hours).\n\nD) is incorrect for early game strategy. While rare dragons like Rainbow or Sun/Moon produce high amounts of coins, they require 4 days to breed and incubate, making them inefficient for rapid early game coin accumulation. Additionally, these dragons and their habitats are typically not available to new players.\n\nThe correct strategy (C) allows for consistent coin production with manageable breeding cycles, making it the best choice for early game progression."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/08/02", "source": ["https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/330473", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/6246128/"], "docs_id": 330473, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand how different privileges unlock, and how you can gain access to different parts of SO with more reputation.

But say, we compress a volume of gas. Won't the particles start moving more quickly? Meaning an increase in their internal energy.\n\nIs this an increase in the internal energy due to pressure?\nOr an increase in temperature due to pressure which in turn increases the energy?\nHow do I see this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For an ideal gas [the internal energy only depends on the temperature of the gas](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/389130/179151). How the temperature relates to pressure is easily seen in the [ideal gas law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law) $$PV\\=NkT$$ \nSo I suppose one could make the argument that the internal energy for the ideal gas depends on the quantity $$\\\\frac{PV}{Nk}$$\nand it's up to you how you want to explain the dependency. The problem with this though is that, depending on the process, these variables are constrained to evolve in certain ways. \n\nIndeed, for your compression example, how you are compressing the gas matters. I will cover some typical examples:\n\n---\n\nIf the gas is compressed in such a way so that its pressure is inversely proportional to it's volume, then by the ideal gas law the temperature remains constant. It turns out that in this case the heat that leaves the gas is exactly balanced by the work you do on it. The internal energy does not change.\n\nIf the gas is compressed in such a way so that its pressure remains constant, then by the ideal gas law the temperature drops in proportion to the volume. In this case more energy leaves the system as heat than what you put in as work. The internal energy decreases.\n\nIf the gas is compressed in such a way so that no heat enters or leaves the system, then all the work you do goes into increasing the internal energy, and hence the temperature of the gas. This process is probably what you had in mind. Here the pressure and volume both change, but the pressure increases in a larger proportion than the volume decreases$^\\*$. Therefore, by the ideal gas law the temperature increases.\n\n---\n\n$^\\*$ In fact, for this process the value $PV^\\\\gamma$ is constant where $\\\\gamma\\>1$. So, if $V$ decreases by a factor $x\\>1$, then $P$ must increase by a factor of $x^{\\\\gamma}$. This means that $PV$, and hence $T$, must increase by a factor of $x^{\\\\gamma\\-1}\\>1$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A sealed container of ideal gas undergoes compression. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the relationship between pressure, volume, and internal energy of the gas?\n\nA) The internal energy of the gas always increases due to the direct effect of increased pressure, regardless of how the compression occurs.\n\nB) If the compression occurs isothermally (constant temperature), the internal energy of the gas remains unchanged despite the increase in pressure.\n\nC) In an adiabatic compression (no heat transfer), the internal energy of the gas decreases as work is done on the system.\n\nD) The internal energy of an ideal gas is solely a function of pressure, and therefore always increases during compression.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. For an ideal gas, the internal energy is a function of temperature only, not pressure directly. In an isothermal compression, the temperature remains constant, so the internal energy doesn't change despite the increase in pressure. The work done on the gas is exactly balanced by the heat leaving the system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the internal energy doesn't always increase with compression; it depends on how the compression occurs.\n\nOption C is incorrect because in an adiabatic compression, the internal energy actually increases as all the work done on the system goes into increasing the gas's temperature.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the internal energy of an ideal gas is not a function of pressure alone, but of temperature. Pressure and volume changes can affect temperature, which in turn affects internal energy, but there's not a direct relationship between pressure and internal energy for an ideal gas."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/08/11", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/101918", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/167440/"], "docs_id": 101918, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Stack Overflow is developed using ASP.NET and C\\#.

Consider these changes:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\nread -p \"enter country code: \" CODE\necho \"exporting data from $CODE\"\nSRC=\"PG:'dbname=alamedaok user=postgres host=localhost'\"\nSQL=\"SELECT id_alameda, pais, geom FROM poblaciones_def WHERE pais=$CODE\"\nogr2ogr -f GeoJSON code_$CODE.geojson $SRC -sql $SQL\n\n```\n\nYou can also prefix the last command with `echo` to see what it is using if it needs to be debugged."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a bash script for exporting PostGIS data to GeoJSON using ogr2ogr, which of the following code snippets correctly incorporates a user-input variable into the SQL query while following bash best practices?\n\nA) \n```bash\nread -p \"Enter country code: \" export\nSQL=\"SELECT id_alameda, pais, geom FROM poblaciones_def WHERE pais = '$export'\"\nogr2ogr -f GeoJSON export.geojson $PG_SOURCE -sql $SQL\n```\n\nB) \n```bash\nread -p \"Enter country code: \" CODE\nSQL='SELECT id_alameda, pais, geom FROM poblaciones_def WHERE pais = `$CODE`'\nogr2ogr -f GeoJSON export.geojson $PG_SOURCE -sql \"$SQL\"\n```\n\nC) \n```bash\nread -p \"Enter country code: \" CODE\nSQL=\"SELECT id_alameda, pais, geom FROM poblaciones_def WHERE pais = $CODE\"\nogr2ogr -f GeoJSON code_$CODE.geojson $PG_SOURCE -sql \"$SQL\"\n```\n\nD) \n```bash\necho 'Enter country code'\nread CODE\nSQL=\"SELECT id_alameda, pais, geom FROM poblaciones_def WHERE pais = \\\"$CODE\\\"\"\nogr2ogr -f GeoJSON export.geojson $PG_SOURCE -sql $SQL\n```\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the correct answer because it follows bash best practices and correctly incorporates the user input variable into the SQL query. Here's why:\n\n1. It uses uppercase for the variable name (CODE), which is a convention in bash.\n2. It uses the read -p command to prompt for input, which is more concise.\n3. The SQL query is enclosed in double quotes, allowing for variable substitution.\n4. The variable $CODE is used directly in the SQL query without additional quotes, which is correct for numeric values. If CODE is expected to be a string, it should be '$CODE'.\n5. The SQL variable is passed to ogr2ogr with quotes (\"$SQL\"), ensuring that it's treated as a single argument even if it contains spaces.\n6. The output filename includes the country code, which is a good practice for organizing multiple exports.\n\nOptions A and B use 'export' as a variable name, which should be avoided as it's a bash command. Option D doesn't use the read -p syntax and unnecessarily escapes quotes in the SQL string. All other options have minor issues in how they construct or pass the SQL query."}}
