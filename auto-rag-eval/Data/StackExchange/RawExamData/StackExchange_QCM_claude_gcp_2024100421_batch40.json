Traditionally in C, I'd just pick a resolution and an epoch offset and model things with \"big enough\" integers, but I wasn't worrying about UTC, just an internal time reference.\n\nLately, I've been working a bunch in Swift/Kotlin/Python3, and I found myself wondering if I wouldn't be better served by building a lightweight higher order representation of instant and deltas in C. Something where I had a distinct struct for each entity, and wrote a few functions to do the math I need between them.\n\nThis would require a little more time (to develop), but possibly give me a little more (type) safety.\n\nI guess I'm curious how others who have had to model UTC times in embedded C have chosen to do so. Should I go with the classic offset/epoch integer model? Or model with actual structs?\n\n(I'm not really worried about performance for this)\n\nCLARIFICATION?\n==============\n\nLots of embedded processes have to measure time or do things at certain times. I've done a bunch of those. Some sort of rolling systick counter is your time base, and you do math against it. The only real drawback I've found over the years, is that it is possible to have bugs related to the semantic differences between a time marker (an instant that occurs on the the time counter) and a duration or delta, between two such times. Since both are (u)ints, it's easy to mix up the two with no warnings.\n\nThe tricky part here is the introduction of the GPS. GPS NMEA times are in UTC field values (e.g. yymmdd, hhmmss). While the UTC gets rid of the TimeZone nightmare, it doesn't get rid of things like leap years. So at bare minimum, I have to implement the math to covert said field values into a seconds offset, and then correlate/map that with the local time counter. This lead to the question: If I have to do that anyway, why not just go all the way. My goal is to schedule things to happen at certain UTC times.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Best way to model UTC time and deltas\n\n**Look to standards to guide you.**\n\n[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) discusses many of the issues of concern both to time stamps and to time deltas.\n\nEven though it is primarily related to textual time presentation, the format of time as text relates directly to data structures in C.\n\n**Wall time vs. clock time.**\n\nThe time on the wall is a world\\-wide agreed upon idea of *what time is it* when its UTC.\n\nYour embedded device simply needs a *clock* counting at some rate and, unless you log data in non\\-volatile memory, can start at 0 each time the units powers on.\n\nThe relationship between wall time and your clock is usually just an offset and scale. The scale may be assumed fixed, factory calibrated or sporadically re\\-calibrated. The *offset*, that is the tricky part, as code needs to sync up with the outside world obliges info exchange at least once.\n\n**Simplicity**\n\n> My goal is to schedule things to happen at certain UTC times.\n\nI'd use the idea of *local UTC* for scheduling. That is your processor's best understanding of UTC, which may drift over time with the real one. On occasion, it may require syncing \\- be preprepared for that. Code can use convenient units (instead of seconds) for your processor like your clock frequency and `int64_t`. This linear approach will simplify scheduling. The YMDhms translations to/from `your_time_t` need only occur when communicating outside the processor (to people or other machines)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When implementing UTC time handling in an embedded system with GPS functionality, which approach is most suitable for scheduling events at specific UTC times?\n\nA) Use a simple integer counter starting from 0 each time the device powers on, without any correlation to real-world UTC.\n\nB) Implement a full calendar system within the embedded device, including handling of leap years and time zones.\n\nC) Use a \"local UTC\" approach with a 64-bit integer representing the device's best understanding of UTC, synced occasionally with GPS time.\n\nD) Rely solely on the GPS chip's NMEA output for all time-related functions and scheduling.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most suitable approach for this scenario. Using a \"local UTC\" with a 64-bit integer allows for efficient scheduling and time tracking within the embedded system. This method provides a good balance between simplicity and accuracy:\n\n- It allows for high-resolution time tracking using the device's internal clock.\n- It can be easily synced with real UTC time from the GPS when needed.\n- It simplifies scheduling by using a linear time representation.\n- It avoids the complexity of full calendar implementations (option B) while still allowing for UTC correlation.\n- It's more reliable and flexible than depending solely on GPS output (option D).\n- It provides better functionality than a simple power-on counter (option A) by maintaining a relationship with real-world time.\n\nThis approach addresses the need for UTC-based scheduling while keeping the implementation relatively simple and efficient for an embedded system."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/06/03", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/145976", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/7035/"], "docs_id": 145976, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In what repository do the Proprietary drivers that are found on the Additional Drivers window found and how can I copy them all so I can have them stored in case I find myself in a computer with a proprietary need but no internet access.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: * Recursive download from here: `http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/restricted/`\n* e.g. `wget -nH -np --cut-dirs=3 -r -l0 $URL`\n* where `$URL` is above or your favorite mirror."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're preparing for a situation where you might need to install proprietary drivers on a computer without internet access.

While a push-pull amplifier could be used, it's not the only option, and the question doesn't specifically require addressing crossover distortion. Option D correctly identifies the need for amplification to boost both voltage and current without specifying a particular amplifier type."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/11/07", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/184860", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/84736/"], "docs_id": 184860, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I saw the sentence \u201cCheck out my social media feeds.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s that mean?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a distinction between a door (restaurant, opening or similar) **to** another world and one **in** another world.\n\nThe preposition **to** indicates that the place or object concerned serves to transport a person from one world to another.

Also you can change parameters of a `tmpfs` by doing a simple `mount -o remount`, especially the size of the file system or the number of inodes.\n\nUsing `zram` as the backing of a temporary file system has the disadvantage, that all data written there needs to be compressed immediatelly (and decompressed upon use). Also you need to put a file system on top, whiches structures need to be stored even if there are no actual files stored. Also you get limitations like max number of inodes, you can't easily change it's size and so on.\n\nIMHO, best solution is to mount `tmpfs` somewhere to use and create a `zram` swap.

This allows for faster access when memory is available. zRam, on the other hand, compresses data immediately, which can save space but introduces compression/decompression overhead.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because zRam doesn't completely replace tmpfs; they have different characteristics and can be used together effectively.

Removing the module from the setup_module table and rerunning the command is likely to resolve the issue. This is because Magento analyzes DDL (Data Definition Language) commands called during setup:upgrade to generate the schema. If the module is already registered in the setup_module table, the legacy install scripts may not be executed, preventing the generation of the db_schema.xml file.

In a \u0393-Ultrametric space, \u0393 is a complete lattice (which could correspond to X in our case), and there's a map d_M: M \u00d7 M \u2192 \u0393 (analogous to our x: S^2 \u2192 X). The special element z_X in X could be seen as the minimal element in the lattice \u0393. The map r_d, while not directly part of the \u0393-Ultrametric definition, seems to be derived from the metric d in a way that could preserve ultrametric-like properties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because r_d is not defined on all of X\u00d7X, only on (X \\ {z_X})^2.\nOption C is unlikely because r_d is defined as a ratio, which may not satisfy all properties of a quasi-metric.\nOption D is possible but less specific than B, as \u0393-Ultrametric spaces naturally induce a topology.\n\nTherefore, B is the most likely correct answer, as it best captures the structure and properties described in the original documentation."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/20", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/320202", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/102008/"], "docs_id": 320202, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a question regarding the relationship between a body's orbital radius, mass, and orbital velocity.\n\nI understand that there is the equation $V \\= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{GM}{R}}$, where $V$ is the orbital velocity, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $R$ is the orbital radius. Does the equation imply that the orbital velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius? So, can it be accurately stated that the orbital velocity decreases as the orbital radius increases?\n\nHowever, [this article](https://www.britannica.com/science/dark-matter) states that \"In general, the speed with which stars orbit the centre of their galaxy is independent of their separation from the centre; indeed, orbital velocity is either constant or increases slightly with distance rather than dropping off as expected.\"\n\nThese observations seem contradictory. Can someone please help clear up the misinterpretation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your understanding that the orbital velocity decreases as the radius increases is correct. Yet, as the article states, we see that orbiting stars seem to have a uniform speed. The resolution comes from the fact that the $M$ in the formula refers to the mass enclosed by the orbit (really the $M$ refers to a point mass, but an object a distance $R$ from the center of a spherically symmetric mass distribution feels the gravitational force that would result if all the mass inside the radius $R$ had been concentrated at the origin and the outside mass was removed completely).\n\nFor bigger orbits, $R$ is bigger as you noted, but also the orbits enclose more mass (mostly dark matter, as the article says), and so the orbital speed stays more or less constant.

The equation V = \u221a(GM/R) is still valid, but the mass M in the equation refers to the mass enclosed within the orbital radius R. In galaxies, as R increases, more dark matter is included within the orbit. This increase in M offsets the increase in R, resulting in a relatively constant orbital velocity for stars at different distances from the galactic center. This observation is one of the key pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter in galaxies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the equation remains valid when properly interpreted. Option B is incorrect as there's no evidence that the gravitational constant varies within galaxies. Option D is incorrect because while stellar orbits in galaxies are not perfectly circular, this alone doesn't explain the observed rotation curves."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/10/24", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/219868", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/96/"], "docs_id": 219868, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I seek something of the form $\\\\\\|f\\-g\\\\\\|\\_p \\\\leq \\|\\\\\\|f\\\\\\|\\_p\\-\\\\\\|g\\\\\\|\\_p\\|$.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You get exactly the opposite inequality.

As such they should obey the Bose\\-Einstein statistics at low temperature. And this means they should form a Bose\\-Einstein condensate at temperature close to absolute zero. However I imagine a condensate of gravitons to be a systems which generates a very strong gravitational field, because of the maximally dense packing of gravitons in such a condensate. Could it therefor be that a black hole is in fact a Bose\\-Einstein condensate of gravitons?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a start to an answer, [the formula for the temperature of the interior of a black hole](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bekenstein-Hawking_entropy) is known. [In particular](https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-temperature-at-the-core-of-a-black-hole):\n\n> For small black holes, we study their black body radiation and see so\n>  little emission that the temperature is about 1/10,000,000 of a degree\n>  above absolute zero. Larger black holes would be even colder because\n>  they let less radiation escape. That means black holes are colder\n>  than space itself (about 2\\.7 degrees above absolute zero).\n\nBut, the harder question is whether a black hole would transform the ordinary matter, dark matter (if such thing exists), and photons that fall into it into gravitons.\n\nThe average density of a black hole, measured as mass divided by volume within the event horizon, is never more than slightly more dense (a few percent or so) than a neutron star which keeps the lion's share of its mass in the form of ordinary matter (i.e. neutrons)[1](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bekenstein-Hawking_entropy), rather than transforming any substantial share of its mass into gravitons. And, in the absence of better and experimentally validated models of the structure of the interior of a black hole (which may be not just practically, but theoretically impossible), there is no way to test the composition of the interior of a black hole and no really compelling reason for it not to be made of really cold ordinary matter.\n\nOne can imagine a black hole composed of a Bose\\-Einstein condensate, as the two articles cited in the comments to the question do. [Dvali (2012\\)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4059) argues that a work around to the entropy problem that I identify below can make this possible:\n\n> We reformulate the quantum black hole portrait in the language of\n>  modern condensed matter physics. We show that black holes can be\n>  understood as a graviton Bose\\-Einstein condensate at the critical\n>  point of a quantum phase transition, identical to what has been\n>  observed in systems of cold atoms. **The Bogoliubov modes that become\n>  degenerate and nearly gapless at this point are the holographic\n>  quantum degrees of freedom responsible for the black hole entropy and\n>  the information storage. They have no (semi)classical counterparts and\n>  become inaccessible in this limit.** These findings indicate a deep\n>  connection between the seemingly remote systems and suggest a new\n>  quantum foundation of holography. They also open an intriguing\n>  possibility of simulating black hole information processing in\n>  table\\-top labs.\n\nBut, as far as I know, this article's hypothesis about entropy is not widely accepted. The cited follow up article to Dvali (2012\\), which is [Alfaro (2016\\)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01639v1.pdf), seems to be a bit more carefully reasoned. Alfaro's abstract states:\n\n> We analyze in detail a previous proposal by Dvali and Gomez that\n>  black holes could be treated as consisting of a Bose\\-Einstein\n>  condensate of gravitons. In order to do so we extend the\n>  Einstein\\-Hilbert action with a chemical potential\\-like term, thus\n>  placing ourselves in a grand\\-canonical ensemble. The form and\n>  characteristics of this chemical potential\\-like piece are discussed in\n>  some detail. After this, we proceed to expand the ensuing equations of\n>  motion up to second order around the classical Schwarzschild metric so\n>  that some non\\-linear terms in the metric fluctuation are kept. We\n>  argue that the resulting equations could be interpreted as the\n>  Gross\\-Pitaevskii equation describing a graviton Bose\\-Einstein\n>  condensate trapped by the black hole gravitational field. Next we\n>  search for solutions and, modulo some very plausible assumptions, we\n>  find out that the condensate vanishes outside the horizon but is\n>  non\\-zero in its interior. Based on hints from a numerical integration\n>  of the equations we formulate an ansatz and eventually find an exact\n>  non\\-trivial solution for a mean\\-field wave\\-function describing the\n>  graviton Bose\\-Einstein condensate in the black hole interior. Based on\n>  this we can rederive some of the relations involving the number of\n>  gravitons N and the black hole characteristics, summarized in its\n>  Schwarzschild radius, along the lines suggested by Dvali and Gomez.\n>  These relations are parametrized by a single parameter \u2014a\n>  dimensionless chemical potential.\n\nIt is less clear in the follow up article that the graviton BEC must be the sole content of the black hole and neither paper addresses any process by which ordinary matter sucked into a black hole is transformed into part of a graviton BEC.\n\nI am not aware of any known process that would convert ordinary matter to gravitons in an ordinary black hole and I am not aware of research that really singles out this possibility. Indeed, a conversion of ordinary matter absorbed by the black hole into gravitons would violate baryon number and lepton number conservation and so this interaction is forbidden in the Standard Model and any reasonably plausible quantum gravity theory that preserves [B and L conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_number). (Could the graviton be the [Goldstone boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstone_boson) associated with the B and L conservation laws under [Noether's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem)? There isn't an obvious reason why these could be connected, but gravity is a force that couples to absolutely everything, and in theory, if it couples to everything it could be a bridge to convert any form of mass\\-energy to any other form of mass\\-energy.)\n\nSimilarly, a graviton BEC scenario is inconsistent with the possibility of a [charged black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_black_hole) (the main alternatives to Schwarzchild and Kerr black holes which are called Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black holes if the angular momentum is zero and are called Kerr\u2013Newman black holes if there is both angular momentum and electric charge), since gravitons lack electromagnetic charge.\n\nWe do know (and can calculate) the total entropy of a black hole and might be able to theoreticaly rule out some versions of the possibilites using this formula, but otherwise I don't know how you could tell the difference.\n\nA Platonic ideal of a [Bose\\-Einstein condensate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate) has [entropy of zero](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_best_definition_for_entropy_in_the_Bose-Einstein_condensation) which is different from the entropy of a black hole, so naively it would seem that a black hole cannot be purely a perfect Bose\\-Einstein condensate of gravitons, even though there could be some bosons in a black hole which are in that state. Short of a true Platonic ideal of a \"perfect Bose\\-Einstein condensate\", however, one can seem \"[superfluidity](http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~mevans/sp/sp5.pdf)\" at very low temperatures, which does not have zero entropy.\n\nIt seems more plausible that the gravitons inside a black hole may be in a Bose\\-Einstein condensate state than that everything inside a black hole is a Bose\\-Einstein condensate of gravitons.\n\n[1](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bekenstein-Hawking_entropy) This is true only for black holes created by the collapse of a star and subsequent accumulation of mass. In principle, \"primordial black holes\" could have a greater density, but no such black holes have ever been observed and conjectures about how primordial black holes could have been created in the very early universe are purely speculative."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about black holes and the possibility of them being Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) of gravitons is most accurate?\n\nA) Black holes have zero entropy, making them perfect candidates for being pure Bose-Einstein condensates of gravitons.\n\nB) The conversion of ordinary matter into gravitons within a black hole is consistent with baryon and lepton number conservation in the Standard Model.\n\nC) The average density of a black hole within its event horizon suggests that it is primarily composed of ordinary matter rather than a graviton BEC.\n\nD) The Dvali-Gomez model proposes that black holes are graviton BECs at a quantum phase transition point, with Bogoliubov modes explaining the black hole entropy without violating known physical laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option A is incorrect because black holes have non-zero entropy given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, which contradicts the zero entropy of an ideal BEC. Option B is false as the conversion of ordinary matter to gravitons would violate baryon and lepton number conservation. Option C, while true for typical stellar black holes, doesn't address the BEC hypothesis directly. Option D is the most accurate, as it reflects the Dvali-Gomez model discussed in the text, which proposes a way for black holes to be graviton BECs while addressing the entropy issue through quantum degrees of freedom at a critical point.

If your structure is swaying that much you have other issues, mostly involving a lack of diagonal bracing.\n* The wood at those locations will give (deform) enough to accommodate such movement, assuming SPF lumber.\n* Nearly all force at those connections is in shear. You will not see good quality screws shear off in this use case. For some peace of mind, use *three* for each stud.\n* The sheathing fasteners provide the connective force on the vertical axis, and they're also acting almost entirely in shear.\n\nI would use screws for everything (3\" for the framing, 2\" for the sheathing). If you'd rather not, ring\\-shank nails give a bit of extra hold, but they're not going to save you from a catastrophic failure if you have so much movement that you're relying on them. Your overall structure needs to be sound.\n\nI suggest screws because there is *some* movement in a tree\\-\\-more than with a ground\\-based structure\\-\\-and because they're nice to work with.

The question involved the plausibility of using a very strong gravitational field to accelerate an astronaut at ludicrously high $G$s. A comment was made that the field would need to be uniform to prevent lethal tidal forces.\n\nMy intuition says that a uniform gravitational field has zero acceleration... that it is the curvature which defines the direction and magnitude of the acceleration. \"Mass tell space how to bend, space tells mass how to move.\" No tide, no bend, no acceleration.\n\nCan gravitational acceleration exist as a \"uniform field\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can't create such a thing. But if you could create one, we would expect a uniform field to subject objects in freefall to constant acceleration (proportional to the strength of the field)\n\nThe earth's gravitational field magnitude varies only slightly as long as you are near the surface. Close enough that we can consider the field to be \"constant\" within a building or laboratory.\n\nTidal effects arise from the non\\-uniformity of the fields we see. The moon and the sun create gravitational fields that are stronger on the side of the earth than on the other.

This is because tidal forces arise from non-uniformity in gravitational fields, which is not present in this scenario. The lack of curvature doesn't mean no acceleration; rather, the field has a consistent magnitude and direction throughout. Option A is incorrect because uniform fields can still cause acceleration.

I'm Replacing it with new 200\\-amp service and all load wiring has been updated and includes ground wiring. The easiest transformation is to add a room and convert the exterior wall where the old panel is to an interior wall and simply put the new panel facing the new room to meet code and avoid a j\\-box. The old panel is also in a kitchen cabinet. The meter box is on the exterior opposite the original panel box but is being relocated to a new ext. location. \n\nI installed a temporary power pole main disconnect with 2\\-2\\-2\\-4 SER to run 25' in schedule 40 from the disconnect to the old panel until the room is built. To convert it to a subpanel, do I remove one of the existing ground/neutral bars and replace it with an insulated neutral bar and put all load neutrals on the insulated bar plus the \\#2 neutral wire from the disconnect and all grounds to the ground bar? I'm assuming the 2\\-2\\-2\\-4 SER Al is rated to enter the house to the panel. \n\nOther than the \\#4 ground wire from the new disconnect to the old panel, does the subpanel also need a \\#6 bare copper ground from the ground bar to a copper ground rod?

Yes, to do it properly, the existing 100 amp panel must have the neutral \"floated\" (insulated) and not bonded to the ground. All neutrals must go to the neutral busbar and all grounds must be connected to the grounding busbar. Since you have 4 wire from the temporary service, you no longer need the ground rods for the 100 amp service. In fact, I think it's probably not even allowed anymore. Your connection assumptions are correct. Will you be gutting the old panel and basically turn it into a big j\\-box? That's what I've done in the past and inspectors are fine with it. Being in a cabinet may force the issue going forward.\n\nRegarding the other sub\\-panel in your workshop, if you have 4 wire feed to it, it's the same drill as your other soon\\-to\\-be subpanel...float the neutral and use separate wires for neutral and ground. You shouldn't need a local grounding rod there either anymore. I understand the code, and the rationale for not sharing neutral and grounding in a sub\\-panel, but not why you can't have local grounding.

Suppose the body was tied to the hemisphere like a rollercoaster is tied to a track. An suppose we slide the body around the hemisphere at a slow constant speed. That is, we also have a force tangent to the hemisphere holding the body back.\n\nWhen the body starts out at the top, it is sitting on the hemisphere. It doesn't fall through because the hemisphere is made of some rigid material that exerts an upward force just strong enough to keep the body from falling through. Since the body moves in a circle at constant speed, the total force is centripetal. $F \\= mv^2/r$.\n\nAs the body slides below the equator, the body doesn't fall off because the track holds it. The total force is still centripetal. But now the normal force is toward the center. If it wasn't for the inward normal force, the body would fall off.\n\nIf you start from the top at a faster speed, the body will stay on the hemisphere if gravity larger than the centripetal force needed to move along the hemisphere. The outward normal force will oppose gravity and reduce the total force to exactly what is needed to follow the hemisphere.\n\nAs the body slides down, the component of gravity toward the center gets smaller. There will be a point where that component isn't bigger than the centripetal force needed to follow the hemisphere. At that point, the body will follow a straighter curve than the hemisphere, and fly off."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: A small object of mass m is attached to a frictionless hemispherical track of radius R.

I didn't see any brightness adjustment slider on the top, and neither the function key for brightness (Fn\\+F5, F6\\) worked. After I restarted upon installation, I tried to switch to nVidia proprietary drivers, hoping it would fix the brightness problem ( In *Software \\& Updates* \\-\\> *Additional Drivers*). That made it even worse. The log that is shown during Ubuntu's boot crashes and my laptop's fan begins to run at crazy speeds. There was no hard disk access when that happens (the hard\\-disk access light stops glowing). I had to hard press power button to force shutdown. I tried Bumblebee, same problem.

If you are using dynamically growing vhdds, then rsync is probably your best bet, and if you are using statically defined disks, then dd is probably your best bet.\n\n**Option 1:**\nFirst, you will have to create a samba or cfs share, or attach a physical drive by some other means to backup the data. Once you have a backup destination attached, you will have to run the rsync or dd command to backup the drive. \n\nRsync example (using Arch):\n<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/full_system_backup_with_rsync>\n\nDD example: \n[http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/10/dd\\-command\\-examples/](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/10/dd-command-examples/)\n\nI'm pretty sure you can pipe rsync into gzip if you want to create a portable file.\n\nThen you must install Centos in a new hyper\\-v machine. Then you have to go through the task of restoring the backup image (which will differ depending on the command you used to create it).\n\n**Option 2:**\nAlternatively, you could create the new CentOS VM first, and then mount the other exported VHD file to the same virtual machine under Hyper\\-V. Since you will have both drives mounted to the same machine, you could go through the migration process at that point. Once you have mounted the backup drive and migrated your bootloader over to it, you can unmount the replacement VM drive. You could then re\\-use the same drive to migrate your other machines (rinse and repeat for each VM you need to migrate). If you have many machines you could attempt to script this process, or you might be able to find a backup script already out there.\n\n**Option 3:**\nCreate the new VHD/VHDX file with hyper\\-V, and then attach and mount it to the Xenserver guest you wish to duplicate, and do the backup directly that way.\n\nI know there are a lot of hoops to jump through, there are three solid options that will probably work without too much fuss. I'm kind of newb with Linux, but I've moved HD images around fairly easily with DD before, and I don't see why it wouldn't work nicely here.\n\n**ORIGINAL ANSWER:**\n\nIf you are using LVM, then the HDDs shouldn't be causing the problem and HD links should be intact after conversion, but I am no expert. I have a fair amount of experience with Linux under Hyper\\-V, but not converting XenServer machines to Hyper\\-V. That being said, the error you are seeing suggests to me that it might be an issue with the linux kernel. It would be helpful to know which Linux distribution you are using.\n\nXenServer has two VM types:\n\nHVM VMs \\- these are equal to Hyper\\-V VMs and need no changes. These VMs can be converted to Hyper\\-V machines by conventional means (copy VHD or use System Center 2012 Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) as recommended by Microsoft).\n\nPV VMs \\- these are 'para virtualized' VMs and don't have a full boot kernel. They are bound to the OS of the VM and share some of the bootloader to bootstrap the machine. You need to replace the PV kernel (kernel\\-xen) in the VM with the pae kernel (kernel\\-pae).\n\nI don't know what linux distribution you are using, and that may have some effect on the actual solution, but, assuming the VMs are PV VMs, the following link has instructions on installing the PV kernel on the Linux box, so you want to **do the reverse** of these instructions, adapting for your Linux distribution. Then the export process should work:\n\n[http://itproctology.blogspot.ca/2009/06/pv\\-enabling\\-hvm\\-from\\-vmware\\-on.html](http://itproctology.blogspot.ca/2009/06/pv-enabling-hvm-from-vmware-on.html)\n\nThis answer assumes you are using PV kernel on your Xenserver vms, and assumes that is the problem causing boot failure. It also assumes you have already tried using System Center 2012 Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) to convert the vms (as per Microsoft best practices, steps shown at the following link):\n\n[https://technet.microsoft.com/en\\-ca/library/gg610672\\.aspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/gg610672.aspx)\n\nFinal Notes: \n\n* I might try disabling secure boot and seeing if that makes a difference.\n* Make sure to follow Microsoft Best Practices for Linux VMs (depending on the distribution you are using). These can be found at the following links, and you could try making those change to the VM **prior to doing the export process** (be sure to back\\-up your virtual machine first):\n\nUniversal Linux VM under Hyper\\-V best practices:\n[https://technet.microsoft.com/en\\-ca/library/dn720239\\.aspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/dn720239.aspx)\n\nDistribution specific Linux VM under Hyper\\-V best practices:\n[https://technet.microsoft.com/en\\-ca/library/dn531030\\.aspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/dn531030.aspx)\n\nLastly, here's what my Linux kernel params look like (Ubuntu/Debian) for my virtual machines (in /etc/default/grub, make sure to run sudo update\\-grub afterwards):\n\n```\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash video=hyperv_fb:1366x768 elevator=noop numa=off\"\n\n```\n\nThe video\\=hyperv\\_fb option will only work once hyper\\-v integration tools are installed on the VM (distribution specific)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When migrating Linux virtual machines from XenServer to Hyper-V, which of the following approaches is recommended for CentOS 6.7 VMs that fail to boot after a standard export and convert process?\n\nA) Modify the boot menu arguments to change xvda references to sda\nB) Use rsync or dd to create a backup of the XenServer VM and restore it to a new Hyper-V VM\nC) Install the kernel-xen package on the CentOS VM before exporting\nD) Change the UUID in /etc/fstab to match the new disk UUID in Hyper-V\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Polychoric correlations are specifically designed for such ordinal data and can capture the relationships between variables better than standard Pearson correlations (option A). \n\nAdditionally, visualizing 2x2 contingency tables (e.g., using mosaic plots) can provide insights into the associations between pairs of questions. This approach aligns with the recommendation in the top answer from StackExchange.\n\nOption A (Pearson correlations) is not ideal for ordinal data. Option B (multiple linear regression) is not suitable for exploring associations between all pairs of questions. Option D (principal component analysis) could be useful for dimensionality reduction but does not directly address the question of assessing associations between responses across questions."}, "47": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/05/14", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/708631", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/329987/"], "docs_id": 708631, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently started the chapter fluid statics and was reading through a book and also watching some videos. I read the fact that fluid pressure is ISOTROPIC at a point i.e same from all direction which made me ponder as pressure is usually dealt like a scalar and attaching drections to it is kind of a vector thing. This is my first confusion. As I continued in the chapter I saw a diagram of a small spherical (point sized) fluid particle with P pressure from all directions and they said the pressure on the point should be P; which is again confusing because shouldn't the pressure be the summation of all these P's that are acting round the fluid molecule and not just 'P' ?

The person who answered the question easily implied by other portions of his code what the syntax error should be corrected to; someone had even said in the comments how the error should be corrected.\n\nSo, I went ahead and corrected the error. However, my suggested edit was [rejected](https://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/3085521).\n\nSo I tried again, including what the syntax error was in the reason for editing, hoping users who actually new vb.net would review the edit.

So overall, the edit had been rejected by 6 users, and approved by one.\n\nI looked at the tags the reviewers commonly use, and the 6 that rejected my suggestion never use the vb.net tag, so I assume they don't know it. The one users who approved my answer used the vb.net tag fairly often. And then today I tried editing again, and it got [approved](https://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/3089816) by three users, all who use vb.net.\n\nWhat should I do if something like this happens again? Should I leave the syntax error, or keep editing it until it gets approved?

However, I have noticed that lots of users do. I put an example in a comment below, and here is another example I came across (on accident): <https://stackoverflow.com/posts/19282384/revisions>. The reason it was edited was because there was a syntax error. (Try putting `if (1 == 1) && (2 == 2)` into a C\\# compiler...it won't work.) (also see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/2546/revisions) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/3202085/revisions), where in the latter someone literally rewrote the whole code block...) Some users have said that if there is an error, the user who noticed it should put a comment. But I know if I typed a little (or big) syntax error, I would *much* rather someone just correct it instead of telling me and letting me fix it. \n\nHowever, as the people who don't like users editing each other's code very truly pointed out, someone could completely change the meaning of the code to something the original poster didn't want. So I had a suggestion on a way to try to fix this: If someone edit's an answerer's *code*, the edit will take place like normal; however, the original poster will be notified someone edited their code, thereby enabling them to check to see if the revision's correct. I don't know, I just thought I might mention that.

Of course, not supported and you should have a backup, so simulate it first with small files on your old pool to see if everything works as expected.\n\n---\n\nFor details see [https://www.mail\\-archive.com/zfs\\-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg22993\\.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/zfs-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg22993.html) and [https://www.mail\\-archive.com/zfs\\-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg23023\\.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/zfs-discuss@opensolaris.org/msg23023.html) for details. You can also search online for \"create raidz2 degraded\" if you have other systems like FreeNAS etc.\n\nThe important steps (taken from the mailing list archive thread by Tomas \u00d6gren and Daniel Rock) are:\n\n1. Create sparse file with the size of the real disk (let's assume it is 1000 GB in this example):\n\n```\nmkfile -n 1000g /tmp/fakedisk1\n\n```\n2. Create a zpool with the real disks and the sparse file:\n\n```\nzpool create -f newpool raidz2 disk1 disk2 disk3 disk4 disk5 /tmp/fakedisk1\n\n```\n3. Immediately put the sparse files offline so that nobody tries to write on it:\n\n```\nzpool offline newpool /tmp/fakedisk1\n\n```\n4. Your pool will now be degraded, but functioning. Copy your files to the new pool (use `ssh` or `netcat` between `send` and `recv` if using network instead of directly attached pools):\n\n```\nzfs snapshot -r oldpool@now\nzfs send -R oldpool@now | zfs recv -Fdu newpool\n\n```\n5. Destroy the old one and replace the sparse files with the now freed up disks:\n\n```\nzpool replace newpool /tmp/fakedisk1 disk6\n\n```\n\n---\n\nAgain, a word of caution depending on your redundancy level (if you use two fake disks on a Z2 or three fake disks on a Z3\\):\n\n> Remember: during data migration your are running without safety belts. \n>  If a disk fails during migration you will lose data."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are migrating data from an old ZFS pool to a new one with more disks, but you don't have all the physical disks available yet.

Obviously no taking the element out of there, or inserting a new one somewhere in\\-between.\n\nAre my senses off or is there a good explanation about *why* you should or shouldn't be allowed to iterate through stack/queue contents in a read\\-only manner?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Stack\" and \"queue\" are terms which are sometimes used to mean two different things, *logical* and *physical*.\n\nIn a strict sense, they are *logical* concepts, and by definition, they are only accessed a certain way, either by reading head or the tail of a FIFO or LIFO stream.\n\nIn a practical sense, they are *physical* data structures. For example, in c\\#, there are `Stack<T>` and `Queue<T>` classes available (along with concurrent\\-friendly versions of the same). For practical purposes, these classes have enumerators that allow to see all of the contents, as well as indexer properties that allow random access to any element in any order.\n\nThere are some contexts where this should not be done. For example, let's say you have invented a new language that is optimized for reading databases. A resultset might be exposed as a read\\-once queue that iterates over a database\\-side cursor. In this case, random access of the items in the queue would be a serious problem, because you can't move your database\\-side cursor backwards.\n\nAnother example\\-\\- the CPU's call stack. It is a LIFO structure that you literally cannot access randomly because each item in the stack is a different size, and there is no way to figure out what size it is without reverse engineering each subroutine. Code is able to use this stack effectively only because each subroutine knows how to deallocate its own stack frame.\n\nSo at a *logical* level, you are right\\-\\- queues and stacks are read in a certain way, by definition. On a physical level, sometimes it is fine to use random access, but sometimes it is not fine, and sometimes it is not possible."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of stacks and queues, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding iteration and access?\n\nA) Stacks and queues should never be iterated over or accessed randomly, as it violates their fundamental LIFO and FIFO principles.\n\nB) Physical implementations of stacks and queues in programming languages always allow for iteration and random access without any potential issues.\n\nC) The ability to iterate or randomly access elements in a stack or queue depends on whether it's being considered as a logical concept or a physical implementation, and the specific context of its use.\n\nD) Iteration and random access are essential features of stacks and queues, and should always be implemented for maximum flexibility.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the nuanced nature of stacks and queues as both logical concepts and physical implementations. Logically, stacks and queues are defined by their LIFO and FIFO access patterns. However, in practical implementations (like C#'s Stack<T> and Queue<T>), iteration and even random access might be provided for convenience.\n\nThe key is understanding that the appropriateness of iteration or random access depends on the specific use case. In some scenarios, such as database cursors or CPU call stacks, random access might be impossible or detrimental to performance. In other cases, it might be perfectly acceptable and useful.\n\nOption A is too restrictive, as it doesn't account for practical implementations that safely allow iteration. Option B is overly permissive, ignoring cases where random access could be problematic. Option D goes too far in the opposite direction, incorrectly suggesting that iteration and random access are always essential and beneficial features."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/07/02", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/25695", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/9783/"], "docs_id": 25695, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Hope someone can shine some light on this!\n\nCan anyone confirm what the Paypal IPN url should be set to for Standard payment? \n\nI have been advised by a Paypal tech that it is <http://www.yoursitename.com/index.php/paypal/ipn/index/> but the Paypal IPN history still shows the response code 500 and we are not getting order status change from \"Pending Payment\" to processing.\n\nI have checked the logs but can seem to find anything that stands out and we have tried the old code change to the ipn.php file but still no luck!\n\nAny help would be great as I don't have much hair left to pull out :( \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ended up fixing this problem by changing my hosting.

An API is a interface for defining the interactions between multiple components, modules, systems, etc. The way you expose this API is separate from how it is implemented. Having a monolith doesn't mean you expose just one API, it means that everything is built as a single, all in one solution. So one of the problem is this: if you expose two APIs from your monolith, and you make changes to one of them, when you deploy, you have to deploy the other one also because you have everything inside the same application. In a microservice architecture, you will have the APIs separated because that's the point, and you can deploy them separately.\n\n> is running multiple processes/services still considered monolithic as long as the codebase is the same and is shipped as \"one unit\"?\n\nYes. If everything is built on the same code base, using the same platform, framework, etc, and deployed as one unit, it is still a monolith. Even if you have things defined in processes or services, if you make a change to one of them, you have to deploy everything. So basically, everything is impacted by your change in just one part of the monolith.\n\nJust as an aside, even though you can build your monolith with multiple processes and services and keep the decoupled and without shared responsibilities, that's not what usually happens. Because you have everything in one place, things tend to leak from one process/service to the other and you can easily end up with one tightly coupled mess of a code base.\n\n> Does using a monolithic architecture for your web application expose its backend services?

A monolithic architecture can indeed provide multiple APIs, but since everything is built and deployed as a single unit, changes to one API will necessitate redeploying the entire application.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the decision to use an API gateway is separate from the architectural choice of monolith vs. microservices.
