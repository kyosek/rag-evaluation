Can we show it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A Gaussian Process doesn't have to perfectly interpolate between points, as that Wikipedia link shows; it all depends on the covariance function that you use.\n\nFor example, consider the GP of the form $X \\\\sim \\\\mathcal N(0, \\\\Sigma\\_{k\\_t})$, where $X$ is a vector of a \"dependant variables\", and $\\\\Sigma\\_{k\\_t}$ is a covariance matrix, where every element $\\\\Sigma\\_{ij} \\= k(t\\_i, t\\_j)$ for some kernel function $k$, and a set of points of the \"independent variable\" $t$.\n\nIf you specify a kernel with the following property: $Cor(x\\_i, x\\_j) \\\\to 1$ as $\\|\\|t\\_i \\- t\\_j\\|\\| \\\\to 0$, notice that you are enforcing continuity. Hence, if you simply use such a kernel, for example, the RBF, it *must* pass through all the points as there's no \"noise\" here at all.\n\nInstead, if you decide to specify a kernel that does account for noise, for example: $k(t\\_i, t\\_j) \\= RBF(t\\_i, t\\_j) \\+ \\\\sigma^2 \\\\mathcal I(t\\_i \\=t\\_j)$ (the `WhiteKernel` in scikit\\-learn, also known as the White Noise kernel), then notice that, even if the two $t$s are close, their correlation isn't 1, i.e. there's some noise here. So the function is not expected to be continuous.\n\nIn fact, you can interpret using such a kernel as the traditional smooth RBF GP but with a noise term added on top:\n\n$$X \\\\sim \\\\mathcal N(0, \\\\Sigma\\_{RBF} \\+ \\\\sigma^2 \\\\mathcal I) $$\n$$\\\\stackrel d\\= \\\\mathcal N(0, \\\\Sigma\\_{RBF}) \\+ \\\\mathcal N(0, \\\\sigma^2 \\\\mathcal I) $$\n$$\\\\Rightarrow X \\= \\\\bar X \\+\\\\epsilon$$\n\n... where $\\\\bar X$ is now a continuous GP. Notice how similar this is to the linear regression equation \\- the only difference really is that you're replacing the mean of the linear regression (which is a parametric line) to a non\\-parametric GP."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Gaussian Process (GP) model, which of the following statements is true regarding the continuity of the process and its relation to the kernel function?\n\nA) A GP always perfectly interpolates between points, regardless of the chosen kernel function.\n\nB) Using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel in a GP guarantees that the process will have discontinuities.\n\nC) Adding a White Noise kernel to an RBF kernel allows the GP to model both smooth trends and noise, potentially resulting in a non-continuous process.\n\nD) The choice of kernel function has no impact on whether a GP will be continuous or not.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because a GP doesn't always perfectly interpolate between points; it depends on the chosen kernel function.\n\nOption B is incorrect because an RBF kernel actually enforces continuity in the GP, not discontinuities.\n\nOption C is correct.

The reduced holonomy implies that these manifolds have vanishing Ricci curvature and hence are automatically solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity.\n\nHowever, physics does not take place on a Riemannian manifold, but rather on a Lorentzian one. Thus my question is: what is known about special holonomy manifolds for metrics of general signature? (I am most interested in the (1,n) case!) In particular I would like to know if there is a classification of allowed holonomy groups and further if there are interesting examples that I should be aware of.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think it would be more accurate to say that the real reason why\nCalabi\\-Yau, hyperk\u00e4hler, $G\\_2$ and $\\\\mathrm{Spin}(7\\)$ manifolds are of\ninterest in string theory is not their Ricci\\-flatness, but the fact\nthat they admit parallel spinor fields. Of course, in\npositive\\-definite signature, existence of parallel spinor fields\nimplies Ricci\\-flatness, but the converse is still open for compact\nriemannian manifolds, as discussed in [this\nquestion](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/16818/are-there-ricci-flat-riemannian-manifolds-with-generic-holonomy), and known to fail for noncompact manifolds as pointed\nout in an answer to that question.\n\nThe similar question for lorentzian manifolds has a bit of history.\nFirst of all, the holonomy principle states that a spin manifold\nadmits parallel spinor fields if and only if (the spin lift of) its\nholonomy group is contained in the stabilizer subgroup of a nonzero\nspinor. Some low\\-dimensional (i.e., $\\\\leq 11$, the cases relevant to\nstring and M\\-theories) investigations (by [Robert Bryant](http://arXiv.org/abs/math.DG/0004073) and [myself](http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-th/9904124),\nindependently) suggested that these subgroups are either of two types:\nsubgroups $G \\< \\\\mathrm{Spin}(n) \\< \\\\mathrm{Spin}(1,n)$, whence $G$ is\nthe ones corresponding to the cases 5\\-8 in the question, or else $G \\=\nH \\\\ltimes \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\-1}$, where $H \\< \\\\mathrm{Spin}(n\\-1\\)$ is one of\nthe groups in cases 5\\-8 in the question. Thomas Leistner showed that\nthis persisted in the general case and, as Igor pointed out in his\nanswer, arrived at a classification of possible lorentzian holonomy\ngroups. Anton Galaev then constructed metrics with all the possible\nholonomy groups, showing that they all arise. Their work is reviewed\nin [their\npaper](http://dx.doi.org/10.4171/051-1/2) ([MR2436228](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2436228)).\n\nThe basic difficulty in the indefinite\\-signature case is that the de\nRham decomposition theorem is modified. Recall that the de Rham\ndecomposition theorem states that if $(M,g)$ is a complete, connected\nand simply connected positive\\-definite riemannian manifold and if the\nholonomy group acts reducibly, then the manifold is a riemannian\nproduct, whence it is enough to restrict to irreducible holonomy\nrepresentations. This is by no means a trivial problem, but is\ntractable.\n\nIn contrast, in the indefinite signature situation, there is a\nmodification of this theorem due to Wu, which says that it is not\nenough for the holonomy representation to be reducible, it has to be\n*nondegenerately* reducible. This means that it is fully reducible\nand the direct sums in the decomposition are orthogonal with respect\nto the metric. This means that it is therefore not enough to restrict\noneself to irreducible holonomy representations. For example,\nB\u00e9rard\\-Bergery and Ikemakhen proved that the only lorentzian holonomy\ngroup acting irreducibly is $\\\\mathrm{SO}\\_0(1,n)$ itself: namely, the\ngeneric holonomy group.\n\nIt should be pointed out that in indefinite signature, the\nintegrability condition for the existence of parallel spinor fields is\nnot Ricci\\-flatness. Instead, it's that the image of the Ricci\noperator $S: TM \\\\to TM$, defined by $g(S(X),Y) \\= r(X,Y)$, with $r$ the\nRicci curvature, be isotropic. Hence if one is interested in\nsupersymmetric solutions of supergravity theories (without fluxes) one\nis interested in Ricci\\-flat lorentzian manifolds (of the relevant\ndimension) admitting parallel spinor fields. It is now not enough to\nreduce the holonomy to the isotropy of a spinor, but the\nRicci\\-flatness equation must be imposed additionally."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about holonomy groups in Lorentzian manifolds is correct?\n\nA) The holonomy groups of Lorentzian manifolds are identical to those of Riemannian manifolds.\n\nB) Ricci-flatness is a sufficient condition for the existence of parallel spinor fields in Lorentzian manifolds.\n\nC) The only Lorentzian holonomy group acting irreducibly is SO_0(1,n).\n\nD) The de Rham decomposition theorem applies without modification to Lorentzian manifolds.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because Lorentzian manifolds have different possible holonomy groups compared to Riemannian manifolds.\n\nB is incorrect because in Lorentzian manifolds, Ricci-flatness is not sufficient for the existence of parallel spinor fields.

Some of these are somewhat subjective or domain specific (e.g. good GUI design principles may be different across cultures or dependent on usage context, think military versus consumer usage).\n\nWhat I'm interested in is a deeper form of quality related to the network (or graph) of types and their inter\\-relatedness, that is, what types does each type refer to, are there clearly identifiable clusters of interconnectivity relating to a properly tiered architecture, or conversely is there a big 'ball' of type references ('monolithic' code). Also the size of each type and/or method (e.g. measured in quantity of Java byte code or .Net IL) should give some indication of where large complex algorithms have been implemented as monolithic blocks of code instead of being decomposed into more manageable/maintainable chunks.\n\nAn analyis based on such ideas may be able to calculate metrics that are at least a proxy for quality. The exact threshold/decision points between high and low quality would I suspect be subjective, e.g. since by maintainability we mean maintainability by human programmers and thus the functional decomposition must be compatible with how human minds work. As such I wonder if there can ever be a mathematically pure definition of software quality that transcends all possible software in all possible scenarios.\n\nI also wonder if this a dangerous idea, that if objective proxies for quality become popular that business pressures will cause developers to pursue these metrics at the expense of the overall quality (those aspects of quality not measured by the proxies).\n\nAnother way of thinking about quality is from the point of view of entropy. Entropy is the tendency of systems to revert from ordered to disordered states. Anyone that has ever worked on a real world, medium to large scale software project will appreciate the degree to which quality of the code base tends to degrade over time. Business pressures generally result in changes that focus on new functionality (except where quality itself is the principle selling point, e.g. in avionics software), and the eroding of quality through regression issues and 'shoe\\-horning' functionaility where it does not fit well from a quality and maintenance perspective. So, can we measure the entropy of software? And if so, how?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This a dangerous idea. \"Objective\" proxies for quality lead directly to management rewards and developers will pursue these metrics at the expense of the actual quality.\n\nThis is the law of unintended consequences.\n\nQuality \\-\\- while important \\-\\- is only one small aspect of software. Functionality and value created by the software are far, far more important than quality.\n\nAll metrics lead to activity to optimize the metric. That, in turn, has consequences that you might not really like.\n\nSoftware is very complex. It's hard to understand how truly complex it is.\n\nEven such \"obvious\" things as unit test code coverage can waste time. Getting to 100% may require creating tests that are actually more complex than the trivial code being tested. Getting to 100% coverage may involve an unacceptable cost. \\[The alternative for trivial, small, rarely\\-used code is test\\-by\\-inspection. But that doesn't fit the metrics game of 100%.]\n\nAnother example is Cyclomatic Complexity. It is one of the best measures of code quality. But it's can be gamed by creating many small functions that may be harder to read (and harder to maintain) than one larger function. You wind up in code reviews where you agree that it may not be very readable but it meets the complexity threshold."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is considering implementing objective metrics to measure code quality.

If non is \"true\", then the cable is not connected.\n\nI know how to build a \"non\\-contact voltage detector\" and a \"continuity\\-tester\", but when I made a simple rectifier\\-bridge with 4x 1N4004 diodes I measured voltage around 100V between ground and DC\\- and I don't want to continuity\\-test on that!\n\nSo what am I missing? How can I safely make a continuity test between zero and ground on AC voltage?\n\nBest Regards\nNiclas R\u00e5dstr\u00f6m\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Without a ground wire\n---------------------\n\nIf I correctly understand the question, it's essentially like this:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gJMGN.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fgJMGN.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nIn this case, it is possible that only one of SW1 and SW2 are closed (because the timer may only interrupt one line). The simple way to detect only the situation in which both lines are closed is to simply put a (safe!) load across the line and see if current flows. A voltmeter, as shown, or neon lamp are both simple way to detect this situations.\n\nIf these are the only wires, however, there will be no reliable way to detect *which* switch is open. All you will be able to detect is whether both switches are closed or not.\n\nWith a ground wire\n------------------\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qiudF.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fqiudF.png)\n\nIf you also have a safety ground wire, there is another option because the ground and neutral wires should be at the same potential. In the case that SW1 is open, neither D1 nor D3 will be lit. If SW2 is open, only D3 will be lit.

If you don\u2019t try the balance the currents, a branch may get slightly more current than the others, which will make the LEDs in the branch slightly hotter, changing the U\\-I characteristics such that the branch will get more current, and you have thermal runaway. I think a 1\u03a9 resistor in each branch should be enough. \n\nThe pulse current is the maximum current allowed in the LED for a short time (for example if one wants to flash the led for a still picture camera). The max current should be the maximum current the LED can accept, probably with perfect thermal dissipation. I\u2019d rather not use currents much higher than the nominal current.\n\nYour calculations for resistor values and power dissipations look fine to me.\n\nEdit: it is **not** fine. First, if the maximum current in your LEDs is \\\\$4 \\\\times 90\\\\textrm{mA} \\= 360\\\\textrm{mA}\\\\$ you should certainly not design a current regulator for a higher current, or you will burn your LEDs. You should rather design it for a lower current to ensure you won\u2019t burn them. I\u2019d go for \\\\$4 \\\\times 60\\\\textrm{mA} \\= 240\\\\textrm{mA}\\\\$. Then, you\u2019d get \\\\$\\\\textrm{R5} \\\\parallel \\\\textrm{R6} \\= \\\\frac{0\\.7\\\\textrm{V}}{0\\.24\\\\textrm{A}} \\= 2\\.9\\\\Omega\\\\$, with \\\\$\\\\textrm{R5} \\\\parallel \\\\textrm{R6} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\textrm{R5} \\\\times \\\\textrm{R6}}{\\\\textrm{R5} \\+ \\\\textrm{R6}}\\\\$. If you choose \\\\$\\\\textrm{R5} \\= \\\\textrm{R6}\\\\$ (which is sane), you have \\\\$\\\\textrm{R5} \\\\parallel \\\\textrm{R6} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\textrm{R5}}{2} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\textrm{R6}}{2}\\\\$, hence \\\\$\\\\textrm{R5} \\= \\\\textrm{R6} \\= 5\\.8\\\\Omega\\\\$.\n\nYour circuit is more a current limiter than a current regulator. It works because when current gets (too) high, the Vbe of `T1` gets high, and then `T1` will reduce the Vgs voltage of `Q1`, which become more resistive and will reduce the current. `R7` is useful so that `T1` can reduce the voltage. Without it, you might just burn `T1` if `WHITE_GPIO` was connected to a low\\-impedence voltage source.\n\nI have no idea about the use of `R21`."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the LED driver circuit described, why is it important to include series resistors in each parallel branch of LEDs?\n\nA) To increase the overall brightness of the LEDs\nB) To reduce power consumption of the circuit\nC) To balance currents and prevent thermal runaway\nD) To allow for higher pulse currents through the LEDs\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Including series resistors in each parallel branch of LEDs is crucial for balancing currents between branches and preventing thermal runaway. As explained in the top answer, without these balancing resistors, one branch may receive slightly more current, causing those LEDs to heat up more. This change in temperature alters the voltage-current characteristics, leading to even more current flow through that branch. This positive feedback loop can result in thermal runaway and potentially damage the LEDs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because adding resistors would not increase brightness; it would actually slightly decrease it. Option B is also incorrect, as the resistors would slightly increase power consumption, not reduce it. Option D is unrelated to the function of the series resistors; pulse current capability is an inherent characteristic of the LEDs themselves."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/05/27", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/778045", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/549063/"], "docs_id": 778045, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just installed Ubuntu 16\\.04 on a Gigabyte PC.

Make sure you have enabled Steam Guard, don't reuse your Steam password on any other sites, and be sure to log out when you're done.\n* You might have trouble hooking the computer to the TV, unless they're right next to each other.\n\n**Try to run it on your laptop.**\n\nPros:\n\n* Jackbox is not the most technically demanding series of games. Your laptop might handle it just fine, even if it's got a weak graphics chipset.\n* Doesn't cost any money (assuming you already own a laptop).\n* You can test it in advance to make sure it will play well, and pick a different solution if it doesn't.\n\nCons:\n\n* Doesn't generalize to more demanding games.\n* Requires you to bring your laptop, which might be inconvenient.\n* If you have a really weak laptop, Jackbox might not run on it.\n\n**Use a cloud gaming service such as GeForce Now**\n\nPros:\n\n* Can be used to stream to any computer regardless of computing power.\n\nCons:\n\n* Usually requires installing client software, which your in\\-laws might disapprove of (so use the laptop instead).\n* Requires a strong internet connection with low latency.

My intuition is no, since it is only used to help me but not used later when the customer uses the code.\n\nI am using python and this code stays in the production version and can be toggled with a flag in a config file.

In this case it shouldn't make much of a difference, but when you're developing you should always think about keeping your code as maintainable as possible.\n* If every developer drops in random debug files all over the solution then you're going to end up with a mess when it comes to pulling this information all together. Better to have a standard process everyone follows.\n* Writing unit tests (as you mentioned in testing in your question) will be very difficult. This code won't be in the builds coming from your build server (which is the most valuable place to run unit tests) so unless you're going to do conditional compilation unit tests... yuck, I'm stopping that idea right there!\n* If this information is useful to you in development it could well be valuable to someone diagnosing issues in production. Why deprive them of data which would make their lives easier?\n\nMy suggestion would be do do something like this:\n\n```\npublic void SendFiles()\n{\n   var files = _sendDirectory.ListFiles();\n   foreach(var file in files)\n   {\n      try\n      {\n        _logging.Info($\"Sending {file} from {_sendDirectory} to remote server\"};\n        SendFile(file);\n      }\n      catch(Exception ex)\n      {\n        _logging.Error(ex, $\"There was an error sending {file} from {_sendDirectory} to remote server\"};\n      }\n   }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis not only removes the conditional compilation but provides more information which could be used to diagnose potential issues in production. To answer your original question (about testing) if \\_log is some kind of ILog object (in .NET I'd use NLog or Log4Net) then it's very easy to DI and unit test that messages (and perhaps more importantly) errors) are being logged."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is working on a file transfer system and has implemented conditional compilation for debugging purposes.

That's false *as stated*\\[1], so to avoid either saying anything actually incorrect or that someone's going to say, \"But what about ...\", I say \"in general, snarks are not boojums\".\n\nWhat's important here is that I use it mostly in the *prose* section of a paper or seminar when I'm trying to focus the reader or listener's attention on the important facets of whatever it is that I'm explaining. So getting in to a long diversion of which snarkss are not boojumss (is it the lesser\\-spotted or the warbler variety?) would be counterproductive. Saying, \"not all snarks are boojums\" tends to draw ones attention to that class of snarks which are boojums. Saying \"snarks are not boojums\" is almost guaranteed to get some smart alec saying, \"But what about greater\\-wrinkled snarks?\" (*especially* in a lecture). So \"in general, snarks are not boojums\" has the triple benefit of 1\\) being true, 2\\) focussing the attention on the key point, and 3\\) not grammatically convoluted.\n\n\\[1]: Banker and Carroll, *Identifying subspecies of snark* (1874\\)"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In mathematical and scientific writing, the phrase \"in general\" is often used.

Now if we need to measure the speed of time, is it possible? Does time actually have a speed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm going to dare to give a very brief answer that's likely not what most folks would expect, but is deeply rooted in experiment:\n\nThe speed of time is just the speed of a clock \\-\\- that is, of how fast some kind of a repeated cycle can be done.\n\nClocks thus only have meaning relative to each other. You can set one as a standard, then measure other by it, but you can never really define \"the\" time standard.\n\nThat is actually a very [Einstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) way of defining time \\-\\- which is to say, it's a very [Mach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach) way of defining time, since Einstein got much of his insistence on hyper\\-realism in defining physics quantities from Mach.\n\nNow, most likely you thought I was going to answer that there is some kind of velocity of an object along a time axis $t$ that has \"length\" in much the same fashion as X or Y or Z, not in terms of cycles. That is certainly what comes to mind for me, in fact!\n\nWhile viewing $t$ as having ordinary XYZ style length turns out to be an incredibly useful abstraction, it's difficult experimentally to make $t$ to behave *fully* like a length. The main reason is that the clock with its cycles keeps sticking in its nose and requiring that at some point, you sort of \"borrow\" a space\\-like axis from XYZ space and use that to write out a sequence of clock cycles (called proper time or $\\\\tau$) on paper. As a result, it's not *really* $t$ you are drawing in those diagrams. You are instead borrowing a bit of ordinary space and mapping clock cycles onto it, making them seem like a length more through the way you represent order them than in how they actually work.\n\nFortunately, there is a different and more satisfying approach to the question of whether time has length, one that is suggested by [special relativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Relativity), or SR. SR says in effect that XYZ space and $t$ are interchangeable, and in a very specific way. So, even though there's always a need to write out some cycles in diagrams \\-\\- proper time happens! \\-\\- you can argue that there is nonetheless a limit at which objects traveling closer and closer to the speed of light look more and more as if their time axis has been changed into a static length along some regular XYZ direction of travel.\n\nSo, by this take\\-it\\-to\\-the\\-limit kind of thinking, you can construct a more explicit concept of $t$ as an axis with XYZ\\-style length.\n\nIt also provides a pretty good answer to you question. Since proper time comes to an almost complete stop as an object nears the speed of light, you can say that you have in effect \"stolen\" the velocity of that object or spaceship through time (from your perspective or frame, not hers!) and converted it fully into a velocity through space (from your perspective).\n\nSo there is your answer: That \"stolen\" velocity along $t$ appears to correspond most closely with the velocity of light $c$ in ordinary space, since that is the real\\-space velocity at which proper time $\\\\tau$ comes (at the limit) to a complete halt. This idea that objects \"move\" at the speed of light along the $t$ axis is in fact a very common assumption in relativity diagrams. It shows up for example whenever you see a light\\-cone diagram whose cone angle is $45^\\\\circ$. Why $45^\\\\circ$? Because that's the angle you get if you assume that the \"velocity\" of light along the $t$ axis is identical to its velocity $c$ in ordinary XYZ space.\n\nNow, is there some slop in how that could be interpreted? You bet there is! The idea of a \"velocity\" in time is for example problematic in a number of ways \\-\\- just try to write it out as a derivative and you'll see what I mean. But taking such a perspective at least in terms of how to *think* of the issue gives a really nice simplicity to the units involved, as well as that conceptual simplicity in how to think of it.

One thing you need to keep in mind is that those websites are crowd sourced and so are unreliable. Also, keep in mind that when champions are counters there is usually something specific about the champion that counters the other. In low ELO a teemo will likely just try to auto Darius repeatedly taking minion aggro, losing farm, and not try to kite away from his grab. In high ELO Teemo will use bushes to avoid taking aggro and do a lot of hit/run feints so that he doesn't get grabbed easily while poking Darius down and denying him farm.\n\n**keep in mind that when champions are counters there is usually something specific about the champion that counters the other.** This statement I made in the last paragraph is the most important. As a Poppy player I'll use her for example. One of my biggest counters is Darius. Why does he counter me? Well Poppy has a passive that reduces burst damage. Darius can bleed Poppy which does low damage and doesn't get reduced by her passive. Darius's ult also ignores Poppy's passive since it does true damage. This means that any trades they make Darius will win out because Poppy's greatest tool for reducing damage is negated. After the trades Poppy can't easily walk away because Darius can grab her and prolong the trade even more. This makes it EXTREMELY dangerous for Poppy to try to farm minion waves at all levels. Another example, Poppy vs Irelia. Irelia counters Poppy because she is more of an AA champion who does true damage and can slow/stun. If Poppy is winning in a trade, Irelia gets a free stun to prolong free damage and has an ability that does true damage. Rumble counters Poppy because she can safely burn Poppy with the low amounts of fire damage which don't get reduced by her passive.\n\nI'll look at another specific counter. Everyone knows that Trundle is a counter to Renekton but if you try to fight Renekton as Trundle early you will lose. Early game is simply about focusing on farming/sustaining as Trundle in this matchup. The reason Trundle counters Renekton is that Trundles ult essentially gets stronger from Renekton's ult. Renekton gets bonus health and Trundle simply steals that bonus health along with armor/MR on top of that. If you are the Renekton player going into this matchup and understand the counter you will realize that the first item you want to rush is a damage item. That's because if you get tanky first you are simply spending gold on stats for trundle to steal.\n\nEssentially, in order to counter Poppy you use a champion who doesn't get reduced damage vs her passive. You can apply this to other champions. If they have a strength that is negated or a weakness they can exploit by picking a champion, it's generally considered a counter in a broad sense. Keep in mind that all counters aren't equal though. You might pick a Riven to counter a Gnar.... but a good Gnar player will understand what makes Riven beat a Gnar in lane and focus on negating that advantage to make the lane more even.\n\nMany people will pick a champion against another simply because they want to **counter** them. The problem with this is that they won't understand what it is about the champion that counters the other champion and the way they play them won't actually be a counter because they don't understand reasoning for the counter."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the most accurate statement about champion counters in League of Legends, according to the information provided?\n\nA) Champion counters are absolute and will always result in an easy win for the countering champion.\n\nB) Counter information on websites is always reliable and should be followed without question.\n\nC) A champion counter is effective primarily because of specific mechanics or abilities that negate or exploit the opponent's strengths or weaknesses.\n\nD) Picking a counter champion guarantees success, regardless of the player's understanding of the matchup.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the documentation emphasizes that \"when champions are counters there is usually something specific about the champion that counters the other.\" It provides examples like Darius countering Poppy due to his bleed and true damage negating her passive, and Trundle countering Renekton because his ultimate becomes stronger when stealing Renekton's bonus stats. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the document mentions that \"all counters aren't equal\" and a skilled player can still play around counters.\n\nOption B is wrong as the text specifically states that crowd-sourced websites are \"unreliable.\"\n\nOption D is incorrect because the document points out that many players pick counters without understanding why they work, which doesn't actually result in countering the opponent effectively."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/12/16", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/344371", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/101635/"], "docs_id": 344371, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose I want my book to start with Chapter 3 starting on a right\\-hand page with page number 10\\.\n\nHere is my code:\n\n```\n\\documentclass[12pt,extrafontsizes,twoside,openright,final]{memoir}\n\\usepackage{lipsum}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\tableofcontents\n\n\\setcounter{page}{9}    \n\\setcounter{chapter}{2} \n\n\\include{ch3}\n\\include{ch4}\n\\include{ch5}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\n(The file `ch3.tex` contains simply `\\chapter{Charlie} \\lipsum`.

For every galoisian extension $K\\|\\\\mathbb{Q}$, we have the subset $S(K)\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{P}$ consisting of those primes which split (completely) in $K$. The question is about characterising such subsets; we call them **galoisian** subsets.\n\nIf $T\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{P}$ is galoisian, there is a unique galoisian extension $K\\|\\\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $T\\=S(K)$, cf. Neukirch (13\\.10\\).

Can this remark now be illustrated by some striking example ?\n\n**Addendum** (28/02/2010\\) [Berger](http://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/~lberger/)'s recent Bourbaki expos\u00e9 1017 [arXiv:1002\\.4111](http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.4111) says that cases of the Fontaine\\-Mazur conjecture have been proved by Matthew Emerton as well. I didn't know this at the time of asking the question, and the unique answerer did not let on that he'd had something to do with Fontaine\\-Mazur...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think it is easiest to illustrate the role of the Langlands program (i.e. non\\-abelian class field theory) in answering this question by giving an example.\n\nE.g. consider the Hilbert class field $K$ of $F :\\= {\\\\mathbb Q}(\\\\sqrt{\\-23})$; this is a degree 3 abelian extension of $F$, and an $S\\_3$ extension of $\\\\mathbb Q$. (It is the splitting field of the polynomial $x^3 \\- x \\- 1$.)\n\nThe 2\\-dimensional representation of $S\\_3$ thus gives a representation\n$\\\\rho:Gal(K/{\\\\mathbb Q}) \\\\hookrightarrow GL\\_2({\\\\mathbb Q}).$  \n\nA prime $p$ splits in $K$ if and only if $Frob\\_p$ is the trivial conjugacy class\nin $Gal(K{\\\\mathbb Q})$, if and only if $\\\\rho(Frob\\_p)$ is the identity matrix, if and only\nif trace $\\\\rho(Frob\\_p) \\= 2$. (EDIT: While $Frob\\_p$ is a 2\\-cycle, resp. 3\\-cycle, if and only if $\\\\rho(Frob\\_p)$ has trace 0, resp. \\-1\\.)\n\nNow we have the following reciprocity law for $\\\\rho$: there is a modular form $f(q)$, in fact\na Hecke eigenform, of weight 1 and level 23, whose $p$th Hecke eigenvalue gives\nthe trace of $\\\\rho(Frob\\_p)$. (This is due to Hecke; the reason that Hecke could handle\nthis case is that $\\\\rho$ embeds $Gal(K/{\\\\mathbb Q})$ as a dihedral\nsubgroup of $GL\\_2$, and so $\\\\rho$ is in fact induced from an abelian character of the\nindex two subgroup $Gal(K/F)$.)\n\nIn this particular case, we have the following explicit formula:\n\n$$f(q) \\= q \\\\prod\\_{n\\=1}^{\\\\infty}(1\\-q^n)(1\\-q^{23 n}).$$\n\nIf we expand out this product as $f(q) \\= \\\\sum\\_{n \\= 1}^{\\\\infty}a\\_n q^n,$\nthen we find that $trace \\\\rho(Frob\\_p) \\= a\\_p$ (for $p \\\\neq 23$),\nand in particular, $p$ splits completely in $K$ if and only if $a\\_p \\= 2$.\n(For example, you can check this way that the smallest split prime is $p \\= 59$;\nthis is related to the fact that $59 \\= 6^2 \\+ 23 \\\\cdot 1^2$.).\n(EDIT: While $Frob\\_p$ has order $2$, resp. 3, if and only if $a\\_p \\=0$, resp. $\\-1$.)\n\nSo we obtain a description of the set of primes that split in $K$ in terms of\nthe modular form $f(q)$, or more precisely its Hecke eigenvalues (or what amounts\nto the same thing, its $q$\\-expansion).\n\nThe Langlands program asserts that an analogous statement is true for any\nGalois extension of number fields $E/F$ when one is given a continuous\nrepresentation $Gal(E/F) \\\\hookrightarrow GL\\\\\\_n(\\\\mathbb C).$ This is known\nwhen $n \\= 2$ and either the image of $\\\\rho$ is solvable (Langlands\\-\\-Tunnell) or $F \\= \\\\mathbb Q$ and $\\\\rho(\\\\text{complex conjugation})$ is non\\-scalar (Khare\\-\\-Wintenberger\\-\\-Kisin).\nIn most other contexts it remains open."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the Galois extension K/Q where K is the Hilbert class field of F = Q(\u221a-23).

A prime splits completely when the trace is 2, not 0. Trace 0 corresponds to Frobenius elements of order 2.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect.

No. There isn't an integer number of weeks per month, so there is no way to reliably split the weeks that overlap month boundaries. You could apportion the week according to the number of days which fall within each month, but that doesn't take account of day\\-of\\-week effects, and with weekly data there is no way of estimating day\\-of\\-week effects.\n4. Badly. See my blog post on this (<http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/longseasonality/>).

That can be done within an exponential smoothing framework (the TBATS model) or within an ARIMA framework (a regression with ARMA errors).

Energy is generated through whatever mechanism (steam/mechanical, photo\\-voltaic) and is then stepped up via a HV substation for long distance transmission. Large factories (Steel Mills, Microchip Plants, etc.) may have a substation dedicated to them for their operations. Otherwise, a substation steps HV down to MV for smaller scale distribution (factories, large office buildings, etc.). This is repeated again for LV, for delivery to homes and small businesses. It's a simple model, albeit misleading because it presents a linear chain of flow from source to load, with a single source generator of power.

Looking some more into it, I couldnt find any version of this snubber without a resistor, so I wonder how do I estimate a good value to deal with some possible ringing? Is there a ballpark I can work with? Is it even necessary? I've driven long cables and motors just with the diode without apparent issues.

Unfortunately you have to guard this case separately, the usual way to do it would be with an `if ... generate` statement.\n\n```\nsome_loop: for i in 0 to 3 generate\n    if i = 0 generate \n       ... \n    end generate;\n    if i > 0 generate \n       ... \n    end generate;\nend generate some_loop;\n\n```\n\nA limitation of the `if ... generate` construct is that (before VHDL\\-2008\\) there is no `else` part. So you either need the unfortunately clumsy form above, or update to the [latest ghdl release (0\\.33\\)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ghdl-updates/) for its much improved VHDL\\-2008 support, which allows you to replace the second `if ... generate` with an `else`.\n\nIf you are assigning every element of some array or record called `something` simultaneously, you may find this alternative style simpler and cleaner:\n\n```\nsomething(0) <= '0';\nsome_loop: for i in 1 to 3 generate\n    something(i) <= foo(i-1, i-1);\nend generate some_loop;\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In VHDL, when implementing a loop that references previous array elements (e.g., i-1), which of the following is the most appropriate and flexible approach to handle the case where i=0?\n\nA) Use a single generate loop without any conditional statements\nB) Use an if...generate statement with separate cases for i=0 and i>0\nC) Always use VHDL-2008's else clause in if...generate statements\nD) Avoid loops entirely and use direct assignments for all array elements\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because a single generate loop without conditionals would cause index out of range errors.\nOption B is correct as it provides a flexible solution that works across VHDL versions, handling the i=0 case separately.\nOption C is not universally applicable as VHDL-2008 features may not be supported in all environments.\nOption D is impractical for larger arrays and doesn't leverage the benefits of generate loops.\n\nThe if...generate approach allows for proper handling of the i=0 case while still using loops for efficiency.

If your electrical circuit is properly installed, undamaged and being properly used then it should not trip. Even just a $5 breaker being repeatedly reset could damage the panel, resulting in a $1000 repair. \n\nIf you do get a power strip and it does trip before the electrical panel circuit breaker then it would likely be because the trip time\\-curve of the power strip is not designed to accommodate the power curve of the microwave, and you won't be fixing the problem, just delaying the inevitable, and possibly damaging the electronics of the microwave due to a disorganized power shutdown.\n\nResidential \"thermal\\-magnetic\" breakers don't trip instantly at 20\\.1 amps. They are designed to trip under conditions that damage wiring, on an inverse time curve for thermal overload conditions, low overcurrents such as 1\\.5x the rating should trip between 90 and 300 seconds, 5x the rating should trip in 4 to 10 seconds, and a high magnetic inrush or short circuit of 10x or more they trip instantly. \n\n[![Circuit breaker time curve](https://i.stack.imgur.com/I9zaK.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/I9zaK.jpg)\n\nFor instance if you have a 1200 watt power hungry coffee maker and a 1800 watt microwave (actual ratings of my appliances) on the same circuit then you have 3000 watts on a 2400 watt circuit. (Code requires kitchen circuits be 20A, 20A x 120V \\= 2400 watts.) That 125% overload should hold for at least 5 minutes, and if it never trips it would still be within NEMA specs.\n\nThose numbers really create a situation that a microwave tripping a breaker means some real circuit evaluation is necessary. Your microwave is faulty and drawing enormous overloads, a circuit breaker is failing, you have a loose connection that could cause arcing that could start a fire, or your combination of loads is greatly overloading your wires and repeated resetting and resuming abuse will create expensive repairs."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner frequently experiences their microwave tripping the circuit breaker in the basement.

Those questions should all be closed because they never meet the quality guidelines. That's not what I'm asking about here. What I'm asking about is just the elementray nature of the question. If the question is elementary, but otherwise meets our quality and topical requirements, is it off\\-topic?\n\nI have always thought that [Stack Overflow is for professional and enthusiast programmers, people who write code because they love it](https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic).

Or it's steamy because the air is hot and humid (the heat is coming from outside). Not sure which situation is more common, though. So I'd like to hear some opinions. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a really interesting question, and upon Googling, I found out that there has been much debate on whether the breath one exhales in a temperate climate is referred to as a 'steamy breath' or simply just, 'breath'.\n\nOf course, the reason for this occurrence is because of a scientific process is called condensation. When you exhale when it's cold outside, the water vapor in your breath condenses into lots of tiny droplets of liquid water and ice (solid water) that you can see in the air as a cloud, similar to fog.\n\nHowever, it is argued that steam is only produced when water is heated, and when we exhale, the process occurring is condensation, so is it technically correct to use the phrase 'steamy breath'?\n\nThe description of the white, cloudy gas when exhaled is simply referred to as \\- vapour:\n\n> a substance diffused or suspended in the air, especially one normally liquid or solid\n\nI think that the word 'steamy' here is used because of the similar observation is made when boiling \\- white solid gas appears. However, it is scientifically wrong to refer to it as a 'steamy' breath, as steam is,\n\n> the vapour into which water is converted when *heated*, forming a white mist of minute water droplets in the air\n\nAlthough the act of both steaming and exhaling in a cold climate both lead to similar observations, the process occurring in both scenarios are different. The 'steamy breath' can simply be referred to as 'breath', for example,\n\n> \"I can see my breath when I exhale.\"\n\nIn the case of your example, 'steamy breath' implies the fact that they have just took part in an intense activity, and are currently holding back their breath because of waiting for something to happen.\nSimilarly, another word used in the same context would be *bated breath*, meaning\n\n> the condition of waiting for something to happen; subdued breathing due to high emotion\n\n'Steamy breath' most likely originated from areas with cold climates, due to description of the white clouds and the same observation of that with boiling, that is why, 'steamy' breath."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the scientific process behind visible breath in cold weather?\n\nA) It is a result of steam production due to the heat of exhaled air meeting cold temperatures.\nB) It occurs due to condensation of water vapor in exhaled breath when it meets colder air.\nC) It is caused by the rapid heating of cold air by warm breath, creating steam.\nD) It is the result of ice crystals forming instantly in exhaled air due to freezing temperatures.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The visible \"steam\" we see when exhaling in cold weather is not actually steam, but rather the result of condensation. When warm, moist air from our lungs meets the cold outside air, the water vapor in our breath condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water and ice crystals. This creates the visible cloud-like appearance, similar to fog. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the process doesn't involve true steam production. Steam is formed when water is heated to its boiling point, which isn't happening in this case.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the air isn't being rapidly heated to create steam. The process is actually the opposite \u2013 warm breath is being cooled by the surrounding air.\n\nOption D is partially true in that ice crystals can form, but it's not the primary process and doesn't explain the visible effect fully.

In which conditions? I would guess only when the degree of the trend is a multiple of the lag used in the filter.\n\nA simple example of seasonal integration with a seasonal period $m$ is a series made up of $m$ alternating independent random walks. That is, take random walks $x\\_{1,t},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,t}$ and form a series $y\\_{\\\\tau}$ of the form\n$$\nx\\_{1,1},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,1},x\\_{1,2},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,2},x\\_{1,3},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,3},\\\\dots .\n$$\nA seasonally differenced process then will be \n$$\n\\\\Delta x\\_{1,2},\\\\dots,\\\\Delta x\\_{m,2},\\\\Delta x\\_{1,3},\\\\dots,\\\\Delta x\\_{m,3},\\\\dots\n$$\nwhere $\\\\Delta x\\_{i,t}:\\=x\\_{i,t}\\-x\\_{i,t\\-1}$. So seasonal differencing applied on $y\\_{\\\\tau}$ is equivalent to simple differencing applied on the alternating component series. The same is true for higher\\-order seasonal differencing of $y\\_{\\\\tau}$ vs. higher\\-order simple differencing of the component series. So from this point on we can consider simple differencing of the component series instead of seasonal differencing of the original series.\n\nIf $x\\_{i,t}$ has a linear trend, $\\\\Delta x\\_{i,t}$ will no longer have it.  \n\nIf $x\\_{i,t}$ has a quadratic trend, $\\\\Delta x\\_{i,t}$ will have a linear one, but $\\\\Delta^2 x\\_{i,t}$ will have none.  \n\nAnd so on for higher\\-order polynomial trends vs. higher\\-order differencing.\n\n> Second, are both the seasonal differencing and the simple (repeated) differencing interchangeable?\n\nNo, they are not intechangeable.  \n\nConsider the setup presented above.  \n\n*Seasonal* differencing only involves simple differencing of the alternating component series. Therefore, $x\\_{i,s}$ never gets \"mixed up\" (i.e. added to or subtracted from) $x\\_{j,t}$, where $i\\\\neq j$. The different component series remain separated, and a seasonal difference of $y\\_{\\\\tau}$ of order $D$ can be written as an alternating sequence of simple differences of order $D$ of the component series.  \n\nMeanwhile, *simple* differencing of $y\\_{\\\\tau}$ \"mixes up\" the component series: you get values like $x\\_{2,1}\\-x\\_{1,1},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,1}\\-x\\_{m\\-1,1},x\\_{1,2}\\-x\\_{m,1},x\\_{2,2}\\-x\\_{1,2},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,2}\\-x\\_{m\\-1,2},x\\_{1,3}\\-x\\_{m,2},x\\_{2,3}\\-x\\_{1,3},\\\\dots,x\\_{m,3}\\-x\\_{m\\-1,3}$ etc. I do not think you could \"unmix\" the components by taking higher order simple differences, it would rather go the other way around \\-\\- you would be involving even more different series (up to a point where all series are involved, of course).\n\n> Is working with a time series by first taking out the trend and then seasonality the same as working with a t.s. by first taking out the seasonality and then the trend?\n\nI guess it depends on how exactly you are doing this. Algebraically this is certainly possible; you can always write $(x\\_t\\+s\\_t)\\+t\\=(x\\_t\\+t)\\+s\\_t$ where $s\\_t$ stands for the seasonal component and $t$ for a linear time trend.

Which of the following approaches is the most comprehensive and correct way to address this problem?\n\nA) Simply add the line `protected $_canUseInternal = true;` to all payment method models.\n\nB) Create a custom payment method specifically for backend use, setting `$_canUseInternal = true`, `$_canUseCheckout = false`, and `$_canUseForMultishipping = false`.\n\nC) Check each payment method model, add `protected $_canUseInternal = true;` where missing, create necessary blocks and templates for admin use, and verify that the payment methods are designed to work in the backend.\n\nD) Revert to the previous Magento version 1.8, as version 1.9.2.4 is incompatible with backend payment methods.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most comprehensive and correct approach. It addresses multiple aspects of the problem:\n\n1. It recognizes that the `$_canUseInternal` property needs to be set to true for payment methods to appear in the backend.\n2. It acknowledges that simply adding this property may not be sufficient for all payment methods.\n3. It includes the step of creating necessary blocks and templates for admin use, which may be required for some payment methods to function properly in the backend.\n4. It emphasizes the importance of verifying that each payment method is actually designed to work in the backend, as some may not be.\n\nOption A is incomplete as it doesn't address the potential need for additional backend-specific code.

The issue affects all of them but it's easier to deal here with just one.\n\n> ```\n> #!/bin/bash\n> screen -dmS xccda \"$(cd /root/constella && ./daemon.sh)\"\n> \n> ```\n\nIf you're declaring this as a `bash` script, don't use `sh` to run it. Either set the permissions and run it as `./main.sh` or else use the right shell `bash main.sh`.\n\nNow, why the script appears to hang. The `screen` session is passed a double\\-quoted string. Somewhat simplistically this means that the shell is allowed to evaluate expressions and variables beginning with `$`. You have included an `$( ... )` instruction, which tells the shell to execute its contents and replace the entire string with the result of whatever it has written to *stdout*. Obviously for that replacement to occur the command has to complete. But yours doesn't. Furthermore, you didn't want the output anyway.\n\nIn summary,\n\n1. Use the correct shell interpreter\n2. Don't use double quotes here \\- use single quotes so that the shell won't parse the contents\n3. Don't try to evaluate the command and use its output. Just execute it.\n\nHere is the revised start of your script; remember to apply similar changes throughout:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\nscreen -dmS xccda 'cd /root/constella && ./daemon.sh'\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You have created a bash script to launch multiple screen sessions, but it's not working as expected.

A shell account that exists to run nothing and only establish the VPN connection.\n2. A main account that will run the programs you wish to ensure only get access to the network once it has been properly secured with a VPN.\n\nSo, with fast user switching enabled, you can log out of the main account. This ensures that no programs or processes from that user will continue running in the background. Most OS X apps are well behaved, and suspend network access when they don't have an active window on\\-screen, but you'd have to monitor and test this forever to be sure nothing is happening \\- logging out is simpler to maintain.\n\nNow, you could also replace \"account\" above with OS and run a virtualization system like Fusion (or Parallels or any other) and only start the guest OS once the host OS has secured everything on a VPN. Depending on the VM software you choose, you also may have control over the network and can turn on and off access even when the guest OS (or OSes) are running.

The product owner does not discuss the details of how it will be done and stops the discussion if team tries so. This applies to all work items (new UI, new API or changes to existing UI/API). Product Owner's reasoning is that getting into the details (both technical \\& functional) of how it will be done is something that needs to happen during sprint and discussing it during grooming is not correct. The effort estimation also happens based upon this discussion.\n\nBut during sprint planning, approved items are taken for the sprint and expectation is that if work item is approved, team should know all the details of the solution and should be able to complete the item in sprint. What happens is team spends first 2\\-3 days in doing the research and getting the PO's approval for the solution (UI design, key business logic clarification).

These PO's better come with a rough UX spec to the planning meeting. In other cases this skill is more present inside the team. Those teams handle the UX design as part of the implementation. The problem arises if the PO has strong opinions about the UI, but fails to communicate in advance what he wants. That is unfair towards the team. \n\nIn short, if it affects the acceptance of a work item, then the PO should not avoid the question at planning meeting.\n\nOn the other hand, you can't expect him to have all the answers prepared, the team must also think actively and give him some options to choose from. \n\nOne good way to approach this at the planning meeting, is to formulate questions to the PO as \"would you accept the story if ...\". \n\nBack to your questions:\n\n> Should the team say no in approving the item unless team understands how the solution will look like?\n\nYes, if the PO is unable to give clarity on what he will accept and what not. \n\n> Should the work item be splitted into research/analysis in which solution prototype will be proposed to the PO? Once the PO will approve the prototype, the main work item will be marked approved.\n\nIf for a certain work item, you all feel an iterative approach would be best (\"let's see how this works, and then decide if it needs a change\"). Then it is better to split it into two items. But don't think of step 1 as a prototype, make it \"potentially shippable\" based on current understanding of the team and PO. The PO can always define work items to improve it later. \n\n> Any other suggestion as to how it can be handled in better way?\n\nSome teams or PO's will prepare rough UX specs (wireframe) before the planning meeting: Aim for early failure.
