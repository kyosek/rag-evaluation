Last one I played was Pok\u00e9mon Yellow on my Gameboy.\n\nEver since then, a lot has changed in the Pok\u00e9mon World. I've tried going through Bulbapedia and Pok\u00e9mon Wikia, but still find there's a lot of new stuff, which just seems confusing:\n\nBreeding, Wifi, items, etc.\n\nAnyway, can anyone give me the main pointers to update myself for playing these games? Or links to the basic information which I definitively should know in order to enjoy it?\n\nAlso, can I catch the dear Pok\u00e9mons from previous versions in the wild or via special events? (Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander, etc.)\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is a brief overview of some of the major mechanic changes (with links to Bulbapedia in the header of each section):\n\n**[Special](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Special_move) / [Physical](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Physical_move) Split**:  \n\nRaven Dreamer already covered this very well in [his answer](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/12601/pokemon-generation-iv-platinum-pearl-diamond-whats-new-since-gameboy-versio/12602#12602), but basically, instead of the type of the move distinguishing whether it's a special or physical attack, it's now based on the attack itself. (For example, Fire Punch is now a physical move, as punching is a physical action).\n\n**[Breeding](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Breeding)**:  \n\nSince Generation II, you can breed two Pok\u00e9mon to obtain a Pok\u00e9mon egg, which will hatch into a Pok\u00e9mon. To breed them, you must put a female and a male (or any gender and Ditto) in the Day Care, and leave them. However, these Pok\u00e9mon must belong to the same [Egg Group](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Egg_group) in order for anything to happen. The Pok\u00e9mon that hatches from the egg will be the female Pok\u00e9mon you put in the Day Care, or the Pok\u00e9mon that isn't Ditto. The male Pok\u00e9mon is in charge of passing down attacks to the offspring. They can pass down any move that the offspring would be able to learn by level\\-up, TM, and certain [Egg Moves](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Egg_moves) (attacks that can't normally be learned by the offspring by either former method, but are programmed in as Egg Moves). Now, there are a **gigantic** amount of other mechanics behind breeding (ie. how the game determines what [IVs](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/IVs) to pass on, what nature to pass on, etc.), but you should probably just read the Bulbapedia article linked.\n\n**New Types**:  \n\nDisgruntledGoat touched on this in [his answer](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/12601/pokemon-generation-iv-platinum-pearl-diamond-whats-new-since-gameboy-versio/12616#12616) , but I'll mention it shortly here. Generation II introduced the [Dark](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dark_(type)) and [Steel](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Steel_(type)) types. Dark types were created to counter the overpowered Psychic types, and the Steel type was introduced as a defensive typing (the only type resistant to Dragon, as Generation II added Dragon attacks other than Dragon Rage). Magnemite and Magneton became Electric / Steel from Electric (the only type change between generations).\n\n**New Attacks:**  \n\nI suppose this is a bit of a given, but there are many attacks that have been added to the Pok\u00e9mon series. In addition, Game Freak occasionally changes the properties of certain moves between generations, generally to balance the game. For example, the attack [High Jump Kick](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hi_Jump_Kick_(move)) has had many changes since it was made. It was a 85 base power move in Generation I, II, and III. In Generation I, the user takes 1 HP damage if the attack misses. In Generation II or III, the user takes half the damage it would have done if the attack misses. The damage of High Jump Kick was increased from 85 to 100 in Generation IV, and again from 100 to 130 in Generation V. However, in Generation V the PP of it was reduced from 20 to 10 and the recoil damage from missing is half of the user's health.\n\n**[Natures](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Natures)**:  \n\nSpeaking of Natures, Generation III introduced natures, which basically modify a Pok\u00e9mon's stat. There are 5 neutral natures, and 20 natures which increase one stat by 10% and decrease another by 10% (one nature for each possibly). For example, if I took two Pikachu with the exact same IV spread: one Bashful (neutral nature) and one Lonely (\\+Attack, \\-Defense), and trained them the exact same way (to ensure the EVs were the same), the Lonely one would have 10% more Attack and 10% less Defense than the Bashful one. In addition, Nature also determines what flavours of Pok\u00e9block / Poffin a Pok\u00e9mon likes / dislikes.\n\n**[IVs (Individual Values)](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/IVs)**:  \n\nThis particular change doesn't really concern casual Pok\u00e9mon players (heck, most people probably don't even know what IVs are), but instead of IVs being able to be 0 \\- 15 (as they were in Generation I and II), they can now be anywhere from 0 \\- 31 (Generation III and on).\n\n**[EVs (Effort Values)](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Effort_values)**:  \n\nYet another mechanic that is invisible to the player but exists. Generation I had an EV system (at that time known as Stat Experience) where defeating a Pokemon gave the EVs of it's base stats, and the difference between a level 100 trained Pokemon's stats and a level 100 untrained Pokemon's stats was `(\u221aStat Experience) / 4`. Since Generation III, each Pokemon has an EV value assigned to it (Zubat has 1 speed EV), and defeating the Pokemon gave that amount of EVs. While the maximum gain per stat has remained the same (up to 63 points higher on a fully trained Pok\u00e9mon), the total number of EV points a single Pok\u00e9mon has been capped to 127 total EVs in Generation III and on. More information in the article.\n\n**[Hold Items](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hold_item)**:  \n\nIn Generation I games, you could use items but not let your Pok\u00e9mon hold them. However, since Generation II, you can now let your Pok\u00e9mon hold items. The effects from these items could be anywhere from healing your Pok\u00e9mon if they get low on health to raising the power of certain moves.\n\n**[Abilities](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokemon_Abilities)**:\nAbilities were introduced in Generation III. Each Pok\u00e9mon species has one or two abilities programmed in (and occasionally a third [Dream World](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokemon_Abilities) ability in the case of [Generation V](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Generation_V)). Abilities can have effects in battle (such as Intimidate which lowers the opponents Attack upon switching in) and sometimes outside of battle (Compoundeyes raises the chance of a wild Pok\u00e9mon holding an item by 50%).\n\n**[Double Battles](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Double_battle) and [Triple Battles](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Triple_battle)**:\nGeneration III added Double Battles, where you send out two Pok\u00e9mon and the opponent does the same. When you attack, you get to chose which Pok\u00e9mon to target, and some moves will target multiple Pok\u00e9mon (for example, Rock Side hits both of your opponent's Pok\u00e9mon). Generation V added Triple Battles, which is similar to Double Battle except for the obvious difference that each trainer uses three Pok\u00e9mon. The left Pok\u00e9mon cannot attack the opponent's Pok\u00e9mon on the right side, and vice versa.\n\n**[Time of Day System](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Time)**:  \n\nGeneration II introduced a time of day system, adding another level of realism to the game. Certain events are only triggered at certain times of day \\- for example, wild Hoothoot only appear at night and certain police officers in\\-game will only challenge you at night.\n\n**[Day of the Week System](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Time)**  \n\nIn addition to the day and night system, Generation II also added a day of week system, where certain events are only triggered on certain days (for example, you can only enter the Bug Catching contest in HeartGold and SoulSilver on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays).\n\n**[Seasons](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Seasons)**:  \n\nGeneration V (yet to be released outside of Japan) built on the last two systems yet again, and added in a season system. The entire overworld changes it's appearance at different seasons, and certain areas become inaccessible / accessible at certain times of the year. Each season lasts one month, so all the seasons will appear 3 times a real year. Spring occurs in January, May, and September, Summer in February, June, and October, Autumn in March, July, and November, and Winter in April, August, and December.\n\n**[Pok\u00e9mon Contest](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Contest) / [Pok\u00e9mon Super Contest](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokemon_Super_Contest) / [Pok\u00e9athalon](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokeathalons) / [Pok\u00e9mon Musical](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Musical)**  \n\nSince Generation III, there have been various events that you could partake in if you wanted to take a break from battling. Ruby and Sapphire introduced the Pok\u00e9mon Contest: a two\\-stage event where your Pok\u00e9mon is first judged on various characteristics (beauty, cuteness, coolness, smartness, or toughness) that can be improved by feeding them [Pok\u00e9blocks](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokeblocks) \\- an item created from blended berries. The second stage consists of your Pok\u00e9mon using it's attacks to impress the judges (different attacks have different appeal levels and secondary effects).\n\nDiamond and Pearl improved on this with the Pok\u00e9mon Super Contest, a three\\-stage competition where you dress up your Pok\u00e9mon, have them dance, and then impress the judges with their attacks. Instead of using Pok\u00e9blocks to increase their characteristics, you bake [Poffin](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Poffin), a bun\\-like food.\n\nHeartGold and SoulSilver has something completely different known as the Pok\u00e9athalon. Your Pok\u00e9mon compete in a series of three mini\\-games, controlled via the touch screen. Depending on how well you do, you gain points, and these points can be spent on items to help you outside of the Pok\u00e9athalon. Instead of the characteristics that the contests use, 5 Pok\u00e9athalon stats were introduced \\- Speed, Power, Skill, Stamina, and Jump. Unlike the contest characteristics, the Pok\u00e9athalon stats are pre\\-determined by the species of the Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nBlack and White added the Pok\u00e9mon Musical. The first stage is similar to the first stage of the Super Contest, where you dress up your Pok\u00e9mon. Your Pok\u00e9mon then perform in the musical, and if the audience likes their performance (determined by how your Pok\u00e9mon are dressed), they will throw items that you can keep."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about changes in the Pok\u00e9mon games since Generation I (Red/Blue/Yellow) is NOT correct?\n\nA) The Special/Physical split means that moves are now categorized as Special or Physical based on the individual move rather than its type.\n\nB) Breeding was introduced in Generation II, allowing players to obtain Pok\u00e9mon eggs by leaving compatible Pok\u00e9mon at the Day Care.\n\nC) Natures were introduced in Generation III and affect a Pok\u00e9mon's stats, increasing one stat by 10% while decreasing another by 10%.\n\nD) The EV (Effort Value) system was completely overhauled in Generation III, changing from a percentage-based system to a point-based system with a maximum of 510 total EVs per Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct - The Special/Physical split was indeed introduced, separating moves based on their individual characteristics rather than type.\n\nB is correct - Breeding was introduced in Generation II, allowing players to obtain eggs from compatible Pok\u00e9mon at the Day Care.\n\nC is correct - Natures were introduced in Generation III and do affect stats as described.\n\nD is incorrect - While the EV system did change in Generation III, the maximum total EVs per Pok\u00e9mon is 510, not 127 as implied in the question.

I.e. if a principal component with high variance explanation is found, this is interpreted, that there is a common cause for all the variables that load onto this common factor. However, in a simulation, I find that other factors may be recovered, which puts some doubt on this causal interpretation. Here is the code I use for my simulation:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nN <- 10000\n\nset.seed(298471979)\n\n# Random variance not explained by any of the factors\nv.error <- 0.01\n# Remaining variance\nv.g <- (1-v.error) / 2\n\n# LATENT variables that should be recovered statistically\ng1 <- rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.g))\ng2 <- rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.g))\ng3 <- rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.g))\n\n# Observed data caused by latent variables\ny1 <- g1 + g2 + rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.error))\ny2 <- g2 + g3 + rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.error))\ny3 <- g1 + g3 + rnorm(N,0,sqrt(v.error))\n\nY <- cbind(y1,y2,y3)\n\npca <- prcomp(Y, scale. = T, center = T)\n\n```\n\nNow under the causal interpretation of the PCA results, I would expect my PCA to recover $g\\_1$, $g\\_2$, and $g\\_3$. However, the actual rotation matrix I get is:\n\n```\nRotation (n x k) = (3 x 3):\n         PC1          PC2        PC3\ny1 0.5785666 -0.002218839  0.8156321\ny2 0.5767353  0.708224186 -0.4071792\ny3 0.5767469 -0.705984121 -0.4110346\n\n```\n\nWhich indicates a common underlying cause for $y\\_1$, $y\\_2$, and $y\\_3$ (which is not what I actually generated). My first guess, was that the $g\\_i$ may not be perfectly uncorrelated (in fact they are not) and hence the PCA is trying to account for this slight correlation. However, a theoretical analysis showed that I would get a similar rotation matrix even for perfectly uncorrelated $g\\_i$.\n\nIn fact, if I do the same thing theoretical and define\n\n$y\\_1\\=g\\_1\\+g\\_2\\+\\\\epsilon\\_1$ with $\\\\epsilon\\_1 \\\\sim N(0,\\\\sigma^2\\)$ \n\nand similar for $y\\_2$ and $y\\_3$, I find that if I try to recover $g\\_1$ as \n\n$g'\\_1\\=(y\\_1\\-y\\_2\\+y\\_3\\)/2$ \n\nand $g\\_2$ as \n\n$g'\\_2\\=(y\\_1\\+y\\_2\\-y\\_3\\)/2$ \n\nthen I have a covariance between $g'\\_1$ and $g'\\_2$ that can be calculated to be \n\n$Cov\\[g'\\_1,g'\\_2]\\=\\\\sigma^2/4\\.$\n\nSo the recovered variables are in fact not orthogonal. However, if I manually do the eigenvalue computation, I get the eigenvector structure of\n\n$\\\\left\\\\{\\\\pmatrix{1\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\},\\\\pmatrix{0\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\\\-1\\\\\\\\},\\\\pmatrix{1\\\\\\\\\\-1/2\\\\\\\\\\-1/2\\\\\\\\}\\\\right\\\\}$\n\nand this closely matches the rotation matrix of the PCA.\n\nSo when does this causal interpretation of a PCA actually make sense? Or is this interpretation always incorrect, similar to mixing up correlation and causation? Also on a related note, are there exact conditions when a PCA might be able to find the original factors? \n\n**EDIT:**\n\nSorry for not clearly distinguishing between \"factors\" and \"components\". Since both are often treated very similarly, I also tend to mix them up from time to time. My question, however, can partially be related to both. \n\nThe situation I am trying to describe is where there are three (unobservable) latent variable $g\\_1$, $g\\_2$, $g\\_3$. However, these are not observable independenlty, but only as their combinations $y\\_1$, $y\\_2$, and $y\\_3$. Since the $y\\_i$ result from the $g\\_i$ it should be possible to reconstruct those. \n\nI am aware, that it is possible to use a PCA to decorrelate data (by multiplying with the rotation matrix) and then reconstruct the original (observable) data back from the decorrelated variables (by multiplying with the transposed rotation matrix). But this is not what I am after, I would like to retrieve the latent unobservable variables.\n\nA true factor analysis (using `factanal`), in this case, produces very similar results:\n\n```\nLoadings:\n   Factor1\ny1 0.710  \ny2 0.703  \ny3 0.703 \n\n```\n\nwhich almost matches the first component I found using a PCA. Also `factanal` wont let me retrieve more than one factor from $Y$.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the absence of any specific clarifying context, \"performance\" is just a synonym for \"quality.\"\n\nThe sentence \"I want a model that performs better\" is essentially the same as the sentence \"I want a higher\\-quality model.\" Readers understand that the speaker is not satisfied with how well the model solves some particular problem, but the reader does not know, precisely, what about the model is dissatisfactory. Does the model predict too many false positives? Or false negatives? Does it predict incorrect classes for images that have a tilted horizon, or are taken on cloudy days? Understanding what about the model needs improvement would require further, specific elaboration.\n\nLikewise, if someone says that Adam has better performance than another optimizer, they're making a claim that Adam does better at some task, which they would have to specify for it to be possible to assess the truthfulness of the claim.

The terminations you're working with (pressure setscrew lugs) are much better at handling aluminum wire than the wrap\\-type terminal screws or backstabs on receptacles and switches, the aluminum wire that you buy now is made from a *different alloy* with better properties for building wiring than the aluminum wire that gave aluminum its bad rap, and the busbars and lugs *themselves* on your breakers and panels are likely made from plated aluminum, too.\n\nSo, that said, I'd use 2AWG, wet\\-location\\-rated (THWN or XHHW\\-2\\) aluminum wire for both hots and the neutral with an 8AWG or 6AWG (8AWG works, 6AWG might be more useful for grounding electrode conductors though) bare copper ground wire.

I'd at a *bare minimum* put a small 20 or 24 slot, 100A panel in as the garage subpanel \\-\\- if you can afford something with more slots in it, *do so*, as often you can get kits with the panel, a main breaker, and some 15 and 20A branch breakers.

It also advocates for using aluminum wire (2 AWG) for hots and neutral due to its cost-effectiveness and improved modern alloys, with a copper ground wire (8 AWG or 6 AWG). The answer also suggests using a larger subpanel (20+ slots) for future expandability, rather than a small 8-slot panel.

In fact in the book it is also suggested to make each strategy object a singleton.\n\nThe problem I have is that some strategies I envision for my program need states/fields. Either because they are path\\-dependent in their behavior or because I want them heterogeneous (a statistical distribution of similar strategies, if you prefer).   \n\nThis forces me to break both Java Effective suggestions: I instantiate a new strategy for each user class AND each of these strategies contain its own fields.   \n\nIs that very bad? Should it be done differently?\n\nIt was suggested to me to keep the fields that make the strategy heterogeneous in the class that uses it and then pass it as an argument. I find that very anti\\-oo. Those fields don't belong to the user class. In fact, if that class uses another strategy it might not need those fields at all. That seems to run against the reason I am using the strategy pattern in the first place.   \n\nMostly I am just very confused\n\n---\n\nI make a simple example here. Imagine you have a class Gambler, which represents somebody making bets on horses. Now this class will require a strategy predictStrategy that will work something like this:\n\n```\ninterface predictStrategy{\n    public Horse predictWinningHorse(HorseRace r);\n}\n\n```\n\nNow, I can have many implementations where the strategy is to choose at random, or pick the white horse or whatever. That's easy.   \n\nImagine though that I implement a strategy that looks at past predictions and somewhat \"learns\" from its past mistakes. Clearly each strategy will have to have its own memory on which to learn. I might have to add one more method to the interface (or make an extension)\n\n```\ninterface predictStrategy{\n    public Horse predictWinningHorse(HorseRace r);\n\n    public void addObservation(HorseRace r, Horse oldPrediction, Horse actualWinner);\n}\n\n```\n\nSo that the Gambler class calls \"strategy.addObservation(...)\" at the end of each race to improve its predictive power.  \n\nCan this be **really** be done with a *stateless* strategy object? It seems impossible to me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would argue that each instance should remain stateless once it is constructed, i.e., it should not maintain extra state across invocations that changes based on the parameters. A classic example is a tax calculator.\n\n```\ninterface TaxCalculator {\n    /**\n     * Calculates the tax for the given purchase price and shipping charges.\n     * All values are in pennies to avoid rounding.\n     *\n     * @param subtotal total price of all items ordered\n     * @param shipping cost of shipping the order\n     * @return calculated tax\n     */\n    int calculate(int subtotal, int shipping);\n}\n\nclass NoTax implements TaxCalculator {\n    public int calculate(int subtotal, int shipping) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\nclass FixedPercentOfSubtotal implements TaxCalculator {\n    private final int ratePercent;\n\n    public FixedPercentOfSubtotal(int ratePercent) {\n        this.ratePercent = ratePercent;\n    }\n\n    public int calculate(int subtotal, int shipping) {\n        return subtotal * ratePercent / 100;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nWhile `FixedPercentOfSubtotal` has a member (state), it's provided at construction time and never changes. You could store one instance per state, making them quasi\\-singletons.\n\n**Update**\n\nNeither the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) nor this [Strategy Pattern](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StrategyPattern) page make any stipulation that implementations should not maintain state across calls. It's less common because strategies are designed to be interchangeable and pluggable at runtime, but I wouldn't rule it out.\n\nHowever, that you needed to add a new method to enable that one strategy implementation is a red flag. Other implementations may not need it. Will you define it in the interface anyway? It may make more sense to have the historical\\-tracking strategy implement `RaceListener` and add it to the race track instance. This would allow it to be shared among multiple users as a singleton."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is implementing a Strategy pattern for a horse race prediction system.

It allows for both stateless and stateful strategies without compromising the overall design or forcing unnecessary complexity on simpler strategies."}, "13": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/03/03", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/4905", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/1879/"], "docs_id": 4905, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We don't want to put out poisons, and we have tried most everything else with no success:\n\n* vibrating pegs\n* traps\n* water in the holes\n* pepper\n\nIts to the point where we're ready to pave over the lawn.

Strictly speaking, magnetic dipole is a collection of two magnetic poles with non\\-zero magnetic dipole moment (the Coulomb magnetic moment). It is a useful model of a magnet from the Coulomb theory of magnetostatics, where magnetic field *can* do work on magnetic poles; in this theory, force on physical magnetic dipole made of two particles with magnetic pole charge $q,\\-q$ at positions $\\\\mathbf r\\_1,\\\\mathbf r\\_2$ is\n\n$$\n\\\\mathbf F \\= q \\\\bigg(\\\\mathbf H(\\\\mathbf r\\_1\\) \\-\\\\mathbf H(\\\\mathbf r\\_2\\) \\\\bigg).\n$$\nDeriving the formula for potential energy for such a dipole in magnetic field\n$$\nE\\_p \\= \\- \\\\mathbf m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf B\n$$\nis easy, the derivation is just like that for potential energy of an electric dipole in external field in electrostatics.\n\nWhen you ask how\n\n$$\nE\\_p \\= \\- \\\\mathbf m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf B\n$$\n\nis consistent with the idea that magnetic field cannot do work on charged particles (due to the Lorentz formula), you are asking about *magnetic moment* that is due to a current loop, not about magnetic moment due to magnetic dipole (which belongs to the theory above).\n\n**Energy of magnetic moment in external magnetic field**\n\nThe potential energy formula\n\n$$\nE\\_p \\= \\- \\\\mathbf m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf B\n$$\n\nis still valid in a limited sense for systems where the magnetic moment $\\\\mathbf m$ is due to a current loop, but it is harder to derive. It is easier to derive it in special cases, such as magnetic moment due to loop of current.\n\n**Work of external forces on a current loop in changing external magnetic field**\n\nConsider a planar current loop, placed in an external field $\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext}$ that we can control. Let the loop be in unstable position in the magnetic field (held in place by some external forces), so that magnetic field is $\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext,1}$ (rougly in the direction of the $z$\\-axis), the current is $I\\_1$ (negative), $\\\\mathbf S \\= A\\\\mathbf e\\_z$ is the surface area vector of the circuit, and magnetic moment is $\\\\mathbf m\\_1 \\= I\\_1 \\\\mathbf S \\= I\\_1 A \\\\mathbf e\\_z$ (roughly of opposite orientation to the magnetic field).\n\nThen during a small time interval $\\\\Delta t$ we slowly increase the external magnetic field by a little to a value $\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext,2} \\= \\\\mathbf B\\_{ext,1} \\+ \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf B\\_{ext}$.\n\nDue to this change, during that time the current will experience induced electric field due to external sources $\\\\mathbf E\\_{i,ext}$ and entire circuit will experience induced EMF that boosts the current in the original direction. As this proceeds, the external induced electric field will do work on the current, and since this is a conservative system, this work will get stored in the system (as increased magnetic energy). So we can use this work to define potential energy:\n\n$$\n\\\\text{increase of potential energy when going from state 1 to state 2} :\\= $$\n$$\n\\\\text{work of external induced electric force on the current}.\\\\tag{\\*\\*}\n$$\n\nFormally\n\n$$\nE\\_{p,2} \\- E\\_{p,1} \\= \\\\Delta W.\n$$\n\nWe can express the work done as function of magnetic field and magnetic moment of the current loop. The procedure could be as follows.\n\nWork done during $\\\\Delta t$ can be expressed as the product\n\n$$\n\\\\Delta W \\= \\\\mathscr{E}\\_{ext} I\\_1 \\\\Delta t\n$$\nwhere $\\\\mathscr{E}\\_{ext}$ is external induced EMF. This is, due to Faraday's law, equal to minus rate of change of magnetic flux due to external magnetic field through the circuit:\n\n$$\n\\\\mathscr{E}\\_{ext} \\= \\- \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf S}{\\\\Delta t}\n$$\n\nCombining the two last equations, we get\n\n$$\n\\\\Delta W \\= \\- \\\\Delta\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf S I\\_1\\.\n$$\n\nHowever the circuit has, initially, the magnetic moment\n\n$$\n\\\\mathbf m\\_1 \\= I\\_1 \\\\mathbf S.\n$$\n\nSo the work done is\n\n$$\n\\\\Delta W \\= \\- \\\\Delta\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf m\\_1\\.\n$$\n\n**Defining potential energy for a \"frozen\" magnetic moment**\n\nIf the current loop system is such that current (and thus also magnetic moment) stays almost the same during all the changes of external field we do, we can approximate and say the only changing term on the right\\-hand side of work done (above) is the external magnetic field. This may be the case when there is already a much greater current in the system than the current changes we can cause by the external magnetic field. Then we can define the following potential energy function of the external magnetic field:\n\n$$\nE\\_p (\\\\mathbf B\\_{ext}) \\= \\- \\\\mathbf m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf B\\_{ext}. \\\\tag{\\*}\n$$\n\nAs long as $\\\\mathbf m$ changes only negligibly during all changes of magnetic field we do, this potential energy obeys (\\*\\*). This is somewhat applicable to a ferromagnet in a weak external magnetic field. Its magnetization and magnetization current is almost \" frozen\" and changes only very little due to weak external field.\n\n**The correct potential energy for the current loop in perfect conductor**\n\nThe potential energy derived above *is not* valid for an ordinary current loop when the current is entirely induced by changes in external magnetic field.\n\nIn general, if the magnetic moment changes are partially non\\-conservative (e.g. the changes of magnetic moment produce some heat inside), then there is no potential energy that can be defined.\n\nHowever, if our current loop system is conservative (perfect conductor), exact potential energy function can still be derived.

Let me argue why this is impossible.\n\nWe can assume w.l.o.g. that the coordinates $(u,v)$ on the tangent plane to $\\\\mathbb{S}^2$ at $q$ were chosen so that $\\\\exp\\_q$ maps the axis $(u,0\\)$ to the great circle connecting $q$\u00a0and\u00a0$p$, and more precisely, if $0\\<\\\\delta\\<\\\\pi$ is the distance between $q$\u00a0and\u00a0$p$ on $\\\\mathbb{S}^2$, that $\\\\exp\\_q$ takes $(\\\\delta,0\\)$ to\u00a0$p$. Furthermore, we can similarly assume on the coordinates $(u',v')$ of the tangent plane at\u00a0$p$ that $\\\\exp\\_p$ maps the axis $(u',0\\)$ to the same great circle and takes $(\\-\\\\delta,0\\)$ to\u00a0$q$. Then $\\\\exp\\_q(u,0\\)$ is the point obtained by traveling a distance $u$ on $\\\\mathbb{S}^2$ starting from $q$ in the direction of\u00a0$p$, and $\\\\exp\\_p(u,0\\)$ is the point obtained by traveling a distance $u$ on $\\\\mathbb{S}^2$ starting from $p$ in the direction opposite to\u00a0$p$, thus $\\\\psi(u,0\\) \\= (u\\-\\\\delta,0\\)$ for $u$ in the neighborhood of\u00a0$0$, hence everywhere by analytic extension.\n\nOn the other hand, if $(u,v)$ lies on the circle $C$ with radius $\\\\pi$ around the origin then $\\\\exp\\_q$ takes $(u,v)$ to the antipode $\\\\tilde q$ of\u00a0$q$. But the inverse image of $\\\\tilde q$ by $\\\\exp\\_p$ is discrete (since $\\\\exp\\_p$ is a diffeomorphism outside of circles of radius $k\\\\pi$ around the origin which are mapped to either $p$ or its antipode $\\\\tilde p$, and we are assuming $p,q,\\\\tilde p,\\\\tilde q$ distinct); and $\\\\psi$ must map $C$ (which is connected) inside this inverse image: so $\\\\psi$ must be constant on\u00a0$C$. But this contradicts the fact that $\\\\psi(\\\\pi,0\\) \\= (\\\\pi\\-\\\\delta,0\\)$ and $\\\\psi(\\-\\\\pi,0\\) \\= (\\-\\\\pi\\-\\\\delta,0\\)$ (as per previous paragraph) are not equal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A stealth missile M is launched from a space station at an unknown direction with constant speed v_m.

I think it is per GR.\n\nI am sure this also fits into mathematics, otherwise people would not be making this argument.\n\nI may be wrong, and please feel free to correct me if you think so. But I do not think that is the case \\- i.e. mass/momentum does not approach infinite.\n\nMy simple argument is \\- if the mass/momentum of a moving particle approaches infinite and such a particle moving at speeds close to $c$, then it would be almost impossible to stop that particle. In other words, it should be equally difficult/impossible to slow it down.\n\nWe all know that though it is not possible to accelerate the particle further, but it is no big deal to slow it down. Slowing down an infinite mass/momentum would not be that easy. **Infinite mass reasoning must apply both ways \\- in speeding up as well as in slowing down. Has it been experimentally shown that it also applies to slowing down at limits close to $c$?** \n\nTherefore, I can argue that mass/momentum does not approach infinite, it is the forces that are rendered ineffective at such speeds because the force itself propagates at $c$ and can not accelerate anything as fast as itself, or faster. Force is rendered ineffective only in direction of motion (acceleration), not in opposite direction (slowing down).\n\n**Analogy how force may become ineffective** \\- In a way, we can not accelerate a car that is already going at 300 miles/hr by pushing with our hands, because humans can not move their hand as fast. But we can accelerate a car going at 5 miles an hour. As the speed gets closer and closer to that of force $c$, the force can not push it any more. Same way as we can not move our hand faster than 300 miles/hr and can not accelerate that car by pushing on it. But slowing down would be effective, dangerous and fatal though.\n\nPlease correct if I am missing something, instead of blank down voting.\n\n**Considering formula given by John Rennie in his answer \\-** \n\n\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\n\nThe momentum of an object of mass $m$ moving at velocity $v$ is:\n\n$$ p \\= \\\\gamma m v \\= \\\\frac{mv}{\\\\sqrt{1 \\- \\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$\n\nwhich goes to infinity as $v \\\\to c$. In the limit of $v \\\\ll c$ the Lorentz factor $\\\\gamma \\\\approx 1$ and we recover the Newtonian approximation.\n\n\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\n\nSame math can be applied to effectiveness of the force. *Only thing is that v is the velocity (only positive) component in the direction of the force. So, for slowing down, it will be 0, or $\\\\gamma \\\\approx 1$*\n\nThe effective force $F1$ when particle is moving at velocity $v$ and a force $F$ is applied:\n\n$$ F \\= \\\\gamma F1 \\= \\\\frac{F1}{\\\\sqrt{1 \\- \\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$\n\nThis way, the math does not change either.\n\nSo at limits close to $c$, the force must be fully effective in slowing down and pretty much ineffective in accelerating.\n\n**I am proposing below experiment to prove/disprove the concept. If someone is aware of such an experiment being done, please share the results.** \n\n1. Make a particle accelerate at \\~highest speed that the accelerator can achieve.\n2. Once this \\~speed is achieved, continue to apply the force for another 1 minute. The particle should gain negligible speed during this 1 minute, but should gain a lot of momentum (per momentum formula)\n3. Now stop the accelerating force and start an equal slowing force. I.e. reverse the force.\n\nPer the current (infinite mass/momentum) explanation, 1 minute of slowing should reduce the speed by negligible \u2013 same speed that was gained during last 1 minute of acceleration. Because force is rate of change of momentum and same force in both directions should cause same change of momentum/speed during same amount of time.\n\nBut per my explanation, a lot more slowing down will take place during the 1 minute because gamma becomes zero for slowing down.\n\nI think evidence and results of such experiment being done, can answer this question definitively. But equivalent other answers would help too \\- like evidence of the 7 Tev energy of protons being physically measured rather than just being calculated via the momentum formula.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question is founded on an incorrect assumption.\n\nThe math absolutely *is* symmetric between acceleration and deceleration (because velocity enters in to the Lorentz factor squared), and we have machines that take advantage of this fact.\n\n[Energy recovery linacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_recovery_linac) work in exactly the manner linacs usually work, only the field timing is maintained 180 degrees out of phase from the acceleration mode. This means that instead of the particle gaining energy at the expense of the field, the field gains energy at the expense of the particle. The forces are the same as in the accelerating case only opposed to the direction of motion, and the particle exhibits the same magnitude of coordinate acceleration (i.e. very little because it is highly relativistic) in the lab frame only slowing rather than speeding up."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: An experiment is conducted with a particle accelerator to test relativistic effects. A proton is accelerated to 99.99% of the speed of light, then subjected to an equal but opposite force to decelerate it. Which of the following statements is true regarding this experiment?\n\nA) The proton will decelerate much faster than it accelerated, because the relativistic mass effect only applies to acceleration.\n\nB) The proton will decelerate at the same rate as it accelerated near the end of its acceleration phase, due to the symmetry of relativistic effects.\n\nC) The proton cannot be decelerated at all once it reaches such high speeds, due to its infinite relativistic mass.\n\nD) The proton will decelerate more slowly than it accelerated, because the force becomes less effective at higher speeds in both directions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The relativistic effects, including the increase in relativistic mass and the corresponding difficulty in changing velocity, apply equally to acceleration and deceleration. This symmetry is mathematically described by the Lorentz factor, which depends on the square of the velocity (v^2/c^2). As a result, a particle moving at 99.99% of the speed of light will experience the same resistance to change in velocity whether it's being accelerated or decelerated. This principle is utilized in energy recovery linacs, where highly relativistic particles are decelerated to recover energy from the beam."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/02/29", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/114835", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/25134/"], "docs_id": 114835, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is an exercise in Stephen Abbott's *Understanding Analysis* that states:\n\n> **Exercise 5\\.3\\.7\\.

For a simple complexity interface I would increase the number of functions to be just the most specific calls to a given set of use cases. You might be lucky and find that if there are only 10 different use case actions where an actor might need different combinations of required and optional arguments then one might just create ten different functions for this.\n\nThis may not be the best solution however if there are a large combination of arguments and use cases to consider.\n\nCheck out the [Builder Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern#PHP)\n\nThe premise of the Builder pattern is that your object class will contain a special builder class object that can construct your object through function calls that return the same object. This allows for fluid code that is much more verbose and clear to a client of the API. This can be much more useful in representing a function's parameters than an extremely long list of arguments and prevents the common problem of a client accidentally mismatching arguments.

Both ends of the call are both server (inbound connections) and client (outbound connections). \nUsually, a dynamic high numbered port is used for the voice channel. A clients control channel is used to pass the voice connection IP and port opened by the client to the opposing call client within the control channel payload. Each client then initiates a voice channel (RTP mentioned above), resulting in one voice channel each way. In your case the home office client would pass the local IP (192\\.168\\.2\\.41\\), not the virtual IP (192\\.168\\.178\\.128\\) of the far end of the VPN. This results in the main office client attempting to connect to an unroutable IP rather than the virtual IP.\n\nYour remote VPN softclient must be able to pass a routable IP to the office client for the voice channel connection or you need a firewall capable of SIP session inspection and management (aka a SIP gateway). \n\nSome softclients can do a reverse cone connection (remote client initiates all call paths) to mitigate virtual IPs and NAT on a VPN. You can look for that function in your soft client docs. Otherwise, the local IPs of both VoIP clients must be transparently and directly routable by both clients. \n\nIf you have a STUN server running, enabling STUN on the client will give the client a way to lookup its virtual IP on the office end of the VPN and use that IP for registration and SIP sessions. Both server and home client must be enabled to work. Note, the STUN service must be running on a server that is directly routable by the PBX (no NAT).

But shouldn't the opposite be true? I mean if you pull particles further apart doesn't the force they apply on each other decrease because the distance between them increases? Kinda like gravity?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First we need to understand the force between individual atoms. At relatively large separations (e.g., a few atomic diameters) atoms attract each other with a force that does, as you suggest, get weaker with distance due to polarization and ionic effects that we needn't go into here. If that was all there was to the story, however, collections of atoms would all end up at zero separation, become arbitrarily dense, and spontaneously form black holes. There would be no \"rods\" in the first place!\n\nFortunately, at very small separations, atoms *repel* each other due to the large positive charges on their nuclei. That repulsive force is much stronger than the attractive force at small separations, but falls off much faster as the separation increases. \n\nAs a result there is a unique separation at which the attractive force is balanced by the repulsive force. Moreover, this equilibrium separation is *maintained* (i.e., it is a \"*stable* equilibrium\") due to the facts that\n\n1\\) If the atoms are actively pulled apart to a slightly larger separation distance, the now larger attractive force will try to pull the atoms back together and \n\n2\\) If the atoms are actively pushed together to a slightly smaller separation distance, the now larger repulsive force will try to push the atoms back apart.\n\nAll of the above is illustrated in the graph below. Notice that the attractive and repulsive forces balance at the equilibrium separation producing zero net force.  \n\n![Attractive, repulsive, and net interatomic forces as functions of interatomic separation](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yu8S9.jpg)\nNotice also that for small increases in separation the net force becomes attractive. Notice especially, that for very, *very*, small increases in separation (the kind that you get when you try to stretch a rod) the net force, the \"stress,\" becomes more attractive in nearly direct (i.e., linear) proportion to the *increase* in separation, the \"strain.\"\n\nFinally, notice that, if you increase the separation by *enough*, then the net attractive force *does* start decreasing again \u2026 as you'd expect if you rip the atoms far enough apart."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A rod is subjected to a tensile stress.

For small strains, the stress-strain relationship in a rod is indeed linear. This is due to the unique balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms at their equilibrium separation. \n\nWhen a small tensile stress is applied:\n1. The atoms are pulled slightly further apart.\n2. This small increase in separation causes the net interatomic force to become more attractive, almost linearly proportional to the increase in separation (strain).\n3. This linear relationship between the net force (stress) and separation increase (strain) holds true for small deformations.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the attractive force between atoms does decrease with distance at larger separations, this is not the dominant effect for small strains.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the stress-strain relationship is only linear for small strains. For very large strains, the relationship becomes non-linear.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it reverses the actual behavior.

This practice was especially common in the early 20th century.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using a woman's own first name with \"Mrs.\" (e.g., Mrs. Jane Smith) was actually considered incorrect by many etiquette writers of the early 20th century.\n\nOption B is false because the passage states that a widow \"was and still is addressed with the same title as when she was married,\" not differently.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the use of \"Mrs.\" before a woman's maiden name was not widely accepted. The passage specifically states that it was \"rarely used\" and considered incorrect by many etiquette experts.\n\nOption D correctly reflects the historical norm described in the passage, where a married woman would be addressed using her husband's full name, as in \"Mrs. John Smith.\""}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/11/22", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/47433296", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/710955/"], "docs_id": 47433296, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have this JSON data:\n\n```\n{\n\"InfoA\" : [256,256,20000],\n\"InfoB\" : [256,512,15000],\n\"InfoC\" : [208,512,20000],\n\"DEFAULT\" : [256,256,20000]\n}\n\n```\n\nWith [JSON\\-to\\-Go](https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/), I get this Go type definition:\n\n```\ntype AutoGenerated struct {\n    InfoA   []int `json:\"InfoA\"`\n    InfoB   []int `json:\"InfoB\"`\n    InfoC   []int `json:\"InfoC\"`\n    DEFAULT []int `json:\"DEFAULT\"`\n}\n\n```\n\nWith this code ([play.golang.org](https://play.golang.org/p/k_ly0IGH1A))\n\n```\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n    \"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    type paramsInfo struct {\n        InfoA   []int `json:\"InfoA\"`\n        InfoB   []int `json:\"InfoB\"`\n        InfoC   []int `json:\"InfoC\"`\n        DEFAULT []int `json:\"DEFAULT\"`\n    }\n    rawJSON := []byte(`{\n\"InfoA\" : [256,256,20000],\n\"InfoB\" : [256,512,15000],\n\"InfoC\" : [208,512,20000],\n\"DEFAULT\" : [256,256,20000]\n}`)\n    var params []paramsInfo\n    err := json.Unmarshal(rawJSON, &params)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err.Error())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nI get error `json: cannot unmarshal object into Go value of type []main.paramsInfo` \n\nI don't understand why.

This is because whenever $a$ and $b$ are numbers,\n\n$$\\\\operatorname{Var}(aX\\+bY) \\= a^2\\\\operatorname{Var}(X) \\+ b^2\\\\operatorname{Var}(Y) \\+ 2ab\\\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) \\= \\\\pmatrix{a\\&b}\\\\mathbb A\\\\pmatrix{a\\\\\\\\b}.$$\n\nApplying this to your problem we may compute\n\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}\n0 \\\\le \\\\operatorname{Var}(aX\\+bY) \\&\\= \\\\pmatrix{a\\&b}\\\\pmatrix{121\\&c\\\\\\\\c\\&81}\\\\pmatrix{a\\\\\\\\b}\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= 121 a^2 \\+ 81 b^2 \\+ 2c^2 ab\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\=(11a)^2\\+(9b)^2\\+\\\\frac{2c}{(11\\)(9\\)}(11a)(9b)\\\\\\\\\n\\&\\= \\\\alpha^2 \\+ \\\\beta^2 \\+ \\\\frac{2c}{(11\\)(9\\)} \\\\alpha\\\\beta.\n\\\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe last few steps in which $\\\\alpha\\=11a$ and $\\\\beta\\=9b$ were introduced weren't necessary, but they help to simplify the algebra. In particular, what we need to do next (in order to find bounds for $c$) is *complete the square:* this is the process emulating the derivation of the quadratic formula to which everyone is introduced in grade school. Writing\n\n$$C \\= \\\\frac{c}{(11\\)(9\\)},\\\\tag{\\*}$$\n\nwe find\n\n$$\\\\alpha^2 \\+ \\\\beta^2 \\+ \\\\frac{2c^2}{(11\\)(9\\)} \\\\alpha\\\\beta \\= \\\\alpha^2 \\+ 2C\\\\alpha\\\\beta \\+ \\\\beta^2 \\= (\\\\alpha\\+C\\\\beta)^2\\+(1\\-C^2\\)\\\\beta^2\\.$$\n\nBecause $(\\\\alpha\\+C\\\\beta)^2$ and $\\\\beta^2$ are both squares, they are not negative. Therefore if $1\\-C^2$ also is non\\-negative, the entire right side is not negative and can be a valid variance. Conversely, if $1\\-C^2$ is negative, you could set $\\\\alpha\\=\\-c\\\\beta$ to obtain the value $(1\\-C^2\\)\\\\beta^2\\\\lt 0$ on the right hand side, which is invalid.\n\nYou therefore deduce (from these perfectly elementary algebraic considerations) that\n\n> *If* $A$ is a valid covariance matrix, then $1\\-C^2$ cannot be negative.\n\nEquivalently, $\\|C\\|\\\\le 1,$ which by $(\\*)$ means $\\-(11\\)(9\\) \\\\le c \\\\le (11\\)(9\\).$\n\n---\n\n**There remains the question whether any such $c$ does correspond to an actual variance matrix.** One way to show this is true is to find a random variable $(X,Y)$ with $\\\\mathbb A$ as its covariance matrix. Here is one way (out of many).\n\nI take it as given that you can construct independent random variables $A$ and $B$ having unit variances: that is, $\\\\operatorname{Var}(A)\\=\\\\operatorname{Var}(B) \\= 1\\.$ (For example, let $(A,B)$ take on the four values $(\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 1\\)$ with equal probabilities of $1/4$ each.)\n\nThe independence implies $\\\\operatorname{Cov}(A,B)\\=0\\.$ Given a number $c$ in the range $\\-(11\\)(9\\)$ to $(11\\)(9\\),$ define random variables\n\n$$X \\= \\\\sqrt{11^2\\-c^2/9^2}A \\+ (c/9\\)B,\\\\quad Y \\= 9B$$\n\n(which is possible because $11^2 \\- c^2/9^2\\\\ge 0$) and compute that the covariance matrix of $(X,Y)$ is precisely $\\\\mathbb A.$\n\n---\n\nFinally, if you carry out the same analysis for *any* symmetric matrix $$\\\\mathbb A \\= \\\\pmatrix{a \\& b \\\\\\\\ b \\& d},$$ you will conclude three things:\n\n1. $a \\\\ge 0\\.$\n2. $d \\\\ge 0\\.$\n3. $ad \\- b^2 \\\\ge 0\\.$\n\nThese conditions characterize *symmetric, positive semi\\-definite* matrices. Any $2\\\\times 2$ matrix satisfying these conditions indeed is a variance matrix.
