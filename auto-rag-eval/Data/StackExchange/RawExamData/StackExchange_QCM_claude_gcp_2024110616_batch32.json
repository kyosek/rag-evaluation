Please see the outline of my proof.\n\n**Partition**: given positive integers $\\\\{a\\_1,\\\\ldots,a\\_n\\\\}$, find a subset $S$ such that \n$$\n\\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i \\= 1/2 \\\\cdot \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n a\\_i.\n$$\n\nLet $\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n a\\_i \\=2K$. We set $b\\_i$ as follows: $b\\_i\\=e^{a\\_i/K}$ for each $i$. Then, for each subset $S$,\n$$\n\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i}{\\\\Pi\\_{i\\\\in S} b\\_i}\\= \\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i \\\\cdot e^{\\-\\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i/K}\n$$\nLet function $H(x)\\=x e^{\\-x/K}$, where $x\\=\\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i$. It is straightforward to verify that $H(x)$ is increasing in $x$ for $x\\\\leq K$; it is decreasing in $x$ for $x\\\\geq K$. Therefore, it has the unique maximum at $x\\=K$, i.e., $H(x)\\\\leq H(K)\\=K/e$. Then,\n$$\n\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i}{\\\\Pi\\_{i\\\\in S} b\\_i}\\= \\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i \\\\cdot e^{\\-\\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i/K} \\\\leq \\\\max\\_x H(x)\\=K/e.\n$$\nThus, the original problem maximized if and only if there exists a subset $S$ such that $\\\\sum\\_{i\\\\in S} a\\_i \\=K$, which is the solution to the **Partition** problem."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is working on optimizing a resource allocation problem for a large e-commerce platform. The platform needs to select a subset of products to feature in a special promotion, maximizing the ratio of total expected revenue to the product of individual price adjustments. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the computational complexity and approach to solving this problem?\n\nA) The problem can be solved in polynomial time using dynamic programming techniques.\nB) This is an NP-complete problem, reducible to the Partition problem, and likely requires heuristic approaches for large datasets.\nC) The problem can be efficiently solved using a greedy algorithm that selects products in descending order of their revenue-to-price ratio.\nD) This problem is solvable in O(n log n) time using a modified version of the knapsack algorithm.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question maps directly to the optimization problem described in the documentation, which has been proven to be NP-complete. The key insights are:\n\n1. The problem is structurally similar to the one in the documentation, with expected revenue (ai) and price adjustments (bi) corresponding to the given pairs of positive reals.\n\n2. The proof outline in the documentation shows a reduction from the Partition problem, which is known to be NP-complete.\n\n3. The transformation used in the proof (setting bi = e^(ai/K)) creates a scenario where the optimal solution corresponds to finding a subset that sums to exactly half the total, which is the essence of the Partition problem.\n\n4. Given its NP-completeness, for large datasets, exact solutions are likely infeasible, and heuristic approaches would be necessary in practice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because NP-complete problems are not known to be solvable in polynomial time. Option C is wrong because a greedy approach cannot guarantee an optimal solution for this type of problem. Option D is incorrect as the problem cannot be solved efficiently (in O(n log n) time) due to its NP-completeness.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (optimization, computational complexity, NP-completeness), applies the theoretical problem to a real-world scenario (e-commerce product selection), and tests critical thinking about algorithm selection and problem-solving approaches in the face of computational intractability."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/30", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/530762", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/333312/"], "docs_id": 530762, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Title says it all, every time I shut down I have to rerun `xinput --set-prop 11 \"Synaptics Finger\" 10 15 100` again is there any way to fix this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I had the exact same issue.

The correct answer, C, is the most robust and maintainable solution for several reasons:\n\n1. It follows the method described in the top answer, which directly addresses the issue.\n2. Using Startup Applications ensures the script runs at the appropriate time during system startup, after the graphical environment is initialized.\n3. It's user-specific and doesn't require root privileges, making it safer and more flexible than system-wide changes.\n4. It's easily maintainable, as the user can modify the script or disable it through the Startup Applications GUI.\n\nOption A is less ideal because cron jobs are typically used for scheduled tasks, not startup processes, and may run before the graphical environment is ready.\n\nOption B is problematic because .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells, which may not be appropriate for graphical session startup, and could run multiple times unnecessarily.\n\nOption D, while potentially effective, is more complex and risky, requiring system-wide changes that could affect other users or cause issues during system updates.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to evaluate different approaches to solving a persistent configuration issue, considering factors like reliability, user-specificity, and ease of maintenance."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/20", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/381461", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/139272/"], "docs_id": 381461, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have got this result.

The \"first photons\" that start the laser action are generated by spontaneous emission. They are not coherent with each other, and there are normally more than one present in the cavity at a time.\n\n> how can we make two incoherent families of photons coherent and make real laser?\n\nWhat happens is, each time a photon from group \"1\" stimulates a new emission, that puts the excited atom involved back to the ground state. This reduces the number of excited atoms available to provide gain for group \"2\". \n\nThis produces a kind of positive feedback mechanism so that if group \"1\" has slightly more photons than group \"2\", then group \"1\" will quickly starve group \"2\" of gain, and group \"1\" will come to dominate. \n\nThis is related to the *gain pinning* effect. If you increase the pump power of a laser above the threshold level, typically this doesn't increase the population inversion, because stimulated emission increases and the excited population is locked at the threshold level (while output power increases). This means the gain spectrum is also \"pinned\" at the threshold level, so if the group \"1\" photons have a frequency at the peak of the gain spectrum, but group \"2\" are slightly off the peak, then group \"2\" will not have sufficient gain to overcome the cavity loss and will quickly die away.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that group \"1\" and \"2\" are not interacting with exactly the same set of atoms in the gain medium. For example, if group \"1\" are in a different spatial mode than group \"2\" so that they overlap a different part of the gain material.

The excitation is the voltage you put into a load cell in order to\nget an output from it.\n2. The load cell's sensitivity is the ratio of its output to its input, stated in units of \"millivolts\\[of output] per volt\"\\[of input], with the full\\-scale\nrated mechanical load on the load cell.\n\nWhat that means is that if you have a load cell rated for 1000kg full\\-scale and it exhibits a sensitivity of 2 millivolts per volt, with an excitation of 10 volts it'll put out 20 millivolts when there's 1000kg sitting on it. With 500kg sitting on it and 10 volts of excitation it'll put out 10 millivolts, as it will with 5 volts of excitation and a 1000Kg load.\n\nAnd the rest of it:\n\nIn order to build up the tiny signal from the load cell into something that makes sense to feed into an ADC, you'll need to amplify that signal. \n\nThe gain of the amplifier will be determined by the ADC's full\\-scale input requirement and the Load cell's full\\-scale output, the relationship being:\n\n$$ A\\_V \\= \\\\frac{ADC\\_{\\\\ in}}{LOAD CELL\\_{\\\\ OUT}}, $$\n\nIn the case of a load cell with a 20mV output and an ADC with a 5 volt full\\-scale input, that gain would need to be:\n\n$$ A\\_V \\=\\\\frac {5V}{0\\.02V} \\= 250 $$ \n\nNow, for the nitty\\-gritty:)\n\nAfter all of that, if everything were perfect, 1000kg sitting on the load cell would result in an output of 11 1111 1111 from the ADC and 00 0000 0000 with no load on the load cell.\n\nThat's 1024 different states representing the range from zero to 1000 kg, so that range would resolve into 1024 increments of about 976\\.56 grams each, which would be the resolution of the system. \n\nIn the instrumentation world, \"offset\" means \"zero\" and span means \"gain\", so what you'll need to do to calibrate your system, once you have it all hooked up, is to make sure there's no mechanical load on the load cell, turn on the excitation supply, crank the span control up a little until you get a reading on the ADC, and wait a while until everything gets stable. Once it does, adjust the offset pot for zero, put 1000 kg on the load cell, and adjust the span control for a reading on the ADC which reflects the resolution you want. \n\nThat is, for maximum resolution set the reading to 11 1111 1111, but if you want to resolve the reading into, say, one kilogram steps for convenience downstream, set the reading to 01 1101 1000 and the count will increase by one LSB for every kilogram added to the load.

Amplifier precision:\n   0.3% of 1000kg = 3kg or 3000g\n\nThe 10-bit ADC's quantization error (option B) is the most critical factor limiting the resolution to 977g per bit, which is larger than the desired 500g resolution. Even with perfect amplification and no other errors, the ADC cannot distinguish changes smaller than its least significant bit.\n\nThe load cell's combined error (A) and temperature effect (D) are much smaller than the ADC quantization error. The amplifier's precision (C), while significant, is still less critical than the ADC's limitation in this case.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to:\n1.

Which of the following statements most accurately captures the true nature of superposition in qubits, as it relates to quantum computing?\n\nA) Superposition allows qubits to simultaneously hold both 0 and 1 values, doubling the information capacity compared to classical bits.\n\nB) Superposition represents our uncertainty about whether a qubit is in state 0 or 1 until we measure it, similar to Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment.\n\nC) Superposition is a state where the qubit has a defined probability of being measured as 0 or 1 in a specific basis, but this state itself is deterministic and basis-dependent.\n\nD) Superposition means that qubits rapidly oscillate between 0 and 1 states, allowing quantum computers to perform parallel computations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analyzing the concept of superposition beyond common misconceptions. The correct answer, C, accurately reflects the nuanced understanding presented in the documentation. Superposition is not about uncertainty (ruling out B) or simultaneous existence of definite states (ruling out A). It's also not about rapid oscillation (ruling out D). \n\nInstead, superposition is a deterministic state that, when measured in a specific basis, yields probabilistic outcomes. The key points are:\n1. The superposition state itself is well-defined and certain.\n2. The probabilities of measurement outcomes depend on the chosen measurement basis.\n3. Superposition doesn't mean the qubit is literally in two states at once, but rather in a distinct state that can lead to multiple possible measurement outcomes.\n\nThis understanding is crucial for grasping how quantum computers leverage superposition for computational advantage, without falling into oversimplified or incorrect interpretations of quantum mechanics."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/11/28", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/92224", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/33448/"], "docs_id": 92224, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We are a robotics association from ENSEIRB\\-MATMECA (Bordeaux, France).

The build command specifies a custom linker script (-T/home/kevin/ausbee-test/Software/System-CM3/link.ld), which is responsible for defining the memory layout of the compiled binary.\n\n2.

This conclusion is based on several factors:\n\n1. The error occurs occasionally (1 out of 20 or 30 times), suggesting a timing-related issue rather than a consistent coding error.\n\n2. The Form_BeforeUpdate event calls the AuditChanges procedure, which performs database operations. This introduces the potential for a race condition.\n\n3.

When I was talking, I used the term \"code\" to refer to a Python program, and he told me that he didn't know what \"code\" was, that the correct term was \"algorithm\", and that \"code\" was something else.\n\nI really didn't know how to refute him because the way I see it is that a program can be an \"algorithm\". I used that term only when I was starting to program simple programs. The word I use most is \"code\", and on the internet, almost everyone else uses that term.\n\nWhen does something go from being an algorithm to being code, if it can change. Maybe it can be both at the same time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In short, while there are differences in the specific meaning of the words, that civil engineer was being needlessly pedantic and balking at you not using his preferred word. There was no justifiable reason to disrupt the flow of conversation other than them wanting to be a clever know\\-it\\-all.\n\n---\n\nArguing over the \"algorithm\" vs \"code\" moniker is like arguing whether what I'm sitting on right now is \"furniture\" or a \"chair\". These are not exact synonyms of one another and in some cases it can be one without being the other, but the specific designation really doesn't matter in scope of the current conversation.\n\nAn algorithm is [defined as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm):\n\n> In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well\\-defined instructions for calculating a function. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.\n\nAll code is essentially an algorithm. It's a sequence of well\\-defined instructions to get the computer to do the thing you want it to do.\n\n**Can you have code that is not an algorithm?**\n\nPedants might argue that declarations (e.g. `public class Foo {}`) are not algorithms and only operations (e.g. `int c = b + a;` can be considered algorithms.\n\nI don't quite agree, as the declarations are essential to the *well\\-defined* nature of the instructions (as they define the data used in the operations). In essence, if your language's native definition of `int` is acceptable, then my custom definition of `class Foo` is as well. I see no reason to distinguish between the two in this regard.\n\n**Can you have an algorithm that is not code?**\n\nYes. Any set of calculation instructions is an algorithm. This could be a handwritten list of steps on how to e.g. calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle (i.e. Pythagoras' theorem):\n\n> 1. Square the length of each leg.\n> 2. Add them together.\n> 3. Take the square root.\n\nThis is not code, but it is an algorithm.\n\nThe furthest stretch I could give in favor of that civil engineer's argument is that you could argue that a *compiled* application is still an algorithm but has ceased to be code. But I doubt you were specifically talking about a compiled file, given that Python is an interpreted language, at which point this argument doesn't even apply in the civil engineer's favor.\n\nAs an aside, while most definitions tend to restrict algorithms to the fields of mathematics and computer science, I personally see no reason why we couldn't consider e.g. a cooking recipe as an algorithm as well. It's still a sequence of well\\-defined instructions to achieve a specific predetermined outcome. But this is maybe a subjective argument and you might feel differently."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is debating the use of terminology in their project documentation.

If so, then how did it became *v. \u2192 n.* from *adj. \u2192 adv.*? If not, where does it come from?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, \\-ment formed nouns in both Old French and Middle English. For instance, consider the etymology for *garment* (as on [Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/garment) and crosschecked with the Oxford English Dictionary or OED). \n\n> c. 1400, \"any article of clothing,\" reduced form of garnement (early 14c.), from Old French garnement \"garment, attire, clothes\" (12c.), from garnir \"fit out, provide, adorn,\" from a Germanic source (compare garnish (v.)), from PIE root \\*wer\\- (4\\) \"to cover.\"\n\n*Garnement* in Old French (a noun) was formed from a verb \\+ \\-ment. This kind of formation from Old French *\\-ment* and Latin *\\-mentum* has several examples, including the French\\-derived words *habiliment, abridgement, accomplishment,* and *commencement*, and the Latin\\-derived words *fragment, aliment,* and *ornament*. ([\"\\-ment, *suffix*,\" OED](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/116535)) \n\nSo both French and English allow for the formation of nouns from verbs with *\\-ment.* What's remarkable is that, from Old French to now, *\\-ment* could also form adverbs from adjectives, and this *didn't* carry over to English. The *[Oxford Guide to Etymology](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_Guide_to_Etymology.html?id=l0kTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q=ment%20mente&f=false)* (2009\\) summarizes its origin from the Latin ablative phrase '(adjective) mente,' which in English terms served as an adverbial: \n\n> Affixes often result from grammaticalization of adverbs or prepositions. For instance, the adverb\\-forming suffix *\\-ment* in French (and likewise Spanish *\\-mente*, Italian *\\-mente*, etc.) originates in uses of Latin *mens*, *ment\\-* in the ablative case in collocations such as *clara mente* 'with a clear mind'. Such collocations showed semantic broadening, e.g. 'clear manner of being or behaving' rather than simply 'with a clear mind', and the pattern became extended to adjectival bases which had no connection with mental activity, ultimately giving rise to a very productive adverb\\-forming suffix.\n\nWhy did the adverb\\-forming *\\-ment* not carry over to English while the noun\\-forming *\\-ment* did? There's no sure answer, but my training as a medievalist makes a hypothesis tempting. There are a few possible suffixes for forming nouns from verbs in each language because the semantic possibilities are broad, so *\\-ion* (procession), *\\-tion* (solution), *\\-er* (bidder), and others all form nouns from verbs with different senses and limitations; *\\-ment* fills a place in the Middle English system for aristocratic items as well as functions of government. (See *government*.) That incorporation fits the history of England in that period, which had French\\-derived legal institutions and a French\\-speaking aristocracy. Shortly after that point, the suffix was naturalized into English and widely applied to words irrespective of origin. (An early example is *onement*, meaning roughly concord or agreement.)\n\nHowever, one suffix tends to dominate adverb formation in each language: English has the Old English\\-derived *\\-ly* and French has the Old French\\-derived *\\-ment*. The suffixes are so widespread and actively used that there is little reason for the suffix to cross over."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about the suffix \"-ment\" in English and French, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A linguist is studying the evolution of the suffix \"-ment\" across Romance and Germanic languages.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Both English and French use \"-ment\" to form nouns from verbs, as evidenced by examples like \"garnement\" in Old French and \"garment\" in Middle English.\n2. The adverb-forming function in French (and other Romance languages) evolved from Latin ablative phrases like \"clara mente\" (with a clear mind), which underwent semantic broadening to mean \"in a clear manner.\"\n3. This adverb-forming function did not carry over to English, likely because English already had a dominant adverb-forming suffix \"-ly\" from Old English.\n4. The noun-forming function in both languages can be traced back to Latin \"-mentum\", showing a shared etymological origin.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the borrowing process and doesn't account for the shared Latin origin.

A single photon may be emitted when an electron in an atom returns down to the ground state from an excited state. In a reciprocal event, such a photon could be subsequently absorbed by a similar atom causing an electron to jump from the ground state up to the excited state.   \n\nA single photon has a wavefunction associated with it. In the case of emission, the wavefunction suddenly appears in the vicinity of the atom and then radiates out from that source. In the case of absorption, the wavefunction may be initially present over a large volume but is said to suddenly disappear (collapse) at the instant the atom gets excited. Both these events are probabilistic and follow the rules of quantum mechanics.   \n\nIn most cases, physics runs equally well forwards or backwards. Presumably this applies to the emission of a photon by one atom and its absorption by a nearby atom. However the wavefunction description of this process is dramatically asymmetric in time. If I try to run it backwards, I see a wavefunction that abruptly appears in a large volume around one atom and then magically converges towards the other and disappears.   \n\nMaybe is just part of the mystery, but is there no quantum\\-mechanical description of such an event where the description itself has time\\-symmetry?\n\n\\[Edit]   \n\n**Quantum\\-mechanical example with spatial and time symmetry:**   \n\nFor what it's worth, the following picture shows a perfect ellipsoidal cavity with two atoms \\- one at each focus. This is a pathological case, but it does seem like the transfer of the excited state from one atom to the other would involve a time\\-symmetric evolution of the wave function.  \n\n[![symmetry between initialization and measurement?](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Pknu.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Pknu.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Emission and absorption of a photon aren't instantaneous processes as long as you don't perturb the system by measuring its state. If you do, the system collapses in a non\\-reversible way. Let me explain how it evolves in the case you don't measure:\n\n### Spontaneous emission\n\nAn atom in the excited state $\\| a \\\\rangle$ emits light in the same spatial pattern as a [classical dipole antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna):   \n\n[![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3HxfN.png \"Dipole emission pattern, Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elem-doub-rad-pat-pers.svg\")](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elem-doub-rad-pat-pers.svg)  \n\nAs you correctly state in your question the emission starts out from the position of the atom and moves away from it at the speed of light. Similar to an antenna which is not damped by electrical resistance, but only by the energy it loses due to radiation, the power it emits decays over time. For the case of the atom the state $\\| a, 0 \\\\rangle$ in which the atom is in the excited state and there is no photon present evolves towards the state in which the atom is in the ground state $\\| b \\\\rangle$ and there is a photon in a superposition of many modes with different wavevectors $\\\\vec{k}$. This happens smoothly:\n$$\n\\| \\\\psi (t) \\\\rangle \\= c\\_a (t) \\\\, \\| a, 0 \\\\rangle \\+ \\\\sum\\_{\\\\vec{k}} c\\_{b, \\\\vec{k}} (t) \\\\, \\| b, 1\\_{\\\\vec{k}} \\\\rangle\n$$\nThe temporal evolution is exponential, i.e. $\\\\left\\| c\\_a (t) \\\\right\\|^2 \\= e^{\\- \\\\Gamma t}$, so that after infinite time the atom is completely in the ground state and the photon is completely emitted. For a more rigorous description see the [Wigner\\-Weisskopf theory](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01336768) as described for example in [Scully \\& Zubairy \u2013 Quantum Optics (1997\\)](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511813993) chapter 6\\.3\\.\n\n### Time\\-reversed spontaneous emission\n\nAll of the described evolution happens unitarily, hence it can happen backwards as well as forwards. If you have an atom in the ground state and prepare a photon in a spatial mode matching the emission pattern of the atom having the right temporal profile you can deterministically drive the atom into the excited state. This is described in [Stobi\u0144ska *et al.* EPL **86** (2009\\)](https://doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/86/14007). It is of course very difficult to do, because you need to focus the light from the full $4 \\\\pi$ solid angle onto the atom and find a way to shape the photon to an exponentially rising wavepacket.\n\n### Absorption of a spread\\-out photon\n\nComing back to the apparent paradox of your question: If the wavefunction of a photon is extended over a large area how does it excite the atom as if it was localized there? The answer is \"It doesn't.\". Like in the case of spontaneous emission the state of the overall system evolves in a superposition of the atom being in the ground state / the photon flying around and the atom being excited by the photon. Just that in the case of a photon not matching the spatio\\-temporal radiation pattern of the atom the probability of the atom being excited $\\\\left\\| c\\_a (t) \\\\right\\|^2$ is very low. So the majority of the wavefunction still describes a free\\-flying photon.\n\nOnly when you measure the state of the atom (or the presence of the photon) you force the system to be in either of the states. This is the moment when the whole spread\\-out photon collapses to be either absorbed or detected somewhere on a camera. The whole mystery is in the description of collapse due to measurement. But this is another topic, covered in questions like \"[Practically, how does an 'observer' collapse a wave function?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/509803/169454)\".\n\n### Is the absorption also a measurement?\n\nThere is a connection between the (partial) absorption of the photon and a projective measurement. By their interaction the atom and the photon become entangled, just like in more advanced collapse models the detector becomes entangled with the observed system. As an example consider an animal\\-friendly version of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat: A radioactive atom, which can trigger a detector and an experimentalist monitoring the detector. If the atom was alone it would evolve into a superposition of decayed and not decayed\n$$\n\\| \\\\psi\\_{\\\\text{atom}} \\\\rangle \\= \\\\alpha \\| \\\\text{decayed} \\\\rangle \\+ \\\\beta \\| \\\\text{not decayed} \\\\rangle \\\\text{.}\n$$\nIf you include the detector into the Hilbert space you can model the system of detector plus atom as an entangled state\n$$\n\\| \\\\psi\\_{\\\\text{atom \\+ detector}} \\\\rangle \\= \\\\alpha \\| \\\\text{decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{triggered} \\\\rangle \\+ \\\\beta \\| \\\\text{not decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{not triggered} \\\\rangle \\\\text{.}\n$$\nInvolving the experimentalist as well then yields the state\n$$\n\\\\begin{align}\n\\|\\\\psi\\_{\\\\text{atom \\+ detector \\+ experimentalist}} \\\\rangle \\= \\\\quad \\&\\\\alpha \\| \\\\text{decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{triggered} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{decay observed} \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\n\\+ \\&\\\\beta \\| \\\\text{not decayed} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{not triggered} \\\\rangle \\| \\\\text{no decay observed} \\\\rangle \\\\text{.}\n\\\\end{align}\n$$\nBecause the experimentalist is part of the superposition, in each branch of the wavefunction it appears to the experimentalist as if the atom is now in a definite state \u2013 as if it had collapsed from the initial superposition.\n\nSo in the end the distinction between the atom and a macroscopic detector is artificial. But it's justified, because the atom can be coherently manipulated to unentangle it from the photon. For macroscopic systems like the detector (and experimentalist) this is pretty hopeless because they have too many degrees of freedom.\n\n### Absorption of a focused photon\n\nIn the case of the elliptic cavity the emission of atom $A$ is indeed reshaped to match the spatial emission pattern of atom $B$. Despite this the probability that atom $B$ absorbs the photon is still less than $1$, because the temporal profile of the emitted photon is exponentially decaying, while perfect absorption (time\\-reversed spontaneous emission) requires an exponentially rising profile.   \n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gIP7N.png)   \n\nIf the cavity size is reduced such that the emission of the photon takes significatly longer than a round\\-trip of in the cavity, the excitation being initially in atom $A$ can be fully transfered to atom $B$ and vice versa.\n\nThe following is a simulation starting in the state\n$$\n\\| a\\_A \\\\rangle \\| b\\_B \\\\rangle \\| 0 \\\\rangle \\\\text{,}\n$$\ni.e. atom $A$ in the excited state, $B$ in the ground state and $0$ photons in the cavity.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The system evolves as a superposition of states, not through instantaneous collapse (ruling out option A).\n\n2. While the excitation does oscillate between the atoms, it's not indefinite. The probability of transfer depends on the cavity size and emission characteristics (ruling out option B).\n\n3.

Now this seems like a problem that should have been solved *decades* ago, and indeed \\- there's no shortage of logging libraries for any decent programming language. But while trying to choose among them I ran across a rather fundamental dilemma.\n\nDo I emphasize safety or performance?\n\nLet's look at both extremes. If I emphasize safety, then I should make sure that the log entry is safely stored before I proceed with work. Otherwise I could end up in a situation where my program thinks it's logged 5 log entries and has done substantial work, but then an error makes these entries disappear and later forensics turn up nonsensical results. \"I see that the program only logged up to point A, but there is already data stored which suggests it reached point B. Then where are the log entries between A and B?! What's going on here?!\" At the furthest extremes of safety this means that after I produce a log entry I also need to wait until it has been successfully flushed to physical storage. However that's a VERY expensive operation and would basically kill my program's performance, since every log call would probably take tens if not hundreds of milliseconds.\n\nOn the other extreme \\- performance. In this case I need to shove the log entry to wherever as fast as I can and move on without looking back. Another background process then can take said entry and try to write it to physical storage, but the main process is unaffected. The main risk here is the one mentioned before \\- it's easy to lose log entries if everything crashes and burns before they could be written out.\n\nAnd this whole thing is on a spectrum, of course. By employing various strategies you can make your chosen approach either safer (but slower) or faster (but riskier). And... I can't decide how to choose.\n\nIs there some commonly accepted middle ground? Has anyone every come up with a way of deciding where your particular situation should lie?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For almost any kind of system, regardless if it is a small or a huge one, it is a good idea to follow the tactics\n\n**First make right, then make it fast!**\n----------------------------------------\n\n(and: don't optimize \"just in case\").\n\nLogging (especially when done for the purpose of post mortem analysis) usually needs to be complete and not to loose the final entries, so I would recommend heavily to always start with a solution which flushes each logged line immediately to disk. Otherwise the log could become pretty useless. \n\nNow, when you have added \"enough\" logging to your application, and when you actually experience a *real, measureable* performance hit, then (and only then) start thinking about optimizations. For most real\\-world applications, it is probably enough to have a switch for turning the logging on or off. Or, if that is not sufficient, a parameter to change the logging level (like \"minimal\", \"standard\", \"verbose\"). So one can make the decision of \"safety\" vs \"performance\" at run time.\n\nThere are definitely some systems for which is not sufficient (for example, when you observe hard\\-to\\-reproduce bugs only after some hours under production load, but cannot afford full \"debug\" logging in a production environment, or when you don't have a chance to restart the system easily in \"logging\" mode after a failure, like software for a black\\-box of an airplane). \n\nIf you are really developing such extraordinary software, you might have to think of further optimizations \\- like a background process which receives logging events and can write them buffered to disk even when the main program crashes, or whatever makes most sense for the particular kind of system you are developing. However, as always with optimizations, this has to done with in\\-depth knowledge of the requirements, the use cases and the system, there is no easy \"one\\-size\\-fits\\-all\" solution to this."}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is creating a critical system for aviation that requires extensive logging.

Depending on your data, this could lead to several clusters: high buildings, low buildings, surrounding landscape. There are some issues, for example, a high tree might be just as high as a low building. \n\nAlternatively, you could perform some kind of (un)supervised classification in which you could use the height information and possibly other source of information such as not only the height information at the current location, but also the surrounding height.\n\nOnce you've determined which area of the map could be classified as city, or urban area, you could provide statistics such as mean and variance to describe the height and variations in the height.\n\nWhich analysis works well also depends on which data you are going to use. Very high resolution LIDAR data supports other analysis than very coarse SRTM images. Also take care that some height products have compensated for buildings as they where not interested in them.\n\nThen there is the question of how to do this kind of analysis. I use R and other high level programming languages to do this. These tools have a steep learning curve, but provide ultimate flexibility.

According to tests by [BigClive](https://www.youtube.com/user/bigclivedotcom/videos) (sorry, I cannot recall exactly in which video he mentions this) some batteries can be completely discharged (0 Volts), charged again and then appear to still have their full capacity. Note that the \"fully discharged\" state did not last long (hours or days perhaps).\n\n*Lithium\\-ion batteries age*\n\nThat is true but also depends everything I mention above and also how you treat the battery. For example in some military applications Li\\-Ion cells are charged not up to 4\\.1 \\- 4\\.2 V (like in many consumer products) but to 3\\.8 V or less. This places less stress in the cells making them last longer.\n\n*but I assume Apple doesn't charge the devices to 100% anyway*\n\nThat will actually be the **battery manufacturer** producing the batteries in such a way that they are at around 40% to 60% charge when finished. They're not charged or discharged as that takes too long! The charge level can be set by using the proper ratios of chemicals during production. Same as non rechargeable batteries are made to have 100% charge.\n\nIf you want to store a device for some time, I suggest charging the battery to a value between 40% to 70 % (my rough estimate). Then if possible **remove** the battery! \n\nIf removing the battery is not possible make sure that the device is switched off and store it in a location where it cannot get very hot or cold.\n\nTo protect against fire and overcharging (when the charging circuit in a product breaks) nearly **any** device will have a battery protection circuit. This will simply disconnect the battery when the battery is in danger.

The correct answer (C) combines several key points:\n\n1. Shipping at 40-60% charge aligns with the information that battery manufacturers produce batteries at this charge level for storage, which is optimal for long-term battery health.\n\n2. Limiting maximum charge to 3.8V during normal use is based on the military application example, which suggests that charging to lower voltages (instead of the typical 4.1-4.2V) reduces stress on the cells and increases longevity.\n\n3.

You can use [OGR\\_TRUNCATE](https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/ConfigOptions#OGR_TRUNCATE), but this appears to be at the layer level\n\n```\narcpy.MakeFeatureLayer_management()\n\n```\n\nIf you have writable ogr.DataSource, then ogr.DataSource.CreateLayer(...)\n\n```\narcpy.SpatialJoin_analysis()\n\n```\n\nI guess it depends on what exactly you are trying to do here. It looks like you can pretty much handle any situation in SpatialJoin with sqlite dialect (with spatialite support) and ogr.DataSource.ExecuteSQL(...). See the docs on [OGR SQL](http://gdal.org/ogr_sql.html) and the [SQLite Dialect](http://gdal.org/ogr_sql_sqlite.html). All of spatialite's functions are available with sqlite and spatialite support enabled in the build.\n\n```\narcpy.da.SearchCursor()\n\n```\n\nThe cursor in arcpy, if I remember correctly, is a generic cursor for iterating over a feature set. The equivalent in OGR is to iterate over features in a layer. To subset the features in a layer, use the ExecuteSQL(...) function above and then iterate:\n\n```\n...\nlyr = ds.ExecuteSQL(\"SELECT * FROM myLayer WHERE id < 10\")\nfor feat in lyr:\n    print(feat.GetFID())\n...\n\n```\n\nor similar. OGR doesn't care if the underlying data is a db or a shapefile (that is the point of GDAL/OGR).\n\n```\narcpy.Delete_management()\n\n```\n\nogr.DataSource.DeleteLayer(...) for a layer, ogr.Driver.DeleteDataSource(...) for an entire datasource.\n\n```\narcpy.AddMessage()\n\n```\n\nJust use print()\n\n```\narcpy.AddError()\n\n```\n\nI can't remember what that does, sorry.\n\nNo code tested, and help(ogr.Class.Func) should give you more info. @gene is right on the API not being what you'd expect.

They need to perform a spatial join operation and then iterate over the results. Which combination of GDAL/OGR functions would be most appropriate to replace the ArcPy SpatialJoin_analysis() and SearchCursor() functions?\n\nA) ogr.DataSource.CreateLayer() and ogr.Layer.GetNextFeature()\nB) ogr.DataSource.ExecuteSQL() with SQLite dialect and a for loop over the resulting layer\nC) ogr.Geometry.Intersection() and ogr.Feature.GetFieldAsString()\nD) ogr.DataSource.CopyLayer() and ogr.Layer.SetAttributeFilter()\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires understanding and integrating multiple concepts from the GDAL/OGR documentation provided. The correct answer, B, involves using ogr.DataSource.ExecuteSQL() with the SQLite dialect to perform the spatial join operation, followed by iterating over the resulting layer with a for loop.\n\nThe ExecuteSQL() method with SQLite dialect allows for complex spatial operations, including joins, by leveraging the power of SQLite's spatial extensions. This is equivalent to ArcPy's SpatialJoin_analysis(). The documentation states: \"It looks like you can pretty much handle any situation in SpatialJoin with sqlite dialect (with spatialite support) and ogr.DataSource.ExecuteSQL(...).\"\n\nFor the cursor functionality, the documentation explains that OGR's equivalent to ArcPy's SearchCursor is iterating over features in a layer. It provides an example using a for loop: \"for feat in lyr: print(feat.GetFID())\".\n\nOption A is incorrect because CreateLayer() is more akin to MakeFeatureLayer_management() and doesn't perform a spatial join. GetNextFeature() is a lower-level approach compared to the pythonic iteration.\n\nOption C uses geometry operations directly, which is not equivalent to a spatial join and cursor combination.\n\nOption D involves copying layers and filtering, which doesn't achieve the spatial join functionality required.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply GDAL/OGR concepts to real-world scenarios, requiring analysis and integration of multiple API functions to replicate ArcPy functionality in a more flexible, database-agnostic manner."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/08/08", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/195468", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/60414/"], "docs_id": 195468, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n```\n\\documentclass[twoside,11pt]{article}\n\\usepackage[english]{babel}\n\\usepackage[hang]{caption2}\n\\usepackage{enumitem}\n\\usepackage{graphics}\n\\usepackage{psboxit}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{multirow}\n\\usepackage{fancyhdr}\n\\usepackage{color}\n\\usepackage{colortbl}\n\\usepackage{colortab}\n\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\\usepackage{rotating}\n\\renewcommand{\\textwidth}{135mm}\n\\renewcommand{\\textheight}{195mm}\n\\pagestyle{fancy}\n\\fancyhead{}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{sidewaystable}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n11 & 12 & 13 \\\\\n21 & 22 & 23 \\\\\n31 & 32 & 33 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{sidewaystable}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n```\n\nerrors:\n\n```\nline 23: !

Given the code snippet and error messages, what is the most likely cause of the problem and the best solution?\n\nA) The \\sidewaystable environment is incompatible with the article document class; switch to the report class instead.\n\nB) The \\usepackage{rotating} command is missing; add it to the preamble to enable sideways tables.\n\nC) The \\begin{sidewaystable} command requires additional parameters for rotation angle; specify [angle=90] after \\begin{sidewaystable}.\n\nD) The table is too wide for the page in landscape orientation; reduce the number of columns or adjust the \\textwidth.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the error is that the LaTeX document is trying to use the \\sidewaystable environment without loading the necessary package. The rotating package provides the \\sidewaystable environment, which allows for the creation of tables rotated by 90 degrees.\n\nThe error messages \"Missing number, treated as zero\" and \"Illegal unit of measure\" are typical when LaTeX encounters an unknown command or environment. In this case, it's trying to interpret \\sidewaystable as a dimension, which it isn't.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the user needs to add \\usepackage{rotating} to the preamble of their LaTeX document. This package provides the necessary commands for rotating large objects like tables.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the article class is compatible with sideways tables when the proper package is loaded. Option C is incorrect because \\sidewaystable doesn't require additional parameters for the rotation angle; it always rotates by 90 degrees. Option D, while a potential issue in some cases, doesn't directly address the error messages shown and wouldn't resolve the immediate problem of the unknown environment.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (LaTeX packages, error interpretation, and document structure), applies to a real-world scenario of preparing scientific publications, and tests critical thinking about troubleshooting LaTeX errors rather than mere memorization of commands."}, "27": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/26", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/198392", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/91348/"], "docs_id": 198392, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As a non\\-English speaker whose native language does not have articles I am always unsure about the use of them. \nThis time I would like to clarify the use of the article \"THE\" together with positions of persons.

Are the two examples equal? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can use them with or without an article, but the meaning is ever so slightly different. When you use them without the definite article, *THE*, then you are using an official title. Grammatically it is like a name, it's a Proper Noun. In this case you need to use capital letters for the title: *Managing Director*, for example.\n\nWhen you use the titles or positions without an article, that's just a description of the person's job. Its a bit like saying *I'm a teacher*. So we can say:\n\n* Managing Director of Leo LT, Kestutis Sliuzas ...\n\nor:\n\n* The managing director of Leo LT, Kestutis Sliuzas ...\n\nThe first is a title, the second a description. When we are using the second form we have the option to use capitals if we want to: *The Managing Director ...*\n\nIn the Original Poster's example:\n\n* John Smith and the director of my department Adam Gray went to a meeting yesterday.\n\nWe need to use the definite article here. The reason is that *the director of my department* is a description, not an official title. However if you wanted to use a title you could:\n\n* John Smith and Director of Marketing, Adam Gray, both attended the\nmeeting.\n\nThis is similar to how we use proper noun titles like *King* or common noun descriptions like *king*.\n\n* The king of my country is an idiot.\n* King of Spain, Felipe VI was asked yesterday ...\n\n*Hope his is helpful!*"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the use of articles with titles and positions, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A journalist is writing an article about international diplomacy and needs to correctly reference multiple heads of state.

I have seen lots of voltage\\-to\\-current converters in other websites, but all of them is about converting 1\\-5 V to 4\\-20 mA, I think there is an offset problem for 0\\-5V.

OAs ( Operational Amplifier) are good for Voltage gain and High impedance output, but not to \"play\" with current, the current output is sensible with the components tolerance. Try to simulate your circuits with variation of 5% in your devices (resistors \\& VCC) and see the output. When you will buy the components they will have deviations about 1% to 5%, depend on the quality of the materials you will buy.\n\nTransistors are the devices to play with current gains, but impedance could be the problem. \n\nSee also the tolerance for the Valve mid\\-position for current, it is 1\\.3%:\n\n```\nVoltage type [V DC] 5 (\u00b10.1)\nCurrent type [mA] 12 (\u00b10.16)\n\n```\n\nYour are right the 12\\.267 mA are not correct ( max. acceptable would be 12\\.16 mA), take this into consideration because it means: **the tolerance current output of your circuit must be max. 1\\.3%!!!.**\n\nIt could means also that maybe temperature compensation of your output must be implemented depend on the range of temperature where the device will operate and ICs you will use.\n\nI have seen the Page 6 Datasheet of the valve: \n\n```\nSetpoint value\nVoltage type [V DC] 0 \u2026 10\nCurrent type [mA] 4 \u2026 20\n\n```\n\nWhy don't you try to control the valve with \"Voltage type\"? I think it is easier to transform your \\+\\-5V to a 0\\-10 Volt linear signal with mid\\-position on 5V. And you have a little more tolerance (2%) requirement for your output. It is easy, you can use an OA adder with a two inputs: one a \\+5V offset and the second your \\+\\-5V signal (you must check the tolerance)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An engineering student is designing an interface card to connect a proportional valve to a data acquisition card for a pneumatic system control thesis. The valve requires a 4-20 mA input, but the data acquisition card outputs -5 to +5 V. Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate to address this challenge while ensuring precision and reliability?\n\nA) Use a passive voltage-to-current converter to transform the -5 to +5 V range directly to 4-20 mA\nB) Implement a custom 0-5 V to 4-20 mA converter circuit using operational amplifiers\nC) Utilize the voltage control option of the valve (0-10 V) with an appropriate signal conditioning circuit\nD) Purchase and integrate a specialized XTR110 IC for 0-5 V to 4-20 mA conversion\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the problem and integration of concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. Precision: The valve's mid-position requires 12 mA with a tight tolerance of \u00b10.16 mA (1.3%). This level of precision is challenging to achieve with custom circuits, especially considering component tolerances.\n\n2. Reliability: Custom voltage-to-current converters (options A and B) are sensitive to component tolerances and environmental factors, making it difficult to maintain the required precision consistently.\n\n3. Availability: The XTR110 IC (option D) is not readily available in the student's country, making it impractical for immediate implementation.\n\n4. Simplicity and tolerance: The valve datasheet indicates it can be controlled with either 4-20 mA or 0-10 V. The voltage control option has a slightly more forgiving tolerance (2% vs 1.3% for current).\n\n5. Ease of implementation: Transforming the data acquisition card's -5 to +5 V output to a 0-10 V range is simpler and more reliable than converting to a precise current output. This can be achieved using an operational amplifier adder circuit with a +5 V offset.\n\nThis solution addresses the immediate needs of the project, allows for easier calibration, and is less susceptible to component variations and environmental factors.

You might also want to track down the program that created them (using information from `ipcs -s -i <id>`) to make sure it's not leaking semaphores. In my experience, though, most leaks come from programs that were interrupted (by segfaults or similar) before they could run their cleanup code.\n\nIf your system really needs all of the semaphores currently allocated, you can increase the number of semaphores available. Run `sysctl -a | grep kernel.sem` to see what the current settings are. The final number is the number of semaphores available on the system (normally 128\\). Copy that line into `/etc/sysctl.conf`, change the final number to a larger value, save it, and run `sysctl -p` to load the new settings."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is troubleshooting a Dell server with Red Hat 5.1 (64-bit) and a PERC 5/i controller.

That translator relies on pull\\-up resistors, which are not really suitable for faster signals. 9600 baud will be OK.

What you have is two uni\\-directional signals.\n\nRead up on [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) for an example of bi\\-directional signalling, where device pins can act as both inputs and outputs. In your application, I assume TX is always an output, and RX is always an input.\n\nIn your application you could get away with two unidirectional translators, one to shift a 5V output down to 3\\.3V suitable for the other device's input, and the other to go from 3\\.3V output to a 5V signal for the other device's input.\n\nThat might look like this:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKVHK.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fOKVHK.png)\n\nTranslator U1 has an input expecting 0V or 5V, but outputs only a 0V or 3\\.3V signal. U2 should take a 3\\.3V level input and output a 5V version.\n\nThere are many ICs you can use to shift between signal levels. Check out the [74LVC125](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74lvc125a.pdf?ts=1634219286379), [CD4504](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd4504b.pdf?ts=1634219488759) for example. If you wish to convert 3\\.3V output signals to 5V, any 74HCTxx gate will do the trick, like the [74HCT08](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hct08.pdf?ts=1634212114898) or [74HCT32](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hct32.pdf?ts=1634220047788).

Then $\\\\gamma$ is the average treatment effect (ATE) conditional on $X$.\n\nNow let $Y\\=TY^T\\+(1\\-T)Y^C$, where $Y^T$ is the outcome in treamtent group and $Y^C$ is the outcome in control group. The primary assumption, which is exploited by ANCOVA, is that the outcome variables $Y^T$ and $Y^C$ are independent from $T$ conditional on $X$. This is also called 'unconfoundedness' written as:\n\n$$P(T\\|Y^T,Y^C,X)\\=P(T\\|X)$$\n\nOtherwise outcome variables and treatment assignment are confounded and (conditional) mean differences on $Y^T$ and $Y^C$ may be caused by other factors than the manipulation (i.e., *even given* $X$). If $T$ and $Y^C$ and $Y^T$ are unconfounded conditional on $X$, the ATE estimate $\\\\gamma$ from ANCOVA will be unbiased given that also all other model assumptions are met. \n\nYou may ask when it is clear whether there is unconfoundedness: this can never be assessed with absolute certainty and it represents the key weakness of adjustment for bias in observational studies. It is recommended (see ref. below) that you include all covariates that are even in tendency (p\\<.10\\) statistically associated (correlated) with either $T$, $Y^C$ or $Y^T$. This suggests that it is not problematic, rather desirable, that $X$ and $T$ are correlated when using ANCOVA (**your first question**). \n\nIn fact, the correlation of covariate(s) with dependent variable 'within the groups' (i.e., $X$ with $Y^C$ or $Y^T$) is an indication that the unconfoundedness assumption holds or is more plausible (**your second question**). But correlation with $T$ likewise indicates this. However: an 'ideal' $X$ covariate is associated to, both, treatment indicator and outcome variables. Since ANOVA does not include $X$ (**your third question**), it would assume unconfoundedness unconditional $X$, i.e., $$P(T\\|Y^T,Y^C)\\=P(T)$$which is a very strong assumption and dependence of $X$ and $T$ would point to its potential violation. It is therefore not recommended in your hypothetical situation and should be preserved to fully randomized experiments, in which any $X$ by definition is independent of treatment and criterion variables.\n\nIt is important to note that meeting all of the **other model assumptions** of ANCOVA is required to find unbiased ATE estimates (e.g., using least squares estimators). Chiefly, this suggests that there is **no interaction** between $T$ and $X$. This is sometimes referred to as effect homogeneity (as opposed to hetorogenous effects, if there is an interaction). Therefore, the model should at least include the interactions as well, which is not standard in ANCOVA models. Furthermore, you assume linearity (inspect residuals to check this assumption) and you also assume that the Y\\-model is correct (i.e., that you included all relevant $X$ to model $Y$). \n\nSometimes, propensity score methods and nonparametric matching methods are superior to ANCOVA because they do not feature the linearity assumption and can include interactions 'on the go'. Moreover, so\\-called double\\-robust methods combine Y\\-modeling with propensity score methods. They guarantee unbiased effect estimates even if the model for $Y$ is incorrect (assuming the propensity score model is correct). Still all of these methods make the unconfoundedness assumption.\n\nFor an excellent treatment of ANOCVA adjustment for selection bias (and also other methods) see: \n\nSchafer, J. L., \\& Kang, J.

They decide to use ANCOVA to analyze their data. Which of the following scenarios would most likely violate the assumptions of ANCOVA and potentially lead to biased estimates of the average treatment effect?\n\nA) The covariate (pre-test scores) is strongly correlated with both the treatment assignment and the outcome variable.\nB) The relationship between the covariate and the outcome variable is non-linear.\nC) The treatment effect varies depending on the level of the covariate.\nD) The covariate is not correlated with the treatment assignment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of ANCOVA assumptions and potential violations that could lead to biased estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE).\n\nOption A is actually desirable for ANCOVA. The documentation states that an \"ideal\" covariate is associated with both the treatment indicator and outcome variables. This helps support the unconfoundedness assumption.\n\nOption B could be problematic, but it's not the most severe violation. While ANCOVA assumes linearity, this can often be addressed by transforming variables or using more flexible modeling approaches.\n\nOption C is the correct answer because it directly violates a key assumption of ANCOVA. The documentation explicitly states that \"there is no interaction between T and X\" is a crucial assumption, also referred to as effect homogeneity. If the treatment effect varies depending on the covariate level, this indicates heterogeneous effects, which standard ANCOVA does not account for and can lead to biased ATE estimates.\n\nOption D is not problematic. The documentation mentions that it's \"not problematic, rather desirable, that X and T are correlated when using ANCOVA.\" Lack of correlation doesn't violate ANCOVA assumptions, though it may reduce the method's effectiveness in adjusting for confounding.\n\nThis question requires integrating multiple concepts from the documentation, including understanding of ANCOVA assumptions, the unconfoundedness assumption, and the importance of covariate relationships with both treatment and outcome variables. It also applies these concepts to a real-world scenario in educational research, testing critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}, "46": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/03/05", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/267825", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/53763/"], "docs_id": 267825, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In my LAN I have an openwrt router configured with IP 10\\.0\\.0\\.1\\.

Two I have come across are K\\-fold and Monte Carlo cross\\-validation techniques. I have read that K\\-fold is a variation on Monte Carlo but I'm not sure I fully understand what makes up the definition of Monte Carlo. Could someone please explain the distinction between these two methods?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: $k$\\-Fold Cross Validation\n--------------------------\n\nSuppose you have 100 data points. For $k$\\-fold cross validation, these 100 points are divided into $k$ equal sized and mutually\\-exclusive 'folds'. For $k$\\=10, you might assign points 1\\-10 to fold \\#1, 11\\-20 to fold \\#2, and so on, finishing by assigning points 91\\-100 to fold \\#10\\. Next, we select one fold to act as the test set, and use the remaining $k\\-1$ folds to form the training data. For the first run, you might use points 1\\-10 as the test set and 11\\-100 as the training set. The next run would then use points 11\\-20 as the test set and train on points 1\\-10 plus 21\\-100, and so forth, until each fold is used once as the test set.\n\nMonte\\-Carlo Cross Validation\n-----------------------------\n\nMonte Carlo works somewhat differently. You randomly select (without replacement) some fraction of your data to form the training set, and then assign the rest of the points to the test set. This process is then repeated multiple times, generating (at random) new training and test partitions each time. For example, suppose you chose to use 10% of your data as test data. Then your test set on rep \\#1 might be points 64, **90**, 63, **42**, 65, 49, 10, 64, 96, and 48\\. On the next run, your test set might be **90**, 60, 23, 67, 16, 78, **42**, 17, 73, and 26\\. Since the partitions are done independently for each run, the same point can appear in the test set multiple times, *which is the major difference between Monte Carlo and cross validation*.\n\nComparison\n----------\n\nEach method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Under cross validation, each point gets tested exactly once, which seems fair. However, cross\\-validation only explores a few of the possible ways that your data could have been partitioned. Monte Carlo lets you explore somewhat more possible partitions, though you're unlikely to get all of them\\-\\-there are $\\\\binom{100}{50} \\\\approx 10^{28}$ possible ways to 50/50 split a 100 data point set(!). \n\nIf you're attempting to do inference (i.e., statistically compare two algorithms), averaging the results of a $k$\\-fold cross validation run gets you a (nearly) unbiased estimate of the algorithm's performance, but with high variance (as you'd expect from having only 5 or 10 data points). Since you can, in principle, run it for as long as you want/can afford, Monte Carlo cross validation can give you a less variable, but more biased estimate.\n\nSome approaches fuse the two, as in the 5x2 cross validation (see [Dietterich (1998\\)](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/089976698300017197) for the idea, though I think there have been some further improvements since then), or by correcting for the bias (e.g., [Nadeau and Bengio, 2003](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/bib/pub_subject/finance/pointeurs/techrep.pdf))."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about cross-validation techniques, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is comparing the performance of two machine learning algorithms using a dataset of 1000 samples.

Exploration of data partitions: Monte Carlo cross-validation allows for exploring more possible ways to partition the data compared to k-fold cross-validation. With 1000 samples and 50 iterations, it provides a good balance between computational cost and partition exploration.\n\n2. Performance estimate quality: Monte Carlo cross-validation can provide a less variable estimate of algorithm performance compared to k-fold cross-validation, especially with a higher number of iterations. While it may introduce some bias, the trade-off for lower variance can be beneficial when comparing two algorithms.\n\n3. Flexibility in training set size: Using 80% of the data for training in each iteration allows for a substantial training set while still keeping a meaningful test set for evaluation.\n\n4. Real-world applicability: In many practical scenarios, it's valuable to assess algorithm performance across various data splits, which Monte Carlo cross-validation facilitates.\n\nOption A (10-fold cross-validation repeated 5 times) would explore fewer unique partitions and might have higher variance in the performance estimate. Option C (Leave-one-out cross-validation) would be computationally expensive for 1000 samples and wouldn't explore diverse partitions.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. Preloading GUI components before authentication (option B) would be a security risk, as it would load user-specific settings and files before the user is verified.\n\n2. Switching to a lightweight desktop environment (option A) might improve performance somewhat, but doesn't address the core issue of resource constraints causing slow loading.\n\n3. Disabling the GUI (option D) would significantly change the user experience and require manual intervention, which doesn't solve the original problem.\n\n4. Increasing RAM and using an SSD (option C) addresses the root cause of slow loading times by providing more resources for the system to work with. This allows the GUI components to load faster after login without compromising security.\n\nThis solution maintains the existing workflow while improving performance.

I posted the relevant research I had done and the sample code I used for trying out the concept. The question was long and I still feel this is a site for long questions and proper analysis of concepts. Your site tour explains:\n\n> about what you have tried and exactly what you are trying to do.\n\nI said I found a lot about this concept during a bug fix. I explained that I had written an article about this stuff on Codeproject. I also mentioned that I have no experience with other languages. All this was done within the rules defined by you. When you say include details, it means details \\- code, links etc., right? Is there a thing called **brief details** or **concise details** or **short details**?\n\nYour site tour further explains:\n\n> Not all questions work well in our format. Avoid questions that are primarily opinion\\-based, or that are likely to generate discussion rather than answers\n\nI asked two to\\-the\\-point questions:\n\n1. Is there another name for the concept I have just described in common language?\n2. Why compiler does not optimize obvious semantic inconsistencies?\n\nI deleted my question, but the moderators can grab it back I know.\nThese two questions are not **STUPID**. I was told by guys that they do not want to hear anything about what I did or where I posted my research etc. They do not want the **gory details**. What? The site asks me to post details. Who are these people who want **short, concise details**? Do they even understand what detail means?\n\nSomeone said that **what i had for breakfast** was irrelevant to them. Another guy mentioned that my code sample was **ridiculous**. All this within seconds of me posting my 1000 words question (including code). This surely means that they have not read the question.\n\nI pointed them to the following link:\n[https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/254570/choosing\\-between\\-stack\\-overflow\\-and\\-programmers\\-stack\\-exchange](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/254570/choosing-between-stack-overflow-and-programmers-stack-exchange)\n\nWho are these guys? What experience have they got? \nI can tell clearly that these guys have no experience of working in a team or mentoring. It will be really sad if they ever get employed because they surely will destroy the team they work with.\n\nThe only answer I received was not poisonous. It just said that the compiler writers have better things to do than to catch what would eventually be a runtime error. What? Really. What better things do you mean. Can you not give me examples where such runtime errors would be a disaster and compilers and tools employed for such an environment do such checking? What are the benefits of not doing such a checking etc. in normal environment?\n\nWhat do you expect me to do? Post one line questions here? I could do that on StackOverflow. Had I posted something like:\n\n```\nHow to use interfaces in C# to delegate a functionality?\n\n```\n\nI am sure I would have been voted up to seventh heaven.

Some meta stuff at the top. This normally sets off a warning flag for me. Things like \"I know this isn't the right place\" and the like tend to be questions that are otherwise problematic on the site. Your particular meta comment was:\n\n> Folks, there is no TL;DR version of my question. Please be patient.\n\nEven if this isn't a post that *is* problematic, it sets one's mind to expect that.\n2. A quick scroll down and I hit four code blocks, two of which have scroll bars on them. This is something that then starts to *look* like one that is going to delve too far into code or fix my code/design type questions.\n\nMany of the questions that tend to be \"here is a lot of code\" tend to get answers that are \"here is a lot of code too.\" Those answers aren't ideal for P.SE, and so questions that ask them may get down voted.\n3. Where is the question? After digging down a bit, they are between two code blocks. The questions appear to be:\n\n\t1. Is there another name for this pattern?\n\t2. Is this really an Adapter?\n\t3. So, does the compiler have no mechanism to check such semantic inconsistencies?\n\t4. Something that looks like a design review.Asking multiple questions in a single post is problematic. Someone could answer the \"another name\" question, and another answer the adapter one, and a third about the compiler. None (or all) of them are 'right' for the question.\n\nWhile I may just be missing it... but I seem to have some difficulty matching the \"abstract stuff in C\\#\" in the question title to the questions being asked.\n4. There's a naming question there. Naming questions have a problematic history on P.SE \\- a bit more about that at [On the troubles of naming and terminology](https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6582/on-the-troubles-of-naming-and-terminology)\n\nThere is a lot there. But I also have to read quite a bit to even find the question being asked and then go back and reread it. And after that, I'm still confused about what question you are asking and what type of answer you are looking for.\n\nThe mouseover for the the down vote reads \"this question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful\" and that 'it is unclear' part may be something that people are voting on when reading the question.\n\n---\n\nSome other bits that are in there from comments here and there...\n\n> @Doval, the site asks me to provide details and share my research. I did that. It is ridiculous that you guys vote down questions if they do not fit your mental models. Your lack of experience in working in teams and mentoring clearly shines through your comments.

Not enough that I'd go about flagging it... but it sets a negative tone and some people may vote accordingly. If you are to point out that *other* people are being rude too (again, judgement call there) this is a question that you asked and people are voting on that (they may also be flagging comments, but that's not as obvious).\n\n> @Graham, Your comment is a good one and gentle too. I am not looking for a free code review. I just want to discuss if what i understood is proper. The attention span of these guys is just pathetic. They need questions that are couple of lines long so that they can answer fast and get points. This site is for detailed analysis as per FAQ. It also asks me to show my research. If I have to be concise I will post on StackOverflow. Why is this so difficult to comprehend? \u2013 msiyer yesterday\n\nSetting aside the tone in this comment: \"I just want to **discuss** if what i understood is proper\" \\- [discussions don't work well on Stack Exchange](https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/q/6742/40980).\n\nI will point out that you brought this up again in the meta question here:\n\n> One guy also said that you are getting a free code review done here, so better get aligned to the rules laid down by the members. NO. I was not getting my code reviewed. I was trying to discuss something that troubles all beginners. Even if I was, I need not stoop and beg.\n\nand\n\n> @Bart, you answered properly. But when you say \"compiler writers have better things to do\", it kind of kills discussion. But we surely discussed on Design patterns. I sincerely feel that the questions were not bad. May not be a world class problem but nothing silly about it. These are issues I have seen all beginners deal with. i hoped a discussion would help others to learn. \u2013 msiyer 6 hours ago\n\nAgain, Stack Exchange is not a site for discussions.

\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is an optimization, the only one that is allowed to alter observable behaviour of a program.\n\nHere's the paragraph `12.8./31`, taken from standard draft n3337 (emphasis mine):\n\n> When certain criteria are met, **an implementation is allowed to omit the copy/move construction of a class\n>  object, even if the copy/move constructor and/or destructor for the object have side effects.** In such cases,\n>  the implementation treats the source and target of the omitted copy/move operation as simply two different\n>  ways of referring to the same object, and the destruction of that object occurs at the later of the times\n>  when the two objects would have been destroyed without the optimization.\n>  This elision of copy/move\n>  operations, called *copy elision*, is permitted in the following circumstances (which may be combined to \n>  eliminate multiple copies): \n> \n> \n> \n> > \u2014 in a return statement in a function with a class return type, when the expression is the name of a\n> >  non\\-volatile automatic object (other than a function or catch\\-clause parameter) with the same cv\\-\n> >  unquali\ufb01ed type as the function return type, the copy/move operation can be omitted by constructing\n> >  the automatic object directly into the function\u2019s return value \n> > \n> > \n> > \u2014 in a throw\\-expression, when the operand is the name of a non\\-volatile automatic object (other than a\n> >  function or catch\\-clause parameter) whose scope does not extend beyond the end of the innermost\n> >  enclosing try\\-block (if there is one), the copy/move operation from the operand to the exception\n> >  object (15\\.1\\) can be omitted by constructing the automatic object directly into the exception object \n> > \n> > \n> > \u2014 when a temporary class object that has not been bound to a reference (12\\.2\\) would be copied/moved\n> >  to a class object with the same cv\\-unquali\ufb01ed type, the copy/move operation can be omitted by\n> >  constructing the temporary object directly into the target of the omitted copy/move \n> > \n> > \n> > \u2014 when the exception\\-declaration of an exception handler (Clause 15\\) declares an object of the same type\n> >  (except for cv\\-quali\ufb01cation) as the exception object (15\\.1\\), the copy/move operation can be omitted\n> >  by treating the exception\\-declaration as an alias for the exception object if the meaning of the program\n> >  will be unchanged except for the execution of constructors and destructors for the object declared by\n> >  the exception\\-declaration.\n> \n> \n> \\[Example... omitted]\n\nThe semantics of a copy/move constructor are just that, copying/moving the contents of an object while initializing another one. If your copy constructors send emails with invitations to your birthday party you should not be surprised if you end up partying alone :)\n\nOK, some copy constructors do other things, too. Think reference counting of a smart pointer. But if that gets optimized away, it's fine. There was no copy and nothing needed to be counted."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about C++ copy elision, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A senior developer is reviewing code and notices a potential performance issue with object creation and copying. Given the following code snippet and the C++ standard's rules on copy elision, what is the most likely scenario for object construction and destruction?\n\n```cpp\nclass ExpensiveObject {\npublic:\n    ExpensiveObject() { /* expensive initialization */ }\n    ExpensiveObject(const ExpensiveObject&) { /* expensive copy */ }\n    ~ExpensiveObject() { /* expensive cleanup */ }\n};\n\nExpensiveObject createObject() {\n    ExpensiveObject local;\n    return local;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    ExpensiveObject obj = createObject();\n    // Use obj...\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nA) The compiler will always perform one construction and one copy, resulting in two object creations\nB) The compiler will optimize out all copies, resulting in only one object creation directly in main()\nC) The compiler may elide the copy, but must still call the copy constructor for semantic correctness\nD) The behavior is undefined and may vary between different compilers and optimization levels\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the C++ standard's rules on copy elision (specifically, the Return Value Optimization or RVO), the compiler is allowed to optimize out the copy operation when returning a local object from a function, even if the copy constructor has side effects. In this case, the compiler can construct the ExpensiveObject directly in the memory location of obj in main(), bypassing the need for a separate construction of local and a subsequent copy.\n\nThis optimization is unique because it's allowed to alter the observable behavior of the program by potentially omitting calls to copy constructors and destructors.

They want to add labels for specific points on the curve, but are struggling with label placement. Which combination of techniques would most effectively solve the label placement issues while maintaining clarity and professionalism in the graph?\n\nA) Use `below` with fixed offsets for all labels and manually adjust rotations\nB) Apply `anchor=north east` with consistent coordinates and rotations for all labels\nC) Implement `node[pos=0.5]` on the axis lines and adjust label content dynamically\nD) Utilize `tikz` absolute positioning with `(axis cs:x,y)` for each label separately\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it addresses the core issue in the most efficient and flexible way. The documentation shows that replacing `below` with `anchor=north east` solves the label placement problem. This approach allows for intuitive coordinate use and consistent rotation, which is crucial for maintaining a professional appearance in scientific visualizations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using fixed offsets with `below` was the original problem, leading to misaligned labels. Manual adjustments are time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies.\n\nOption C is incorrect because `node[pos=0.5]` on axis lines would not allow for precise positioning of labels at specific data points, which is required in this scenario for marking m, p, and m+p values.\n\nOption D, while potentially workable, is overly complex for this situation. Using absolute positioning with `(axis cs:x,y)` for each label separately would be more time-consuming and could lead to inconsistencies in label placement across different graph scales or sizes.\n\nThe correct solution (B) demonstrates an understanding of LaTeX and PGFPlots syntax, as well as best practices in scientific visualization.

What is the most likely root cause and solution to this problem?\n\nA) A compatibility issue between Evolution and Outlook, requiring an update to the latest version of Evolution\nB) A corrupted local cache in Evolution, necessitating a clearance of the email client's temporary files\nC) A synchronization conflict with the default calendar, requiring deletion and re-addition of the calendar account\nD) A network firewall blocking the calendar sync protocol, requiring adjustment of firewall settings\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The root cause of this issue is likely a synchronization conflict with the default calendar in Evolution. This conclusion is drawn from the top answer, which describes a similar problem and its solution. The permanent \"searching for an existing version of this appointment\" message indicates that Evolution is stuck in a loop trying to reconcile the incoming appointment with its existing calendar data.\n\nThe solution involves deleting the default calendar (in this case, a Google calendar account) and then adding it again. This process effectively resets the synchronization state and allows Evolution to properly handle incoming appointment requests.

While I can't really speak about the actual business problem, I can give a few reasons for why we think that Event Sourcing might be a good fit:\n\n* great auditing capabilities based on the history of events\n* \"travelling back in time\" to recreate a previous state of an aggregate (e.g. for debugging purposes)\n* the ability to create new projections that take the full history into account\n\nSince I can't go into detail about the exact domain we're in, I will describe my problem using the domain described [in this Kata dealing with quiz games](https://playingwithprojections.github.io/doc/domain/).\n\nI think I got the general idea of Event Sourcing and how CQRS links to it. However, all examples I can find use domains with clear separations between aggregates as well as between different instances of the same aggregate (in the Kata mentioned above, quizzes and games have a clear relationship. There's no interdependence between different quizzes or different games).\n\nThe problem\n-----------\n\nIn my case I have the problem that it must be possible to **merge different instances of the same aggregate** (in our sample domain this could mean that it must be possible to merge different quizzes together into one quiz) as well as undoing this merge later on (reconstructing the two original quizzes from the merged one).\n\nThis constraint adds quite some complexity when it comes to constructing the current state of an aggregate, because it's necessary to read the whole event stream from the beginning to be sure that all relevant events are taken into consideration. It's not possible to partition the event stream in a useful way because it's impossible to tell which aggregates will be merged later in the future. It might even be a problem when the event stream gets partitioned, because the temporal order of related events gets lost.  \n\nFrom what I understand, partitioning the event stream allows for a fast provision of the events that are necessary to build up the current state of an aggregate. For instance, if I want to know the current state of the quiz with ID `124ecf`, I technically could filter the event streams to just have the events for this exact ID which would drastically reduce the number of events. If this is not possible, like in my case, reading the event stream ad hoc to recreate the state of an aggregate will become very slow and impractical over time.\n\nThe solution I came up with so far\n----------------------------------\n\nThe only solution for this problem that seems to be possible to me is to work with rolling snapshots for all necessary projections. The snapshots would update themselves continuously, building up a state optimized for their specific use case (processing commands, answering queries etc.).  \n\nI'm skeptical about this idea, because it requires quite some effort. Most of the implementations of typical applications don't require rolling snapshots for most use cases because building up the desired state from the event stream is fast enough. This simplicity is lost in my case.\n\nThe question\n------------\n\nMy question could be split up in several parts:\n\n* Is it a good idea to use Event Sourcing for domains like these where it's not possible to draw clear boundaries between different instances of the same aggregate?\n* Does it make sense to heavily rely on using rolling snapshots to get the desired performance?\n* Is there another way other than rolling snapshots to implement this?\n* I can't think of a way for partitioning the event stream. Am I missing something? Are there some techniques that allow partitioning/sharding under the given circumstances?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your analogy is intereseting and heading in the right direction. \n\n> Microservices are like user space drivers\n\nYes and no: \n\n* Yes, like [user\\-mode drivers](https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=developersguide:overviewofminixarchitecture), microservices provide an independent functionality in their own tiny and independent process. Minix drivers run as independent process to offer a functionality that would otherwise be (or at least run as a) part of a monolotithic kernel.\n* No, because user\\-mode drivers are archtiectured around the microkernel. Remove the microkernel and the full architecture is useless. The microservice archtiecture, is not a star around a central component, but a mesh. Every microservice has its value by its own. Shutting down any of them should still leave an overall system that provides some (less) value.\n* No, because microservices can be used to scale, so that you run several instances on different machines of the same service. I doubt that you would run in parrallel 2 keyboard drivers to increase throughput.\n\n> Microservices adds communication overhead\n\nYes, and it's a lot of message passing like on the Minix kernel. The API of microservices might however be of a higher level of abstraction, thius more complex, and based on more complex types. The communication overhead will be more significant than what you are used to for an OS microkernel with its device drivers. (*and the [overhead for switching between user\\-mode and kernel\\-mode](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/3/198874-lessons-learned-from-30-years-of-minix/fulltext), which was one of the performance reason why MINIX didn't become mainstream, can be neglected in comparison*). \n\n> Microservices can be partially upgraded without downtime  \n> \n>  Microservices does not need to speak HTTP.\n\nYes, exactly"}, "answer": "Certainly!

Which approach would best address their concerns while maintaining the benefits of Event Sourcing?\n\nA) Implement a traditional relational database alongside the event store to track quiz relationships\nB) Use rolling snapshots for all necessary projections, updating them continuously\nC) Partition the event stream based on original quiz IDs before any merges occur\nD) Abandon Event Sourcing for this use case and use a standard CRUD-based approach instead\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests the application of Event Sourcing concepts to a complex real-world scenario where clear aggregate boundaries are challenging to maintain. Option B is the best solution because:\n\n1. Rolling snapshots address the performance concern of reconstructing aggregate state from a potentially large event stream. This is especially important given the requirement to merge and split quizzes, which makes it impossible to partition the event stream effectively.\n\n2. Continuous updates to the snapshots ensure that the latest state is always available for quick access, solving the problem of slow ad-hoc reads from the event stream.\n\n3. This approach maintains the benefits of Event Sourcing (audit trail, time travel debugging, flexible projections) while addressing the performance issues.\n\nOption A introduces a separate system, losing the benefits of Event Sourcing and potentially creating data consistency issues. Option C isn't viable because partitioning based on original IDs doesn't work when quizzes can be merged and split.

The correct answer, B, is the most effective strategy because:\n\n1. The documentation states that Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its close relatives (Fedora, CentOS, Scientific Linux, Oracle Linux) \"will always have Python installed since the installer and many core tools are written in Python.\"\n\n2. This approach ensures Python availability without additional installation steps on a wide range of popular enterprise and community Linux distributions.\n\n3.

The correct answer, B, integrates several key points:\n\n1. Regenerative braking can feed energy back into the battery, but only when the generated voltage is higher than the battery voltage. This typically occurs at higher speeds.\n2. As the motor slows down, the regenerative braking voltage will fall.

This method is superior for several reasons:\n\n1. It accounts for the interdependence of the percentage data. Since the percentages for each subject sum to 1, they are not independent, which violates assumptions of methods like t-tests or MANOVA.\n\n2. The regression approach allows for simultaneous analysis of both the teaching method (A vs. B) and the subject areas (PercA, PercB, PercC, PercD) as predictors, capturing the full structure of the data.\n\n3. By using the 'melt' function to reshape the data, we can analyze all percentages in a single model, increasing statistical power and providing a more comprehensive view of the differences between methods.\n\n4. The regression output provides coefficients for each subject area and the teaching method, allowing us to quantify the effect of each factor on the percentages.\n\n5. This approach can handle unbalanced designs and missing data more robustly than some alternative methods.\n\n6. The F-statistic and p-value from the regression model provide a global test of whether there are significant differences between the teaching methods across all subject areas simultaneously.\n\nWhile options A, B, and C might seem plausible, they each have limitations:\n- Option A (t-tests) would increase the risk of Type I errors due to multiple comparisons and ignore the interdependence of the percentages.\n- Option B (chi-square test) is not ideal for continuous percentage data and wouldn't capture the nuanced differences between methods as effectively.\n- Option C (MANOVA) assumes multivariate normality and independence of observations, which may not hold for percentage data that sum to 1 for each subject.\n\nThe regression approach (Option D) provides the most comprehensive and statistically appropriate analysis for this scenario, aligning with the method demonstrated in the provided R code."}, "64": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/13", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/252065", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/99656/"], "docs_id": 252065, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In my problem, I have two inputs: a binary matrix $M$ of size $m\\\\times n$ and an integer $k\\\\geq 1$.\n\nLet $S\\_i$ and $T\\_j$ be subspaces of $\\\\mathbb{R}^k$ with $1\\\\leq\\\\dim(S\\_i)\\\\leq k$ and $1\\\\leq\\\\dim(T\\_j)\\\\leq k$ for all $i\\=1,...,m$ and $j\\=1,...,n$.\n\nThe matrix $M$ indicates how the subspaces $S\\_i$ and $T\\_j$ must intersect.\nWhen $M(i,j)\\=0$, it means that $S\\_i$ and $T\\_j$ are orthogonal to each other, that is, $S\\_i\\\\perp T\\_j$.\nWhen $M(i,j)\\=1$, it means that $S\\_i$ and $T\\_j$ are not orthogonal, that is, $S\\_i\\\\not\\\\perp T\\_j$.\n\n> My question is the following: given an integer $k$ and a matrix $M$, what can we say about the dimensions of the subspaces?\n\nFor example, it is obvious that when $M(i,j)\\=0$, it leads to the inequality $\\\\dim(S\\_i)\\+\\\\dim(T\\_j)\\\\leq k$ meaning that we can obtain stronger upper bounds: $\\\\dim(S\\_i)\\\\leq \\\\color{red}{k\\-1}$ and $\\\\dim(T\\_j)\\\\leq \\\\color{red}{k\\-1}$.\n\nMy problem concerns more particularly the following example with $k\\=3$ and $M\\=\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\ 1 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 1 \\& 1 \\& 0\\\\end{pmatrix}$,\n\nI am pretty sure that this matrix implies to have $\\\\dim(S\\_i)\\=\\\\dim(T\\_j)\\=1$ for $i,j\\=1,...4$ but I am not able to prove it.\n\nMaybe, with the special sparsity pattern of $M$ (multiple zeros per row/column), would it possible to show that it implies $\\\\dim(S\\_i)\\\\leq k\\-2$ and $\\\\dim(T\\_j)\\\\leq k\\-2$ for $i,j\\=1,...4$?\n\nThank you very much for any advice!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In your specific example we easily get that all 8 subspaces are non\\-zero (else we would have all\\-1s row or column), and none of $S\\_i$ contains another $S\\_j$ (since there exists a subspace orthogonal to $S\\_i$ but not to $S\\_j$.)

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The documentation mentions that \\startC is undefined in MKIV, indicating a change in syntax highlighting mechanisms between versions.\n2. Simply loading verb-c.mkii (option A) is stated to fail due to other undefined macros, suggesting deeper incompatibilities.\n3. While \\definetyping is mentioned, it's noted that it doesn't provide syntax highlighting, ruling out option B as an optimal solution.\n4. The LaTeX solution (option C) is not directly applicable to ConTeXt and would require significant adaptation, making it less likely to be the best approach in a ConTeXt-specific scenario.\n5. ConTeXt MKIV typically uses a more modern approach to syntax highlighting through its typescript mechanism. This allows for defining custom language environments that are compatible with MKIV's architecture and can provide syntax highlighting.\n\nOption D represents the most likely solution that aligns with modern ConTeXt practices, requiring the developer to research and implement a typescript-based solution for C code highlighting. This approach would involve creating a new language definition using ConTeXt's built-in mechanisms, which is more in line with MKIV's design philosophy and likely to provide a robust, long-term solution for syntax highlighting in the migrated document."}, "66": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/14", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/201104", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/10109/"], "docs_id": 201104, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: To motivate that (admittedly) strange question:\n\nWhen TeX builds a vertical list it keeps track of the depth of the last box added in a special variable called `\\prevdepth` which is used to calculate baselineskip glue for paragraph lines. When a new vertical list is being built (and the OR starts a new vertical list) TeX reinitializes `\\prevdepth` and when processing ends it resets it to the old (outer) value.\n\nWith normal output routines (that ship out pages) that's okay as the `\\prevdepth` (after the output routine ends) will match the last box on the main vertical list if there is a remainder that was not put into box255\\. If the main vertical list is empty the value is wrong but that doesn't make a difference because TeX will use `\\topskip` on top of the first line so it is essentially ignored.\n\nBut the situation is different if the output routine puts material back to be reprocessed. In that case the last box on the main vertical list is a) either the box that was not used in the OR and that has a depth matching `\\prevdepth` or it is the last box from the stuff that the OR contributed (which may have a different depth).\n\nSo to make baselineskip calculations work correctly we would need to know which situation we are in: has everything been packaged into box255 or is there an unused remainder? If that question could be answered that would also solve the issue but this is to my knowledge not possible.\n\nAn alternative solution would be to pretend that the material generated by the OR has the same depth as the outer `\\prevdepth` but for this I would somehow need to know its value.\nKnowing its value is simple if we force the OR with an explicit penalty because then I can just save it and used the saved value. But what can be done if the OR is called by TeX on its own?\n\nThat's really the question above ... any idea (as sneaky as it needs to be) to somehow get at this value in this particular case?\n\nOr alternatively, any method to clearly determine whether or not the main vertical list is emptied.\n\nPlease note that I'm looking for a solution that works with all TeX engines, so doesn't make use of, say, lua programming.\n\nTo motivate a bit further, here is a short plain TeX file that shows the general problem (though here it could be fixed as we explicitly force the output routine):\n\n```\n\\tracingonline=1\n\\showboxbreadth\\maxdimen\\showboxdepth\\maxdimen\n\ntest with g to get a depth\n\n\\showthe\\prevdepth % we see the prevdepth from the last line\n\n% now assume we have some OR that traps the data and does something with it\n% afterwards it is pushing back new or changed data t build pages, In the example I\n% simply dropped the collected data and replaced it with soemthing else which has a different \n% \\prevdepth.

In that case we can use the depth of box 255 as a measure for the `\\prevdepth`calculations that will have taken place if there is any remainder in recent contributions, and use this to adjust the new depth to match that. An if there isn't any remainder then this doesn't really matter either. This trick is in fact already mentioned by Don Knuth in the TeXbook where he discusses an output routine that add index headings in random places in the text (and normal text has this nice property of having a depth smaller than `\\maxdepth` ... normally but unfortunately not always.\n\nHowever, this stops working if this can't guaranteed and the general case is what I was and am after. He is also correct in stating that finding out what the value of `\\prevdepth` on the main vertical list is isn't really going to help us as such, so my question above was partly incorrect: we also need to know if there is in fact something on the recent contributions and if so deal with it.\n\nSo what I tried to get my head around over the last days if that is really impossible to find out within base TeX (or if it needs an extension in luatex or is already available there and resolved in ConTeXt ... would be interesting to learn about it beside that claim @Martin you made). And as it stands now it is possible in TeX after all. The solution is a bit complex and perhaps it can be simplified further but it is not so complex that it can't be used (and hopefully not too complex that I overlooked some cases).\n\nThe main idea is not to try to determine the situation directly but instead use 2 output routines in succession that just ensure that the recent contributions are empty. Along the way we gather enough information to afterwards dissect the material gathered and do whatever we like.\n\nMy initial idea of using `\\aftergroup` to regain control and have a look doesn't work because the token inserted that way will not be executed when the output routine ends. Instead TeX immediately calls again on a procedure \"buildpage\" that takes anything on recent contributions and moves it to the main vertical list and only once that has happened my inserted token is looked at (in other words too late).\n\nSo the more complicated approach is that the first OR puts box255 back but only it has changed `\\vsize` to the largest possible dimen. Additionally it uses `\\aftergroup` so that we gain control later again. As we have changed `\\vsize` we will get everything including the material recent contributions onto the main vertical list and only then our control token kicks in. Finally we change the output routine to a second one and then return.\n\nThe token inserted by `\\aftergroup` will then issue a forcing penalty (actually it does a little more, see below) so that everything is grabbed and the second OR is called.\n\nInside that OR we are now in a better situation:\n\n* we know that recent contributions is empty (except for a (`\\penalty 10000`)\n* we can store away what was gathered in box255\n* or we could manipulate it using `\\vsplit` etc to get, for example the amount split of that we would have gotten in the first OR\n* and we can use `\\aftergroup` to gain control after the OR has ended.\n* the latter allows us to change `\\prevdepth` on the main vertical list to represent whatever is needed\n\nAnd that should (I believe) do the trick completely.\n\nHere is the (more or less documented code including a bit of test data to play out various scenarios). It is a bit longish but largely because I tried to properly document the most important aspects and some of the more subtle points.

Which of the following approaches is most likely to resolve this issue while maintaining compatibility across all TeX engines?\n\nA) Manually adjust \\baselineskip after each output routine call\nB) Implement a two-pass output routine system with \\aftergroup control\nC) Use \\luatex primitives to directly manipulate the vertical list\nD) Modify \\topskip to compensate for \\prevdepth discrepancies\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective solution is to implement a two-pass output routine system with \\aftergroup control. This approach addresses the core issue of managing \\prevdepth correctly when content is pushed back for reprocessing.\n\nThe two-pass system works as follows:\n1. The first output routine sets \\vsize to \\maxdimen and uses \\aftergroup to gain control after processing.\n2. This ensures all content, including recent contributions, is moved to the main vertical list.\n3. A second output routine is then triggered, which can safely manipulate the content knowing the recent contributions are empty.\n4. Finally, \\aftergroup is used again to adjust \\prevdepth as needed before resuming normal processing.\n\nThis method is superior because:\n- It works across all TeX engines, not relying on engine-specific features like Lua.\n- It correctly handles the \\prevdepth issue by ensuring full control over the vertical list state.\n- It allows for precise manipulation of content and spacing without relying on heuristics or assumptions about box depths.\n- It avoids the pitfalls of directly modifying \\baselineskip or \\topskip, which could lead to inconsistent results in different contexts.\n\nThe other options are less suitable:\nA) Manually adjusting \\baselineskip is error-prone and doesn't address the root cause.\nC) Using \\luatex primitives isn't compatible with all TeX engines.\nD) Modifying \\topskip doesn't solve the underlying \\prevdepth management issue and could introduce new problems.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple TeX concepts, understanding of output routine behavior, and analysis of a complex technical solution, thus targeting higher cognitive levels."}, "67": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/01/13", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/686160", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/509919/"], "docs_id": 686160, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have two server accounts (tow student user accounts of same university Linux server).

Please help me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not sure how to accomplish this is pure bash, but the Python script below should work perfectly for all possible folder names. It will also accept a command line argument (described later under **Optional pattern matching argument**).\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nif len(sys.argv) == 1:\n    folder = subprocess.run(\\\n        ['find','-mindepth','1','-maxdepth','1','-type','d','-print0'],\\\n            capture_output=True).stdout[:-1].split(b'\\x00')\nelse:\n    folder = subprocess.run(\\\n        ['find','-mindepth','1','-maxdepth','1','-type','d',\\\n            '-name',sys.argv[1], '-print0'],\\\n            capture_output=True).stdout[:-1].split(b'\\x00')\ncounts = []\nfor name in folder:\n    counts.append(sum(name in i[:len(name)] for i in folder))\ncounts = sorted(list(zip(counts,folder)),reverse=True)\nif counts[0][0]>1:\n    sys.stdout.buffer.write(counts[0][1]+b'\\x0a')\n\n```\n\nSave the script (e.g. as `mainfoldername.py` or whatever) and the command `python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py` will output the folder name that meets the criteria of occuring most often as the starting string in folder names in the current working directory. If no folders meet that criteria, the script produces no output.\n\nWith the example directories you've given, `python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py` will output **`./Target.Dire ctoryName`**.\n\nUsing **command expansion**, a variable can be set to the script's output value and used in other commands:\n\n```\n$ myvar=\"$( python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py )\"\n$ echo \"$myvar\"\n./Target.Dire ctoryName\n$ cd \"$myvar\"\nTarget.Dire ctoryName$\n\n```\n\nShell script usage\n------------------\n\nIn **shell scripts** that will use this output, a check for cases where no folder names met the criteria (i.e. the python script produced no output) should be included by testing the value for zero length, e.g:\n\n```bsh\n#!/bin/sh\nmyvar=\"$( python3 /path/to/mainfoldername.py )\"\n[ ! -z \"$myvar\" ] || exit 1\n\n```\n\nOptional pattern matching argument\n----------------------------------\n\n`python3 /path/to/mainfolder.py PATTERN`\n\nThis script will accept one optional argument on the command line where *`PATTERN`* is a shell pattern that folder names must match.\n\nThe most basic use of this is as a switch between finding regular folders or finding hidden folders. The script's default behavior is to find all folders.\n\n**To find only hidden folders**, use **`'.*'`** for *`PATTERN`*:\n\n```\npython3 /path/to/mainfolder.py '.*'\n\n```\n\n**To find only non\\-hidden folders**, use **`'[!\\.]*'`**\n\n```\npython3 /path/to/mainfolder.py '[!\\.]*'\n\n```\n\nIt's also useful when you know some string that will appear in the target folder's name.\n\n**To find only folders whose names contain the string `Target`**:\n\n```\npython3 /path/to/mainfolder.py '*Target*'\n\n```\n\nNote that the patterns should always be contained in quotes to avoid expansion by the shell.

The error \"Connection refused\" suggests that the server is not allowing this type of connection. \n\nOption A is incorrect because if the SFTP service wasn't running, the initial SSH connection would likely fail as well. Option B is plausible but doesn't address the core issue of transferring between accounts. Option C is unlikely, as internal connections typically wouldn't be blocked by a firewall.\n\nThe correct approach (D) recognizes that direct SFTP between user accounts on the same server is not typically allowed for security reasons. Instead, the administrator should:\n1. SFTP or SCP the files from user2 to their local machine\n2. Then SFTP or SCP from the local machine to user1\n\nThis two-step process maintains proper access controls and follows the standard SFTP usage pattern of transferring between a local machine and a remote server, which the documentation mentions is the more common and well-documented scenario.

It's IIS 7, not 7\\.5\\.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can not disable individual handler mappings in the UI. The 'Edit Feature Permissions' mentioned by Mark Henderson applies to the whole feature 'Handler Mappings', so it applies to all mappings, not a single one.\n\nThere are really three groups of handlers, one that requires Execute permission such as, 'ISAPI\\-dll' or 'CGI\\-exe', the second group that requires 'Script' permissions, all the asp.net handlers are in that group. The third group of handlers only requires 'Read' permission, 'StaticFile' is an example of this. Because it does not execute a process nor does it run a script, it just reads a file from the file system.\n\nYou can check this by open 'Edit Feature Permissions' and uncheck 'Script', most of the mappings are now disabled. Uncheck 'Read' and the last few enabled ones are disabled as well.\n\nTo remove a handler from a site, open the web.config and add something like this:\n\n```\n<system.webServer>\n    <handlers>\n      <remove name=\"PageHandlerFactory-Integrated-4.0\"/>\n    </handlers>\n</system.webServer>  \n\n```\n\nThis will remove the integrate ASP.NET 4 page handler, which means web forms (aspx) will no longer work.\n\nIf you look at the 'Handler Mappings' for the same site in IIS Manager, that mapping still shows up in the enabled section, even though it does no longer work for the site."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about IIS 7 handler mappings, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A web developer is tasked with securing a new IIS 7 server by disabling specific file extensions without removing their handler mappings.

The correct answer, A, is the most effective approach because:\n\n1. It uses the <remove> element in the web.config file, which aligns with the example provided in the documentation for removing specific handlers.\n2.

How can a mirror be used to explain the appearance of mirages?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am not sure whether this is the most effective approach but here's how I would've deal with it.\n\nIt is stated in the question that the force is distributed uniformly. This means that any piece of the disk would experience a force proportional to its area. Keep this in mind.\n\nFurthermore since the torque created by the friction at any point is proportional to this point's distance to the center of the disk, it makes sense to model the disk as many concentric rings. The reason this is sensible is that both the area of such a ring, thus the force on the ring, and the distance for all the points on it to the center can be written in terms of the radius of each ring. Thus it is easy to express the torque on each ring which is just the product of the distance and the force.\n\nThen you can add all the disks back together to acquire the total torque on the disk. This simply means integrating with respect to r from 0 to R.\n\nThis is a sketch of the friction forces acting on different points. Note even they all have the same magnitude, the ones closer to the rim creates a larger torque. Also note all of them creates a torque in the same direction.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nTKma.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nTKma.png)"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about mirages and the request for a challenging multiple-choice question, here's a question that integrates multiple concepts and requires critical thinking:\n\nQuestion: An observer in a desert sees what appears to be a pool of water on the horizon.

Which of the following explanations best describes why a mirror cannot be used to perfectly replicate this mirage effect in a laboratory setting?\n\nA) Mirrors reflect light at a constant angle, while mirages involve gradual bending of light rays\nB) The mirage effect requires a heat source, which a mirror cannot provide\nC) Mirrors can only produce inverted images, unlike the upright images seen in desert mirages\nD) The reflective surface of a mirror is too smooth to simulate atmospheric density variations\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests the ability to apply understanding to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is A because mirages are caused by the gradual bending of light rays through layers of air with varying density, primarily due to temperature differences.

This interpretation integrates multiple concepts from the documentation:\n\n1. The primary meaning of \"scale\" used here aligns with the technical definition of scalability in computing processes, where a system can handle growth without fundamental changes.\n\n2.

So, more than deriving the MLEs (which is straightforward), I would say that this is a good example in order to examine whether pooling samples (**\"unite and conquer\"?**) is more beneficial than keeping the samples separate (**\"divide and conquer\"?**). But \"more beneficial\" according to which criteria? \n\nWe will discuss them as we go along.\n\nNote that we need both sample sizes to be larger than unity, $n\\_1 \\>1, n\\_2 \\> 1$, otherwise the variance estimator will equal zero.\n\nIf we keep the samples separate we will obtain\n\n$$\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_v \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_1}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_1}v\\_i,\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_1 \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_1}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_1}(v\\_i\\-\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_v)^2$$\n\nand \n$$\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_w \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_2}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_2}w\\_i,\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_2 \\= \\\\frac 1{n\\_2}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\_2}(w\\_i\\-\\\\hat \\\\mu\\_w)^2$$\n\nThe MLEs for the means will be unbiased, efficient, consistent and asymptotically normal.\n\nThe variance estimators will be biased, consistent and asymptotically normal (see [this post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/105337/asymptotic-distribution-of-sample-variance-of-non-normal-sample), which holds in general, even for normal samples).\n\nSince we have bias here, it is an easy thought to turn to Mean Squared Error.

So as regards these estimators, pooling the two samples or not, makes no difference as regards the functional form of the estimators, or their properties.\n\nBut the variance estimator will be different. It is also rather easy to derive that\n\n$$\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_p \\= \\\\frac{n\\_1}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_1\\+\\\\frac{n\\_2}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_2$$\n\nThis is also a biased an consistent estimator, and also asymptotically normal, being the convex combination of two asymptotically normal variables.\n\nTurning to the issue of bias and Mean Squared Error, since the two separate\\-samples estimators are independent we have that\n\n$$\\\\text{Var}(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_p) \\= \\\\frac{n\\_1^2}{(n\\_1\\+n\\_2\\)^2}\\\\frac{2(n\\_1\\-1\\)}{n\\_1^2} \\\\sigma^4\\+\\\\frac{n\\_2^2}{(n\\_1\\+n\\_2\\)^2}\\\\frac{2(n\\_2\\-1\\)}{n\\_2^2}\\\\sigma^4 \\= \\\\frac {2n\\_1\\+2n\\_2\\-4}{(n\\_1\\+n\\_2\\)^2}\\\\sigma^4$$\n\nand\n\n$$B\\\\left(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_p\\\\right) \\= \\\\frac{n\\_1}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}E(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_1\\)\\+\\\\frac{n\\_2}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}E(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_2\\) \\- \\\\sigma^2 \\= \\\\frac {\\-2}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2} \\\\sigma^2$$\n\nSo the MSE here is \n\n$$MSE(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_p) \\= \\\\frac {2n\\_1\\+2n\\_2\\-4}{(n\\_1\\+n\\_2\\)^2}\\\\sigma^4\\+\\\\frac {4}{(n\\_1\\+n\\_2\\)^2} \\\\sigma^4 \\= \\\\frac {2}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}\\\\sigma^4$$\n\n**In order for sample\\-pooling to be superior in MSE terms** we want that\n\n$$MSE(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_p) \\< MSE(\\\\hat \\\\sigma^2\\_i), i\\=1,2$$\n\n$$\\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac {2}{n\\_1\\+n\\_2}\\\\sigma^4 \\< \\\\frac{2n\\_i\\-1}{n\\_i^2} \\\\sigma^4 \\\\Rightarrow 2n\\_i^2 \\< 2n\\_in\\_1 \\- n\\_1 \\+ 2n\\_in\\_2 \\- n\\_2$$\n\nThis reduces to the same condition for either $i\\=1$ or $i\\=2$, namely\n$$0 \\< \\- n\\_1 \\+ 2n\\_1n\\_2 \\- n\\_2 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac {n\\_1\\+n\\_2}{n\\_1n\\_2} \\< 2 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac 1{n\\_2} \\+ \\\\frac {1}{n\\_1} \\< 2$$\n\nwhich holds, since both sample sizes are strictly higher than unity.\n\nTherefore we conclude, that **\"unite \\& conquer\" is the MSE\\-efficient approach here**. \n\n**But we will lose something**: if $n\\_1 \\\\neq n\\_2$ the pooled\\-sample variance estimator does not give a Gamma finite sample distributional result, because it is the linear combination of two Gamma random variables *with different scale parameters* (different $\\\\theta\\_i$'s). This does not result into a Gamma, but into a rather complicated infinite sum expression (see [this paper](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02481123?LI=true)).

The correct answer is C, to pool the samples and use a weighted average of the individual variance estimators.\n\nThe documentation shows that when we have two independent samples from normal populations with a common variance, the pooled variance estimator is more efficient in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE) compared to using separate variance estimators.\n\nThe pooled variance estimator is given by:\n\u03c3\u00b2\u1d56 = (n\u2081/(n\u2081+n\u2082))\u03c3\u00b2\u2081 + (n\u2082/(n\u2081+n\u2082))\u03c3\u00b2\u2082\n\nThis estimator combines information from both samples, effectively increasing the total sample size used for estimation.

The first is to note that `EEMEM` just pre\\-allocates variables into the EEPROM memory space, and you can just as easily use the actual memory addresses in the various `eeprom_` api functions. So you could create a table of `#define` constants for the variables you require and access them this way. The only real disadvantage is that you need to keep track of how each variable is allocated, but as soon as you require fixed allocations then you'll have to do this anyway.\n\nIf you only require part of the memory to have fixed allocation and the rest you want the compiler to sort out, you can create a new linker section, for example, called `.eepromfixed`.

The code shows proper I2C communication and initialization for the magnetometer, but there's no initialization for the accelerometer. Specifically:\n\n1. The code initializes the magnetometer's CRA_REG_M register (0x00) to enable the temperature sensor, but there's no equivalent initialization for the accelerometer.\n2. The CTRL_REG1_A (0x20) for the accelerometer is defined but never used in the code. This register is crucial for enabling the accelerometer and setting its data rate and power mode.\n3.

The sentence \"The principal insists (that) teachers attend the professional development seminar\" is grammatically correct and idiomatic.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it incorrectly includes \"to be\" before the verb \"updated.\" In the subjunctive mood, we use the base form of the verb without \"to.\"\n\nOption C is incorrect because it uses a different structure (\"It is essential for...that\") which, while grammatical, does not demonstrate the subjunctive mood as clearly as the correct answer. Additionally, the use of \"that they complete\" instead of just \"they complete\" makes it less idiomatic.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it uses \"submits\" instead of the subjunctive \"submit.\" With \"suggests that,\" we should use the base form of the verb (submit) without the third-person singular -s.\n\nThis question requires students to apply their understanding of the subjunctive mood, recognize its use in context, and differentiate between correct and incorrect applications in natural English sentences.

I'm proposing that we take a look at what makes sites successful, and then what should make site successful, and see if we can shrink the distance between the two. Given this approach, I believe we can make the site a better place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What makes a site successful?\n\n1. Finding a community of users already within Stack Exchange, who are willing to put a bit of time and effort into the process.\n2. A short proposal/ commitment time, made possible by \\#1\\.\n3. A clearly defined scope, that can attract a reasonable number of users.\n4. A scope which there is a large number of questions, which can be reasonably easily found.\n5. Having advocates for a site tends to make it work better.\n6. Steady progress towards the goal.\n7. Maintaining interest in the site\n8. Some kind of critical mass seems to help, once the site is moving, people get excited about it, and help spread the word.\n\nProof of this:\n\n1. [Stack Overflow in Portuguese](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/23539/stack-overflow-in-portuguese?referrer=2cEbomCluXXY236h5e0UuA2)\\- Destined to die until a user started referring people, who believed in the site. Now it is well on its way to success.\n2. Logic Design clearly shows a limited, but good scope, and slow and stead progress towards goals. Activity is shown by the number of questions asked about it.\n3. [Politics](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/25906/politics?referrer=BI9Ll_aP-kRVLwgiGK_kNg2) is slowly on its way to death, with a somewhat inactive creator and no one really spreading the word about the site.\n4. [Chinese Emigration](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/36960/chinese-emigration-?referrer=fEydiZ6VRdfFiZVRcftP7w2)\\- Huge interest initially, but not from within SE. Without SE support, it will likely wither and die.\n5. [Smugmug](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/25069?phase=commitment)\\- Huge initial interest, it took over a year to get the site to beta. By that time, the original interest had drained away, leaving the site to wither. The site is alive, but I wouldn't at all be surprised if it died soon.\n\nWhat should be the metrics?\n\n1. A minimum number of users is required.\n2. How much does the community seem to be forming before the community has officially started?\n3. Some number of users willing to help police the site.\n4. Length of time seems important, perhaps length of time since last visit.\n\nHow could we get there? One thing that I realized when typing this up is that all we need is a few users who are willing to moderate the site in its early stages, and a bunch of people willing to ask questions. It might turn into a free for all early on, but the dust will settle, and the site can be recovered. Science Fiction and Fantasy is living proof of such a site, it was rocky at first, but now stands as a very solid site. All it took was a few people with the power and interest to set the site on the right course. \n\nAs for more of a list:\n\n1. I believe that a user should be required to have at least 200 reputation on at least one site prior to opening a proposal on Area 51\\. Maybe make a minimum 150 reputation or something like that.\n2. Have an option to commit to \"moderate\" a site. Have some criteria that shows how they are helping to moderate a site. This wouldn't require asking questions on the site, but maybe get points for closing, downvoting, and participating on meta, in addition to closing questions, to get the commitment back."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about StackExchange's Area 51 and site success factors, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A new StackExchange site proposal for \"Sustainable Urban Planning\" has gained initial traction but is struggling to reach the commitment phase.

The correct answer, B, aligns with several key success factors mentioned:\n\n1. It addresses finding a community within Stack Exchange (point 1 in the success factors), which is crucial for initial support and faster progression through the proposal/commitment phases (point 2).\n2. Refining the scope addresses the need for a clearly defined scope that can attract a reasonable number of users (point 3).\n3. Promoting steady progress aligns with point 6, which is essential for maintaining momentum.\n4. Identifying active SE users with relevant expertise helps in finding advocates for the site (point 5) and contributes to forming a core group of users willing to moderate the site in its early stages.\n\nOption A is incorrect because broadening the scope contradicts the need for a clearly defined scope, and recruiting primarily from outside SE doesn't leverage the existing community.\n\nOption C is flawed because extending the proposal phase goes against the success factor of having a short proposal/commitment time. Simplifying commitment criteria might lead to less engaged users, contradicting the need for dedicated moderators and active participants.\n\nOption D focuses too heavily on attracting new users to SE, which, as seen in the Chinese Emigration example, can lead to initial interest that withers without SE support.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and critically evaluate different approaches to site development within the StackExchange ecosystem."}, "81": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/04/02", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/43174452", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/5987361/"], "docs_id": 43174452, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have the next code:\n\n```\nvar app = angular.module('ForclazApp', ['ngRoute']);\n\napp.config(function($routeProvider){\n    $routeProvider\n        .when(\"/\", {\n            templateUrl: \"partials/header.html\"\n        })\n        .when(\"/motos\", {\n            templateUrl: \"partials/motos.html\"\n        })\n        .when(\"/repuestos\", {\n            templateUrl: \"partials/repuestos.html\"\n        })\n        .when(\"/taller\", {\n            templateUrl: \"partials/taller.html\"\n        })\n        .when(\"/blog\", {\n            templateUrl: \"partials/blog.html\"\n        })\n        .when(\"/contacto\", {\n            templateUrl: \"partials/contacto.html\"\n        })\n        .otherwise({\n            redirectTo: '/'\n        });\n});\n\n```\n\nDoesn't matter in which link you click, it always redirects to header.html template.

Given the provided code and symptoms, what is the most likely cause of this routing issue?\n\nA) The $routeProvider configuration is incorrectly nested within the app.config function\nB) The application is missing a central ng-view directive in the main HTML template\nC) AngularJS 1.6.3 has a known bug that always defaults to the first defined route\nD) The base href tag in the HTML is set incorrectly, causing all routes to resolve to the root path\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of this issue is the absence of an ng-view directive in the main HTML template. The $routeProvider configuration appears correct, defining multiple routes with their corresponding templateUrls. The menu links are also properly formatted with the correct hash-based syntax for AngularJS routing.\n\nHowever, for the routing to work as expected, AngularJS needs a designated area in the HTML where it can inject the templates defined in the route configuration. This is typically achieved by adding an ng-view directive to the main HTML template, like so: <div ng-view></div>.\n\nWithout this ng-view directive, AngularJS has nowhere to render the templates specified in the route configuration. As a result, it may default to showing only the first template (header.html) or not changing the view at all when routes change.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the $routeProvider configuration is correctly placed within app.config.\nOption C is incorrect as there's no known bug in AngularJS 1.6.3 that would cause this specific behavior.\nOption D is plausible but less likely, as incorrect base href would typically result in 404 errors rather than always showing the header template.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple AngularJS concepts (routing, templates, and directives) and tests the ability to analyze a real-world scenario to identify a common implementation oversight in single-page applications."}, "82": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/02/22", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/265089", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/123930/"], "docs_id": 265089, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have two files\n\n`file1.txt`\n\n```\n78Z|033333157|0000001|PERD1|2150421|D|0507020|3333333311\n78Z|033333157|0000001|PERD0|2160208|A|1900460|3333333311\n78Z|033333157|0000001|RSAB1|2150421|D|0507070|3333333311\n78Z|033333157|0000001|RSAB0|2160208|A|1900460|3333333311\n78Z|033333157|0000001|ANT37|2141023|D|1245260|3333333311\n78Z|033333157|0000001|ANT36|2150422|D|1518490|3333333311\n78Z|033333157|0000001|ANT28|2150321|D|0502090|3333333311\n78Z|033333157|0000001|ANT27|2150122|D|0501450|3333333311\n78Z|033333157|0000001|ANT26|2141222|D|1637460|3333333311\n78Z|033333157|0000001|ANT10|2160208|A|1900460|3333333311\n78Z|033333157|0000001|ABS10|2151221|D|1223390|3333333311\n78Z|696931836|0000001|PERD0|2160203|A|1114450|2222222222\n78Z|696931836|0000001|RSAB0|2160203|A|1114450|2222222222\n78Z|696931836|0000001|ANT09|2160203|A|1114450|2222222222\n78Z|010041586|0000001|PERD0|2160119|A|1835100|3333333333\n78Z|010041586|0000001|RSAB0|2160119|A|1835100|3333333333\n78Z|010041586|0000001|ANT33|2160119|A|1835100|3333333333\n78Z|011512345|0000001|PERD0|2151213|A|1413550|4444444444\n78Z|011512345|0000001|RSAB0|2151213|A|1413550|4444444444\n78Z|011512345|0000001|ANT32|2160219|A|0319230|4444444444\n78Z|011512345|0000001|ANT09|2160218|D|0319230|4444444444\n78Z|011512345|0000001|ANT07|2150729|D|1508230|4444444444\n78Z|011512345|0000001|ANT06|2141013|D|1208190|4444444444\n78Z|011512345|0000001|ABB06|2131224|D|1857030|4444444444\n78Z|012344052|0000001|PERD0|2160203|A|1219570|5555555555\n78Z|012344052|0000001|ANT50|2160203|A|1219570|5555555555\n78Z|099999999|0000001|PERD0|2151214|A|1512460|6666666666\n78Z|099999999|0000001|RSAB0|2151214|A|1512460|6666666666\n78Z|099999999|0000001|ANT32|2160219|A|0319000|6666666666\n78Z|099999999|0000001|ANT09|2160218|D|0319000|6666666666\n78Z|099999999|0000001|ABS10|2150615|D|0125350|6666666666\n\n```\n\n`file2.txt`\n\n```\n3333333311|ANT10\n2222222222|ANT09\n5555555555|ANT50\n3333333333|ANT33\n6666666666|ANT32\n4444444444|ANT09\n\n```\n\nI need a create new file with the lines matched by fourth and eighth column of the `file1.txt` with second and first column of the `file2.txt`\n\nThe result must be (the order is not important)\n\n`file3.txt`\n\n```\n78Z|033333157|0000001|ANT10|2160208|A|1900460|3333333311\n78Z|696931836|0000001|ANT09|2160203|A|1114450|2222222222\n78Z|012344052|0000001|ANT50|2160203|A|1219570|5555555555\n78Z|010041586|0000001|ANT33|2160119|A|1835100|3333333333\n78Z|099999999|0000001|ANT32|2160219|A|0319000|6666666666\n78Z|011512345|0000001|ANT09|2160218|D|0319230|4444444444\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n```\nawk -F'|' 'NR==FNR{e[$2$1]=1;next};e[$4$8]' file2.txt file1.txt\n\n```\n\nFirst read *file2* and set array `e[field2+field1]` then *file1* and print if `e[field4+field8]` is set.\n\nOr turn the fields around:\n\n```\nawk -F'|' 'NR==FNR{e[$1$2]=1;next};e[$8$4]' file2.txt file1.txt\n\n```"}, "answer": "Certainly!

For file2.txt (NR==FNR condition):\n   - It uses '|' as the field separator (-F'|')\n   - Creates an associative array 'e' with keys formed by concatenating $2 and $1 (second and first fields)\n   - Sets the value to 1 for each key (e[$2$1]=1)\n   - Skips to the next record (next)\n\n2. For file1.txt:\n   - It checks if the key formed by concatenating $4 and $8 (fourth and eighth fields) exists in the 'e' array\n   - If it exists, the line is printed\n\nThis approach efficiently creates a lookup table from file2.txt and uses it to filter lines from file1.txt, avoiding the need for sorting or creating temporary files. It leverages AWK's associative arrays for fast lookups, making it more efficient than options B, C, or D.\n\nThe question tests the candidate's ability to analyze a complex AWK command, understand file processing order, and recognize efficient data structure usage in text processing tasks."}, "83": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/31", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/144234", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/72400/"], "docs_id": 144234, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We're doing a simple exercise and we have the following situation:\n\nif ( random(1\\-100\\) \\=\\= 50 OR random( 1\\-100 ) \\=\\= 50 ) THEN\n \\[..]\n\nThe random function may return any number between 1\\-100 1 and 100 included with a theoretic complete randomization.\n\nI'd like to know what is the % of that IF statement to return TRUE.\n\nanother question is:\n\nConsidering the OR statement aqs short\\-circuit does it affect in any way that %.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let X \\= random(1\\-100\\) and Y \\= random( 1\\-100 ).

The root cause is likely related to how the component was modified in the library.

While the matrix M satisfies some necessary conditions for having an integer square root (being positive definite and having a determinant that's a perfect square), these conditions alone are not sufficient to guarantee the existence of an integer square root.\n\nThe fact that all eigenvalues are positive integers is an additional helpful property, but it still doesn't guarantee an integer square root. There are likely additional, more complex conditions that need to be checked to determine if an integer square root exists.\n\nOption A is incorrect because meeting these conditions doesn't definitely ensure an integer square root. Option C is too absolute and contradicts the information given. Option D oversimplifies the problem by focusing only on the trace, which isn't mentioned in the original context.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to critically analyze the given information, recognize the complexity of the problem beyond the stated conditions, and avoid jumping to conclusions based on partial information.

Internals of the ancient 741 opamp. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier#Internal_circuitry_of_741-type_op-amp).*\n\nMost opamps will have an output arrangement similar to the push\\-pull arrangement of the old 741\\. Others will have FET transistors rather than BJTs. In either case if the top transistor (red oval) is turned on the output will be pulled to positive rail. If the bottom transistor (green oval) is turned on the output will be pulled to negative rail. How close they get depends on the exact output configuration and the driving circuitry.\n\n> If you try to obtain a voltage greater than the power rails of an op\\-amp, what will happen?\n\nThe output will turn on as much as it can and will limit your output somewhere between the rails.\n\n> I am assuming that the output \\=\\= the rail limiting it. Is that correct, or does it break the op\\-amp?\n\nYou are correct in that the output will be limited. It will only \"break\" it in that if it latches up there may be a short delay for it to unlatch and begin normal operation again.\n\nNote that this does not take into account what happens if the output is driven outside the rails by an external circuit feeding *back* into the output."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about operational amplifiers and their output behavior, here's a challenging question that integrates multiple concepts and requires critical thinking:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a circuit using an operational amplifier (op-amp) to amplify a small sensor signal. The sensor output ranges from 0 to 100 mV, and the desired output range is 0 to 5V. The op-amp is powered by a dual supply of \u00b112V. During testing, the engineer notices that for some input signals, the output appears to be clipped. What is the most likely cause of this issue, and what modification would best address it?\n\nA) The op-amp's slew rate is too low; replace it with a higher bandwidth op-amp\nB) The gain is set too high; reduce the feedback resistor value\nC) The input signal is exceeding the common-mode range; add a voltage divider at the input\nD) The output is rail-limited; implement a single-supply configuration with voltage biasing\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The problem description indicates that the output is being clipped for some input signals, which suggests that the op-amp is reaching its output limits. Given that the op-amp is powered by \u00b112V supplies, its output should theoretically swing close to these rails. However, the desired output range is only 0 to 5V, which is well within the op-amp's capabilities.\n\nThe issue is likely that the gain is set too high. With a 100 mV maximum input and a desired 5V maximum output, the required gain is 50 (5V / 0.1V). However, if the gain is set higher than this, some input signals could cause the output to exceed 5V, resulting in clipping as the op-amp tries to produce an output beyond the desired range (but still within its own limitations).\n\nOption A is incorrect because slew rate limitations typically cause distortion at high frequencies, not clipping of DC or low-frequency signals.\nOption C is unlikely because the input range is very small (0-100mV) and should be well within the common-mode range of most op-amps.\nOption D is incorrect because the \u00b112V supply is already sufficient for the desired output range; changing to a single-supply configuration would unnecessarily complicate the circuit.\n\nReducing the feedback resistor value (option B) would lower the gain, ensuring that the maximum input signal (100 mV) is amplified to exactly 5V, preventing clipping and utilizing the full desired output range.

They've modeled a switch closure at t=2s using a voltage-controlled switch in PartSim, but the simulated current through a 4k\u03a9 resistor doesn't match their calculated values. Given this scenario, what is the most likely cause of the discrepancy?\n\nA) The student incorrectly calculated the time constant (RC) of the circuit\nB) PartSim's voltage-controlled switch model doesn't accurately represent an ideal switch closure\nC) The initial conditions of the circuit at t=2s weren't properly set in the simulation\nD) The student's calculated function doesn't account for the capacitor's charging behavior\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key issue here lies in the initial conditions of the circuit at the moment the switch closes. The student's calculated function assumes an initial current of 1mA through the 4k\u03a9 resistor when the switch closes at t=2s. However, in the PartSim simulation, the circuit starts from a completely de-energized state at t=0s. \n\nWhen the switch closes at t=2s in the simulation, the capacitor is still uncharged, and the initial current through the 4k\u03a9 resistor would be higher than 1mA (closer to 3mA, given by 12V/4k\u03a9). This mismatch in initial conditions causes the discrepancy between the simulated and calculated results.\n\nTo properly model this scenario, the student would need to either:\n1. Set up the initial voltage across the capacitor in PartSim to match the steady-state condition before the switch closes, or\n2. Adjust their calculations to account for the circuit's behavior from t=0s to t=2s, including the initial charging of the capacitor.\n\nThis question requires the student to analyze the problem, apply circuit theory concepts, and critically think about the differences between idealized calculations and practical simulations, thus targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "94": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/07/17", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/236697", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/229741/"], "docs_id": 236697, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There have been a [few](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/194295/add-an-android-widget-to-the-stack-exchange-app) [different](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/224343/add-a-widget-that-displays-hot-network-questions) feature\\-requests for widgets on Android, and it's something we've been thinking about a lot recently.

There's no revision history, and when they are deleted they're gone for good.\n\nComments are Not Intended to Correct Mistakes\n---------------------------------------------\n\n> ### When shouldn't I comment?\n> \n> \n> Comments are not recommended for any of the following:\n> \n> \n> * **Suggesting corrections** that don't fundamentally change the meaning of the post; instead, make or suggest an edit;\n\nThe people suggesting that this should be a comment, or you shouldn't touch incorrect code in answers are throwing the baby out with the bathwater. [Almost all suggestions not to change code is limited to questions](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88627/how-far-can-i-refactor-the-code-in-someone-elses-question).\n\nUnfortunately, it is a lot easier for people to say, \"Code change, no good\" and reject your edit than to actually comprehend what you've changed and determine if it's good. For people who don't understand the language, it's like trying to correct Czech spelling \\-\\- you're not going to be a good judge. Ideally, people would hit 'Skip', but then they wouldn't be making progress toward review badges.\n\nPersonally I hope you keep suggesting these edits, or better yet make it to 2000 rep so you can edit them without the queue. These edits make the site better and provide better resources for future readers. They should be encouraged, not rejected out of ignorance."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A junior developer on your team has noticed a syntax error in a highly-upvoted answer on Stack Overflow. The error is minor but could confuse beginners. The developer asks for your advice on how to handle this situation. What is the most appropriate course of action that aligns with Stack Overflow's collaborative editing philosophy while ensuring the integrity of the original answer?\n\nA) Suggest that the junior developer post a comment pointing out the error and wait for the original answerer to make the correction\nB) Advise the junior developer to make an edit correcting the syntax error, providing a clear edit summary explaining the change\nC) Recommend creating a new answer that includes the corrected code and explains why the original answer contained an error\nD) Instruct the junior developer to ignore the error as editing others' code is generally discouraged on Stack Overflow\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate action is to advise the junior developer to make an edit correcting the syntax error, with a clear edit summary. This aligns with Stack Overflow's collaborative editing philosophy as outlined in the documentation. The help center explicitly states that posts are intended to be collaboratively edited, and that edits to \"correct minor mistakes\" are common reasons for edits. Furthermore, the documentation advises against using comments to suggest corrections that don't fundamentally change the meaning of the post, instead recommending making or suggesting an edit.\n\nThis approach also addresses the issue of reviewers potentially rejecting edits due to unfamiliarity with the programming language. By providing a clear edit summary, the junior developer increases the chances that knowledgeable reviewers will approve the edit. The documentation highlights a real-world example where edits correcting syntax errors were eventually approved by reviewers familiar with the language in question.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation specifically discourages using comments for suggesting corrections. Option C is unnecessary and could lead to duplicate information. Option D contradicts the collaborative editing philosophy of Stack Overflow and the guidance provided in the documentation.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about best practices in collaborative online environments."}, "98": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/09/22", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1077578", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/874195/"], "docs_id": 1077578, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to delete var/log files due to low disk space, but I cannot find out how. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As mentioned, you can delete a specific log file with `sudo rm /var/log/<FILENAME>` or all of them with `sudo rm /var/log/*`.\n\nI also found this: \n`du -h /var/log/ 2>/dev/null > ~/fileinfo` to list the size and path of every log file.

After identifying that log files in /var/log are consuming excessive space, which approach would be most effective in addressing the immediate issue while maintaining best practices for system management?\n\nA) Execute 'sudo rm /var/log/*' to delete all log files and free up space immediately\nB) Implement a log rotation policy and compress older logs before deleting any files\nC) Use 'du -h /var/log/ 2>/dev/null > ~/fileinfo', analyze the output, and selectively delete the largest log files\nD) Move all log files to a separate partition with more available space\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of system administration concepts, integrating multiple aspects from the documentation and best practices. \n\nOption A, while mentioned in the documentation, is an extreme measure that could delete important system information and potentially cause issues with running services expecting log files to exist.\n\nOption B is a good long-term solution but doesn't address the immediate critical disk space issue.\n\nOption D is a temporary workaround that doesn't solve the root problem and may just delay dealing with the issue.\n\nOption C is the most appropriate because:\n1. It allows the admin to identify which log files are consuming the most space using the command provided in the documentation.\n2. It enables selective deletion of the largest files, addressing the immediate disk space issue.\n3. It maintains a balance between freeing up space and preserving potentially important log information.\n4.

Given the error messages and configuration steps provided, what is the most likely root cause of the DHCP server failing to start properly?\n\nA) Incorrect network interface specification in the DHCP server configuration\nB) Syntax error in the DHCP configuration file\nC) Incompatible subnet and IP range configuration\nD) Insufficient system permissions to start the DHCP service\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely root cause of the DHCP server failing to start properly is a syntax error in the DHCP configuration file (option B). This conclusion is based on several key observations from the provided information:\n\n1. The error message \"check syslog for diagnostics\" appears during both installation and restart attempts, indicating a configuration issue rather than a system-level problem.\n\n2. In Step 3, there's a critical typo in the configuration file: \"dafault-lease-time\" instead of \"default-lease-time\". This syntax error would prevent the DHCP server from parsing the configuration file correctly.\n\n3. While option A (incorrect network interface specification) could be a potential issue due to the lowercase 's' in \"INTERFACEs\", this alone is unlikely to cause a complete failure to start the service.\n\n4. Option C (incompatible subnet and IP range) is not likely the primary issue, as the provided subnet and IP range appear to be consistent.\n\n5. Option D (insufficient permissions) is less probable because the commands are being run with root privileges (indicated by the '#' prompt).\n\nThe syntax error in the configuration file is the most severe issue that would prevent the DHCP server from starting. It's a common mistake that would cause the server to fail immediately upon attempting to read the configuration. Fixing this typo would be the first step in resolving the issue, and it aligns with the instruction to check syslog for diagnostics, as such an error would typically be logged there.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (DHCP configuration, error message interpretation, and Linux system administration) and tests the ability to analyze a real-world scenario to identify the most critical issue among several potential problems."}}
