In these coordinates, the volume element can be written as d\u2074k = k\u00b3 dk d\u03a9, where d\u03a9 represents the solid angle element. Since the integrand only depends on the magnitude of k, the angular integration \u222b d\u03a9 contributes only a constant factor. This leaves us with an integral over k, where the measure d\u2074k contributes a factor of k\u00b3, resulting in the form \u222b dk k^(D-1). This approach maintains the Lorentz invariance of the integral while simplifying its evaluation."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/08/19", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1115369", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/364808/"], "docs_id": 1115369, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: USB\\-3, Thunder Bolt is today's standard, but I'm seeing a lot of boards still coming with a Parallel port on new motherboards with the LGA1151 socket.\n\nIs the parallel port still in use for today's technology? \n\nI am not talking about the serial port, but the 25\\-pin parallel port.\n\nSome Examples\n**Asus H110M\\-D** and the **Gigabyte GA\\-H110M\\-S2PH**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, if you're Asus, Gigabyte, etc. and you're designing a motherboard, the cost of adding a parallel port is practically non\\-existent if you're already putting a serial port on it. Serial ports are still useful \\-\\- much more so than parallel ports. But the thing is, the SAME chip controls both, so the question becomes \"why not?\" Both of the motherboards you linked to also have a serial port on them.\n\nSecondly, a USB\\<\\-\\>Parallel adapter takes the simplest of interfaces and makes it way more complicated than it should be. Any time I encounter one of these adapters, I wind up spending more time getting the stupid adapter to work than I do getting the device that plugs into it to work. Sometimes there's just no substitute for having an actual, physical parallel port.\n\nThere are several other reasons why the good old parallel port can still be found on modern computers. I myself have witnessed the following with my own two eyes:\n\n* [Software protection dongles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_protection_dongle). There are still many old and esoteric scientific/engineering applications in use that use the parallel port for their anti\\-piracy dongles. One I saw recently was for calculating mineral densities from the sample data taken from a gas spectrometer. No need to update an app like that because all it does is a single, very specific kind of math problem. It does, however, benefit from running on a faster computer than the ones available when it was written, and the dongle lets you replace the computer with ease.\n* Heavy industrial equipment interfaces. Think computerized textile looms, assembly line robots, parcel sorting machines, etc. These devices have a service life of decades \\-\\- much longer than the computer that controls them could be expected to last. Many of them have been in use since the 1980's when parallel ports were not only common; they were the fastest connection available at the time. I recently saw one being used by a plasma cutter making custom ducting for an HVAC supplier.\n* My son is in the Boy Scouts. At their annual Pinewood Derby races, his troop has a track that records the race times over a parallel port and flags the winner from each round.\n* Old large format/high\\-capacity printers. Some of these things are 20 years old and still going strong. They even still make parts for them.\n* Some business are still using old Nortel PBX systems for their phones. In the one I saw a couple years ago, a parallel port connected the PBX to the voice mail server. It also used a WYSE dumb terminal to program it, which I was unable to figure out.\n\nThese are just the ones I've seen. Remember that computers aren't just for playing games and goofing around on the Internet. Some of them are built to get work done, and parallel ports often come in handy for that."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why parallel ports are still included on some modern motherboards despite the prevalence of newer technologies like USB-3 and Thunderbolt?\n\nA) Parallel ports are faster and more reliable than USB-3 and Thunderbolt for data transfer.\n\nB) The cost of including a parallel port is negligible when a serial port is already present, and it maintains compatibility with certain legacy hardware and software.\n\nC) Parallel ports are required for modern gaming peripherals and high-speed internet connections.\n\nD) Motherboard manufacturers include parallel ports purely for aesthetic reasons to appeal to nostalgic consumers.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the documentation explains that the cost of adding a parallel port is minimal when a serial port is already included, as they often use the same chip. Additionally, parallel ports maintain compatibility with various legacy systems and specialized equipment still in use, such as software protection dongles, industrial equipment interfaces, and old large format printers. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they misrepresent the capabilities and reasons for including parallel ports on modern motherboards."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/05/06", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12722", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/7226/"], "docs_id": 12722, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a list of filenames as `id-datetime.txt`, one each line, where id is always the same and datetime is ordered.\n\nI need first and last datetime so having a sed\\_script in a variable `$script` that grabs it I can do\n\n```\nsed -nr \"1 $script p; \\$ $script'\n\n```\n\nI get\n\n```\ndatetime (oldest)\ndatetime (newest)\n\n```\n\nalso working with a single\\-file list.\n\nNow what if I'd like to get also another line with also the id like\n\n```\nid\ndatetime (oldest)\ndatetime (newest)\n\n```\n\nis there an (easy) way of editing line 1 twice so it gives 2 separate lines?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ok, I got it\n\n```\n1 {\n    #hold the line\n    h\n    #extract id\n    s|^([0-9]{6}).*|\\1|; p\n    #put line back again\n    g\n    #get datetime\n    $sed_str\n}\n\n```\n\nthis part of the sed script will print (and edit) the first line twice"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: You have a list of filenames in the format \"id-datetime.txt\", one per line, where the id is consistent and the datetime is ordered.

However, I would like to add that may be you should try `pandoc`[Homepage](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). It can convert various formats like `latex`, html, xhtml, html5, docx, odt, epub, `conTeXt` etc. into each other. My experience has been pleasant. However, installation of pandoc requires `haskell platform` which took nearly 350MB of space on `ubuntu 12.04`.\n\nFor a good rendering of math in `html`, I think that `mathjax` is the way to go. It is supported by most browsers. It can handle most of the `latex` math environments. One drawback though is the slow loading of the webpages with a lot of math.\n\nI used:\n\n```\npandoc -s --mathjax a.tex -o a.html\n\n```\n\nto get\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LKoYY.png)\n\nPersonally, I have converted my PhD Thesis with a lot of math into html using `pandoc` which also handles bibliographies.\n\nEDIT: Major bugs regarding math environments have been addressed in pandoc v1\\.9\\.2\\. The example above uses the latest version 1\\.9\\.4\\.5\\. Ubuntu repository has older versions.

This approach offers several advantages:\n\n1. It provides a reliable and consistent way to move all VMs, including system VMs like VCSA.\n2.

Even the Microcontroller is active low reset). I'm guessing there's reasons beyond the technology used as to why this still pervades (such as active low would reset on a brown out condition, chips would reset on power\\-on, tradition, etc.). \n\nSomething that I haven't really thought about until now, is what would be the better design when driving active low logic (specifically resets on other chips) from a microcontroller. Is it better to: \n\nA. Drive the resets directly from the microcontroller, with a 1 for an indefinite period of time, or\n\nB. Add a pullup resistor to Vdd and use the microcontroller to briefly pull down to 0\n\nOption B adds more footprint and cost (BOM), but I would guess it would be more stable, since it's passively being tied up to the non\\-reset position, and uses less static power consumption (even if negligible) on the uC since the output would be high for only a brief blip. Also trivial, but the programming would also be a little easier (Reset \\= 1 resets the line). Option A is simpler but, but an unintended reset on that line would cause the system to fail. A full power cycle would be needed to recover the system.\n\nI also think about what position I would like to be in better with my design if the reset line also were to fail permanently \\-\\- if it were pulled up by a resistor, the system could still remain mostly functional, but if it was just the microcontroller driving the output, everything would be stuck in reset (completely nonfunctional). I've never heard of a single pin failing on a microcontroller though. \n\nFor an active low *data* line, I would never consider option B. There's no justification to add that many pullups. \n\nI'm guessing there's no practical difference between the two (i.e., microcontrollers are reliable enough to drive a solid 1 for long periods of time without glitches), so I should go with A to save on cost and footprint.

While both options A and B can work, B allows for the addition of other reset mechanisms such as hidden switches, brownout monitors, or watchdog timers.

This returns a matrix with 15 rows, with one extra predictor added each time. However there is no suggestion as to which model to choose. Have I missed something? Is there a way I can get the lars package to return just one \"*best*\" model?\n\nThere are other posts suggesting using `glmnet` instead but this seems more complicated.

Any general comments on LASSO/lars/glmnet would also be greatly appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Using `glmnet` is really easy once you get the grasp of it thanks to its excellent vignette in [http://web.stanford.edu/\\~hastie/glmnet/glmnet\\_alpha.html](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html) (you can also check the CRAN package page).\nAs for the best lambda for `glmnet`, the rule of thumb is to use \n\n```\ncvfit <- glmnet::cv.glmnet(x, y)\ncoef(cvfit, s = \"lambda.1se\")\n\n```\n\ninstead of `lambda.min`.\n\nTo do the same for `lars` you have to do it by hand. Here is my solution\n\n```\ncv <- lars::cv.lars(x, y, plot.it = FALSE, mode = \"step\")\nidx <- which.max(cv$cv - cv$cv.error <= min(cv$cv))\ncoef(lars::lars(x, y))[idx,]\n\n```\n\nBear in mind that this is not exactly the same, because this is stopping at a lasso knot (when a variable enters) instead of at any point.\n\nPlease note that `glmnet` is the preferred package now, it is actively maintained, more so than `lars`, and that there have been questions about `glmnet` vs `lars` answered before (algorithms used differ).\n\nAs for your question of using lasso to choose variables and then fit OLS, it is an ongoing debate. Google for OLS post Lasso and there are some papers discussing the topic. Even the authors of Elements of Statistical Learning admit it is possible. \n\n**Edit**: Here is the code to reproduce more accurately what `glmnet` does in `lars`\n\n```\n  cv <- lars::cv.lars(x, y, plot.it = FALSE)\n  ideal_l1_ratio <- cv$index[which.max(cv$cv - cv$cv.error <= min(cv$cv))]\n  obj <- lars::lars(x, y)\n  scaled_coefs <- scale(obj$beta, FALSE, 1 / obj$normx)\n  l1 <- apply(X = scaled_coefs, MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(x) sum(abs(x)))\n  coef(obj)[which.max(l1 / tail(l1, 1) > ideal_l1_ratio),]\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of LASSO variable selection using the glmnet package in R, which of the following statements is correct regarding the selection of the optimal lambda value?\n\nA) The best lambda value is always lambda.min from cv.glmnet()\nB) The rule of thumb is to use lambda.1se from cv.glmnet()\nC) The optimal lambda should be manually calculated using the lars package\nD) The lambda value doesn't affect the variable selection process\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Is that normal, and should I be concerned?\n\nLong Version:\nIn the picture is a white 14/3 wire running parallel and very close to a black 14/2 wire. They travel closely for about 8 feet to the crawl space below.\n\nThe white one used to be jumped off of the black wire in the box above this picture (but out of frame), but It is now wired only to a 3\\-way switch in that box. In the crawl space it is dead\\-ended in a junction box.\n\nI was going to use it to operate a different light that hadn't been on a 3\\-way switch before by reconnecting it at that crawl\\-space junction box.\n\nHowever, it is showing a current despite no known connection to a circuit. Is it possible that running so close to the live black wire makes it look like it has a current? And is it safe to use it as is, or should I crack into the wall more to separate them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Voltage and Current are 2 very different things. Voltage is like pressure in a water line, current is the flow rate. A tiny 1/4\" at high pressure isn't going to flow a lot of water, a fire hydrant at relatively low pressure will flow A LOT!\n\nNow, getting to your issue: You probably have an induced current , that's how transformers work. All you can do is put a load (like and old style incandescent bulb) on it and see if the power goes away. The non\\-contact testers or even the modern multi\\-meters are so sensitive they'll detect almost anything. If you don't feel safe working on the circuit, you'll have to turn off the breaker to the other cable as well."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An electrician is troubleshooting a white wire that shows current despite not being connected to a power source. The wire runs parallel to a live black wire for about 8 feet.

The electrician should use an incandescent bulb to test for actual power flow.\nC) The non-contact tester is faulty and giving false readings. The electrician should replace the testing equipment.\nD) The white wire is secretly connected to another power source. The electrician needs to trace the entire wire path to find the connection.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely explanation is induced voltage, which occurs when a wire runs parallel to a live wire for some distance. This is similar to how transformers work. The electrician should use an incandescent bulb as a load to test if there's actual power flow in the wire. If there's no real current, the bulb won't light up.

In talks and introductory courses, the point of view is overwhelmingly frequentist ([MLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood), $p$ values), but there tends to be a tiny fraction of time dedicated to admire Bayes formula and touch upon the idea of a *prior distribution*, usually tangentially. \n\nThe tone employed to discuss Bayesian statistics oscillates between respect for its conceptual underpinnings, and a hint of skepticism regarding the chasm between lofty objectives, and arbitrariness in the selection of the prior distribution, or eventual use of frequentist maths after all.\n\nSentences such as \"if you are a hard\\-core Bayesian...\" abound.\n\nThe question is, Who are the Bayesians today? Are they some select academic institutions where you know that if you go there you will become a Bayesian? If so, are they specially sought after? Are we referring to just a few respected statisticians and mathematicians, and if so who are they?\n\nDo they even exist as such, these pure \"Bayesians\"? Would they happily accept the label? Is it always a flattering distinction? Are they mathematicians with peculiar slides in meetings, deprived of any $p$ values and confidence intervals, easily spotted on the brochure?\n\nHow much of a [niche](https://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/is-bayesian-inference-a-religion/) is being a \"Bayesian\"? Are we referring to a minority of statisticians?\n\nOr is current Bayesian\\-ism equated with machine learning applications?\n\n... Or even more likely, is Bayesian statistics not so much a branch of statistics, but rather an [epistemological](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/) movement that transcends the ambit of probability calculations into a philosophy of science? In this regard, all scientists would be Bayesian at heart... but there would be no such thing as a pure Bayesian statistician impermeable to frequentist techniques (or contradictions).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm going to take your questions in order:\n\n> The question is, Who are the Bayesians today?\n\nAnybody who does Bayesian data analysis and self\\-identifies as \"Bayesian\". Just like a programmer is someone who programs and self\\-identifies as a \"programmer\". A slight difference is that for historical reasons *Bayesian* has ideological connotations, because of the often heated argument between proponents of \"frequentist\" interpretations of probability and proponents of \"Bayesian\" interpretations of probability.\n\n> Are they some select academic institutions, where you know that if you go there you will become a Bayesian?\n\nNo, just like other parts of statistics you just need a good book (and perhaps a good teacher).\n\n> If so, are they specially sought after?\n\nBayesian data analysis is a very useful tool when doing statistical modeling, which I imagine is a pretty sought\\-after skill, (even if companies perhaps aren't specifically looking for \"Bayesians\").\n\n> Are we referring to just a few respected statisticians and mathematicians, and if so who are they?\n\nThere are many respected statisticians that I believe would call themselves *Bayesians*, but those are not *the* Bayesians. \n\n> Do they even exist as such, these pure \"Bayesians\"?\n\nThat's a bit like asking \"Do these pure programmers exist\"? There is an amusing article called [46656 Varieties of Bayesians](http://fitelson.org/probability/good_bayes.pdf), and sure there is a healthy argument among \"Bayesians\" regarding many foundational issues. Just like programmers can argue over the merits of different programming techniques. (BTW, pure programmers program in Haskell).\n\n> Would they happily accept the label?\n\nSome do, some don't. When I discovered Bayesian data analysis I thought it was the best since sliced bread (I still do) and I was happy to call myself a \"Bayesian\" (not least to irritate the p\\-value people at my department). Nowadays I don't like the term, I think it might alienate people as it makes Bayesian data analysis sound like some kind of cult, which it isn't, rather than a useful method to have in your statistical toolbox.\n\n> Is it always a flattering distinction?\n\nNope! As far as I know, the term \"Bayesian\" was introduced by the famous statistician Fisher as a derogatory term. Before that it was called \"inverse probability\" or just \"probability\".\n\n> Are they mathematicians with peculiar slides in meetings, deprived of any p values and confidence intervals, easily spotted on the brochure?\n\nWell, there are conferences in Bayesian statistics, and I don't think they include that many p\\-values. Whether you'll find the slides peculiar will depend on your background...\n\n> How much of a niche is being a \"Bayesian\"? Are we referring to a minority of statisticians?\n\nI still think a minority of statisticians deal with Bayesian statistics, but I also think the proportion is growing.\n\n> Or is current Bayesian\\-ism equated with machine learning applications?\n\nNope, but Bayesian models are used a lot in machine learning. Here is a great machine learning book that presents machine learning from a Bayesian/probibalistic perspective: [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/\\~murphyk/MLbook/](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) \n\nHope that answered most of the questions :)\n\n*Update:*\n\n> \\[C]ould you please consider adding a list of specific techniques or premises that distinguish Bayesian statistics?\n\nWhat distinguish Bayesian statistics is the use of Bayesian models :) Here is [my spin on what a Bayesian model *is*](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/129712/6920):\n\n*A Bayesian model is a statistical model where you use probability to represent all uncertainty within the model, both the uncertainty regarding the output but also the uncertainty regarding the input (aka parameters) to the model. The whole prior/posterior/Bayes theorem thing follows on this, but in my opinion, using probability for everything is what makes it Bayesian (and indeed a better word would perhaps just be something like probabilistic model).*\n\nNow, Bayesian models can be tricky to *fit*, and there is a host of different computational techniques that are used for this. But these techniques are not *Bayesian* in themselves. To namedrop some computational techniques:\n\n* Markov chain Monte Carlo\n\t+ Metropolis\\-Hastings\n\t+ Gibbs sampling\n\t+ Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\n* Variational Bayes\n* Approximate Bayesian computation\n* Particle filters\n* Laplace approximation\n* And so on...\n\n> Who was the famous statistician who introduced the term 'Bayesian' as derogatory?\n\nIt was supposedly Ronald Fisher.

With parallel devices, the only way you can get a NACK, is if all generate a NACK. Effectively, you have no way of verifying if the the slave received the data. You have turned a communication protocol into an unknown.\n\nFrom [Understanding the I2C Bus](http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva704/slva704.pdf).\n\n> There are several conditions that lead to the generation of a NACK:\n> \n> \n> 1.

The ACK/NACK system becomes unreliable as a NACK would only occur if all devices NACK simultaneously. This means the master cannot detect if individual slaves received data correctly, potentially leading to undetectable communication failures. While this approach might seem to work initially, it defeats the purpose of I2C's built-in error detection and can make troubleshooting extremely difficult.

The key insight is that the mapping A \u2192 A^O (where A is a complexity class and O is an oracle) is not solely determined by the elements in the language O. Instead, it depends on how A is semantically defined and how it interacts with the oracle.\n\nFor instance, NP^O allows both nondeterminism and access to O, while P^O allows deterministic polynomial time computation and access to O.

So why is there a difference?\n\nAccording to these links [\"creature\"](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/creature?s=t) is pronounced as \"kree\\-cher\" whereas [\"creative\"](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/creative?s=t) is pronounced as \"kree\\-ey\\-tiv\", why \"ey\" added in next than in the first.\n\nIs there any rule to remember where to use \"ey\" and where not to?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is just a weird facet of modern English pronunciation. I don't know any particularly good explanation or mnemonic. \"Creature\" and \"creative\" are actually both pronounced somewhat irregularly/unpredictably, although in different ways (in \"creature\", the sequence \"ea\" is pronounced in an unexpected way, and in \"creative\", the stress is placed in an unexpected place).\n\nSome background material: the digraph \"ea\" is often used in English to represent a single vowel sound, and its etymological origin in these contexts is usually a single vowel sound or diphthong: e.g. \"beak\" from French *bec,* \"bean\" from Old English *b\u0113an* (Old English \"ea\" was a diphthong, not a sequence of two separate vowels), \"treat\" from Old French *tretier, traitier* (modern French \"traiter\").\n\nThe spelling and pronunciation of \"creature\" appears at first glance to fit this pattern, but actually, the \"ea\" in \"creature\" doesn't come from a historical monophthong or diphthong. It comes from two vowels in hiatus (the OED says \"\\< Anglo\\-Norman *creatur,* Anglo\\-Norman and Old French *criature,* Anglo\\-Norman and Old French, Middle French *creature* (French *cr\u00e9ature*)\").\n\nRegarding the pronunciation, the OED says\n\n> The stem vowel appears to have shown some variation in early modern English, but generally to have shown the reflex of Middle English open *\u0113*; the different developments of this sound in different regional varieties of English largely account for the variation in the stem vowel which is found subsequently. (There is also very limited evidence for a trisyllabic pronunciation in early modern English, on the same pattern as creation n.) critter n. shows a variant with shortening of the stem vowel after raising to /i\u02d0/. The realization of the second syllable varied in Middle English and early modern English according to whether this syllable showed secondary stress; pronunciations of the type /\u02c8kri\u02d0t\u0283\u0259/ ultimately reflect pronunciations with secondary stress, while pronunciations of the type /\u02c8kri\u02d0t\u0259/ ultimately reflect pronunciations without such secondary stress. Compare forms at nature n., pasture n., etc.\n\nIn trisyllabic or polysyllabic words taken from French, stress often seems to move \"back\" from the final syllable in an alternating fashion. I'll give an example: the word \"relative\", from French *relatif/relative,* is thought to have been pronounced with stress on the final syllable in the past (the modern French pronunciation sounds to an English ear like it has final stress). The present\\-day stress on the first syllable in English can be explained as a strengthening of an originally secondary stress on the first syllable. Alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables is known to be a tendency in English pronunciation: for example, compare the pronunciation of \"prohibit\", where the first syllable has no secondary stress because it immediately precedes a stressed syllable, to that of \"prohibition\", which seems to have secondary stress on the first syllable.\n\nAnyway, the alternating\\-stress explanation is a bit hypothetical, but we can verify that many trisyllables and polysyllables from French are currently pronounced with stress on the third\\-to\\-last or \"antepenultimate\" syllable. (There are classes of regular or predictable exceptions to this stress pattern, like words with a \"heavy\" consonant cluster after the second\\-to\\-last syllable, e.g. \"collective\" or \"deceptive\".)\n\n### Creative\n\n\"Creative\" is an *unpredictable* exception to the general tendency towards antepenultimate stress in words of this type: there is no obvious explanation for its penult stress that I know of (it only has a single consonant after the stressed syllable).\n\nIt seems likely that \"creative\" has a stressed, \"long\" vowel in the second\\-to\\-last syllable in part due to influence from the verb \"create\". Word\\-final stress is somewhat regular in certain types of disyllabic verbs. (See this question for notes on the pronunciation of other adjectives ending in *\\-ative*: [Is there a rule for the position of the accent (stressed sound) in words ending with \\-ative?](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/307413/is-there-a-rule-for-the-position-of-the-accent-stressed-sound-in-words-ending))\n\nIt may also be related to the use of penult stress in the noun \"creator\": note that all speakers use this stress pattern for this word, while some other nouns ending in \"\\-ator\" like \"narrator\" and \"dictator\" may be pronounced with antepenultimate stress.\n\n### Creature\n\nAccording to the alternating\\-stress/antepenultimate stress principle (which, as mentioned, doesn't always accurately predict the position of stress in modern English), the word \"creature\" would have been expected to be pronounced something like /\u02c8kri\u02d0\u0259t\u0283\u0259r/. However, in a sequence of a stressed vowel immediately followed by unstressed schwa, like \\[i\u02d0\u0259], it's relatively easy for the schwa to be lost. That seems to have happened here. It's also possible that the disyllabic pronunciation was strengthened by the many words spelled with \"ea\" representing a monophthong, including the now\\-rhyming \"feature\" from Old French *feture, faiture.*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains the difference in pronunciation between \"creature\" and \"creative\"?\n\nA) \"Creature\" comes from a single vowel sound historically, while \"creative\" comes from two separate vowels.\n\nB) The stress pattern in \"creative\" follows the regular rule for words ending in \"-ative\", while \"creature\" is an exception.\n\nC) \"Creature\" lost its middle syllable over time, while \"creative\" retained its original pronunciation from French.\n\nD) \"Creature\" follows the alternating-stress principle, while \"creative\" is an unpredictable exception to this rule.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is D. The passage explains that \"creature\" follows the general tendency in English for alternating stress patterns and antepenultimate stress in words of French origin. Over time, it lost its middle unstressed syllable, resulting in its current pronunciation. \n\nOn the other hand, \"creative\" is described as an \"unpredictable exception\" to this general rule. It has stress on the penultimate syllable, which is not typical for words of its structure. The passage explicitly states that there is no obvious explanation for this stress pattern in \"creative\".\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's the opposite of what the passage states. \"Creature\" actually comes from two vowels in hiatus historically, while many words with \"ea\" come from a single vowel sound.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage doesn't suggest that words ending in \"-ative\" regularly follow the stress pattern of \"creative\". In fact, it mentions that \"creative\" is an exception.\n\nOption C is partially true for \"creature\" but doesn't accurately describe \"creative\".

An interesting article appeared about a .50 caliber bullet found at the site of the Battle of Ox Hill. The 21st Massachusetts Regiment had fought at a local cornfield with extreme and horrifying injuries. Yet, they had no medical care. The bullet has molar tooth cusp imprints, reportedly from a patient biting during surgery without anesthesia.\n\nAn evidence possibly showing the origin of the phrase is the tooth marks found on a 200\\-year\\-old musket ball on display at *The Dr. Samuel D. Harris National Museum of Dentistry*:\n\n> ![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hcuwR.jpg)\n> \n> \n> The bullet on display at the museum was excavated from what is now the Northport section of Baltimore but is believed to have been a field hospital during the War of 1812\\. University of Maryland Dental School pathologist and forensic odontologist Dr. Bernard Levy analyzed the musket ball and verified the impressions are from a human\u2019s dentition.\n> \n> \n> This makes the musket ball a rare find because while many lead musket balls from the Civil War and prior conflicts have been found with teeth marks on them, Dr. Swank said the vast majority have been chewed on by feral hogs who rooted them from the ground. Spotting the difference between a bullet chewed by a hog and one a human chomped on to withstand a painful medical procedure takes some skill, but dental professionals are best equipped to notice.\n> \n> \n> *[http://www.dentalproductsreport.com/dental/article/biting\\-bullet](http://www.dentalproductsreport.com/dental/article/biting-bullet)*\n\nHere is another evidence, chewed bullets from [the Battle of Antietam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Antietam). These bullets, which Civil War soldiers bit during surgery conducted without anesthesia, are known as *pain bullets* also:\n\n> ![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pB2bg.jpg)\n> \n> \n> Archaeologists have determined that these human\\-chewed bullets are most likely from men who perhaps believed it would ease their pain to \"bite the bullet.\"\n> \n> \n> *[http://civilwarstory.nstemp.com/civil\\-war\\-archaeology.html](http://civilwarstory.nstemp.com/civil-war-archaeology.html)*\n\n---\n\nOn the other hand, I found some sources that are against the idea of *pain bullets*. They think that people wouldn't put easily swallowed bullets in their mouth during surgeries and bite marks on the bullets are mostly from animals and especially from hogs.\n\nHere is a plausible explanation from an antique medical, surgical \\& dental artifacts resource site:\n\n> So\\-called medical chewed or pain bullets are mis\\-identified. An easily swallowed bullet is the last thing that one would want to put in the mouth of any anxious patient. To bite the bullet is not a medical phrase, rather it is an old military term referring to loading a muzzleloader. The tip of a preloaded ball and powder paper cartridge was opened with the soldier's teeth, the powder and ball were then poured into the muzzle, the paper cartridge, itself, came next as packing, lastly, all was tamped down with a ram rod. In the heat of battle, it is possible that soldiers may have bitten the paper cartridge at the wrong end (bullet end) and this may have caused some of the marks.\n> \n> \n> *<http://www.antiquescientifica.com/alerts.htm>*\n\n*[Ciwilwarscholars.com](http://civilwarscholars.com/2011/10/myth-no-2-biting-on-the-bullet-for-pain-george-wunderlich/)* and *[civilwarvirtualmuseum.org](http://www.civilwarvirtualmuseum.org/medicine/field-medicine/bitten-bullets.php)* are among the sources that are against the *pain bullet* idea. For example, in one of the sources, it is mentioned that both chloroform and ether were available for administration before surgery. The first method of anesthesia, nitrite oxide, was introduced in 1844; ether as an anesthetic was first used by Horace Wells (an American dentist) in 1846; and the Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson first used the anesthetic qualities of chloroform in 1847\\. But there is an evidence that there are chewed bullets with human bite marks that are older than the discovery of anesthesia.\n\nAlthough there are some plausible explanations against the theory, most authoritative sources favor it. So we can conclude that there is strong evidence from authoritative sources that pain bullets were used during surgeries; and it is the origin of the phrase \"bite the bullet\".\n\n---\n\nBonus readings:\n\n* *<http://www.pochefamily.org/books/MeltedLead.html>*\n* *<http://www.mytreasurespot.com/main/read.php?5,92836,93227>*\n* *[http://civilwartalk.com/threads/pain\\-bullet.25666/](http://civilwartalk.com/threads/pain-bullet.25666/)*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the origin of the phrase \"bite the bullet\" is most accurate according to the provided information?\n\nA) The phrase originated from soldiers biting bullets while loading muzzleloaders during battle.\n\nB) The phrase comes from patients biting on bullets during surgeries before the widespread use of anesthesia.\n\nC) The phrase has no connection to actual bullet-biting and is purely metaphorical.\n\nD) The origin of the phrase is definitively known and undisputed by historians.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While there is some debate, the most authoritative sources presented in the text support the idea that \"bite the bullet\" originated from patients biting on bullets during painful surgeries before anesthesia was widely available.
