You have selected the Shipping Address but haven't chosen a Shipping Method before clicking \"Next\". You're using a customized DHL Shipping Method. What is the most likely cause of this error and how can you resolve it?\n\nA) The error is caused by an incompatible database connection. Modify the app/etc/env.php file to correct the database settings.\n\nB) The shipping method model needs to be overridden. Create a custom module to extend the DHL shipping method and implement the required changes.\n\nC) The error is due to missing shipping rates. Ensure that the shipping rates are properly configured in the Magento admin panel for the DHL shipping method.\n\nD) The checkout process is faulty. Rebuild the checkout module and clear the cache to resolve the issue.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The error \"Carrier with such method not found: null, null\" suggests that there's an issue with the shipping method implementation. Given that you've customized the DHL Shipping Method, the most likely cause is that the overridden model is not properly implemented or is missing crucial functionality. \n\nThe correct approach to resolve this issue is to create a custom module that extends the DHL shipping method (option B). This allows you to override the necessary parts of the shipping method while maintaining the core functionality. By properly implementing the custom module, you can ensure that your specific requirements are met without breaking the checkout process.\n\nOptions A and D are not directly related to the described issue. While database connections and checkout processes can cause problems, they're not the most likely culprits given the specific error message and context provided.\n\nOption C, while related to shipping, is less likely to be the root cause. If it were simply a matter of missing shipping rates, you would typically see a different error message or no available shipping methods, rather than the specific \"Carrier with such method not found\" error."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/07/10", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/373908", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/119333/"], "docs_id": 373908, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a use case where I do internal data computations using English system, due to various precomputed graph coefficients and other data already using the English system.

(Debugging information will be there to stay long\\-term and not just used during development).\n\n**My question is this \\- where within the MVC do I make the value conversions, and why?**\n\nMy current choices to do this conversion are in the Controller or in the View.\n\nIf I do the conversion inside the controller, I will essentially need to maintain two sets of variables (one for computations, one for to pass to View.\n\nIf I do conversion in View, my Controller will be leaner due to only knowing English system, but the View will acquire various conversion coefficients and conversion code and thus become heavier.\n\nThere is perhaps a third option \\- does conversion need to essentially become another layer between Controller and the View? If so where or how do I wire it in?\n\n**More Info on my specific situation**\n\nI have a PHP web application written in Zend Expressive. Controllers there are called `Handlers`.\n\n```\nclass Handler // aka Controller\n{\n    private $renderer; // renders view template\n\n    function handle($request)\n    {\n         $system = $request->getUnitSystem(); //\"English\", \"Metric\"\n         $page = $request->getPage(); //page number\n         $data = $this->repository->getEnglishData(); //PHP array of English-valued data sets\n\n         /* Conversions in Handler */\n         $data[$page]['height'] = $this->valueConverter->feet_to_meters($data[$page]['height']);\n         $data[$page]['height_unit'] = $system->isMetric() ? 'meters' : 'feet';\n\n         $params = array(\n             'paginator' => $this->paginator->getPaginator($data, $page),\n         );\n\n         /* Send to View */\n         return new HtmlResponse($this->renderer->render('show_data.phtml', $params));\n\n     }\n} \n\n```\n\nSo above I have the following players:\n\n* `$system`, which is the value of the unit system (English or Metric)\n* `$valueConverter`, which is a library of value conversion methods\n* `$data`, a PHP array with a set of of English\\-valued data\n\nI use conversion in the Controller to update values to use correct Unit System, and I send those off into the View. View displays them as\\-is. \n\n**Extra Complication when to different systems are to be displayed**\n\nI also have a use case where I need to show debugging information on the screen in English units (show internal computations for debugging purposes) and show \"Real\" information in converted Metric units. So different unit systems may need to be displayed at the same time.

Creating a separate conversion layer allows for clean separation of concerns, keeps the Controller focused on business logic, and doesn't clutter the View with conversion code. It also provides flexibility for handling different unit systems simultaneously.\nC) This approach works but can lead to code duplication and increased complexity in the Controller.\nD) Storing both values in the Model would increase data redundancy and coupling between the Model and presentation concerns.\n\nThe separate conversion layer (option B) provides the best balance of maintainability, flexibility, and adherence to MVC principles, especially when dealing with multiple unit systems simultaneously."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/05/30", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/250184", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/92781/"], "docs_id": 250184, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am planning to install UPVC double\\-glazed windows into a timber structure I'm (re)building.

In Magento, many important tasks, including payment processing and order placement, rely on cron jobs. Setting up and running Magento cron jobs is crucial for the proper functioning of various modules and extensions, including payment gateways like Stripe.\n\nWhile disabling the One Step Checkout extension (option A) might temporarily resolve the issue, it's not addressing the root cause and would remove functionality from the store. Updating the Stripe module (option B) is generally a good practice but unlikely to solve this specific problem if it's related to cron jobs. Switching to a different payment gateway (option D) is an unnecessary and potentially disruptive change that doesn't address the underlying issue.\n\nThe correct approach is to set up and run Magento cron jobs (option C). This can be done by following Magento's official documentation on configuring cron jobs or by manually triggering the cron using the command line: php bin/magento cron:run.

All the changes you define in the array are the actual changes being made to the product attributes. So in this case the product\\-website relation will be adjusted. The 'websites' parameter does not mean the other attributes are only updated for the given websites.\n\nThe only way to adjust data on a specific level can be done by passing in an additional parameter for the storeview. Like below, in this case the '2' as the last parameter stands for the storeview with ID 2\\.\n\n```\n$result = $client->call($session, 'catalog_product.update', array('33', array(\n    'short_description' => 'Product short description 2',\n    'meta_description' => 'Product meta description 2',\n    'price' => '100',\n), '2'));\n\n```\n\nUnfortunately though price is a website level attribute. I hoped that it would automatically echo the defined price attribute value to the website level, but instead the values is updated directly on the global level.\n\nSo in short, it does not look like you can adjust prices on a website level via the API. You will need to create a custom API for it. Either that, or I'm accidentally overlooking something in the Core API documentation.\n<http://www.magentocommerce.com/api/soap/catalog/catalogProduct/catalog_product.update.html>\n\nBy the looks of it there is a different API call for the setting special prices. Not something you asked for, but perhaps you can use it to copy/create your custom API method for setting the regular price.\n<http://www.magentocommerce.com/api/soap/catalog/catalogProduct/catalog_product.setSpecialPrice.html>\n\nDo mind that this API method for specialPrice suffers the exact same issue regarding updating the price to the global level.\n\nHopefully this makes it all a bit more transparant for you. \nUnfortunately you will need to write some custom API code to reach your goal.\nThe following page is a good start for that:\n<http://www.magentocommerce.com/api/soap/create_your_own_api.html>"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is working on a Magento e-commerce platform with multiple websites.

The 'websites' parameter only adjusts the product-website relation, not the price for specific websites. While there is a method for setting special prices (catalog_product.setSpecialPrice), it also updates prices at the global level, not the website level.

Also notice that for $\\\\beta\\_1$ and $\\\\beta\\_2$ hyperparameters the general advice is not to change the defaults, you should do it only when you have a good reason for that."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When using the Adam optimization algorithm for machine learning, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding hyperparameter tuning?\n\nA) The learning rate should always be the first hyperparameter to tune, as it has the most significant impact on model performance.\n\nB) The \u03b21 and \u03b22 parameters should be adjusted frequently to optimize the algorithm's performance for each specific problem.\n\nC) Adam's default hyperparameters are usually sufficient, and tuning is often unnecessary except in specific cases where the learning rate may need adjustment.\n\nD) Adam requires extensive hyperparameter tuning for all its parameters (learning rate, \u03b21, and \u03b22) to achieve good performance on any given task.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation indicates that Adam is an adaptive algorithm that often performs well with its default hyperparameters. While tuning the learning rate may sometimes lead to improvements, it's generally not the first concern. The \u03b21 and \u03b22 parameters should typically be left at their default values unless there's a specific reason to change them. This approach aligns with the adaptive nature of Adam, which is designed to self-tune during training. Options A, B, and D all suggest more aggressive or necessary tuning than is typically required for Adam, making them less accurate statements about the algorithm's hyperparameter tuning needs."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/01/22", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/119956", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/2509/"], "docs_id": 119956, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The moderator view of user profiles includes an \"email\" field with the default text \"`(click to show)`\":\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CPy3J.png)\n\nIn times past, clicking it caused it to reveal the user's email address, but this behavior seems to have changed\\* to taking me directly to the \"contact user\" page.\n\nIf this is intended, the text should be changed.

Folks asking questions for the first time are often unclear on what is allowed or expected; by explaining common misconceptions in a clear manner, you can help these people better understand and learn to become productive members of your community.\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\n### You need to be aware of what's on\\- and off\\-topic for your site\n\nIf you've already had multiple discussions about what should go into your site's [on\\-topic](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic) and [about](https://stackoverflow.com/about) pages, then you probably have a reasonable idea of where the boundaries sit here. If your community has worked to provide a solid set of FAQs on your meta site, then you're in great shape. But if you're still relying on the default \"audience description\" that came from Area51, you might have some work to do...\n\n### You need to know what the most common *misconceptions* are\n\nYou can find a list of recently\\-closed questions in [the 10K tools](https://stackoverflow.com/tools?tab=close). I've found it useful to look at a random sampling of recent questions closed as off\\-topic and too\\-localized. You can do the same using [this query](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/120940)... but be aware that it excludes *deleted* posts, so the results will be somewhat skewed; also, beta sites aren't in SEDE. If you want a list for your site, ping me in chat.\n\n**Don't try to brainstorm on what you *think* should be or might be off\\-topic.** Critically examine what you're seeing in practice instead \\- this should be driven by the community, not by your own personal preferences or prejudices.\n\nDiscuss it with your community\n------------------------------\n\nClosing should be something that has wide\\-spread support on a site. If folks disagree as to what is on\\- or off\\-topic, then that's something that needs to be resolved before going further. In particular, topics that are allowed *with restrictions* need to have those restrictions hashed out and documented, either on your meta or on your [on\\-topic](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic) page.\n\nSo take your ideas for off\\-topic reasons, throw them into a meta post and let folks discuss them.\n\nCreate the wording for each reason as it will appear on the site\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis can be tricky; your goal here is to communicate clearly with the people whose questions are being closed, with the people who are closing questions *and* with the people who will later read those questions and wonder why they were closed.\n\nAt a bare minimum, **off\\-topic reasons should identify a *specific* topic considered inappropriate**. If you're struggling to be specific, find an example of a question that is off\\-topic and discuss the factors that make it inappropriate for the site.\n\nWhenever possible, **try to explain *why* a given topic is not allowed** \\- this is your chance to answer the inevitable question *once* rather than repeating it every time a question must be closed.\n\n**Provide resources that will aid askers in solving their problems**: either instructions for asking the question in a more suitable fashion, links to a different site where the question may be considered on\\-topic.\n\n**Be as concise as possible**. Save *lengthy* explanations and examples for meta FAQs that can be discussed and refined over time, and then include links to these in the off\\-topic reasons. Don't depend on anyone following these links though; keep critical information and guidance in the reason text itself.\n\nDo all of this on your meta site so that folks can critique the wording and suggest improvements.\n\nPick the top three reasons\n--------------------------\n\nLarge lists make selection tedious and difficult. Fortunately, most sites do not attract an extremely high volume of off\\-topic questions, and those that are asked tend to be about a relatively small number of topics \\- therefore, we limit the number of active reasons to 3\\. A few sites do get a regular influx of off\\-topic questions in a larger number of distinct categories; if you find this to be the case on your site, post a feature\\-request on your meta site with examples of questions that would benefit from a predefined off\\-topic option \\- we'll verify the need for this and work with you to make more reasons available.\n\nAdd the reasons, approve them and activate them\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n![The off-topic reason admin page can be accessed from the off-topic close dialog](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zS1ZR.png \"The off-topic reason admin page can be accessed from the off-topic close dialog\")\n\nAny moderator can [add a new off\\-topic reason](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186031/how-do-moderators-update-custom-off-topic-reasons-for-their-site), and an unlimited number of reasons can be added.\n\n![The reason editor](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VX3bM.png)\n\nOnce you've settled on the wording for a reason, a moderator will need to approve it.\n\n![approve link available only to mods other than the author](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SDItY.png)\n\nThe moderator who created a reason cannot approve it himself; we want *at least* two people to be reviewing these before making them available. Approving a reason also activates it, and as noted above, only 3 reasons can be active at any one time on most sites \\- to approve more than this, an existing reason will have to be deactivated first.\n\n![the deactivated reason list](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yJKT3.png)\n\nOff\\-topic reasons can never be completely removed from the system \\- this prevents reasons that have been used on closed questions from disappearing and causing confusion. However, moderators can deactivate reasons at any time, which will prevent them from being used in the future (unless re\\-activated).\n\nYou can also drag active reasons to change the order in which they appear on the close dialog.\n\nMonitor the use of your off\\-topic reasons\n------------------------------------------\n\n**[A tool for monitoring the usage of these reasons](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257449/new-10k-tool-question-close-statistics) is available to moderators and 10K users on every site.**\n\nIt's important to keep an eye on how off\\-topic is being used on a site. If good questions are being closed incorrectly, the predefined reasons may be too vague; if too many bad questions are being left open or closed with \"other\" (custom comments left by the close\\-voter), then you may have picked the wrong reasons. If you see something amiss, don't hesitate to bring it up for discussion on your meta."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a site moderator implementing custom off-topic close reasons, which of the following is NOT a recommended step in the process?\n\nA) Examine recently closed questions to identify common misconceptions\nB) Create a meta post to discuss potential off-topic reasons with the community\nC) Brainstorm hypothetical scenarios that might be off-topic without examining actual closed questions\nD) Draft concise explanations for why certain topics are not allowed on the site\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation explicitly advises against brainstorming hypothetical off-topic scenarios without examining actual closed questions.

By Banach\\-Alaoglu, to show that the closed convex hull of $(y\\_n)$ is weakly compact it is sufficient to verify that $T$ is weak$^\\*$ to weak continuous. But that is the same as saying that $T^\\*$ maps $X^\\*$ into the predual $c\\_0$ of $\\\\ell\\_1$, which in turn is the same as saying that $(y\\_n)$ converges weakly to zero."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Let X be a Banach space and (xn) be a normalized sequence in X that converges weakly to 0.

The closed convex hull of a weakly compact set in a Banach space is weakly compact.

As with that list, there should be some rules.\u00a0\n\n1. **The inequality should not be too well known.** This is to rule out things like Cauchy\\-Schwarz or the Sobolev inequalities. The inequality should be unfamiliar to a majority of mathematicians.\n2. **The\u00a0inequality should represent research level mathematics.** This is taken straight from the other list, and feels like a good rule.\n3. **The inequality should be important.**\u00a0\u00a0Since it is easier to come up with inequalities versus exact formulas, this should be more restrictive than in the other list. The idea is to have inequalities which played an important role in the development of some field.\n4. **An answer can be a class of inequalities.** As noted in the comments, often what is important is a family of inequalities which all convey the same idea but where no single result is *the* fundamental example. This is perfectly acceptable, and perhaps even encouraged since any such examples will likely have lots of applications.\n\nTo give an idea of what I mean, let me give an example which I think satisfies the first three criteria; the Li\\-Yau estimate.\n\nThe Li\\-Yau inequality is the estimate $$ \\\\Delta \\\\ln u \\\\geq \\- \\\\frac{\n n}{ 2t}.$$\n\nHere $u: M \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^\\+ $ is a non\\-negative solution to the heat equation\n$ \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} \\= \\\\Delta u, $ $(M^n,g)$ is a compact Riemannian manifold with non\\-negative Ricci curvature and $\\\\Delta$ is the Laplace\\-Beltrami operator.\n\nThis inequality plays a very important role in geometric analysis. It provides a differential Harnack inequality to solutions to the heat equation, which integrates out to the standard Harnack estimate.\nThere are many results strengthening the original inequality or adapting it to a different setting. There are also results which are not generalizations of the original inequality but which bear its influence.\u00a0For instance, Hamilton proved a tensor version of the Li\\-Yau inequality for a manifold which has non\\-negative sectional curvature and evolves by Ricci flow. Furthermore, one of Perelman's important breakthroughs was to prove a version of the Hamilton\\-Li\\-Yau inequality for a solution to time\\-reversed heat flow when the metric evolves by Ricci flow. These results are not at all corollaries of the original Li\\-Yau estimate, but they are similar in spirit.\u00a0\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The class of [concentration of measure inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_measure) is a fundamental tool in modern probability (and any field that uses probability, e.g., random matrix theory, theoretical computer science, statistics, high\\-dimensional geometry, combinatorics, etc.).

The process can be done through iTunes by connecting the iPhone, right-clicking on the device, selecting \"Restore from backup,\" and choosing the desired backup file.

I took both outlets apart, but couldn't see any wiring anomalies. I also traced the wires pretty thoroughly, but couldn't find anywhere that bare copper could be in contact (obviously I can't see inside the walls). The circuits (seem to) work fine, and it seems like if this were really happening, it would create a short that would trip a breaker. But I repeated the test several times, and the meter kept telling me there was continuity.

It is a matter of easing up the shingles far enough to gain access to the nails, pull them out without ripping the shingle(s) up, it will also require easing up the shingles above the damaged ones and pull THOSE nail out of the way too since they are going through the top of the next course down. Eventually the shingle will practically fall out and you can replace the shingle in reverse order.\n\nIf you are fortunate, the roof has not gotten hot enough to bond the shingles together. On 3 tab shingles the asphalt dabs that come with the shingle to bond the tabs of one row to another are easy to separate. The architectural shingles I replaced my 3 tab shingles with, the asphalt dabs were a different story. The three tab shingles popped up best while the roof was cool, while the architectural shingles needed a heat gun set to get the shingles really hot, but not so hot to melt them (the shingles), but enough to get the bond to release. I hope you do not have to go that route.\n\nI use a ripping bar to ease the shingles up, I have not had any luck with any other style bar, unless I sharpened the edge a bit.\n\n[![ripping bar](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQhuP.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQhuP.gif)\n[![Shingle repair](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MyhaC.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MyhaC.png)\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0uhQy.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0uhQy.jpg)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When replacing damaged shingles on a roof, which of the following techniques is NOT recommended?\n\nA) Using a ripping bar to carefully lift the shingles\nB) Removing nails from the shingles above the damaged ones\nC) Applying heat with a heat gun to release bonded architectural shingles\nD) Prying up shingles forcefully with a flat-head screwdriver\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) Using a ripping bar is recommended as it's specifically mentioned as an effective tool for carefully lifting shingles without causing damage.\nB) Removing nails from the shingles above the damaged ones is necessary to gain proper access and ensure a clean replacement.\nC) Applying heat with a heat gun is suggested for architectural shingles that have bonded strongly, though care must be taken not to overheat.\nD) Prying up shingles forcefully with a flat-head screwdriver is not mentioned and could potentially cause more damage to the surrounding shingles or underlayment.

The third group of handlers only requires 'Read' permission, 'StaticFile' is an example of this. Because it does not execute a process nor does it run a script, it just reads a file from the file system.\n\nYou can check this by open 'Edit Feature Permissions' and uncheck 'Script', most of the mappings are now disabled. Uncheck 'Read' and the last few enabled ones are disabled as well.\n\nTo remove a handler from a site, open the web.config and add something like this:\n\n```\n<system.webServer>\n    <handlers>\n      <remove name=\"PageHandlerFactory-Integrated-4.0\"/>\n    </handlers>\n</system.webServer>  \n\n```\n\nThis will remove the integrate ASP.NET 4 page handler, which means web forms (aspx) will no longer work.\n\nIf you look at the 'Handler Mappings' for the same site in IIS Manager, that mapping still shows up in the enabled section, even though it does no longer work for the site."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In IIS 7, you want to disable specific file extensions like .cshtml and .aspx without completely removing them from the server.

Are there any rules of thumb to guide judgement in this area?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's an excellent answer to this exact question [here](http://www.statisticalhorizons.com/logistic-regression-for-rare-events), based on King \\& Zeng (2001\\) ([pdf](http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/0s.pdf)).\n\nThe gist, from that article:\n\n> The problem is that maximum likelihood estimation of the logistic model is well\\-known to suffer from small\\-sample bias. And the degree of bias is strongly dependent on the number of cases in the less frequent of the two categories. So even with a sample size of 100,000, if there are only 20 events in the sample, you may have substantial bias."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is conducting a study on a rare disease that affects only 0.1% of the population. They have collected data on 100,000 individuals, including various potential risk factors. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of logistic regression for this study?\n\nA) Logistic regression is ideal for this scenario because of the large sample size of 100,000 individuals.\n\nB) The rarity of the disease (0.1%) makes logistic regression unsuitable, regardless of the sample size.\n\nC) Logistic regression can be used, but the results may be biased due to the small number of positive cases, despite the large overall sample size.\n\nD) The researcher should always use logistic regression for binary outcomes, regardless of the event frequency.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, even with a large sample size (100,000 in this case), if there are very few events (positive cases) in the sample, logistic regression can suffer from substantial bias. In this scenario, with a disease prevalence of 0.1%, there would only be about 100 positive cases in a sample of 100,000, which could lead to biased estimates in logistic regression.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only considers the overall sample size and ignores the importance of the number of events. Option B is too extreme, as logistic regression can still be used, but with caution and awareness of potential bias. Option D is incorrect because it overgeneralizes the applicability of logistic regression without considering the specific characteristics of the data, particularly the rarity of events."}, "31": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/08/12", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1357657", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/1390833/"], "docs_id": 1357657, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have text file named (document\\_determinationv1\\.txt).

It will work as long as your file contains exactly one line containing the keyword DATE followed by a colon and the date you want to extract. It will also not check whether DATE appears as a word of its own, whether the part after DATE: is actually a date, or whether it is followed by any additional junk. If your file contains more than one line containing DATE followed by a colon then it will put all of the parts after each DATE: into the variable, separated by newlines, which may or may not wreak havoc with your further processing. So if your file contains, for example:\n\n```\n[DOCUMENT_DETERMINATION]\n#REVISION:v1;DATE:20210805;WEIGHT:123kg\n[REAL_DETERMINATION]\n#PRIME:13;CANDIDATE:BART SIMPSON\n\n```\n\nthen the command will happily put\n\n```\n20210805;WEIGHT:123kg\nBART SIMPSON\n\n```\n\ninto the variable, including the newline between the letters g and B.\n\nBut as long as you can guarantee the file has exactly the format you quoted in your question it will work fine."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You have a text file named document_determinationv1.txt containing the following lines:\n\n```\n[DOCUMENT_DETERMINATION]\n#REVISION:v1;DATE:20210805\n```\n\nYou want to extract the date (20210805) from the second line and store it in a variable using a shell script command.

It uses grep to find the line containing \"DATE:\" and then cut to extract the part after the colon. However, it doesn't handle potential edge cases as well as the correct answer.\n\nB) This command uses awk to split the line on \"DATE:\" and print the second part. While it would work for the given example, it's not as robust as the correct answer for handling variations in the file format.\n\nC) This is the correct answer. The sed command 's/.*DATE://p' efficiently extracts everything after \"DATE:\" in the file. It's more flexible and can handle variations in the file format, such as the date appearing on different lines or multiple occurrences of \"DATE:\".\n\nD) This command assumes the date is always on the last line and is the third colon-separated field.

The documentation explains that on Mac OS, running sh activates POSIX mode, which in turn enables the xpg_echo option. This causes different behavior compared to bash. The recommended solution is to use printf instead of echo, especially when using option flags, as echo implementations can be inconsistent across different systems. While upgrading bash (as mentioned in option D) might be beneficial for other reasons, it doesn't directly address this specific issue. Option A incorrectly attributes the behavior to a bug, and option C provides inaccurate information about sh and bash compatibility."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/12/03", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/194143", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/93773/"], "docs_id": 194143, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: ![Here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FytE3.jpg)Best **WAR** attack strategy is to attack high\\-mid **Townhall 8** opponent whose air defense (**level 6**) is in the middle of the base.\n\n* I cant use 3 lightning spells as the air defense is not close to one another.\n* The base is spread out properly and i want to score 2\\-3 stars on this base\n\nWhat are the good attack strategies here ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a fairly late\\-TH8 base, and judging by your comments you're still early\\-to\\-mid TH8\\. It would have been extremely difficult to get 2 or 3 stars here. In past wars, I've found it likely to get:\n\n* 2\\-3 stars on a base weaker than mine (ie, less than my TH level)\n* 1\\-2 stars on similar level bases (ie, same TH level, less upgraded)\n* 1 star (if that) on higher level bases (ie, same TH level but more upgraded, or higher TH level)\n\nConsider this when planning your attacks \\- if you're trying to earn stars most efficiently, attack slightly below you on their list (ie, if you're \\#6 on your side, look at \\#6 through \\#10 on their side or so)\n\nFor this base, I'd probably be tempted to go ground instead of air. The air defenses are pretty well upgraded (wizard towers and AD's, primarily) while ground defenses are kind of weaker (archer towers, cannons, although mortars are fully upgraded). \n\nI'd probably try to run Giants on this, backed up by archers or wizards. I'd probably go with healing spells or a mix of heal and rage, although if you know the CC troops are strong ground units, you might take lightning. You can put some healers in your camps if you want, but with all that AD chances are good they're going to get shot down quickly. Wall breakers aren't as critical here, since there's not a lot of layers of wall to be dealt with. \n\nI'd start by drawing the clan castle out. The upper right area seems like it should be possible to get close enough to draw it with a barbarian. Checking the radius in the preview is a good way to get a closer look. If you can't get close enough with a barb, a giant would work although it's kind of a waste. \n\nIf the CC troops are to be lightning'ed, draw them over the lower right mortar and try to take them out and the mortar out in the same go. Otherwise, draw them into a corner and drop archers or wizards to obliterate them. \n\nThe right side and/or lower right side seem like good spots to attack from \\- the weakest wizard tower is here, and the goal is really to get 2 stars if possible, so we want to \"wedge\" into the base to hit the town hall. \n\nI'd drop one giant to check for traps, and then drop the rest en masse. Let them take out a swath of defenses, and then drop roughly half the ranged units in behind. With luck, they'll spread out and strip a big hunk of the base.\n\nAs the troops spread out and the closest building to the edge of the base starts to look like the town hall, drop 1\\-2 ranged units until their target is the TH, and then drop the rest. \n\nThat's about the best strategy I can come up with, given your resources and level."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: As an early-to-mid Town Hall 8 player attacking a late Town Hall 8 base in Clash of Clans, which of the following strategies is most likely to yield 2-3 stars?\n\nA) Using 3 lightning spells to take out the air defenses and then deploying dragons\nB) Attacking with a full air army, focusing on destroying the wizard towers first\nC) Using a ground attack with giants as tanks, backed up by archers or wizards, and using healing spells\nD) Deploying a mix of air and ground troops to confuse the opponent's defenses\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation suggests that for an early-to-mid TH8 player attacking a late TH8 base, a ground attack would be more effective than an air attack. This is because the air defenses are well upgraded, while some ground defenses are weaker. The strategy recommends using giants as tanks, supported by archers or wizards, and utilizing healing spells. This approach aims to \"wedge\" into the base to reach the town hall and potentially achieve 2 stars. Options A and B are incorrect because they focus on air attacks, which would be less effective against the upgraded air defenses.

If so, which one would be recommended?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Electrical characteristics\n--------------------------\n\nYou must consider the maximum characteristics. This includes the maximum DC forward current the display can handle. Maximum reverse voltage should also be noted down as well. 60mA max for 7 segments and 30mA max for the DP.\n\nBy the looks of it, you should be running the 7 segments at 20mA and the DP LED at 10mA to be safe.\n\nForward voltage should also be taken into consideration. You should be powering this display from a 12 volt supply since the forward voltage **CAN BE** (Vf is not consistent as it varies at different currents, make show you don't blow up the LED by overestimating the forward voltage!!! Read below to see what I mean by overestimating since in the formula of determining the series resistor, the Vf deducts the supply voltage.) a whopping 7\\.8V (DP is 3\\.9V) where it can increase all the way to 10V (DP is 5V).\n\nNow lastly, it's using those values. You need these values in order to know what resistor to use. However it's not that simple. The forward voltage changes at different forward currents. Check the [datasheet](http://www.produktinfo.conrad.com/datenblaetter/1000000-1099999/001050584-da-01-en-LED_ANZEIGE_7_SEG__ROT_SC40_19SURKWA.pdf) and look at the graph that shows the relation between them.\n\nNow calculate on [here](http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/led-resistor-calculator) and you get your resistor value.\n\nWould an Arduino Leonardo suffice?\n----------------------------------\n\nCurrently with your method, it will *just* work since the Leonardo has 20 pins capable of outputting IO and you would omit pin 13 which is already connected to an LED and 1 and 2 since they're connected to Tx and Rx. However you can shave some pins down. Since you're going to be lighting the LED's one by one at a fast rate to give the illusion that they're all on at once, you can shave the 9 pins for each segment display into 4, saving 5 pins. This means you'll have more space for other stuff. You don't have to do this though otherwise you would need a BCD (or 4bit binary) to decade decoder IC.\n\nNeed any driver IC's?\n---------------------\n\nYes and no. Since your arduino runs at 5V and you would be driving the LED display at a much higher voltage, you would need to drive them. You could use a whole lot of PNP transistors and resistors in series with each base in addition to the resistors in series with the LEDs to drive them, or supplement the individual transistors together with a PNP transistor array IC which makes things a lil bit more organised.\n\nAnd if you're shaving these 9 pins into 4, you would need a BCD to decimal decoder as you're driving with binary this way."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When building a 9-digit 7-segment LED display using an Arduino Leonardo and 4-inch 7-segment LED displays, which of the following statements is correct regarding the electrical characteristics and setup?\n\nA) The maximum DC forward current for the 7-segment LEDs is 60mA, and 30mA for the decimal point LED. It's recommended to run them at these maximum values for optimal brightness.\n\nB) The forward voltage of the LEDs is constant regardless of the forward current, so using the maximum forward voltage value from the datasheet is always safe when calculating the necessary resistor values.\n\nC) To reduce the number of required I/O pins, you can use multiplexing techniques to control the 9 digits with just 4 pins, but this would require the use of a BCD to decimal decoder IC.\n\nD) The Arduino Leonardo's 5V output is sufficient to directly drive the LED display without any additional components, as long as appropriate current-limiting resistors are used.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because while the maximum currents are stated correctly, it's recommended to run the LEDs at lower currents (20mA for 7-segments, 10mA for DP) for safety.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the forward voltage varies with forward current, and overestimating it can lead to damaging the LEDs.\n\nOption C is correct. Multiplexing can reduce the required pins from 9 to 4 for digit selection, but this would necessitate a BCD to decimal decoder IC to interpret the 4-bit binary input.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the LED display requires a higher voltage (12V recommended) than the Arduino's 5V output.

The molecules of water / air should apply the force of equal magnitude on the ball as the ball applies to the water molecules. Can anyone please explain this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The third law of motion:\n\n> [When one body exerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion) a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.\n\n**Edit after revisit:**\n\n> The molecules of water / air should apply the force of equal magnitude on the ball as the ball applies to the water molecules.\n\nThe basic misunderstanding here is in the notion of force. Acceleration for impacts will define the force, and it is best to think of the **[dp/dt definition of force.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force)** An incoming ball does not have 10 Newton's force , it has a constant velocity, so no force . **Force is generated on impact by dp/dt.** \nImpacts with solids distribute momentum and energy on the whole solid due to the cohesiveness of the electromagnetic interactions, and the total momentum energy balance can be calculated with the impact point , and dp/dt calculated to give the force of impact.\n\nImpact on air is coming in tiny scatters and tiny dp/dt. Impact on water is similar if the ball has enough energy, molecules bounce left and right with a small dp/dt slowly dissipating the energy and dispersing the momentum.\n\n**end edit** \n\nYou ask :\n\n> Then why does'nt it bounce back when it hits a water surface ?\n\nBouncing back depends on elasticity of surfaces deformations and dissipative motions of the surfaces which absorb the energy and momentum of impact , and have to be estimated for each individual case.\n\nHave you estimated the force that the steel ball exerts on the water molecules? dp/dt will transfer momentum to all the column of water it penetrates and dissipate the energy until it hits the bottom. At the surface little except ripples because the liquid is displace\\-able with little energy/momentum needs . [Look at the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF8aQHwcKN0) for a drop falling, which has the same density as the water and small energy/momentum to transfer to see how the third law is obeyed by dissipating the impulse and still a small drop bounces back.\n\nAir is a non thinker: individual molecules have very small mass with respect to the ball and pick up the tiniest fraction from the impact diminishing the motion of the ball very slightly at best. \n\nOne has to do the calculations to see that the third law is OK ? It is called a law because innumerable people have done the calculations and found that the law is validly describing data."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A steel ball is dropped onto different surfaces: a solid iron plate, a water surface, and through air.

However, the way force and momentum are distributed and dissipated in different materials leads to different observable outcomes. In solids, the force is distributed quickly through the entire body due to strong intermolecular forces, often resulting in a visible bounce. In liquids like water, the force is dissipated by displacing the fluid and creating ripples, with energy being absorbed more gradually. In gases like air, the force is distributed among countless low-mass molecules, resulting in minimal visible effect on the ball's motion. The key is understanding that force in impacts is related to the rate of change of momentum (dp/dt), which varies significantly between these different mediums."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/23", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106335", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/37762/"], "docs_id": 106335, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I upgraded to OS X 10\\.9 yesterday, and since then, one Google Chrome Helper is constantly red in Activity Monitor.

You'll have to wrap it into your own function to which you can add a stricter type definition, since the definition given by lodash itself is too permissive.\n\n[The type definition for that method can be found here](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/lodash/common/object.d.ts#L2532), and as you can see, the return type for each overload is just the intersection type of its arguments, where it sounds like you want the return type to be just exactly the type of the first argument.\n\nSo I would recommend wrapping the method into your own function with the signature you want. Something like this maybe:\n\n```\n// Using only the final overload (the variadic one), since thats how we call it later.\ndeclare function lodashMerge(object: any, ...otherArgs: any[]): any;\n\ntype DeepPartial<T> = {\n    [K in keyof T]?: DeepPartial<T[K]>;\n}\n\nfunction myMerge<T>(base: T, ...args: DeepPartial<T>[]): T {\n    return lodashMerge(base, ...args);\n};\n\n```\n\nThen, using that, you'll get an error on your second example, but not on the first. *Although actually, you get an error on both since you misspelled \"dimensions\"* ;)\n\n```\n// No problem, works as expected.\nconst child : Human = myMerge(base,{\n  age:22,\n  dimensions:{ // Note the change in spelling, otherwise: error.\n     height:99\n  }\n})\n\n// Error: See below\nconst child2 : Human = myMerge(base,{\n  hairColor:'red' // Error: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'hairColor' does not exist in type 'DeepPartial<Human>'.\n})\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are developing a TypeScript application that uses lodash's merge function.

It uses a DeepPartial type to allow partial updates of nested objects while maintaining type safety. The function signature ensures that the base object is of type T, and additional arguments are DeepPartial<T>, allowing for flexible but type-safe merging.\n\nC) This option doesn't use lodash's merge function and doesn't provide deep merging capabilities.

The variable is then used in a script. The Feature class has 200,000 rows and the script takes a very long time to complete. Is there a way to do this quicker?

The thing that is likely being very slow is the `arcpy.CalculateField_management()` function. You should use a cursor, it will by several magnitudes faster. Also, you said you are using ArcGIS Desktop 10\\.3\\.1, but you're using the old ArcGIS 10\\.0 style cursors, which are also much slower.\n\nThe min() operation even on a a list of 200K will be pretty quick. You can verify this by running this small snippet; it happens in the blink of an eye:\n\n```\n>>> min(range(200000)) # will return 0, but is still checking a list of 200,000 values very quickly\n\n```\n\nSee if this is any faster:\n\n```\nimport arcpy\nfc = arcpy.env.workspace = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(0)\nXfield = \"XKoordInt\"\nwith arcpy.da.SearchCursor(fc, [Xfield]) as rows:\n    ListVal = [r[0] for r in rows]\n\nvalue = min(ListVal) - 20\nprint value\n\n# now update\nwith arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(fc, [Xfield, 'Matrix_Z']) as rows:\n    for r in rows:\n        if r[0] is not None:\n            r[1] = (r[0] - value) / 20.0\n            rows.updateRow(r)\n\n```\n\nEDIT:\n\nI ran some timing tests and as I suspected, the field calculator took almost twice as long as the new style cursor. Interestingly, the old style cursor was \\~3x slower than the field calculator.

It contains $xy$ so $D(I)\\=2$. But I claim $y^{k\\+1} \\\\in I^k$, so $D(I^k) \\= k\\+1$.\n\nBy the binomial theorem\n\n$$ y^{k\\+1} \\= (y\\-x^k \\+ x^k)^{k\\+1} \\= \\\\sum\\_{i\\=0}^{k\\+1} \\\\begin{pmatrix} k\\+1 \\\\\\\\ i \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\left(y\\-x^k\\\\right)^i x^{k (k\\+1\\-i) } $$\n\nIn the exponent:\n\n$$k(k\\+1\\-i) \\=k^2 \\+k \\- ik \\= (k\\+1\\)(k\\-i) \\+ i$$\n\nso this is \n\n$$(y\\-x^k)^{k\\+1} \\+ \\\\sum\\_{i\\=0}^{k} \\\\begin{pmatrix} k\\+1 \\\\\\\\ i \\\\end{pmatrix} x^i\\\\left(y\\-x^k\\\\right)^i \\\\left(x^{k\\+1}\\\\right)^{k\\-i} \\\\in I^k$$\n\n(Boris pointed out a flaw in my earlier argument, leading me to find this counterexample.)\n\nIn general, subadditivity shows $\\\\lim\\_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{D(I^n)}{n}$ exists, and that any fixed value of $\\\\frac{D(I^n)}{n}$ is at least this limit. So one version of this question is about how to compare $D(I)$ to this limit. Here we show the limit can go arbitrarily close to $1$ with $D(I)\\=2$. By adding random linear factors, the limit can get arbitrarily close to $D(I)\\-1$. But probably for larger $D(I)$ the limit can be less than $D(I)$ by even more than $1$.\n\n---\n\nSome lower bounds:\n\nIn the case where $I$ is radical, if $D(I) \\\\geq 2$, then $D(I^n) \\\\geq (3/2\\)n$ (and in fact $\\\\lceil (3/2\\) n \\\\rceil$ is achieved.) $V(I)$ must not be contained in any line, so it must contain $3$ noncolinear points, and we can assume that $I$ is the ideal of $3$ noncolinear points. Then $I^n$ is the ideal of functions vanishing of order $n$ at those $3$ points. This contains a function of degree $(3/2\\)n$, which is the product of powers of the lines through the points.\n\nThis is optimal, because given a polynomial $f$, which is the first line raised to the power $a$ times a polynomial of degree $d\u2212a$, the polynomial of degree $d\u2212a$ must intersect the two points on the first line with multiplicity $n\u2212a$, so $d\u2212a \\\\geq 2(n\u2212a)$ and if $d\\\\leq (3/2\\)n$, $a \\\\geq n/2$. Then the same is true for the multiplicity of the other $3$ lines, hence $d\\\\geq 3n/2$.\n\n---\n\nHere's another interesting phenomenon. Take $I$ to be the ideal of $k (k\\+1\\) /2$ generic points. Then $D(I)\\= k$ by dimension counting. $I^n$ is the ideal of functions vanishing of order $n$ at $k(k\\+1\\)/2$ distinct points, which is an ideal of codimension $n (n\\+1\\)/2 \\\\cdot k (k\\+1\\)/2$. This is less than $d (d\\+1\\)/2$ for $d$ approximately equal to $nk / \\\\sqrt{2}$. So there is a degree $d$ polynomial in $I^n$, and $D(I^n)$ is asymptotically at most $nk/\\\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n---\n\nI can show that if $D(I) \\\\geq 2$, then $\\\\lim\\_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} D(I^n)/ n\\> 1$. Take $I$ maximal with respect to the property $D(I) \\\\geq 2$. Then each local factor of $I$ at a point of $V(I)$ either contains two linear functions, or is maximal with respect to the property of containing one linear function, and hence looks like $(y, x^2\\)$, or is maximal with respect to the property of containing no linear functions, and hence looks.\n\nWhat do the last kind of ideals look like? There must be some length $1$ extension, which must contain some linear function $y$, and so it is of the form $(x^k,y)$ for some $n$. Length one extensions of that have the form $(x^{k\\+1}, xy, y^2, ax^k\\+ by)$ and we must have $a \\\\neq 0$. If $b \\=0$, the ideal contains is contained in $(x^2, xy, y^2\\)$, which is one example of a maximal ideal with this property. Otherwise by scaling $y$, we may put it in the form of my example.\n\nCase 1: $I\\= (x^2, xy, y^2\\)$. An element in $I^n$ vanishes to order $2n$ on $I$, hence has degree at least $2n$.\n\nCase 2: $I \\= (y\\-x^k, x^{k\\+1})$. An element in $I^n$ intersects $y\\-x^k$ with multiplicity $n (k\\+1\\)$, hence has degree at least $n (k\\+1\\)/k$. Having $(y\\-x^k)$ divide the element doesn't help because it has degree $k$ but only removes $k\\+1$ of the intersection.\n\nCase 3: $I$ contained in $(y, x^2\\)$. Then $I$ must also vanish somewhere else on the line $y\\=0$. If the degree is at most $(3/2\\)n$ the intersection multiplicity with the line $x\\=0$ is at least $2n$ so by the same logic as in the reduced case the polynomial contains a factor of $x^{n/2}$. The remainder of the polynomial must vanish to order $n$ at the other point on the line $y\\=0$ hence have degree at least $n$, so the minimum is $(3/2\\)n$.\n\nCase 4: $I$ is contained in none of these and is maximal, hence reducd.
