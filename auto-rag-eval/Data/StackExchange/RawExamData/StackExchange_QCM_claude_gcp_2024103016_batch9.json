But the GPIO12 (which I am trying to read as LOW right after ESP wakes up) does not hold on to the LOW value long enough for me to read it right after wake up.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One hardware solution is to use [SR Latch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#Simple_set-reset_latches). From description it look like the NAND one (/S, /R) would be suitable in this situation. You should be able to find a chip with such latch or build one from gates using for example 74HC00 (4 nand gates out of which 2 would be used). However one extra pin to reset the SR latch after power up caused by the external button is needed.\n\nConnection could be as follows:\n\n* /S \\- connected to wake up button connected also to ESP8266\\. Assumed the ESP8266 wake up (/RESET) is active low, momentary switch pulls to GND, and this line is normally pulled up (like in the falstad schematic from question).\n* /R \\- connected to some output of the ESP8266 (GPIO) \\- you would need pull up on this pin too, so it is defined when ESP8266 is in power down\n* Q (SR output) \\- connected to some input of the ESP8266 (GPIO)\n\nOperation would be as follows:\n\n1. Pressing the momentary switch (shorting to GND) \\- would change state of the SR output to 1\\.\n2. After boot up is finished software would read state of the Q \\- if it is \"1\" this is power up due to switch/if 0 this is power up due to timer.\n3. Before going to sleep again, you would arm the SR latch for next power up by applying short pulse to GND on /R pin so Q would be 0\\.\n\nOne drawback of this solution is that after first applying power to the system (3\\.3V ramp up) SR latch state is unknown (either 0 or 1\\). This means that you might misread first power up reason but later on would be OK.\n\n*Standard disclaimer \\- solution provided w/o any simulation or prototyping \\- you should think it through, check if works at all and if is suitable for your application.*"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An ESP8266 module needs to differentiate between wake-ups caused by a timer and those caused by a button press.

An SR latch circuit using NAND gates provides a hardware-based solution to differentiate between wake-up sources.

We just have to put huge amount of water and heat then engine will work for days.\n\nBut in my books, all engines are based on cyclic process. Why?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> We can make a steam engine just by putting huge amount of water in large tank and heat it and then use the steam to run the wheel. We just have to put huge amount of water and heat then engine will work for days. But in my books, all engines are based on cyclic process. Why?\n\nThis is essentially a question of definition. You can indeed extract work from a non\\-cyclical thermodynamic process, but such processes are not considered to be heat engines. Heat engines are defined by returning to the initial state with the exception of a transfer of heat from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir. If a device truly does not have a cycle then it is not a heat engine by definition.\n\nSo the real question is not whether all heat engines are based on a cycle, they are by definition. The real question is whether or not your example qualifies as a heat engine.\n\nYour example is a standard steam turbine which is based on the Rankine cycle: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankine_cycle>\n\n![Rankine cycle from Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Rankine_cycle_layout.png/640px-Rankine_cycle_layout.png)\n\nAt some point you will need to refill the water. So the complete cycle includes condensing the water from steam back to a liquid. It doesn\u2019t matter if that condensation is done in a closed chamber or in the open atmosphere. Either way the condensation and refilling is considered part of the cycle. So your device does have a cycle (the Rankine cycle) and is indeed a heat engine (a steam turbine).\n\nRegarding efficiency: if you replenish the water then you have a legitimate heat engine with a cycle and the efficiency is less than the Carnot efficiency. If you do not replenish the water then you do not have a heat engine at all and the concept of efficiency doesn\u2019t make sense."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A student proposes a \"new\" type of steam engine that operates by heating a large tank of water to produce steam, which then drives a turbine.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this proposal?\n\nA) The student is correct; this is a novel non-cyclic heat engine that could potentially exceed Carnot efficiency.\n\nB) The proposal is flawed because all steam engines must have a closed-loop water system to function.\n\nC) This is actually a standard steam turbine based on the Rankine cycle, with atmospheric condensation completing the cycle.\n\nD) The proposal describes a thermodynamic process for extracting work, but it cannot be classified as a heat engine.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The student's proposal actually describes a standard steam turbine operating on the Rankine cycle. Even though the water isn't recondensed within a closed system, the condensation occurring in the atmosphere and subsequent refilling of the tank complete the thermodynamic cycle. This makes it a legitimate heat engine. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it's not a novel non-cyclic engine and cannot exceed Carnot efficiency. \nOption B is wrong as steam engines don't necessarily need a closed-loop system; atmospheric condensation can complete the cycle. \nOption D is incorrect because the proposal does describe a heat engine, specifically a steam turbine based on the Rankine cycle."}, "15": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/06/23", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/24770", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/8008/"], "docs_id": 24770, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: i would like to know how to get the frond end properties in magento because in the resource model that i got these properties are not available, i dont know why or how to get them, this is the collection that i got:\n\n```\n        $collection = Mage::getResourceModel('eav/entity_attribute_collection');\n\n```\n\nbut if i try to get any front end property doesnot give anything:\n\n```\n  foreach($collection as $attribute){         \n        Mage::log($attribute->getIsSearchable(),null,\"layerfilter.log\");\n   }\n\n```\n\nOutput: \n 2014\\-06\\-23T21:44:48\\+00:00 DEBUG (7\\): \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume, this is what you need:\n\n```\n$attribute_code = \"name\"; \n$attribute_details =\nMage::getSingleton(\"eav/config\")->getAttribute('catalog_product',    $attribute_code);\n$attribute = $attribute_details->getData();\nprint_r($attribute);\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided Magento documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Magento, you want to retrieve the frontend properties of product attributes, including whether they are searchable.

In this case it shouldn't make much of a difference, but when you're developing you should always think about keeping your code as maintainable as possible.\n* If every developer drops in random debug files all over the solution then you're going to end up with a mess when it comes to pulling this information all together. Better to have a standard process everyone follows.\n* Writing unit tests (as you mentioned in testing in your question) will be very difficult. This code won't be in the builds coming from your build server (which is the most valuable place to run unit tests) so unless you're going to do conditional compilation unit tests... yuck, I'm stopping that idea right there!\n* If this information is useful to you in development it could well be valuable to someone diagnosing issues in production. Why deprive them of data which would make their lives easier?\n\nMy suggestion would be do do something like this:\n\n```\npublic void SendFiles()\n{\n   var files = _sendDirectory.ListFiles();\n   foreach(var file in files)\n   {\n      try\n      {\n        _logging.Info($\"Sending {file} from {_sendDirectory} to remote server\"};\n        SendFile(file);\n      }\n      catch(Exception ex)\n      {\n        _logging.Error(ex, $\"There was an error sending {file} from {_sendDirectory} to remote server\"};\n      }\n   }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis not only removes the conditional compilation but provides more information which could be used to diagnose potential issues in production.

Client computers (like Bob's) come pre-installed with a set of trusted root CA certificates. When connecting to a website, the client receives the website's certificate along with any intermediate certificates in the chain of trust. The client then verifies this chain, ultimately tracing back to one of the trusted root CA certificates on the system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because storing every CA certificate locally would be impractical and unnecessary. \n\nOption B is incorrect because there isn't a single \"master\" CA certificate that can decrypt all website certificates. Each website has its own unique certificate.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the verification process is automated and involves cryptographic checks, not manual comparison.\n\nThe misconception in the original question stems from a misunderstanding of how the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and certificate chain of trust work in practice.

A magnet generates field lines that look like the following:\n\n[![picture of a magnet](https://i.stack.imgur.com/46Gdk.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/46Gdk.png)\n\nThe field lines from the magnet extend throughout all space, which is how we are able to detect them on the surface of the earth.

Near a current-carrying wire, the magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the wire. The compass needle will orient itself tangent to these circular field lines, which means it will be parallel to the wire. The needle doesn't require distinct north and south poles to align itself; it simply follows the direction of the local magnetic field, which in this case is created by the current in the wire.

I am guessing that this ensures that one of the 110/120 volt connections is active at any one time, but wouldn't this make the wiring 2\\-phase?\n\nJust to verify, the rest of the setup below:\n\nWiring diagram:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pOlsG.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pOlsG.png)\n\nThe 18BX2203 has a 3 HP 220 volt 1 phase Leeson motor. I have residential 2 phase wiring and was confused if I needed to some each 120 from the same phase or from different phases.\n\nThe manual recommended that I connect the bandsaw to a 15 amp breaker but I wanted to provide myself some additional margin for a future tool but was also aware that tools use more power on startup. I initially was going to use 12/2 wire, but I decided on schedule 40 conduit with Thermoplastic High Heat\\-resistant Nylon\\-coated THHN wire.\n\nAnother question I had was the number of wires connecting to the outlet. I initially thought I would need to have 4 wires (a 12/3 wire), both a neutral and a ground in addition to two hot wires. After thinking about it a little bit, it made sense two use three wires total, since I was setting up a dedicated circuit and the ground and the neutral would be the same wire\n\nReceptacle\n==========\n\nThe bandsaw came pre\\-wired with a 220V 3\\-pin plug. I used this page to make sure I used the correct outlet. One of the decisions I had to make was if I wanted to use a twist lock plug, but I didn't consider the benefit worth the extra work to re\\-wire the saw.\n\nI decided on 20 Amp Commercial Grade Double\\-Pole Single Outlet, White which has two connections for hot and one ground wire.\n\nBreaker\n=======\n\nI think the 20 Amp Double\\-Pole Type QP Circuit Breaker will work if I connect the red and black to each of the 20 amps (but does this make it 40 amps)?\n\n[![breaker](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0kMYh.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0kMYh.png)\n\nWire\n\nIn setting up a 20\\-amp circuit, I had to make sure this worked with my setup.

The center tap is called neutral. This is called \"Split\\-phase\" since you can grab the outer \"phase\" wires (hot\\-hot) or grab one phase and neutral for half the voltage.\n\nIf you're wondering, this was Edison's idea when power was DC.\n\nThe plug you need on the saw is a NEMA 6\\-15\\.

Further, a 20A circuit is allowed to have 15A sockets on it (as long as there are 2 or more sockets, e.g. the above NEMA 6\\-15 will suffice).\n\n* If you cable this with /3 cable, simply cap off the neutral.\n* If you cable it with /2 cable, you MUST use tape etc. to re\\-mark the white wire to indicate that it is a hot.\n* If you use individual THHN wires, you MUST use a hot color (black brown red orange yellow pink blue purple) for the 2nd hot. Both hots CAN be the same color, in fact, I recommend it. There's no useful purpose in distinguishing them *from each other*, but with up to 4 circuits allowed in conduit, you want to distinguish them from other circuits.\n\nFor instance suppose you have a 120V and two 240V circuits in a conduit.

Curran valued the fervour of bishops and the gusto of bookmakers in political leadership, traits he found lacking in the professors who were then leading British Socialism."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/08/21", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/282704", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/102420/"], "docs_id": 282704, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When solving the riddle at Monoliths you can learn Atlas words.

In locking home users out of some settings like this Microsoft are making some attempt to prevent the horrors of the XP era of unpatched systems where people have turned off updates because they don't understand why they need them and the implications of not getting them.\n\nOn to the guts of your question.

For historical reasons just about every domestic installation in the UK uses the same European standard voltage of 230V for every socket. In turn, almost all sockets used indoors are the same size and shape and deliver the same maximum current. (Some farms have three\\-phase 415V supply, but I don't think that's often run to the house itself...!) \n\nJust in itself that introduces a whole level of complexity as the higher voltage is much keener on using a human being to find its way to earth. \n\nSecondly, current. UK domestic power sockets are all rated at 13A, whereas in the US there's typically different sockets for different kinds of jobs. However, these sockets are joined in a \"ring main\" which is typically rated at 32A in total for all the sockets on the ring: so in theory connecting live and neutral on a ring main can deliver 230V \\* 32A \\= 7\\.3kW. \n\nMakes for a nice bang. So it's wise to be careful.\n\nPower in the UK is distributed from the supply company's meter to a \"consumer unit\" (these days, RCDs and circuit breakers) from whence the ring mains for sockets, lights and heavy equipment are powered. Like sockets, breakers are double\\-pole. The power company generally only provides a single\\-phase supply from their meter, it's an offence to tinker with anything upstream of that.\n\nEarth is typically a earth rod (TT), separate earth from the supplier (TN\\-S) or combined and separate from the supplier (TNC\\-S) combined with separate connections to the water main (if it's metal) and the gas main. \n\nMost houses have two ring mains, typically upstairs and downstairs, and for convenience most have an upstairs and a downstairs lighting radial circuit. Electric cookers typically and water heaters (immersion heaters) typically get their own circuits rated at 32/40 amp and 20 amp respectively Lighting, the ring mains, and high\\-current circuits use different sizes of cable and m.c.b's (miniature circuit breaker).\n\nThe UK has been described as one of the most heavily fused countries on earth. As the ring main can in theory deliver 32A to the socket, each appliance has its own fuse built into the plug. That, along with the higher voltage and current, is one reason why the UK has such big plugs. These fuses are (these days) clipped into their own holder which can be (reasonably) easily extracted without taking the plug apart; they come in 3A, 5A and 13A sizes.\n\nThere's more, much more: bathrooms and other wet areas have their own special restrictions known as a special location, there's regulations about how wires can be joined together, how many sockets can be on a ring, the distance between sockets, the number of spurs permitted, and so on and so on. A three year apprenticeship is a good start, as is careful digestion of the Wiring Regulations BS 7671\n\nWhat can be done by a DIYer? Notionally buildings regulations have always required a \"Competent Person\" to do any electrical work. Since the introduction of Part P of building regulations a recognised contractor needs to inspect major work or work in bathrooms and kitchens."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK electrical system, which of the following statements is NOT true regarding domestic power sockets and their associated circuitry?\n\nA) UK domestic power sockets are all rated at 13A and are typically connected in a ring main.\nB) The ring main is usually rated at 32A in total for all the sockets on the ring.\nC) Each appliance has its own fuse built into the plug, which comes in 3A, 5A, and 13A sizes.\nD) The maximum power that can be safely drawn from a single socket is 7.3kW.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA, B, and C are all correct statements about the UK electrical system. However, D is incorrect. While it's true that the ring main can theoretically deliver 7.3kW (230V * 32A), this is the total capacity for the entire ring, not for a single socket. Each socket is limited to 13A, which at 230V would be approximately 3kW. The 7.3kW figure represents the theoretical maximum for the entire ring main, not what can be safely drawn from a single socket. This question tests understanding of the relationship between the ring main's total capacity and individual socket limitations in the UK electrical system."}, "48": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/08/05", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1163669", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/393882/"], "docs_id": 1163669, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there any GUI network/bandwidth analyser which gives network consumptions per process and an overall sum over a large period of time? \n\nI use `nethogs` which is great but it's for command line.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Nutty](https://babluboy.github.io/nutty/) is one such graphical network information and monitoring tool that works on Ubuntu. \n\nNutty is available as a PPA for Ubuntu (16\\.04 upwards) and other Ubuntu based systems.

Furthermore it's important that the sorting is correct, so that the nologin line is at the end. Do you have any idea how to achieve this in a flexible manner?\n\nThanks and regards \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Puppet will edit `/etc/passwd` on its own accord, when you add `user` resources to your manifest, such as\n\n```\nuser {\n    'admin1':\n        ensure => present,\n        uid => 1003,\n        password => '$6$...',\n}\n\n```\n\nOrdering of existing lines will be tricky at best. Puppet natively does not support anything like that. My advice would be to use an `exec` resource like this:\n\n```\nexec {\n    '/path/to/script-that-moves-nologin-line-to-the-end':\n        unless => '/script/that/returns-true-if-nologins-line-is-currently-at-the-end'\n}\n\n```\n\nYou would want Puppet to perform that after syncing all user resources to your system.

Using 'user' resources allows Puppet to manage user accounts natively, which is more idiomatic and maintainable than directly editing /etc/passwd. The 'exec' resource with a custom script provides the flexibility to ensure the nologin line is always at the end of the file, addressing the ordering requirement.\n\nOption A is less flexible and more error-prone, as it requires manual specification of entries for each machine. Option B, while possible, introduces unnecessary complexity by creating a custom function. Option D using augeas could work but is more complex than necessary for this task and may not easily handle the dynamic nature of user entries across different machines.\n\nThe correct approach (C) allows for easy management of both static admin users and dynamic regular users, while also ensuring the correct ordering of entries in /etc/passwd."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/02/05", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/195458", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/76315/"], "docs_id": 195458, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> Walt thought I was crazy.

The sentences above are an excerpt from the book *Jack: Straight from the Gut* by Jack Welch. I have looked up the meaning of \"business\" in several dictionaries. It seems that \"business\" is a countable noun **only** when it means \"company\".\n[Longman Dictionary](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/business)\n\nBut from the excerpt, \"**businesses**\" here doesn't mean \"companies\", which makes me really confused.

It is talking about his chemical and metallurgical division which is one of GE\u2019s biggest and most profitable companies. \n\nIn simple terms the paragraph is saying that this person in 20 months, went from a small medical development **company**to a manager of the chemical and metallurgical division, which is one of the GE\u2019s biggest and profitable **companies**"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of business terminology, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of \"business\" as a countable noun?\n\nA) \"Business\" is always a countable noun when referring to any commercial activity.\nB) \"Business\" is only countable when referring to a company, but can be used in plural form to describe different divisions within a single corporation.\nC) \"Business\" is never countable and should always be used in its singular form.\nD) \"Business\" is only countable when referring to completely separate legal entities, not divisions or units within a larger company.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. While \"business\" is typically only countable when referring to a distinct company, the passage demonstrates a nuanced usage where \"businesses\" in plural form is used to describe different divisions within a single corporation (GE in this case). This usage, though less common, shows that \"business\" can be countable not only for separate companies but also for distinct operational units within a large corporation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because \"business\" is not always countable when referring to commercial activity in general. \nOption C is incorrect as the passage clearly shows \"business\" used in both singular and plural forms. \nOption D is too restrictive, as the passage shows \"businesses\" used for divisions within GE, not just separate legal entities.\n\nThis question tests understanding of nuanced language use in business contexts and the ability to interpret specialized terminology beyond standard dictionary definitions."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/03/06", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/199221", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/19838/"], "docs_id": 199221, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The concepts of being non\\-periodic and aperiodic for tilings have obvious versions for connected graphs with a countable set of vertices and a finite number of edges meeting at each vertex. A graph $G$ of this class is non\\-periodic when its group of graph isomorphisms is trivial (this is the group of isometries if the graph is considered as a metric space in the usual way). $G$ is aperiodic if its hull consists of non\\-periodic graphs. Here, the hull of $G$ consists of all graphs of this class that can be expressed as an increasing union of balls with the same center and increasing radius, each of them isometric to some ball in $G$ (using the metric structure). The same definitions have direct versions for graphs with decorations, where a decoration of $G$ is a map assigning a natural number to each vertex of $G$, and the isometries are required to preserve the decorations. Finally, $G$ is said to be of bounded geometry when there is a uniform upper bound on the number of edges that meet at every vertex. Now, the question is the following: If $G$ is of bounded geometry, is there a decoration $\\\\alpha$ of $G$ with finite image such that $(G,\\\\alpha)$ is aperiodic?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \\[Sorry, can't post this as a comment, not enough rep].\n\nDo you want to answer this claim for every graph $G$? That seems like it could be tricky.\n\nIt is easy to consider some simple cases in isolation, though. For $\\\\mathbb{Z}$ one may construct decorations for which the hull will contain all periodic, all non\\-periodic as well as a mix of periodic and non\\-periodic. Clearly for a periodic decoration every decorated graph in the hull will also be periodic. For an example of all non\\-periodic, one could label the vertices using two colours so that the result is a Fibonacci tiling of the line (an example of a Sturmian sequence). All decorated graphs in the hull will correspond to Fibonacci tilings, so will be aperiodic. For a mixture of periodic and non\\-periodic, just label the central vertex with a different colour to the rest.\n\nSimilar examples will work for $\\\\mathbb{Z}^d$ for any $d \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$. You could consider more interesting graphs for which the result is aperiodic without any decoration. For example, consider the graph of a Penrose kite and dart tiling and then \"split up\" the edges depending on their \"types\" in the tiling (e.g., as a meeting of kites, darts or of a kite and a dart) \\[edit: one would need to add further decorations if the original tiling had 5\\-fold symmetry].

In the above cases, the codes are the **same**.I don\u2019t know how to find the problem, can anyone help me?\n\n```\nclass DstarLite {\npublic:\n  DstarLite() = delete;\n  DstarLite(GridStatus* a, GridStatus* b, FILE* fp)\n      : k_m_(0), start_(a), last_(start_), goal_(b), open_close_(fp) {}\n  void calculateKey(GridStatus* s);\n  void updateVertex(GridStatus* u);\n  void initialize();\n  void computeShortestPath();\n  void rePlanning(vector<pair<GridStatus*, int>>& node_change);\n  GridStatus* getStart();\n  void setStart(GridStatus* val);\n  GridStatus* getGoal();\n\nprivate:\n  Fib frontier_;  \n  double k_m_;\n  unordered_map<GridStatus*, handle_t>\n      heap_map_;  \n  GridStatus* start_;\n  GridStatus* last_;  \n  GridStatus* goal_;\n  FILE* open_close_;\n};\n\nvoid DstarLite::calculateKey(GridStatus* s) {\n  s->f = min(s->g, s->rhs) + heuristic(start_, s) + k_m_;\n  s->k2 = min(s->g, s->rhs);\n}\n\nvoid DstarLite::initialize() {\n  fprintf(open_close_, \"%d %d\\n\", start_->x, start_->y);\n  fprintf(open_close_, \"%d %d\\n\", goal_->x, goal_->y);\n  goal_->rhs = 0;\n  calculateKey(goal_);\n  handle_t hand = frontier_.push(goal_);\n  heap_map_[goal_] = hand;\n}\n\nvoid DstarLite::updateVertex(GridStatus* u) {\n  bool heap_in = heap_map_.find(u) != heap_map_.end();\n  if (u->g != u->rhs && heap_in) {\n    calculateKey(u);\n    frontier_.update(heap_map_[u]);\n  } else if (u->g != u->rhs && !heap_in) {\n    calculateKey(u);\n    handle_t hand = frontier_.push(u);\n    heap_map_[u] = hand;\n  } else if (u->g == u->rhs && heap_in) {\n    calculateKey(u);\n    frontier_.erase(heap_map_[u]);\n    heap_map_.erase(u);\n  }\n}\n\nvoid DstarLite::computeShortestPath() {\n  int count = 0;\n  while (smaller(frontier_.top(), start_) || !myEqual(start_->rhs, start_->g)) {\n    count++;\n    auto u = frontier_.top();\n    pair<double, double> k_old = {u->f, u->k2};\n    pair<double, double> k_new;\n    k_new.first = min(u->g, u->rhs) + heuristic(start_, u) + k_m_;\n    k_new.second = min(u->g, u->rhs);\n    if (k_old < k_new) {\n      calculateKey(u);\n      frontier_.update(heap_map_[u]);\n    } else if (myGreater(u->g, u->rhs)) {\n      u->g = u->rhs;\n      frontier_.pop();\n      heap_map_.erase(u);\n      for (auto s : neighbors(u)) {\n        if (s->rhs > u->g + cost(u, s)) {\n          s->next = u;\n          s->rhs = u->g + cost(u, s);\n          updateVertex(s);\n        }\n      }\n    } else {\n      double g_old = u->g;\n      u->g = kDoubleInfinity;\n      auto neighbor = neighbors(u);\n      neighbor.push_back(u);\n      for (auto s : neighbor) {\n        if (myEqual(s->rhs, cost(s, u) + g_old)) {\n          if (!equal(s, goal_)) {\n            double pp_s = kDoubleInfinity;\n            for (auto succ : neighbors(s)) {\n              double dis = succ->g + cost(succ, s);\n              if (dis < pp_s) {\n                pp_s = dis;\n                s->next = succ;\n              }\n            }\n            s->rhs = pp_s;\n          }\n        }\n        updateVertex(s);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  cout << \"Dstar visited nodes : \" << count << endl;\n}\n\nvoid DstarLite::rePlanning(vector<pair<GridStatus*, int>>& node_change) {\n  k_m_ += heuristic(last_, start_);\n  last_ = start_;\n\n  for (auto change : node_change) {\n    GridStatus* u = change.first;\n    int old_threat = u->threat;\n    int new_threat = change.second;\n\n    double c_old;\n    double c_new;\n\n    u->threat = new_threat;\n    u->rhs += (new_threat - old_threat) * threat_factor;\n    updateVertex(u);\n\n    for (auto v : neighbors(u)) {\n      u->threat = old_threat;\n      c_old = cost(v, u);\n      u->threat = new_threat;\n      c_new = cost(v, u);\n      if (c_old > c_new) {\n\n        if (v != goal_) {\n          if (v->rhs > u->g + c_new) {\n            v->next = u;\n            v->rhs = u->g + c_new;\n          }\n        }\n      } else if (myEqual(v->rhs, c_old + u->g)) {\n        if (v != goal_) {\n          double pp_s = kDoubleInfinity;\n          for (auto pre : neighbors(v)) {\n            double dis = pre->g + cost(pre, v);\n            if (dis < pp_s) {\n              pp_s = dis;\n              v->next = pre;\n            }\n          }\n          v->rhs = pp_s;\n        }\n      }\n      updateVertex(v);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nGridStatus* DstarLite::getStart() { return start_; }\n\nvoid DstarLite::setStart(GridStatus* val) { start_ = val; }\n\nGridStatus* DstarLite::getGoal() { return goal_; }\n\n```\n\n```\n  DstarLite dstar(start, goal, open_close);\n  dstar.initialize();\n  dstar.computeShortestPath();\n\n```\n\nSorry, I think it is difficult to locate the problem in the code, so the code was not shown before.

It uses LEFT OUTER JOINs to include all pipes, even those without survey data. The GROUP BY clause is necessary to group the results by pipe (ID_PROD and IDENTIFIANT), and the MAX function correctly selects the most recent survey date for each group.

Below is a simplified example that hopefully makes it clear what the shared style should look like. \n\nBe careful with style IDs, since the ones put out by many KML exporters can often be confusing. Also note that the hover style will only work on desktop/web, as there's no \"hover\" event on mobile touchscreens. \n\n```\n<StyleMap id=\"my_stylemap\">\n  <Pair><key>normal</key><styleUrl>#my_style_normal</styleUrl></Pair>\n  <Pair><key>highlight</key><styleUrl>#my_style_highlight</styleUrl></Pair>\n</StyleMap>\n\n<Style id=\"my_style_normal\">\n  <IconStyle>\n    <Icon><href>http://example.com/icons/my_icon.png</href></Icon>\n    <scale>1.1</scale>\n  </IconStyle>\n  <LabelStyle>\n    <scale>0</scale>\n  </LabelStyle>\n</Style>\n\n<Style id=\"my_style_highlight\">\n  <IconStyle>\n    <Icon><href>http://example.com/icons/my_icon.png</href></Icon>\n    <scale>1.3</scale>\n  </IconStyle>\n  <LabelStyle>\n    <scale>1</scale>\n  </LabelStyle>\n</Style>\n\n```\n\nThe important parts are making sure that the style IDs and references in the StyleMap are correct, that the normal style has LabelStyle \\> scale \\= 0, and the highlight style has LabelStyle \\> scale \\= 1 or higher."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Google Earth KML, which combination of elements and attributes is necessary to create a hover effect where placemark labels appear only when the mouse is over the icon?\n\nA) A single <Style> element with <LabelStyle><scale>0</scale></LabelStyle> for the normal state and <LabelStyle><scale>1</scale></LabelStyle> for the hover state.\n\nB) A <StyleMap> with two <Pair> elements, one for \"normal\" and one for \"highlight\", each referencing separate <Style> elements with different <LabelStyle><scale> values.\n\nC) Two <IconStyle> elements within a single <Style>, one with <scale>1.1</scale> for normal state and another with <scale>1.3</scale> for hover state.\n\nD) A <StyleMap> with a single <Pair> element referencing a <Style> that toggles between <LabelStyle><scale>0</scale> and <LabelStyle><scale>1</scale> on hover.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach to create a hover effect for placemark labels in Google Earth KML is to use a <StyleMap> with two <Pair> elements. One Pair is for the \"normal\" state and another for the \"highlight\" (hover) state. Each Pair references separate <Style> elements. The normal style should have <LabelStyle><scale>0</scale></LabelStyle> to hide the label, while the highlight style should have <LabelStyle><scale>1</scale></LabelStyle> or higher to show the label on hover.
