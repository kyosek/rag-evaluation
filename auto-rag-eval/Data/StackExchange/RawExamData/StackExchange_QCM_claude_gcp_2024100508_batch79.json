In Swift iOS programming I could create a pList (flat\\-file) or store settings in the NSUserDefaults. I'm just wondering what my options are in ASP.NET MVC. \n\nI originally wanted to ask \"What's the best way to implement admin/owner settings?\" but I didn't want my question closed as being subjective. I am, however, hoping to deduce what the preferred method is ultimately to adhere to best practices.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My experience is that the \"settings\" supported by C\\# out of the box are not very useful.\n\nStoring the settings in the database is a much better idea for a number of reasons.\n\n1. It will be possible to take a complete backup of the blog by backing up the database without having to remember what other files you need.\n2. If you one day decide to take this system of yours, which currently implements a single blog for a single user, and turn it into a blogging platform supporting many blogs operated by multiple users, you will just create multiple settings records, one for each user, and at least that part will be taken care of. With a settings file, such a thing would be impossible, you would certainly have to rewrite your settings mechanism to make use of the database at that point.\n3. Your settings may need to refer to rows in the database, in which case it only makes sense to also store the settings in the database in order to enjoy the benefits of referential integrity checking. For example, you may wish to add a setting for a \"sticky post\" which is to always be displayed first, regardless of how old it is. If you go with a settings file, then the \"sticky post id\" setting will be just a meaningless number, interpreted by your code to (hopefully) correspond to a blog post. If you store your settings in the database, then the RDBMS will ensure that this number will in fact be the actual id of an existing row in the blog posts table. (Or NULL, if you don't want a sticky post.)\n\nNeed I go on?\n\nThe way this is usually accomplished is by having a settings table with a single row in it. This is not just a wild idea that you had, it is a legitimate technique which has actual application in the real world.\n\nThere is no way to guarantee that additional rows will never be accidentally added to the settings table, but at least you can count the rows during startup and display an error message if more than one row is found.\n\nYou can easily guarantee that there will always be only one instance of the settings object by adding a `private static bool` member to it, and `Assert`ing from the constructor of the object that this `bool` is `false`, then setting it to `true`. This means that the constructor may only be invoked once."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is creating a blog system and wants to implement customizable settings for the admin.

So if `T` implements a `delete` function, `S` should implement it too and should perform a delete when called. However, `S` is free to add additional functionality over and above what `T` provides. Consumers of a `T`, when given an `S` would be unaware of this extra functionality, but it's allowed to exist for consumers of `S` directly to utilise.\n\nA highly contrived of examples of how the principle can be violated might be:\n\n```\nclass T\n{\n    bool delete(Item x)\n    {\n        if (item exists)\n        {\n            delete it\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\nclass S extends T\n{\n    bool delete(Item x)\n    {\n        if (item doesn't exist)\n        {\n            add it\n            return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n**Slightly more complex answer: no, as long as you don't start affecting the state or other expected behaviour of the base type.** \n\nFor example, the following would be a violation:\n\n```\nclass Point2D\n{\n    private readonly double _x;\n    private readonly double _y;\n\n    public virtual double X => _x;\n    public virtual double Y => _y;\n\n    public Point2D(double x, double y) => (_x, _y) = (x, y);\n}\n\nclass MyPoint2D : Point2D\n{\n    private double _x;\n    private double _y;\n\n    public override double X => _x;\n    public override double Y => _y;\n\n    public MyPoint2D(double x, double y) : \n        base(x, y) => (_x, _y) = (x, y);\n\n    public void Update(double x, double y) => (_x, _y) = (x, y);\n}\n\n```\n\nThe type, `Point2D`, is immutable; its state cannot be changed.

Just whether or not they were there (technically speaking, a 0 does not guarantee they weren't there, just that they weren't detected there. For simplicity, I think it might be best to not worry about this at this point).\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is use this information with community detection algorithms to see if I can identify how cities are clustered together without using any kind of geographic data. If you think about it, at the highest level, you might expect some kind of regional clustering of cities at the scale of a state or country. Then if there is some kind of regional clustering, then within each of those regions, the next level might be clusters of major urban areas made up of lots of cities. And of course, there might be solitary rural cities. My expectation is that people are more likely to visit areas that are more convenient to travel to, whether it's for work, recreation, shopping, etc, and that this can be used to identify community structure.\n\nI look at this data and can see it being visualized as a graph in several different ways. It could easily be viewed as a hypergraph, or as a multigraph, or as a bipartite graph. For some of the stuff I've tried, I'm collapsing it into a complete weighted graph. What I've tried so far is creating a pairwise adjacency matrix of the cities with a single similarity or distance metric for each pair of cities (in my case, I've been using the Jaccard index). I have then been using this adjacency matrix with community detection algorithms in iGraph that try to maximize modularity. To a degree, this works. I can see the regional clustering that makes sense based on geographic features. However, trying to perform the same process within these regions does not seem to work as well. I also notice that individuals that occur at more cities tend to make things worse, and the community detection process works better when they are removed. However, from a randomized sampling standpoint, arbitrarily removing these people is terrible. I'm also not sure if these community detection algorithms are really intended to be used with complete graphs. On top of that, I don't understand modularity well enough yet to know if its limitations are coming into play.\n\nAnother interesting approach I've seen but haven't tried is using a simulated annealing algorithm with the data in a bipartite graph to maximize modularity.\n\nI guess my question is, what approaches would you recommend for community detection with this type of data, and where there is the potential for hierarchical structure?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The H\\-Volume is the volume contained by the rectangle $\\[x\\_1,x\\_2] \\\\times \\[y\\_1,y\\_2]$ of a 3\\-dimensional function $H(x,y)$. To visualize this, see the Figure [![H-Volume of the $\\Pi$ copula](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZcl3.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZcl3.png)\n\nwhich is the contour plot of the independence copula (which is simply a 3\\-dimensional function with some special properties that make it a copula function).\n\nThe H\\-Volume is the volume contained within the box labeled $R3$. However, remember that the Copula function is defined as the H\\-Volume of the copula function $H$ from $\\[0,u] \\\\times \\[0,v]$. Thus, $H(x\\_2,y\\_2\\)$ in reference to the figure would be the volume contained by $R1\\+R2\\+R3\\+R4$. To get the region of interest, which is just $\\[x\\_1,x\\_2] \\\\times \\[y\\_1,y\\_2]$, we must subtract out $R2$ and $R4$. However, by subtracting out $R2$ and $R4$, we have also subtracted out $R1$ twice. We thus add $R1$ back into the equation (recall that $R1$ is included when computing $H(x\\_2,y\\_2\\)$. \n\nTo think about it in 3\\-D terms, see the Figure [![H-Volume of the $\\Pi$ copula 3-D Visualization](https://i.stack.imgur.com/69bQf.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/69bQf.png).

I then push the resulting Frankensteinian database to production. This is as error prone as you can imagine. \n\nThere *has* to be a better way to do this. \n\n### Other Paths\n\nI've toyed with the idea of a shared database, but that isn't ideal, as unapproved changes to products and pages would reflect on the production site.\n\nI've also toyed with the idea of piping the database dumps into Git, but that still requires me to know which tables to keep from each respective database.\n\n*Update*\n\nNow that I think about it, would the better path here be to have a second \"staging\" store on the production environment rather than a separate development server?

When designing your models, the focus is on capturing the business logic and meanings within the problem domain. This should be captured in a way which makes sense to the business, including more than just entities and data fields. Some data elements are interpreted from others, some are contingent upon others, etc. Additionally you'd add to this model any basic logic you need, such as how an object internally responds when a certain element is set to a certain value.\n\nIt's entirely likely that you'll end up with something that's 90\\+% identical to how you end up persisting the data. That's fine. It can be completely identical without being coupled.\n\nNote also that modeling the domain in a fog of true persistence ignorance is a bit of a holy grail for software design. If you can do it, fantastic. But if the problem domain is at all significant and has any complexity to it then it's still a good idea to step back from the domain modeling from time to time in order to do a sanity check on data persistence to make sure you haven't painted yourself into a corner.\n\nJust remember the actual roles of the various components and keep those roles separated when you design them. For any given design decision, ask yourself if any of those roles are violated:\n\n1. Database \\- Store the data, maintain the integrity of the data, maintain the data at rest.\n2. Models \\- Contain the business logic, model the problem domain, maintain the data in motion, respond to business\\-level events, etc.\n3. Views \\- Present data to users, perform user\\-side logic (basic validation before true validation is performed in the models, etc.).\n4.

This aligns with the principle of separation of concerns and allows for looser coupling between the models and the database.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it leads to database-driven design, which can result in tighter coupling.\n\nOption B is also incorrect as it creates a direct dependency between the models and the database structure, reducing flexibility and potentially violating the separation of concerns.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it violates the principle of separation of concerns by combining distinct roles (models and database connectors) into a single component.\n\nThe correct approach (C) allows for models to be designed independently of the database, focusing on business logic and domain concepts.

The first is that it requires all four kinds of character, not three out of four.

You need to escape the hyphen, preferably by moving it to the end.\n3. The `.*` at the beginning does nothing but make the regex less efficient, and one at the end should be `\\S*`, to exclude whitespace.

In this case, the word \"tell\" is used in two different senses:\n\n1. In the first part, \"You can always tell a Harvard man,\" the word \"tell\" means to identify or recognize.\n2. In the second part, \"but you can't tell him much,\" the word \"tell\" means to inform or give information to.\n\nThis clever use of polysemy creates a play on words that forms the basis of the joke, highlighting the stereotype of Harvard graduates as being easily identifiable but also arrogant and unwilling to listen to others.\n\nOption A (Alliteration) is incorrect as there's no repetition of initial consonant sounds.\nOption B (Onomatopoeia) is incorrect as there are no words that phonetically imitate sounds.\nOption D (Synecdoche) is incorrect as there's no use of a part to represent a whole or vice versa."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/10/25", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/477733", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/317626/"], "docs_id": 477733, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I already have *Windows 8\\.1* installed and going to install *Gentoo* on the same drive. Also thinking of using rEFInd.\n\nSo do I really have to disable Fast Boot?\n\nIf it isn't necessary, what limitations do I get \u2014 what instructions do I have to follow to keep this dual\\-boot working?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Disabling the BIOS\\-level **Fast Boot** feature is only necessary to get enough time to access BIOS/UEFI boot menus, as @kemotep mentioned in question comments. \n\nIf you're using rEFInd as your boot menu, that is not typically required, as rEFInd has an adjustable timeout and it can also provide you a boot menu option for accessing the firmware settings (aka \"BIOS settings\").\n\nOn the other hand, the Windows\\-level **Fast Startup** feature will typically prevent you from mounting the Windows partitions in Linux, since it acts basically the same as hibernating the Windows OS: Linux sees that Windows has not cleanly unmounted the Windows partitions and so some cached data might held in the hibernation data, waiting to be written to its final place in the Windows filesystem. (In Fast Startup such cached data is likely to be minimal or non\\-existent, but Linux cannot know that for sure, and so refuses to automatically mount any Windows partitions that have not been cleanly unmounted.)\n\nIf you don't need to mount Windows filesystems in Linux (and vice versa), you can keep Fast Startup enabled. Of course that will make it more difficult to exchange files between the operating systems.\n\n[Here's how to disable Fast Startup, with pictures.](https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-disable-or-enable-fast-startup-in-windows-8-1/) Basically go to Control Panel \\-\\> All Control Panel Items \\-\\> Power Options \\-\\> System Settings, and under the title \"Shutdown settings\", uncheck the item \"Turn on fast startup (recommended)\" and click on \"Save changes\" at the bottom of the window.\n\nWhen starting the installer for Gentoo, make sure you start it in the UEFI mode. Dual\\-boot between two operating systems with the same boot style is usually manageable without too much effort; trying to deal with one OS using UEFI and another using legacy BIOS mode is extra tricky and might not be achievable at all, depending on firmware\\-level limitations."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When setting up a dual-boot system with Windows 8.1 and Gentoo Linux using rEFInd, which of the following statements is correct regarding Fast Boot and Fast Startup?\n\nA) Both BIOS-level Fast Boot and Windows-level Fast Startup must be disabled for the dual-boot to function properly.\n\nB) BIOS-level Fast Boot can be kept enabled when using rEFInd, but Windows-level Fast Startup should be disabled to allow mounting of Windows partitions in Linux.\n\nC) Both BIOS-level Fast Boot and Windows-level Fast Startup can be kept enabled without any limitations when using rEFInd.\n\nD) BIOS-level Fast Boot must be disabled, but Windows-level Fast Startup can be kept enabled without any issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that BIOS-level Fast Boot is not typically required to be disabled when using rEFInd, as rEFInd provides an adjustable timeout and options for accessing firmware settings. However, Windows-level Fast Startup should be disabled if you want to mount Windows partitions in Linux, as it prevents Linux from cleanly mounting these partitions. Keeping Fast Startup enabled will make it more difficult to exchange files between the operating systems.

But for almost none of them, I was able to find any specification regarding the input impedance. I suspect there is something to know about that: is there any standard input impedance for audio amplifiers? at least sufficiently probable for taking the risk to buy such an item?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a sortof standard for a certain class of professional audio gear. This standard is 600 \u03a9. All \"line level\" audio in such a setup is expected to drive 600 \u03a9. This is also the impedance of the microphones.\n\nHowever, many many amps don't follow this. In fact, most amps try to be \"high\", which means to not appreciably load the output stage of whatever they think is producing the signal. Of course everyone's idea of \"high\" is different. The most common is probably around 10 k\u03a9.\n\nThat's what I've done with audio gear aimed at consumers. Anything that produces a consumer audio signal won't be damaged, loaded to the point of distortion, or even appreciably attenuated by 10 k\u03a9. Otherwise, you want the input impedance to be as low as possible avoid picking up stray noise when nothing is connected."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An audio engineer is designing a consumer-grade amplifier and needs to determine the appropriate input impedance.

It's high enough to not load most audio sources appreciably, yet low enough to avoid excessive noise pickup. This value strikes a balance between performance and practicality in consumer audio applications."}}
