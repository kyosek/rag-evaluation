Some days are lighter than others, but on the 1st, 671 IPs were blocked trying to access SMTP (669\\) and cPanel (2\\).\n\nTo try and get this under better control, I thought about only allowing web access to everyone, and blocking specific large blocks from accessing FTP or SMTP.

This requirement makes it difficult to work with allocators that itself contain state, rather than indirectly point to state.\n\n**Note:** The reason this may have worked for `vector` is because an allocator of type `T` doesn't get rebound on a `vector<T>`, since it only needs to allocate `n` instances of `T`. This is not true for more complex data structures like a `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`, etc \\-\\- since there may be nodes of objects or other contiguous sequences internally used.\n\n---\n\n\\[1] Stateful allocators are stored directly into the containers that use them. This means that a `vector<T,MonotonicIncreasingAllocator<T,N>>` will now also store the allocator itself, containing an `array<T,N>`, directly inside of the `vector` class, in addition to its own data \\-\\- which is wasteful. Copying or even moving a container with this allocator would be an extremely expensive operation.\n\nAdditionally, by storing the data directly inside of the allocator, conversion\\-construction requires a copy of the entire internal `std::array` object, which means that the rebinding constructs a *new* object that refers to a different monotonic structure than the allocator that was being rebound \\-\\- which isn't ideal.\n\nYou should look into the architecture that's used in [`std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/polymorphic_allocator) for better inspiration. The `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator` holds onto 1 data type: a `std::memory_resource` pointer, which makes rebinding cheap, and storage of this allocator cheap. The `memory_resource` is type\\-ambiguous and passed by indirection, which allows for allocators after being rebound to use and refer to the same memory pool."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When implementing a custom allocator for use with STL containers like std::unordered_map, which of the following is a crucial requirement that must be met?\n\nA) The allocator must have a fixed size array to store elements.\nB) The allocator must throw an exception when deallocate() is called.\nC) The allocator must be rebindable to different types and provide a conversion constructor.\nD) The allocator must store its data directly inside the container for efficiency.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As explained in the documentation, an allocator must be rebindable to different types, which is crucial for complex containers like std::unordered_map. This requires implementing a rebind template and providing a conversion constructor that can construct the allocator from a different type U. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a fixed size array is not a requirement and can actually lead to inefficiencies.\nOption B is not a requirement for allocators and would likely cause issues in many scenarios.\nOption D is incorrect and actually highlighted as a problem in the documentation, as it can lead to inefficient and expensive operations when copying or moving containers.\n\nThe key insight from the documentation is that allocators need to work with different internal types used by containers, not just the main value type.

Thus the expected price will be\n\n$C\\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{n}{2^n}\\=2C$\n\nSimilarly, the strategy \"buy D and attempt a transformation to B until you get B\" will have expected price\n\n$B\\_D\\+D\\\\sum\\_{n\\=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{n3^{n\\-1}}{4^n}\\=4D$\n\nIt's no coincidence that the expected price is just the cost divided by the probability of success; this follows from the properties of the [binomial distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution).\n\nYou'll want to compare these two and see which is minimal and run with that strategy."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company produces Product A using Product B.

The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.\n* If your question contains a link, please use the syntax of `[text](link)`, as that will make it easier for transcribing for the finished questionnaire.\n* This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at current.\n* At the start of the nomination phase, the Community Team will select **up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community** provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election. That said, if I have concerns about any questions in this fashion, I will be sure to point this out in comments before the decision making time.\n* Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, typically containing 10 questions in total.\n* This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates.

That is, I'd like to `debootstrap` it myself or adjust the `lxc-ubuntu` template (commonly under `/usr/share/lxc/templates`) in order for this to work.\n\nHere's why I am asking this question. If you look at the `lxc-ubuntu` template, you'll notice:\n\n```bash\n# Detect use under userns (unsupported)\nfor arg in \"$@\"; do\n    [ \"$arg\" = \"--\" ] && break\n    if [ \"$arg\" = \"--mapped-uid\" -o \"$arg\" = \"--mapped-gid\" ]; then\n        echo \"This template can't be used for unprivileged containers.\" 1>&2\n        echo \"You may want to try the \\\"download\\\" template instead.\" 1>&2\n        exit 1\n    fi\ndone\n\n```\n\nFollowing the use of `LXC_MAPPED_GID` and `LXC_MAPPED_UID` in the referenced `lxc-download` template, though, there seems to be nothing particularly special. In fact all it does is to adjust the file ownership (`chgrp` \\+ `chown`). But it's possible that the extended attributes in the `download` template are fine\\-tuned already to accomplish whatever \"magic\" is needed.\n\nIn the comments to [this blog post by St\u00e9phane Graber](https://www.stgraber.org/2014/01/17/lxc-1-0-unprivileged-containers/) St\u00e9phane tells a commenter that\n\n> There\u2019s no easy way to do that unfortunately, you\u2019d need to update\n>  your container config to match that from an unprivileged container,\n>  move the container\u2019s directory over to the unprivileged user you want\n>  it to run as, then use Serge\u2019s uidshift program to change the\n>  ownership of all files.\n\n... and to:\n\n* have a look at <https://jenkins.linuxcontainers.org/> for the packages built for the `download` template\n* check out `uidmapshift` from [here](https://launchpad.net/~serge-hallyn/+archive/nsexec)\n\t+ This program appears to roughly do `lxc-usernsexec -m b:0:1000:1 -m b:1:190000:1 -- /bin/chown 1:1 $file` as explained in [`lxc-usernsexec(1)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lxc-usernsexec.1.html)\n\nBut there are no further pointers.\n\n**So my question is: how can I take an ordinary (privileged) LXC container that I have built myself (having `root` and all) and migrate it to become an unprivileged container?** Even if you can't provide a script or so, it would be great to know which points to consider and how they affect the ability to run the unprivileged LXC container. I can come up with a script on my own and pledge to post it as an answer to this question if a solution can be found :)\n\n*Note:* Although I am using Ubuntu 14\\.04, this is a *generic* question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I was just doing something very similar, moving KVM VMs into unprivileged LXC.\n\nI was using system containers for this (so they can be started automatically on boot), but with mapped UID/GIDs (user namespaces).\n\n1. edit /etc/subuid,subgid (I mapped uid/gids 10M\\-100M to root and use 100K per container)\n2. for first container, use u/gids 10000000\\-10099999 in /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/config\n3. mount the container storage on /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/rootfs (or do nothing if you don't use separate volume/dataset/whatever per container)\n4. chown 10000000:10000000 /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/rootfs\n5. setfacl \\-m u:10000000:x /var/lib/lxc (or simply chmod o\\+x /var/lib/lxc)\n6. lxc\\-usernsexec \\-m b:0:10000000:100000 \\-\\- /bin/bash\n\nNow you're in the first container user namespace. Everything is the same, but your process thinks it's uid is 0, when in fact in the host namespace it's uid 10000000\\. Check /proc/self/uid\\_map to see whether your uid is mapped or not. You will notice you can no longer read from /root and it seems to be owned by nobody/nogroup.\n\nWhile in the user namespace, I rsync from the original host.\n\nOutside the user namespace, you will see that the files in /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/rootfs are now owned not by the expected (same) uids as the origin installation, but rather 10000000\\+remote\\_uid. This is what you want.\n\nThat's it. When you have your data sync'ed, remove everything from container's /etc/fstab so it won't try to mount things, and it should start. There might be other things to change, check what the LXC template for the containerised distro does. You can definitely remove the kernel, grub, ntp and any hardware\\-probing packages in the container (you don't even have to run it, you can chroot to the container from the user namespace)\n\nIf you don't have a running remote VM, you can also mount the original VM storage in the host namespace and rsync/SSH back in to localhost. The effect will be the same.\n\nIf you (as it seems) simply want to change your privileged container to unprivileged, you might as well just add the uid/gid mapping, add a mapping as above to your container config and then do something along the lines of:\n\n```\nfor i in `seq 0 65535`; do\n  find /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/rootfs -uid $i -exec chown $((10000000+i)) \\{\\} \\;\n  find /var/lib/lxc/CTNAME/rootfs -gid $i -exec chgrp $((10000000+i)) \\{\\} \\;\ndone\n\n```\n\nThat should be all that needs doing, now you should be able to run the container unprivileged. This example above is extremely inefficient, uidshift will probably do a better job at this (but I haven't used it yet).\n\nHTH."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When migrating a privileged LXC container to an unprivileged one, which of the following steps is NOT typically required?\n\nA) Editing /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid files to map UID/GID ranges\nB) Modifying the container's configuration file to include UID/GID mappings\nC) Changing ownership of the container's root filesystem\nD) Reinstalling all packages within the container\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA, B, and C are all necessary steps when migrating a privileged LXC container to an unprivileged one. Editing /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid is required to define UID/GID mappings for the host system. The container's configuration file needs to be updated to include these mappings. Changing ownership of the container's root filesystem is also crucial to align with the new UID/GID mappings.\n\nOption D, reinstalling all packages within the container, is not typically required. While some adjustments may be needed (such as removing hardware-specific packages), a complete reinstallation is unnecessary. The existing packages can usually be retained, with their ownership adjusted to match the new UID/GID mappings.\n\nThe correct process involves remapping file ownerships, adjusting configurations, and ensuring proper permissions, rather than reinstalling the entire container's contents."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/12/14", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/350821", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/86563/"], "docs_id": 350821, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to get fetch Region Name instead of its value, from select option,\nbut I get the only region value not its name,\n\nI have created a select option in the system.xml\n\nbelow is my code,\n\n**System.xml**\n\n```\n<field id=\"gstregion\" translate=\"label\" type=\"select\" sortOrder=\"6\" showInDefault=\"1\" showInWebsite=\"1\" showInStore=\"1\">\n                <label>Production State</label>\n                <comment><![CDATA[Select the Origin State.]]></comment>                 \n                <source_model>Test\\Code\\Model\\Config\\Region\\RegionInformationProvider</source_model>\n                <depends>\n                    <field id=\"GSTtax/GSTtax/status\">1</field>\n                </depends>\n            </field>\n\n```\n\n**app/code/Test/Code/Model/Config/Region**\n\n```\n<?php\nnamespace Test\\Code\\Model\\Config\\Region;\n\nclass RegionInformationProvider\n{\n  protected $countryInformationAcquirer;\n  protected $addressRepository;\n\n  public function __construct(\n      \\Magento\\Directory\\Api\\CountryInformationAcquirerInterface $countryInformationAcquirer\n  ) {\n         $this->countryInformationAcquirer = $countryInformationAcquirer;\n  }\n\n  public function toOptionArray()\n  {\n        $countries = $this->countryInformationAcquirer->getCountriesInfo();\n        foreach ($countries as $country) {\n            if($country->getId() == 'IN'){\n                $regions = [];\n                if ($availableRegions = $country->getAvailableRegions()) {\n                     foreach ($availableRegions as $region) {\n                          $regions[] = [\n                             'value' => $region->getId(),\n                             'label' => $region->getName()\n                           ];\n                     }\n                 }\n            }  \n        }\n        return $regions;\n\n     }\n}\n\n```\n\n**Data.php**\n\n```\nconst CONFIG_GST_REGION           = 'GSTtax/GSTtax/gstregion';\n\npublic function getGstRegion()\n    {\n        $storeScope = \\Magento\\Store\\Model\\ScopeInterface::SCOPE_STORE;\n        return $this->scopeConfig->getValue(self::CONFIG_GST_REGION, $storeScope);\n    }\n\n```\n\n**test.phtml**\n\n```\n$state = $this->helper('Test\\Code\\Helper\\Data')->getGstRegion();    \necho $state;\n\n```\n\n**`<option value=\"580\" id=\"optIdqnoKrZDb\" selected=\"selected\">Gujarat</option>`**\n\n**Output \\=\\> 580**\n\n**not Gujarat**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: change this line from\n\n```\n'value' => $region->getId(),\n\n```\n\nto\n\n```\n'value' => $region->getName(),\n\n```\n\nthen check"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Magento 2 system, you're trying to retrieve the Region Name instead of its value from a select option in the system configuration.

With this model one could select one or more polygons and create new virtual polygons from the selected set. Furthermore one could dissolve within the set, creating a result akin to merged polygons, or have disparate polygons, possibly overlapping, that identify themselves as one unit (multipart polygons in shapefile parlance). These virtual polygons are called regions. When the regions are loaded into Arcmap (or ArcEdit/View back then) they behave like an independent shapefile or feature class in terms of querying, symbolizing, etc. \n\nThe beauty of this model and what is missing from feature classes and feature datasets in the ArcGIS world, so far as I've been able to determine, is that **in regions the geometry is stored only once**. Imagine, for example, the continent of North America split into polygons depicting countries, islands, states \\& territories, counties, municipalities, etc. down to whatever level you feel like stopping at, all stored in a single feature class. (ugh, what a mess) Yet, each level has convenient handles (country, province, whatever) that can be grabbed and used as if they were independent feature classes. \n\nCoverages and Regions have their problems, they weren't left behind lightly, but they weren't all bad. Sooo, what is the ArcGIS answer to ArcInfo Regions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm one of those lucky ones (I think) that entered the GIS world at about the time coverages were being phased out. I've used them, and still do sometimes, but never had to deal with thm in the old pre\\-ArcGIS ArcInfo.\n\n**To answer your question as simply as possible, I don't believe there is anything comparable to Regions or Region sub covrages in the new geodatabase model.**\n\nHere's a link to a white paper from 2003 describing the differences between coverages and geodtabases: [ArcGIS: Working With Geodatabase Topology](http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/geodatabase-topology.pdf)\n\nFrom what I've gleened from this paper, ESRI believed at that time that any benefits from th efficiency of the coverage model were not enough to continue supporting it. Thus the move to the more flexible geodatabase."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of GIS data models, which of the following statements about ArcInfo Workstation's Regions and modern ArcGIS geodatabases is most accurate?\n\nA) Geodatabases offer the same efficient storage of geometry as Regions, where geometry is stored only once for multiple levels of polygons.\n\nB) ArcGIS geodatabases have a direct equivalent to Regions, providing the same functionality and storage efficiency.\n\nC) Regions were abandoned primarily due to their inflexibility, while geodatabases offer more flexibility at the cost of some storage efficiency.\n\nD) The transition from coverages and Regions to geodatabases was driven by the superior topology handling of the new model.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that Regions in ArcInfo Workstation allowed for efficient storage of geometry, storing it only once for multiple levels of polygons. However, it also mentions that coverages and Regions had problems and \"weren't left behind lightly.\" The transition to geodatabases was driven by a need for more flexibility, as stated in the white paper reference. While geodatabases may not offer the same level of storage efficiency for overlapping geometries, they were chosen for their increased flexibility and other benefits. Option A is incorrect because geodatabases don't offer the same efficient storage. Option B is false as there is no direct equivalent to Regions in geodatabases.

As you zoom in, the client system (eg leaflet), asks for tiles at a different zoom level, and only has to get 16 files to show a map of 1024x1024 pixels. \n\nIf you want to create a base map from an image you need to generate all the tiles that make up the zoom levels of your map \\- you don't just take a single image file and serve it from the web server.\n\nWith a web server running an XAMPP stack you could possibly do this dynamically \\- leaflet will ask for a URL like `/map/4/3/2.png` and then your server would generate that image file, perhaps by slicing from a single source image.

If you can use the autocorrelation when the system is into operation, there is no problem.

There is no direct data leakage in the described approach, as the model is not using any future information in its training data. However, the sliding window approach may be benefiting from the natural autocorrelation present in time series data. This means that adjacent months are likely to have similar patterns, allowing the model to perform well on the immediate next month (t+1) but potentially overestimating its performance on truly future, less correlated data (like t+12 or t+13).\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no direct leakage of future information into the training set.\nOption B is overly optimistic, as performance is likely to degrade when testing on less correlated future data.\nOption D is too strict and arbitrary.

Basically, there is an explicit algorithm by which one can achieve any orientation\\-preserving orthogonal transformation as a (highly non\\-unique) sequence of rotations in pairs of coordinates. You can prove the existence of this decomposition in general by induction on the number of coordinates, and this is essentially what Philip Gibbs did in [his answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/12331/rotations-in-space-time/12366#12366), for the case of dimension 4\\.\n\n---\n\nOriginal answer:\n\nThe only way I know how to make Landau's statement both precise and correct is to say that the vector space of first\\-order infinitesimal rotations in 4 dimensions is spanned by infinitesimal rotations in the 6 pairs of axes. (In particular, the word \"resolved\" here is a bit of a puzzle to me.)\n\nAny linear transformation in $n$ dimensions (including any rotation) can be written as an $n \\\\times n$ matrix, where for each $k$ between $1$ and $n$, the $k$th column of the matrix gives the coordinates of where the $k$th basis vector goes. In order for a transformation to be a rotation, we need the lengths of the vectors to be preserved, and we need the angles between them to stay the same. We can encode these conditions in a succinct equation asserting that our matrix times its transpose is the identity. The set of such transformations is given by the solutions to the matrix equation, so it forms an algebraic subset of the $n^2$\\-dimensional space of matrices. In fact, it has the structure of a Lie group, called the orthogonal group $O(n)$.\n\nWe can describe infinitesimal rotations by adding an infinitesimal element $\\\\epsilon$ to our number system, which satisfies the properties that $\\\\epsilon \\\\neq 0$ and $\\\\epsilon^2 \\= 0$. An infinitesimal transformation is a matrix of the form $I \\+ \\\\epsilon M$, where $I$ is the $n \\\\times n$ identity matrix, and $M$ is any matrix with real (non\\-infinitesimal) entries. In order for this to be a rotation, it is necessary and sufficient that the matrix equation $(I \\+ \\\\epsilon M)(I \\+ \\\\epsilon M)^T \\= I$ is satisfied. The left side can be expanded as $I \\+ \\\\epsilon M \\+ \\\\epsilon M^T$, so the equation becomes $\\\\epsilon (M \\+ M^T) \\= 0$. Since the entries of $M$ and $M^T$ are non\\-infinitesimal, this is equivalent to $M$ being skew\\-symmetric, i.e., $M \\= \\-M^T$. That is, the space of first\\-order infinitesimal rotations is the space of matrices of the form $I \\+ \\\\epsilon M$, where $M$ is skew\\-symmetric \\- this is also called the Lie algebra of the group $O(n)$.\n\nIt remains to find a set that spans the space of skew\\-symmetric matrices. A natural method is given taking all pairs of distinct coordinates, and for each pair, choosing an antisymmetric combination, i.e., $e\\_{ij} \\- e\\_{ji}$, where $e\\_{ij}$ is the matrix that has a 1 in the $i$th row and $j$th column and zeroes elsewhere. This forms a linearly independent set of size $\\\\binom{n}{2}$, which is the dimension of the space of skew\\-symmetric matrices. If a matrix $M$ has the form $e\\_{ij} \\- e\\_{ji}$, we can think of it as an infinitesimal rotation in the $x\\_i x\\_j$ direction, since exponentiating yields the rotation: $$e^{tM} \\= (e\\_{ii} \\+ e\\_{jj}) \\\\cos t \\+ (e\\_{ij} \\- e\\_{ji}) \\\\sin t \\+ \\\\sum\\_{k \\\\not \\\\in \\\\{i,j \\\\} } e\\_{kk}.$$\nIn dimensions 3 and 4, the rotations you listed are precisely those given by pairs of distinct coordinates."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In 4-dimensional space-time, how many independent infinitesimal rotations are needed to span the space of all possible rotations, and which planes do these rotations occur in?\n\nA) 3 rotations in the planes xy, yz, and xz\nB) 4 rotations in the planes xy, yz, xz, and tz\nC) 5 rotations in the planes xy, yz, xz, tx, and ty\nD) 6 rotations in the planes xy, yz, xz, tx, ty, and tz\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: In 4-dimensional space-time, there are 6 independent infinitesimal rotations needed to span the space of all possible rotations. These occur in the planes xy, yz, xz, tx, ty, and tz. This is because the space of first-order infinitesimal rotations is equivalent to the space of skew-symmetric 4x4 matrices, which has dimension 6 = (4 choose 2). Each of these rotations corresponds to a pair of distinct coordinates in 4D space-time.

These pressure differences are formed by variations in temperature and weather, and the gradient between them helps to determine the strength of the wind felt. \n\nThis may be a simple view where there is just one area of high pressure and one of low pressure. If I read the second part correctly that is to do with the increased complexity of the atmosphere and pressure systems where you experience a less obvious wind direction. It's possible for the wind to move in all directions including downwards based on where the air is being pulled towards. It may be to do with interference as well such as the wind hitting buildings or other objects that will cause changes in the air patterns around them, there may also be more local heating effects that cause pressure variations leading to more complex air flows. In a large, open, area the wind will be more\\-or\\-less in one direction. An example would be on a ship at sea where from personal experience the wind comes from a specific direction. Compare that to a city where the wind deflecting off buildings will cause all sorts of local 'winds', though the overall propagation would be towards the global low perssure. \n\nOn a larger scale the rotation of the earth and heating by the sun is what drives the most high\\-level air currents. There is a pattern of these currents that is fairly well established from when ships used the wind for power. The effect of the earth on the wind is observed as the windspeeds are far higher in the upper atmosphere with thinner air and less interference from the ground (when very close)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the complex nature of wind patterns and their variations in different environments?\n\nA) Wind is solely caused by the Earth's rotation and has a uniform direction globally.\n\nB) Wind patterns are primarily influenced by pressure differences caused by temperature variations, with additional factors such as topography and local heating effects contributing to their complexity.\n\nC) Wind direction and speed are constant at all altitudes, with no difference between ground level and upper atmosphere.\n\nD) Wind is only affected by large-scale weather systems and is not influenced by local environmental factors.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately captures the main factors influencing wind patterns. Wind is primarily driven by pressure differences caused by temperature variations, which create systems of high and low pressure. However, the complexity of wind patterns is further increased by factors such as topography (e.g., buildings in cities), local heating effects, and the Earth's rotation. This explanation accounts for both the large-scale drivers of wind (pressure systems) and the local factors that create the varied wind directions and speeds we experience. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they oversimplify wind patterns or ignore important factors that contribute to their complexity."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/12/10", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/45574", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/17671/"], "docs_id": 45574, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have about 500 variables per patient, each variable has one continous value and is measured at three different time points (after 2 month and after 1 year).

The circuit board must have an area of solder\\-tinned\\-copper underneath the package. The dimensions of this area depend on the size of the PowerPAD package. Thermal vias connect this area to internal or external copper planes and should have a drill diameter sufficiently small so that the via hole is effectively plugged when the barrel of the via is plated with copper. This plug is needed to prevent wicking the solder away from the interface between the package body and the solder\\-tinned area under the device during solder reflow. Drill diameters of 0\\.33 mm (13 mils) work well when 1\\-oz. copper is plated at the surface of the board while simultaneously plating the barrel of the via. If the thermal vias are not plugged when the copper plating is performed, then a solder mask material should be used to cap the vias with a diameter equal to the via diameter of 0\\.1 mm minimum. This capping prevents the solder from being wicked through the thermal vias and potentially creating a solder void under the package.

We can calculate the zeta function of a disjoint union by the formula $Z(X\\\\amalg Y,t)\\=Z(X,t)Z(Y,t)$. There is also a formula for $Z(X\\\\times Y,t)$ in terms of $Z(X,t)$ and $Z(Y,t)$, but this is slightly more complicated. In fact, these two formulas are precisely the standard big Witt vector addition and multiplication law on the set $1\\+t\\\\mathbf{Z}\\[\\[t]]$. (Actually, there's more than one standard normalization, so you have to get the right one. I believe this ring structure was first written down by Grothendieck in his appendix to Borel\\-Serre, but I don't know who first made the connection with the ring of Witt vectors as defined earlier by Witt.) If we let $K\\_0$ be the Grothendieck group on the isomorphism classes of such schemes, where addition is disjoint union and multiplication is cartesian product, then we get a ring map $K\\_0\\\\to 1\\+t\\\\mathbf{Z}\\[\\[t]]$. We could also do all this with the L\\-factor $L(X,s)\\=Z(X,q^{\\-s})$ (where $q$ is the cardinality of the finite field) instead of the zeta function. This is because they determine each other.\n\nThis is all good. The problem I have is when there is bad reduction. So now let $X$ be a scheme of finite type over $\\\\mathbf{Q}$ (say). Then the L\\-factor $L\\_p(X,s)$ is defined by \n$$L\\_p(X,s)\\=\\\\mathrm{det}(1\\-F\\_p p^{\\-s}\\|H(X,\\\\mathbf{Q}\\_{\\\\ell})^{I\\_p}),$$\nwhere $I\\_p$ is the inertia group at $p$. (Sorry, I'm not going to explain the rest of the notation.) If $I$ acts trivially (in which case one might say $X$ has good reduction), then taking invariants under $I$ does nothing, and so as above, the L\\-factor of a product and sum of varieties is determined by the individual L\\-factors. If $I$ does not act trivially, then the L\\-factor of a sum is again the product of the individual L\\-factors, but for products there is no such formula! (The following should be an example showing this. Take $X\\=\\\\mathrm{Spec}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{Q}(i)$, $Y\\=\\\\mathrm{Spec}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{Q}(\\\\sqrt{2})$. The we have the following Euler factors at 2: $L\\_2(X,s)\\=L\\_2(Y,s)\\=L\\_2(X\\\\times Y,s)\\=1\\-2^{\\-s}$ and $L\\_2(X\\\\times X,s)\\=(1\\-2^{\\-s})^2$. So the L\\-factors of two schemes do not determine that of the product.) Therefore the usual Euler factor cannot possibly give a ring map defined on the Grothendieck ring of varieties over $\\\\mathbf{Q}$.\n\nSo, is there a way of fixing this problem? I would guess the answer is No, because while some people might allow you to scale Euler factors by numbers, I don't think anyone will let you change them by anything else. But maybe there is some \"refined L\\-factor\" that determines the usual one (and maybe incorporates the higher cohomology of the inertia group?) Assuming there is no known way of repairing things, I have a follow\\-up question: Is there some general formalism that handles this failure? And if so, how does that work? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: James: given that no\\-one else answered this yet, let me just make some naive comments that you probably know already. \n\nOf course the problem is that if $I\\_p$ isn't acting trivially, then \"taking $I\\_p$\\-invariants\" isn't as functorial as you'd like it to be. For example consider two 1\\-dimensional ($\\\\ell$\\-adic, or even complex) representations $\\\\rho\\_1$ and $\\\\rho\\_2$ of $D\\_p$, a decomposition group at $p$, each with $I\\_p$ acting non\\-trivially, and with $I\\_p$ also acting non\\-trivially on $\\\\rho\\_1\\\\otimes\\\\rho\\_2$. Then the local $L$\\-factors of $\\\\rho\\_1$, $\\\\rho\\_2$ and $\\\\rho\\_1\\\\otimes\\\\rho\\_2$ are all just 1, but the local $L$\\-factor of $\\\\rho\\_1\\\\otimes(\\\\rho\\_1^{\\-1})$ is clearly not 1\\. In some sense this example is even simpler than the example you give.\n\nBut what the example is supposed to stress is the underlying basic problem (which presumably you know already): if $G$ is group acting on f.d. vector spaces $M\\_1$ and $M\\_2$, then $M\\_1^G\\\\otimes M\\_2^G$ can easily be strictly smaller than $(M\\_1\\\\otimes M\\_2\\)^G$. Hence the moment one considers the local Euler factor (which depends only on the $G$\\-invariants, where here $G$ is the inertia subgroup) one has lost too much information.\n\nBut why not simply consider the ring of isomorphism classes of $\\\\ell$\\-adic representations of $D\\_p$ instead? That's a perfectly good ring, and it has direct sums and tensor products, and presumably if you consider virtual representations too then maybe you can see maps from the ring you mention above to this ring (via Kunneth?). Perhaps this ring is \"too coarse\" for you? I'm not sure. But, if it is, and you're after some finer invariant, then *surely* the invariant will depend only on the action of $D\\_p$. So at least this observation somehow removes all the geometry from the question, which now perhaps is \"give me a quotient ring of the ring of reps of $D\\_p$\" that still distinguishes non\\-isomorphic unramified representations\" or something.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: (major addition to answer). Overnight I realised that really all the answer above was saying was the following. You want to find a map from the Grothendieck ring to \"zeta\\-functions\". I am suggesting that we start by factoring this map into three pieces. I now realise that I am a bit hazy as to whether this can be done. First I am suggesting that we start by sending a variety to the corresponding motive. Now already I realise I might be in trouble, because I think a motive always has realisations, which are representations, and something in your Grothendieck ring might sometimes only have a virtual rep attached to it. But let me ignore this issue. Next I want to go from motives to their realisations (rep of $D\\_p$ on an $\\\\ell$\\-adic vector space). Now I want to go from this representation to its $L$\\-function (defined as in the question), and I want to claim that your map (I am confused about your map though because I don't know whether you're fixing a degree of cohomology or looking at all degrees at once and taking an alternating sum) factors somehow as a composite of these 3 maps. Finally I am claiming that your complaints are only about the last map, so really your question is purely representation\\-theoretic. I am not sure whether I am right about this formalism, so I wanted to flag it explicitly.\n\nNext, here's an exercise you might want to try. The group $I\\_p$ has a pro\\-$\\\\ell$ component so it might have some higher cohomology on $\\\\ell$\\-adic vector spaces. I suspect that $D\\_p/I\\_p$ acts on $H^i(I\\_p,M\\_\\\\ell)$ for all $i$. Why not take the alternating product of these and then take char poly of Frobenius? Stab in the dark! Might get nowhere."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange discussion:\n\nQuestion: Based on the discussion about L-factors and Grothendieck rings, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the challenge of defining a ring map from the Grothendieck ring of varieties over Q to a ring of L-functions when there is bad reduction?\n\nA) The problem can be easily solved by considering the ring of isomorphism classes of \u2113-adic representations of the decomposition group Dp instead.\n\nB) There is no known way to fix this problem, as changing Euler factors by anything other than scaling is not generally accepted in the field.\n\nC) The issue can be resolved by taking the alternating product of higher cohomology groups of the inertia group and then taking the characteristic polynomial of Frobenius.\n\nD) The problem arises because taking Ip-invariants is not as functorial as desired when Ip acts non-trivially, leading to a loss of crucial information in the local Euler factors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The core issue, as explained in the discussion, is that when the inertia group Ip acts non-trivially, taking Ip-invariants loses too much information. This loss of information means that the L-factors of individual varieties do not determine the L-factor of their product, breaking the desired ring structure. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while considering \u2113-adic representations of Dp is a valid approach, it doesn't directly solve the problem of defining a ring map to L-functions. \n\nOption B, while touching on the difficulty of the problem, is too definitive in stating there's no known way to fix it, and doesn't capture the core issue.\n\nOption C is speculative and not presented as a confirmed solution in the discussion.\n\nOption D correctly identifies the fundamental problem: the non-functoriality of taking Ip-invariants when Ip acts non-trivially, which leads to the loss of information that prevents the desired ring structure from being preserved."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/04/19", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/385171", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/47700/"], "docs_id": 385171, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was meditating this morning and this came to me.

It attempts to use a range expression that doesn't work as intended in this context.\n\nOption B is the most precise and efficient solution, matching the structure provided in the original documentation while correctly addressing the specific line range required."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/01/07", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1391697", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/982130/"], "docs_id": 1391697, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a [Lenovo 320S\\-15IKB (Type 81BQ)](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/300-series/320s-15ikb-type-81bq) Ideapad Laptop. This is a new laptop with latest versions of drivers and utilities installed. \n\nWhen using the Intel Graphics app, I attach the charge cable, the Ideapad's screen gets brighter; when unplugged, it returns to the previous brightness level. I want the screen not to change brightness when I plug in or unplug. If I disable the Intel Graphics app, the Ideapad does not change brightness when the power state changes.\n\nAs you see in this screenshot, there's no option to change it in Windows Power Management software. There should be a pair of sliders for brightness as the third items, one under 'On battery' and another under 'Plugged in', but they're missing. \n\n[![Screenshot of all this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/d62wh.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/d62wh.png) \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Display of the *Brightness* slider [*should* be controlled by the Registry key](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/108126-add-remove-display-brightness-power-options-windows.html)`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Power\\PowerSettings\\7516b95f-f776-4464-8c53-06167f40cc99\\aded5e82-b909-4619-9949-f5d71dac0bcb` value DWORD *Attributes*. Set it to `2` to display the slider. However, that might *not* display the slider in some circumstances. \n\nYou can set the brightness through the Registry directly to work around that issue.\n\n[![Default Power Scheme brightness settings](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JBopK.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JBopK.png)\n\n* Press `Win`, type `rege` and `Enter` to open Regedit.\n* Copy the key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Power\\PowerSettings\\7516b95f-f776-4464-8c53-06167f40cc99\\aded5e82-b909-4619-9949-f5d71dac0bcb` and paste it into the Regedit Search bar to go to that key.\n* In the key `DefaultPowerSchemeValues` are sub\\-keys for `ACSettingIndex` and `DCSettingIndex` to adjust the percentage brightnes on mains power and on battery power, respectively. Set them for *each* GUID, so that all plans have the same brightness setting on battery and on mains.\n* **N.B.** If a third\\-party app such as the *Toshiba eco utility* controls screen brightness, you may need to search the Registry for `ACSettingIndex` and change the values *there*, as well.\n\n[![Toshiba eco brightness settings](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SeGqr.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SeGqr.png)\n\nPlease let me know if either Registry setting resolves the issue."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user with a Lenovo 320S-15IKB Ideapad Laptop is experiencing unwanted screen brightness changes when plugging in or unplugging the charger. The brightness sliders are missing from Windows Power Management. Which of the following approaches is most likely to resolve this issue permanently?\n\nA) Disable the Intel Graphics app\nB) Modify the Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Power\\PowerSettings\\7516b95f-f776-4464-8c53-06167f40cc99\\aded5e82-b909-4619-9949-f5d71dac0bcb and set the DWORD value 'Attributes' to 2\nC) Adjust the ACSettingIndex and DCSettingIndex values in the Registry for all power plan GUIDs under DefaultPowerSchemeValues\nD) Contact Lenovo support to request a BIOS update\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While disabling the Intel Graphics app (option A) might temporarily stop the brightness changes, it's not a permanent solution and may impact other graphics functionalities. Option B could potentially make the brightness slider visible in Windows Power Management, but it doesn't guarantee this will work in all cases and doesn't directly address the issue of different brightness levels when plugged in or on battery. Option D is unlikely to resolve this specific issue as it appears to be software-related rather than a BIOS problem.\n\nOption C is the most comprehensive solution. By adjusting the ACSettingIndex (for when plugged in) and DCSettingIndex (for when on battery) values in the Registry for all power plan GUIDs, you ensure that the brightness levels are consistent regardless of the power state. This directly addresses the root cause of the issue and provides a permanent fix that works even if the brightness sliders are not visible in the Windows Power Management interface."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/14", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/122394", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/38313/"], "docs_id": 122394, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> How can you take advantage of this?

The phrase \"to convince a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\" serves as the ultimate purpose or goal of having \"sufficient cause to believe Mr Trump or his associates were involved with terrorists or foreign spies.\" This interpretation is supported by the insertion of \"in order\" before the phrase, which clarifies its function as expressing the intended result of the preceding information.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the phrase doesn't describe the process of bugging phones, but rather the reason for obtaining permission to do so.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the phrase doesn't explain why Mr. Trump was under surveillance, but rather what would be necessary to justify such surveillance legally.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the phrase is related to the concept of sufficient cause, it doesn't define the term itself. Instead, it describes what the sufficient cause would need to accomplish."}}
