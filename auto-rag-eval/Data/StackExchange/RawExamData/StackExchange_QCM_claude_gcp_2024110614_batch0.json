However, I don't get immediate feedback. Instead, I connect to wi\\-fi. However, wi\\-fi is both slower and less reliable than ethernet. Thus, I'd like to know whether I am connected to ethernet or not. Of course I can go into preferences and network settings to see whether I'm connected to ethernet, but it would be better if there was some form of indicator in the status bar, just as there is for wi\\-fi.\nThus, my question:\n\n**Is there a way of getting an indicator of ethernet connectivity in the OSX menu\\-bar?**\n\nPerhaps there is a free application that can do this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is Menumeters:\n\n* [menumeters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/) for OSX 10\\.10 and earlier\n* The port of [menumeters for OSX 10\\.11 onwards](https://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan/).\n\nIf you go into the preferences for MenuMeters it is possible to add a network icon to the OSX menu bar.\nClicking on the icon, indicates the current network (i.e., wifi or Ethernet).\n\nThis is a reasonable solution, but it still requires you to click on the icon to see whether ethernet is connected."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is working on a project that requires switching between multiple office locations with different network setups.

But the net allocates over 1GB of RAM when I train it. What is all that memory needed for?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I found out some of the factors that may contribute to the effect.\n\n1\\) At least in tiny\\-cnn, some of the buffers are allocated not once but once per **worker thread**. On a machine with **8** CPU threads, this can increase the memory usage a lot.\nIn debug mode using MS VC\\+\\+ 2015 the following two lines in the code base allocate a big chunk, both related to worker threads: [`ith_in_node(i)->set_worker_size(worker_count);`](https://github.com/nyanp/tiny-cnn/blob/aa71c81e71102f1a495ca95e7243d64779252831/tiny_cnn/layers/layer.h#L481) and [`ith_out_node(i)->set_worker_size(worker_count);`](https://github.com/nyanp/tiny-cnn/blob/aa71c81e71102f1a495ca95e7243d64779252831/tiny_cnn/layers/layer.h#L485).\n\n2\\) Additionally to the values for the neurons and weights listed in my question, also gradients and some other stuff for the backward passes and the optimization have to be stored.\n\n3\\) Not sure if this is relevant fot tiny\\-cnn, but many frameworks seem to use an operation called **im2col**. This makes the convolution much faster, by expressing it as a matrix multiplication. But in case of filters with 3\\*3 in height and width, this scales the number of values from the input to a convolution up by a factor of **9**.\nJustin Johnson explains it in the lecture [\"S231n Winter 2016 Lecture 11 ConvNets in practice\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue4RJdI8yRA) starting at 36:22\\.\n\n4\\) There was an **error in my initial calculation**. When a volume of 512\\*512\\*3 is convolved with 6 3\\*3 filters and then send into an average pooling layer, the result volume is 256\\*256\\*6, but in between it is 512\\*512\\*6, also contributing with a factor of **2**.\n\n5\\) There was **another error in my initial calculation**. I demonstrate it on the last conv layer (7\\). It takes a volume of 16\\*16\\*96 to a volume of 8\\*8\\*192 with filters of size 3\\*3\\. This means every filter has 3\\*3\\*96 weights, and there are 192 of them, resulting in 165888 (3\\*3\\*96\\*192\\) weights overall for this layer, not 6912\\.\n\nSo numerologically multiplying only the first three factors (8, 9 and 2\\) we end up with a factor of 144, which seems enough to explain the high memory consumption."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about neural networks and memory usage, here's a challenging question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A deep learning engineer is optimizing a convolutional neural network for image processing on a resource-constrained device.

Given the information in the documentation, which optimization technique would most effectively reduce memory usage while maintaining the network's structure?\n\nA) Reducing the number of worker threads to minimize per-thread buffer allocations\nB) Implementing a custom convolution operation to avoid using im2col\nC) Decreasing the image resolution to 256x256x3 before the first convolution\nD) Using half-precision (16-bit) floating-point format for all values\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Decreasing the image resolution to 256x256x3 would have the most significant impact on memory usage. As mentioned in point 4 of the documentation, there was an error in the initial calculation. The intermediate volume after convolution but before pooling is actually 512x512x6, which is a major contributor to memory usage.\n\n2. By reducing the input image size to 256x256x3, we effectively quarter the memory required for the first layer's input and intermediate representations. This cascades through the entire network, reducing memory usage at every subsequent layer.\n\n3. While option A (reducing worker threads) would help, it's not as effective as reducing image size, especially if the number of threads is already low.\n\n4. Option B (custom convolution) might avoid the memory increase from im2col, but this is only a factor of 9 increase, less impactful than reducing image size.\n\n5.

T is indeed an isogenous product of S and Ta, but never a direct product due to the inherent overlap between these subtori.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the example explicitly shows that a direct product relationship doesn't hold.\n\nOption C is partially true but incomplete, as the relationship is consistent across the central isogeny class.\n\nOption D is incorrect because S and Ta are not disjoint; they have a non-trivial intersection as explained in the example.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze and apply complex mathematical concepts in the context of algebraic groups, requiring integration of multiple ideas from the given documentation."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/23", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/42408462", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/5394129/"], "docs_id": 42408462, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have the following pom.xml file\n\n```\n<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\nxsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n<modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n<groupId>com.globalfoundries.pdk.dm</groupId>\n<artifactId>pdk-swtcommon</artifactId>\n<version>1.6-SNAPSHOT</version>\n<packaging>jar</packaging>\n<name>PDK SWT Common</name>\n<url>http://maven.apache.org</url>\n\n<parent>\n    <groupId>com.globalfoundries.pdk</groupId>\n    <artifactId>pdk-parent</artifactId>\n    <version>1.2</version>\n    <relativePath>../pdk-parent/pom.xml</relativePath>\n</parent>\n\n...\n</project>\n\n```\n\nWhen I do an Maven Clean, I got an error that seems to concatenate the full path for the pdk\\-parent/pom.xml into the current path where it complaints about non\\-readable POM and the path that is was given is:\n\\\\MPTFS04\\\\cley\\\\Profile\\\\Perforce\\\\pdk\\-workspace\\\\pdk\\-qa\\\\shared\\\\dev\\\\DEV\\\\java\\\\pdk\\-swtcommon\\\\MPTFS04\\\\cley\\\\Profile\\\\Perforce\\\\pdk\\-workspace\\\\pdk\\-qa\\\\shared\\\\dev\\\\DEV\\\\java\\\\pdk\\-parent\\\\pom.xml\n\nWell, \\\\MPTFS04\\\\cley\\\\Profile\\\\Perforce\\\\pdk\\-workspace\\\\pdk\\-qa\\\\shared\\\\dev\\\\DEV\\\\java\\\\pdk\\-swtcommon is where my current project and pom.xml is; and \\\\MPTFS04\\\\cley\\\\Profile\\\\Perforce\\\\pdk\\-workspace\\\\pdk\\-qa\\\\shared\\\\dev\\\\DEV\\\\java\\\\pdk\\-parent\\\\pom.xml is where the parent pdk\\-parent\\\\pom.xml full path is...

Given the following scenario and error message, what is the most likely root cause of the build failure, and what approach should be taken to resolve it?\n\nA) The relativePath in the parent POM is incorrect; it should be changed to an absolute path to ensure proper resolution.\nB) There's a circular dependency between the child and parent POMs; the parent reference should be removed from the child POM.\nC) Maven is incorrectly resolving the parent POM location due to a Windows path handling issue; the build should be executed on a Linux system instead.\nD) The relativePath is being misinterpreted due to network drive mapping; it should be replaced with a repository-based parent POM reference.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The error message indicates that Maven is having trouble locating the parent POM file, resulting in a \"Non-readable POM\" error. The path being reported is a concatenation of the current project path and the parent POM path, suggesting a problem with path resolution.\n\nThe key factors to consider are:\n1. The project is using network drives (\\\\MPTFS04\\...)\n2. The build is running on Windows 7\n3. The parent POM is referenced using a relativePath\n\nThe issue likely stems from Maven's inability to correctly resolve the relative path when dealing with network drives on Windows. This is a known limitation in some versions of Maven when working with mapped network drives.\n\nOption D is the most appropriate solution because:\n1. It addresses the root cause of the path resolution issue\n2. It follows Maven best practices for multi-module projects\n3. It eliminates dependencies on local file system structure\n\nBy replacing the relativePath with a repository-based parent POM reference, the team can ensure that Maven resolves the parent POM correctly regardless of the local file system structure or network drive mapping. This approach also improves the project's portability and reduces potential issues when building on different environments.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they don't address the underlying issue and may introduce new problems. Option B is incorrect because there's no evidence of a circular dependency in the given information, and removing the parent reference would likely break the project structure.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (Maven build process, POM structure, Windows path handling, best practices for multi-module projects) and tests the ability to analyze a complex real-world scenario to determine the most appropriate solution."}, "7": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/01", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/351631", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/45805/"], "docs_id": 351631, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I use the `tcolorbox` package to produce exercises with solution.

Which combination of packages and techniques would best achieve this while maintaining the existing exercise-solution structure?\n\nA) Use the `manyfoot` package with `\\footnotetextC` commands placed after each `tcolorbox`\nB) Implement the `paranotes` package with `\\parnote` commands inside the boxes and `\\parnotes` in the `after upper` option\nC) Modify the `tcolorbox` options to include a `footnote` parameter that automatically places footnotes outside the box\nD) Use the standard `\\footnote` command with a custom `\\footnotemark` redefinition to place footnotes outside the box\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The optimal solution involves using the `paranotes` package, which is specifically designed for handling inline footnotes in complex layouts. This approach addresses several key aspects of the problem:\n\n1. It maintains the existing `tcolorbox` structure for exercises and solutions.\n2. It allows for inline footnotes within both the exercise and solution boxes.\n3. The footnotes are printed outside the boxes, as desired.\n4. It's more flexible than the `manyfoot` approach, which had limitations in the solution box.\n\nThe implementation involves:\n- Adding `\\usepackage{parnotes}` to the preamble.\n- Using `\\parnote{...}` for inline footnotes within the boxes.\n- Adding `\\parnotes` to the `after upper` option of the exercise environment to print the notes.\n- Including `\\parnotes` manually at the end of the solution content.\n- Adding `code={\\parnotereset}` to the exercise environment to reset footnote numbering for each exercise.\n\nThis solution integrates seamlessly with the existing `tcolorbox` setup, addresses the limitations of the previous approach with `manyfoot`, and provides a consistent way to handle footnotes in both exercise and solution boxes.

The point cloud I'm testing against is very big (\\~800\\.000\\). However, this doesn't really explain why my implementation is so slow. This is my approach:\n\nFirst, I created a spatial index for the point shape \n\n`pntshp.ExecuteSQL('CREATE SPATIAL INDEX ON %s' % table_name)`\n\nI defined an array of buffer distances to narrow down the search radius. Which of course also means that I have to create a buffer for each point (which might be expensive). \n\n`BUFFER_DISTANCES = ( 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 ) # 100m, 500m, 1km, 2km, 5km` \n\nThen, the buffer is used as a spatial filter \n\n`node_lyr.SetSpatialFilter(buff)`\n\nIf the filter returns `None` the buffer distance will be increased. \n\n```\nfor buffer_d in BUFFER_DISTANCES:\n    buffr = get_buffer(xy_street,buffer_d)\n    ...\n\n```\n\nThen I am calculating the distance to the points returned by the spatial filter\n\n```\np=ogr.Geometry(ogr.wkbPoint)\np.AddPoint(xy[0],xy[1])\n\nfor feat in node_lyr:\n    geom = feat.GetGeometryRef()\n    d = p.Distance(geom)\n    dist.append(d)       \n\n```\n\nTo get the closest point:\n\n```\ndef get_closest_pnt(dist, node, how_close):\n    mrg = zip(dist,node)\n    mrg.sort(key=lambda t: t[0])\n    try:\n        return mrg[how_close]\n    except IndexError, ierr:\n        print '%s \\ndist/node tuple contain %s' % (ierr,mrg)\n\n```\n\nIt all works fine but is really slow. Creating a spatial index didn't show any effect, really. To calculate 100 points this implementations takes \\~6,7 seconds. The program needs to be able to calculate the closest location for more than 2000 points as fast as possible. Any ideas on how to improve my approach? \n\n**EDIT**\n\nI tried different approaches to see where it gets me. I came across something very astonishing I want to share here. \n\nI implemented a simple lookup algorithm as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19154296/python-how-to-search-for-a-substring-in-a-set-the-fast-way), and one of the solutions that where suggested (the sorted set approach). \n\nThe surprising fact is that performance is not only dependent on the implementation but even more so of the OSX. My original ogr/buffer algorithm turns out to be blazing fast on my OSX whereas it is painstaking slow on Linux (hence the question here). \n\nHere are my results (100 runs). \n\n```\nMethod       |     OSX        |  Linux Ubuntu\nogr buffer   | 0:00:01.434389 | 0:01:08.384309\n\nsub string   | 0:00:19.714432 | 0:00:10.048649\n\nsorted set   | 0:00:01.239999 | 0:00:00.600773\n\nSpecs Mac OSX\nProcessor 4x2.5 GHz  \nMemory 8 GB 1600 MHz\n\nSpecs Dell Linux Ubuntu\nProcessor 8x3.4GHz\nMemory 7.8 GB\n\n```\n\nIf someone can explain why these differences occur, please don't hesitate. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Avoiding the spatial query**\n------------------------------\n\nSince you noted buffering is computationally expensive and may be holding you back, consider this approach: Start looping through each point and round off your lat long point to a decimal place within your buffer (i.e. if your lat/long is 12\\.3456789/12\\.3456789 then get all points that begin with a lat/long of 12\\.34567/12\\.34567 or 12\\.34568/12\\.34568 or 12\\.34567/12\\.34568 or 12\\.34568/12\\.34567\\). Use a [hash table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) to do this. Take this subset of points, get all distances to your input point, and the point with minimum distance is the one you want. Creating a lookup methodology will make this very efficient.\n\nThis avoids having to do expensive spatial queries and query filter setup 800,000 times. You would only be doing string/double comparisons and distance calculations in this method. The only downside that I could see to this method is that each decimal roundoff is an order of magnitude above the last, so if your spatial query didn't return any points, rounding down again may return many more points than you need, which would slow you down a bit. However, you have at least two orders of magnitude in your orignal BUFFER\\_DISTANCES, so I think this method may suffice for your purposes and would certainly be faster than the method you have going right now.\n\n**The hash table:**\n-------------------\n\n[Here's](http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/cpp/algorithms/hash/article.php/c5131/Introduction-to-Hash-Tables.htm) a more concise and better introductory explanation to hash tables. \n\nThe concept is like so: You want to look up the definition for the word \"Yes\" in the dictionary. You don't look through every word in a dictionary starting from A to find the words that start with Ye, correct? You jump straight to the Y section first, then you look for the page that says Ye\\-Yo and then you scan all the words on that page to get the definition for Yes.\n\nThe lookup methodology to loop through all the lat/long points would be implemented in this same fashion.

The current implementation using spatial indexing and buffering is slow, taking about 6.7 seconds for 100 points. Which of the following approaches is most likely to significantly improve performance while maintaining accuracy?\n\nA) Increase the buffer distances to reduce the number of spatial queries\nB) Implement a hash table-based lookup using rounded latitude and longitude values\nC) Switch from OGR to a different GIS library for spatial operations\nD) Parallelize the distance calculations using multi-threading\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most promising approach to improve performance is implementing a hash table-based lookup using rounded latitude and longitude values. This method addresses several key issues with the current implementation:\n\n1. It avoids expensive spatial queries and buffer creation, which were identified as potential bottlenecks in the original approach.\n\n2. It leverages efficient data structures (hash tables) for quick lookups, which can significantly reduce search time compared to spatial filtering.\n\n3. It allows for incremental precision adjustments by rounding coordinates to different decimal places, mimicking the effect of increasing buffer sizes without the computational overhead.\n\n4. This method scales well with large datasets, as it doesn't require iterating through all 800,000 points for each query.\n\n5. It aligns with the top answer's suggestion, which explains how this approach can be more efficient than spatial queries for this specific use case.\n\nOption A (increasing buffer distances) might reduce the number of queries but wouldn't address the fundamental performance issues. Option C (switching GIS libraries) is unlikely to provide the necessary performance boost, as the problem lies more in the approach than the specific library. Option D (parallelizing calculations) could offer some improvement but doesn't address the core inefficiency of the current method and may introduce additional complexity.\n\nThe hash table approach offers a balance of performance improvement and accuracy, making it the most suitable solution for optimizing this specific point-finding algorithm."}, "10": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/08/04", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2872218", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/581716/"], "docs_id": 2872218, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the fourth edition of \"Introduction to Real Analysis\" by Bartle and Sherbert, theorem 6\\.2\\.3 (Rolle's theorem) states,\n\n> Suppose that f is continuous on a closed interval $I :\\= \\[a, b]$, that\n>  the derivative of $f$ exists at every point of the open interval $(a, b)$, and that $f(a) \\= f(b) \\= 0$.\n>  Then there exists at least one point $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that the derivative of $f$ is zero at $c$.\n\nNow, why are we taking $f(a)\\=0\\=f(b)$?

The correct answer is A, and here's why:\n\n1. The given function f(x) satisfies all the conditions of Rolle's Theorem:\n   - It is continuous on the closed interval [0, 5]\n   - It is differentiable on the open interval (0, 5)\n   - f(0) = f(5) = 3 (note that they are equal, but not necessarily zero)\n\n2.

We can prove this by considering a new function g(x) = f(x) - k, which would have g(0) = g(5) = 0, satisfying the original theorem.\n\n3. Therefore, we can conclusively state that there must be at least one point c in (0, 5) where f'(c) = 0.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while f(0) = f(5), the function is not necessarily constant throughout the interval.

If E is measurable, we can construct a probability measure on E that is consistent with the original probability space (\u03a9, \u2131, P).\n\n2. It ensures that the preimage of any measurable subset of E under X is an event in \u2131. This is necessary for defining the probability distribution of X.\n\n3. It enables us to calculate probabilities for any measurable subset of E, not just individual points.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while E needs to be measurable, it doesn't need to be a sigma-algebra itself. The sigma-algebra is typically defined on E, not E itself.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while topological spaces are important in some areas of probability theory, measurability is the key concept here, not topology.\n\nOption D is too restrictive. While finite sets are always measurable, E doesn't need to be finite. Many important random variables have infinite ranges (e.g., normal distribution).\n\nThe question about \"what it means for a range not to be measurable\" is addressed implicitly. If E were not measurable, we couldn't consistently assign probabilities to all subsets of E, making it impossible to fully describe the behavior of the random variable X in probabilistic terms.\n\nThis question tests the student's understanding of the relationship between random variables, their ranges, and the underlying probability space, requiring integration of multiple concepts and critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/08/02", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/291613", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/189551/"], "docs_id": 291613, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been building an application and the whole thing is built around a simple data storage system. \n\n* Create an array.\n* Convert it into JSON.\n* Add `<?php die()` at the beginning to prevent access.\n* Save to PHP file and save to disk.\n\nThen.\n\n* Open file.\n* Remove `<?php die();`.\n* Decode it from JSON.\n* Edit/Read array.\n* Save it back to file if edited.\n\nIs this a safe way to store data?

I want to set my own talks or texts in `cowsay`. But I can't configure it out. When I open terminal there is nothing from `cowsay`.

I'll get to it later. Once you have the script, all you have to do is to execute it. As suggested before, edit your \\~/.bashrc file and add at the end a line containing the path to your script. For example, if you have the script in your home folder and the script's filename is \"cowscript\", then you could add the following line at the end of your \\~/.bashrc file:\n\n```\n$HOME/cowscript\n\n```\n\nNow, the script used in Linux Mint 9 is the following:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\nRANGE=4\n\nnumber=$RANDOM\nlet \"number %= $RANGE\"\ncase $number in\n    0)\n        cow=\"small\"\n        ;;\n    1)\n        cow=\"tux\"\n        ;;\n    2)\n        cow=\"koala\"\n        ;;\n    3)\n        cow=\"moose\"\n        ;;\nesac\n\nRANGE=2\nnumber=$RANDOM\nlet \"number %= $RANGE\"\ncase $number in\n    0)\n        command=\"/usr/games/cowsay\"\n        ;;\n    1)\n        command=\"/usr/games/cowthink\"\n        ;;\nesac\n/usr/games/fortune | $command -f $cow\n\n```\n\nBasically, it will display a random cow (either *small*, *tux*, *koala*, or *moose*) and the message will be taken from fortune. Also, this script will execute wither *cowsay* or *cowthink*, the only difference being that *cowthink* will display a thinking cow instead of a talking cow.\n\nNow, the fun thing is that you can modify the script to show more cows or to show different cows. To do that, you first need to know what cows you have installed. In a terminal, run:\n\n```\ncowsay -l\n\n```\n\nYou can use any of those cows. All you have to do is to edit the script: if you want to add a new cow, just copy the lines containing \"cow\" (plus the number and semi\\-colons) and paste them before the line that says \"esac\". Then, change the number and name of the cow, so for instance, if you want to add a cow called \"udder\", all you have to do is to add these lines before the first \"esac\":\n\n```\n4)\n    cow=\"udder\"\n    ;;\n\n```\n\n**Important**: the second line of the file, \"RANGE\\=4\", must be changed also. If you add one cow, then instead of 4 use 5, also if you delete one cow, then you must use 3, and so on. Also note that the numbers that you see must be in the range from 0 to *RANGE \\- 1*. That's why RANGE is 4 and the numbers are 0, 1, 2, and 3\\.\n\nYou could also create your own cows, although that might take a bit more of work. All you have to do is to get any ASCII art you like and edit it, but it is a bit tricky. You can see how it's done here: [http://lmpeiris.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/cowsayhow\\-to\\-make\\-a\\-cow\\-talk\\-on\\-terminal\\-startup/](http://lmpeiris.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/cowsayhow-to-make-a-cow-talk-on-terminal-startup/) However, consider that any **@** and **\\\\** symbols need to be backslashed, that is, you must put before that symbol this other symbol: **\\\\**. This might be the case for **\\#**, too (but not always). If your ASCII Art contains **\\#**, you could backslash it too, but sometimes it would be enough with just one of them... I'm not sure how to explain it, sorry. I guess you will have to try to see if it works. Also, make sure that the file you edit has the extension \".cow\"\n\nFinally, once you have your own cows, you can either add them to the default location (you probably will need to be superuser for that) at /usr/share/cowsay/cows, or you could add to your \\~/.bashrc file this lines:\n\n```\nexport COWPATH=\"/usr/share/cowsay/cows\"\n# set COWPATH so it includes user's cows\nif [ -d \"$HOME/cowfiles\" ] ; then\n    COWPATH=\"$COWPATH:$HOME/cowfiles\"\nfi\n\n```\n\nBe sure to add those lines before you call your \"cowscript\". This also assumes that you have a folder called \"cowfiles\" on your home folder. Change the path if you want so it points to the folder where you have your cowfiles."}, "answer": "Understood. I'll create a challenging multiple-choice question based on the provided StackExchange documentation about customizing cowsay and fortune. Here's the question:\n\nQuestion: A Linux user wants to create a custom cowsay script that displays a random message from fortune when opening a terminal. They've successfully created the script, but now want to add their own custom ASCII art cow. What is the most comprehensive approach to integrate this custom cow into their existing setup?\n\nA) Simply add the new ASCII art file with a .cow extension to the /usr/share/cowsay/cows directory\nB) Modify the script to include a new case for the custom cow, update the RANGE variable, and add the cow file to a user-specific directory\nC) Edit the ~/.bashrc file to include the path to the new cow file and modify the cowsay command in the script\nD) Create a new cowsay command that only uses the custom cow, replacing the original randomization script\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most comprehensive approach involves several steps, addressing both the script logic and file placement:\n\n1. Modifying the script: The user needs to add a new case in the cow selection part of the script, incrementing the RANGE variable and adding a new option for their custom cow.\n\n2. File placement: Instead of adding the cow file directly to /usr/share/cowsay/cows (which might require superuser privileges), it's better to use a user-specific directory.\n\n3. Updating COWPATH: The ~/.bashrc file should be modified to include the custom cow directory in the COWPATH.\n\nThis approach (B) combines script modification, proper file management, and system configuration updates. Option A is incomplete as it doesn't modify the script and might require superuser access. Option C misses the script modification aspect, which is crucial for including the new cow in the random selection. Option D completely changes the intended functionality of having random cows and messages.\n\nThis question tests the user's ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, including script modification, file system organization, and environment variable configuration, aligning with higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/08", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/93516", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/18483/"], "docs_id": 93516, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Consider the class of bounded sequences to which every Banach limit (non\\-negative shift\\-invariant continuous functional on $l^\\\\infty$ taking convergent sequences in the usual sense to their limits) assigns the same limit value.\n\n **Does a sequence belong to this class if its Cesaro means have a limit?** \n\nAlso, is the converse true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can characterize Banach limits as continuous functionals on $\\\\ell^\\\\infty$ which vanish on\n$$ X :\\= \\\\{(x\\_n \\- x\\_{n\\+1}): (x\\_n) \\\\in \\\\ell^\\\\infty\\\\} $$\nand which send the constant sequence $(1,1,\\\\dots)$ to $1$.\n\nNote that $X$ is a subspace.\nThe Hahn\\-Banach Theorem tells us that we are asking: if $(y\\_n) \\\\in \\\\ell^\\\\infty$ has Cesaro mean $0$, is it in the closure of $X$?\n(And the converse question is: does every element of $X$ have Cesaro mean $0$?\nYes; since the $n^\\\\text{th}$ Cesaro mean of $(x\\_n\\-x\\_{n\\+1})$ is $(x\\_1\\-x\\_{n\\+1})/n$, which converges to $0$ since $(x\\_n)$ is uniformly bounded.)\n\nThe answer is no.\nConsider the sequence $(y\\_n)$ that has $1$ once, followed by $\\-1$ three times, then $1$ five times, and so on.\nOne can compute the Cesaro mean, and see that it approaches $0$ in the limit.\nBut $(y\\_n)$ is not in the closure of $X$.\n\nSurely, if it were, then let $(x\\_n) \\\\in \\\\ell^\\\\infty$ be such that \n$$ \\\\\\|(y\\_n) \\- (x\\_n\\-x\\_{n\\+1})\\\\\\|\\_\\\\infty \\< 1/2\\. $$\nLet $M$ be a natural number, $M \\\\geq \\\\\\|(x\\_n)\\\\\\|$. \nLet $n$ be an index such that \n$$ y\\_n \\= \\\\cdots \\= y\\_{n\\+4M} \\= 1\\. $$ \nThen for $i\\=1,\\\\dots,4M$,\n$$ x\\_{n\\+i} \\< x\\_{n \\+ i\\-1} \\- y\\_{n \\+ i \\- 1} \\+ 1/2 \\= x\\_{n \\+ i \\- 1} \\- 1/2, $$\nand summing these up, we find\n$$ x\\_{n\\+4M} \\< x\\_n \\- 4M/2\\. $$\nThis contradicts the assumption that $\\\\\\|(x\\_n)\\\\\\| \\\\leq M$."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Banach limits and Cesaro means, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying the relationship between Banach limits and Cesaro means for bounded sequences.

I think that maybe if my model was applied to some different observation, I would be 95% sure that its $AUC$ fit into CI. Am I right?\n\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A confidence interval is an interval\\-estimate for some true value of a parameter. Let us (as an example) start with e.g. a confidence interval for the mean of a normal distribution and then move on to ROC and AUC so that one sees the analogy. \n\nAssume that you have a random normal variable $X \\\\sim N(\\\\mu;\\\\sigma)$. Where $\\\\mu$ is the **unknown** population mean and, to keep it simple, let us assume that $\\\\sigma$ is known. \n\nWe now draw a sample of size $n$ from the distribution of X, i.e. we get a sample $x\\_1, x\\_2, \\\\dots x\\_n$. The goal is to have an idea about the unknown $\\\\mu$ using the sample drawn. It is well known that the arithemetic average $\\\\bar{x}\\=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_i x\\_i$ is an unbiased (point) estimator for (the unknown) $\\\\mu$ and that $\\[\\\\bar{x}\\-1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}};\\\\bar{x}\\+1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}}]$ is a $95\\\\%$ confidence interval for (the unknown) $\\\\mu$. \n\nIf we draw another sample $y\\_1, \\\\dots , y\\_n$ from the distribtion of $X$ then, in the same way we will find **another** confidence interval for the (unknown) $\\\\mu$ as $\\[\\\\bar{y}\\-1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}};\\\\bar{y}\\+1\\.96\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}}]$. \n\nSo each time we draw a sample of size $n$ from the distribution of $X$, we find a confidence interval for the (unknown) $\\\\mu$ and all these intervals will be different. **The fact that it is a $95\\\\%$ confidence interval means that, if we draw an 'infinite' number of samples of size $n$ from the distribution of $X$, and for each of these samples we compute the $95\\\\%$ confidence interval, then $95\\\\%$ of all these intervals (one interval for each sample) will contain the unknown $\\\\mu$.** (so sometimes , namely $5\\\\%$ of the intervals, such an interval will not contain the unknown $\\\\mu$, so sometimes you have bad luck.)\n\nThe same holds for the AUC, when you compute the AUC, you compute it from a sample, in other words what you compute is an estimate for the **true *unknown* AUC**. Similarly you can, for the sample that you have, compute a confidence interval for the true but unknown AUC. If you were able to draw an infinite number of samples, and for each sample obtained compute the confidence interval for the true AUC, then $95\\\\%$ of these computed intervals would contain the true but unknown AUC. \n\n**Note that the interval is random, because it is computed from a random sample. The true AUC is not random, it is some unknown property of your population.**\n\nUnfortunately you can not draw an infinite number of samples, most of the time you have only one sample, so you will have to do it with one interval, **but you are rather confident** ($95\\\\%$ of the so computed intervals will contain the true unknown AUC) that this interval will contain the true AUC. And yes, if the lower border of the interval is higer than 0\\.5 then **you can be rather confident that** your model is not the random model, but, as above, you may also have had bad luck with the sample."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about confidence intervals for AUC in ROC analysis, here's a challenging question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist has developed a new machine learning model for predicting credit default risk.

It's a common misconception to interpret confidence intervals as providing absolute certainty.\n\nOption B is a common misinterpretation of confidence intervals. The interval doesn't describe the probability of the parameter falling within it, but rather the long-run behavior of the interval estimation procedure.\n\nOption C is correct. It accurately describes the frequentist interpretation of a 95% confidence interval. If we could repeat this process of sampling and calculating confidence intervals many times, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true, unknown AUC value.\n\nOption D is incorrect and represents a misunderstanding of both confidence intervals and statistical significance.

This method offers several advantages:\n\n1. Functions support parameters natively, unlike aliases which don't handle arguments well.\n2. It avoids the unnecessary complexity of nesting a function within an alias (option A).\n3. It's more efficient than calling an external script (option C) as it's loaded into the shell's memory.\n4. It properly handles multiple arguments using \"$@\", unlike the alias in option D which only uses $1.\n5. It follows the principle of least astonishment by behaving like a normal shell command.\n6. It allows for easy modification and expansion of functionality within the function if needed.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's understanding of shell scripting best practices, function definitions, and the limitations of aliases.

The key insight is that the compactness of the Lie group G is essential for the anti-symmetry property of the defined relation.\n\nThe relation is indeed reflexive and transitive, as stated in the documentation. However, the anti-symmetry property, which is necessary for a partial order, is not guaranteed for all groups.\n\nThe example provided in the documentation demonstrates a case where anti-symmetry fails for a non-compact group (the group of conformal automorphisms of R\u00b2). In this example, we have subgroups H and K where K is a subgroup of H, and a conjugate of H is a subgroup of K, but H is not conjugate to K. This violates anti-symmetry.\n\nThe fact that the author claims this relation defines a partial order specifically for compact Lie groups suggests that compactness is a crucial property for ensuring anti-symmetry.

Here is a unusual one: if $A \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a **convex** set, the \n[Cauchy\\-Crofton formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crofton_formula) says that the perimeter of $A$ equals the measure of the set of lines that hit $A$, or\n\n$$ p(A) \\= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int\\_{S^1} \\\\lambda(P\\_{\\\\theta} A) d\\\\theta, $$\n\nwhere $P\\_\\\\theta$ is the orthogonal projection in the direction $\\\\theta \\\\in S^1$, and $\\\\lambda$ the Lebesgue measure on any line.\n\nNow, this definition of $p(A)$ makes sense for non\\-necessarily convex sets, excepts that it is not the usual notion of perimeter, so let's call it rather \"mean shadow\".

Option D misidentifies the cause as a tagging problem rather than a feature of the search system.\n\nThis question requires the integration of concepts from the documentation, application of the information to a real-world scenario (improving search functionality), and analysis of potential solutions.

The correct answer is C because both \"it\" and \"that\" can be grammatically correct in this situation, but they have slightly different implications:\n\n1. \"It\" would be a neutral pronoun referring back to the Galaxy S8.\n2. \"That\" serves as a demonstrative pronoun, which can add emphasis and slightly shift focus.\n\nUsing \"that\" in this context subtly reinforces the specific recommendation of the Galaxy S8 model, making it a valid stylistic choice, especially in informal speech. This aligns with the documentation's implicit acceptance of \"that\" in this usage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"that\" can indeed be used as a subject pronoun in certain contexts.

It is fed from a 100A breaker using 3\\-3\\-3\\-5 CU Service wire. I removed the ground screw to isolate the Neutral and I installed the ground bus that came with it on the left side. It is attached with 2 screws directly to the panel. I connected the \\#5 ground wire to this ground bus.\n\nThe question:\nThe ground bus is SHORT with only 8\\-10 usable positions so I have added an additional ground bus on the right side of the panel. It is made specifically for the panel, Square D and attaches with 1 screw, centered over 2 nubs that lock it in place. Is the screw enough to ground this additional bar or do I need to interconnect it to the first ground bus with wire. If so, what size?\n\nThanks VERY much in advance for your assistance!\n\n**Follow up:**\n\nINSTRUCTIONS!! Those would VERY handy indeed. The problem is that they SUCK. Number 4 gives all the info about how to wire it, but I found it less than useful. Here is the entire text of the instructions:\n\n1\\) Turn off all power to the enclosure\n\n2\\) Mount grounding bar to the back of enclosure:\n\n* if one mounting hole and two nubs are provided, mount with outer holes over nubs and mounting screw through center hole.\n* if two mounting holes are provided, mount with two mounting screws.\n\nNOTE: If no mounting holes are provided, use \\#26 drill bit to drill two 0\\.147 in diameter mounting holes using grounding bar as a template.\n\n3\\) Apply equipment grounding label to enclosure beside grounding bar.\n\n4\\) **Install wiring to grounding bar.** See equipment grounding label for binding screw torque.\n\nSo are they assuming this is the ONLY grounding bar and therefore the \\#5 ground feed from the main panel will get attached to it? Or is the lack of instruction to jumper it to an existing main ground bar an indication that the screws are enough and that it grounds through the body of the enclosure to the original ground bar? I sure can't tell from what little info they provided.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Follow the instructions.** You are obliged (NEC 110\\.3\\) to follow the extra grounding bar's instructions. That's because those instructions are the basis for UL granting it a *listing* as safe. \n\nAs long as you met the instructions, **feel free to exceed**. So you can add a ground wire even if it's not required. Generally you don't downsize a service wire (i.e. you wouldn't run 14AWG to the last single 5\\-15 receptacle of a 20A circuit), so you'd stay with 5AWG Cu ground wire. \n\nAny type is fine, as long as it meets the original current rating.

The main ground bus is connected to the #5 ground wire from the main panel. Given the manufacturer's instructions and NEC requirements, what is the most appropriate way to ensure proper grounding of the additional bus?\n\nA) Connect the additional ground bus to the main ground bus with a #5 copper wire\nB) Attach the additional ground bus with the provided screw and rely on the panel enclosure for grounding\nC) Drill additional mounting holes and use two screws to attach the ground bus for better conductivity\nD) Apply a conductive paste between the additional ground bus and the panel enclosure before attaching\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the application of NEC requirements and manufacturer instructions in a real-world scenario. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. NEC 110.3 requires following the manufacturer's instructions for listed equipment.\n2. The instructions state that if one mounting hole and two nubs are provided, the ground bus should be mounted \"with outer holes over nubs and mounting screw through center hole.\"\n3. The question specifies that the additional ground bus \"attaches with 1 screw, centered over 2 nubs that lock it in place,\" matching the manufacturer's instructions.\n4. The instructions do not require interconnecting multiple ground buses with wire, suggesting that proper attachment to the enclosure is sufficient for grounding.\n5. The top answer emphasizes following the instructions and states that exceeding them (e.g., adding a wire) is optional but not required.\n\nOption A is a plausible distractor because it seems logical to connect ground buses, but it's not required by the instructions.

The correct answer is B because the documentation states that \"The most recent horse you've ridden will be your active horse, and will reappear wherever you fast travel,\" and \"Any other owned horses return to the stable where they were purchased.\" This explains why only one horse is at Whiterun's stables after fast-traveling.\n\nOption A is a plausible misconception but incorrect, as the game's behavior is working as designed.

I contend that to truly get a normal distribution one must have mean\\=median\\=mode, all the data must be contained under the bell curve, and perfectly symmetrical around the mean. Therefore, technically, there are virtually NO normal distributions in real studies, and we should call them something else, perhaps \"near\\-normal\". \n\nShe says I'm too picky, and if the skew/kurtosis are less than 1\\.0 it is a normal distribution and took off points on an exam.

In reality virtually no data is ever a perfect normal distribution, although we can discuss \u201capproximately normal distributions\u201d such as height, weight, temperature, or length of adult ring finger in large population groups.\n\n**Professor's answer:**\n\n> You are correct that there is no perfectly normal distribution. But, we are not looking for perfection. We need to look at data in addition to the histogram and the measures of central tendency. What do the skewness and kurtosis statistics tell you about the distribution? Because they are both between the critical values of \\-1 and \\+1, this data is considered to be normally distributed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A problem with your discussion with the professor is one of terminology, there's a misunderstanding that is getting in the way of conveying a potentially useful idea. In different places, you both make errors.\n\nSo the first thing to address: it's important to be pretty clear about what a [*distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) is.\n\nA normal *distribution* is a specific mathematical object, which you could consider as a model for a process (which you might consider an uncountably infinite population of values; no finite population can actually have a continuous distribution).\n\nLoosely, what this distribution does (once you specify the parameters) is define (via an algebraic expression) the proportion of the population values that lies within any given interval on the real line. Slightly less loosely, it defines the probability that a single value from that population will lie in any given interval.\n\nAn observed sample doesn't really have a normal distribution; a sample might (potentially) be drawn from a normal distribution, if one were to exist. If you look at the empirical cdf of the sample, it's discrete. If you bin it (as in a histogram) the sample has a \"frequency distribution\", but those aren't normal distributions. The distribution can tell us some things (in a probabilistic sense) about a random sample from the population, and a sample may also tell us some things about the population.\n\nA reasonable interpretation of a phrase like \"normally distributed sample\"\\* is \"a random sample from a normally distributed population\".\n\n\\*(I generally try to avoid saying it myself, for reasons that are hopefully made clear enough here; usually I manage to confine myself to the second kind of expression.)\n\nHaving defined terms (if still a little loosely), let us now look at the question in detail. I'll be addressing specific pieces of the question.\n\n> normal distribution one must have mean\\=median\\=mode\n\nThis is certainly a condition on the normal probability distribution, though not a requirement on a sample drawn from a normal distribution; samples may be asymmetric, may have mean differ from median and so on. \\[We can, however, get an idea how far apart we might reasonably expect them to be if the sample really came from a normal population.]\n\n> all the data must be contained under the bell curve\n\nI am not sure what \"contained under\" means in this sense.\n\n> and perfectly symmetrical around the mean.\n\nNo; you're talking about the *data* here, and a sample from a (definitely symmetrical) normal population would not itself be perfectly symmetric.\n\nHere's some simulated samples from normal distributions:\n\n[![Histograms of 9 samples of size 60 from a normal distribution with population mean 50 and population  standard deviation 5](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zuhk2.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zuhk2.png)\n\nIf you generate a number of samples of about that sample size (60\\) and plot histograms with about 10 bins, you may see similar variation in general shape.\n\nAs you can see from the histograms, these are not actually symmetric. Some, like 2, 4 and 7, are quite distinctly *asymmetrical*. Some have quite short tails, like 5 and 8, some have noticeably longer tails, at least on one side. Some suggest multiple modes. None actually look all that close to what an actual normal density looks like $\\-$ that is, even random samples don't necessarily look all that much like their populations, at least not until the sample sizes are fairly large $\\-$ considerably larger than the n\\=60 I used here.\n\n> Therefore, technically, there are virtually NO normal distributions in real studies,\n\nI [agree with your conclusion](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/204471/is-there-an-explanation-for-why-there-are-so-many-natural-phenomena-that-follow/204479#204479) but the reasoning is not correct; it's not a consequence of the fact that *data* are not perfectly symmetric (etc); it's the fact that *populations* are themselves not [perfectly normal](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/57407/what-is-the-meaning-of-all-models-are-wrong-but-some-are-useful).\n\n> if the skew/kurtosis are less than 1\\.0 it is a normal distribution\n\nIf she said this in just that way, she's definitely wrong.\n\nA sample skewness may be much closer to 0 than that (taking \"less than\" to mean in absolute magnitude not actual value), and the sample excess kurtosis may also be much closer to 0 than that (they might even, whether by chance or construction, potentially be almost exactly zero), and yet the distribution from which the sample was drawn might be distinctly non\\-normal (e.g. bimodal, or clearly asymmetric, or perhaps with somewhat heavier tails than the normal $\\-$ it's not *just* the tail that determines kurtosis)\n\nWe can go further \\-\\- even if we were to magically know the *population* skewness and kurtosis were exactly that of a normal, it still wouldn't of itself tell us the population was normal, nor even something close to normal.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n[![double gamma, shape parameter 2.302776](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNWV9.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNWV9.png)\n\nThis particular example is strongly bimodal, heavier tailed than the normal, but symmetric. It has the same skewness and kurtosis as the normal.\n\nFurther examples can be found in [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/154965/805) answer.\n\nNot all are symmetric, and some are discrete.\n\n> The dataset is total number of falls/year in a random sampling of 52 nursing homes which is a random sample of a larger population.\n\nThe population distribution of counts are *never* normal. Counts are discrete and non\\-negative, normal distributions are continuous and over the entire real line.\n\nBut we're really focused on the wrong issue here. Probability models are just that, *models*. Let us not [confuse our models with the real thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(mythology)).\n\nThe issue isn't \"are the *data themselves* normal?\" (they can't be), nor even \"is the population from which the data were drawn normal?\" (this is almost never going to be the case).\n\nA more useful question to discuss is \"how badly would my inference be impacted if I treated the population as normally distributed?\"\n\nThat is we should not be overly focused on whether the assumption is *true* (we shouldn't expect that), but whether it's useful, or perhaps what and how severe might the consequences be if we were to use such a model.\n\nIt's also a much harder question to answer well, and may require considerably more work than glancing at a few simple diagnostics.\n\nThe sample statistics you showed are not particularly inconsistent with normality (you could see statistics like that or \"worse\" not terribly rarely if you had random samples of that size from normal populations), but that doesn't of itself mean that the actual population from which the sample was drawn is automatically \"close enough\" to normal for some particular purpose. It would be important to consider the purpose (what questions you're answering), and the robustness of the methods employed for it, and even then we may still not be sure that it's \"good enough\"; sometimes it may be better to simply not assume what we don't have good reason to assume *a priori* (e.g. on the basis of experience with similar data sets).\n\n> it is NOT a normal distribution\n\nData \\- even data drawn from a normal population \\- never have exactly the properties of the population; from those numbers alone you don't have a good basis to conclude that the population is not normal here.\n\nOn the other hand neither do we have any reasonably solid basis to say that it's \"sufficiently close\" to normal \\- we haven't even considered the purpose of assuming normality, so we don't know what distributional features it might be sensitive to.\n\nFor example, if I had two samples for a measurement that was bounded, that I knew would not be heavily discrete (not mostly only taking a few distinct values) and reasonably near to symmetric, I might be relatively happy to use a two\\-sample t\\-test at some not\\-so\\-small sample size; it's moderately robust to mild deviations from the assumptions (somewhat level\\-robust, somewhat less power\\-robust). But I would be considerably more cautious about as causally assuming normality when testing equality of spread, for example, because the best test under that assumption is quite sensitive to the assumption.\n\n> Because they are both between the critical values of \\-1 and \\+1, this data is considered to be normally distributed.\"\n\nIf that's really the criterion by which one decides to use a normal distributional model, then it will sometimes lead you into quite poor analyses.\n\nThe values of those statistics do give us some clues about the population from which the sample was drawn, but that's not at all the same thing as suggesting that their values are in any way a 'safe guide' to choosing an analysis.\n\nCast your mind back to the fact that there's distributional examples where the population has very different shape from the normal, but with the same *population* skewness and kurtosis. Add to that the inherent noise in their sample equivalents (and not least of all, the considerable downbias typical of sample kurtosis), and you may well be concluding rather too much on very limited and possibly misleading evidence.\n\n---\n\nNow to address the underlying issue with even a better phrased version of such a question as the one you had:\n\nThe whole process of looking at a sample to choose a model is fraught with problems \\-\\- doing so alters the properties of any subsequent choices of analysis based on what you saw! e.g for a hypothesis test, your significance levels, p\\-values and power are all *not what you would choose/calculate them to be*, because those calculations are predicated on the analysis not being based on the data.\n\nSee, for example Gelman and Loken (2014\\), \"[The Statistical Crisis in Science](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-statistical-crisis-in-science),\" *American Scientist*, Volume 102, Number 6, p 460\n(DOI: 10\\.1511/2014\\.111\\.460\\) which discusses issues with such data\\-dependent analysis."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation and guidelines, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing the distribution of falls in nursing homes and wants to determine if the data can be considered normally distributed for statistical analysis purposes.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The data itself cannot be \"normally distributed\" as it's a sample, not a population. We can only infer about the underlying population distribution.\n\n2. While the skewness and kurtosis values fall within -1 to +1, this alone is not sufficient to conclude normality (ruling out option A). These values are compatible with normal distributions but also with some non-normal distributions.\n\n3. The unequal mean, median, and mode do not automatically disqualify the data from being from a normal population (ruling out B), as sample statistics often differ from population parameters due to random variation.\n\n4. Sample size alone doesn't guarantee normality (ruling out D). The central limit theorem applies to means of samples, not individual samples themselves.\n\n5. The fact that this data represents counts (falls per year) suggests the underlying population is likely not truly normal, as counts are discrete and non-negative.\n\n6. To determine if a normal approximation is appropriate, we'd need to consider:\n   - The purpose of the analysis (some methods are more robust to non-normality than others)\n   - Visual inspection of the data (e.g., Q-Q plots, histograms)\n   - Additional goodness-of-fit tests\n   - The nature of the variable (counts often follow other distributions like Poisson)\n\nTherefore, while the data shows some characteristics compatible with normality, we can't conclusively determine if it's appropriate to treat it as normal without more information and context about the planned analysis.

The correct approach involves a combination of strategies:\n\n1. For adding a label near the first price, the best practice is to create a new template file (e.g., price-label.phtml) rather than modifying the core price-box.js file. This approach maintains better separation of concerns and is less likely to cause conflicts during Magento updates.\n\n2. To display the discount percentage, overriding final_price.phtml is the recommended method. This allows for the calculation of the percentage discount based on the original and final prices, and provides a suitable location to insert the percentage display without modifying core files.\n\nOption A is incorrect because modifying amount/default.phtml is not the best location for discount percentage calculations and may affect other price displays unintentionally.\n\nOption C introduces unnecessary complexity by creating a custom price model, which is overkill for this requirement.\n\nOption D is suboptimal as it concentrates too much logic in a single template file, reducing modularity and potentially complicating future maintenance.\n\nThe correct answer (B) represents the most maintainable and Magento-aligned approach to achieving both customization goals while adhering to best practices for theme development and overrides in Magento 2."}, "77": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/10/02", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/405294", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/49284/"], "docs_id": 405294, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Motivation**\n\nThe notion of uniform integrability is important for formulating the Vitali convergence theorem. Unfortunately, different authors define uniform integrability differently, which causes quite a lot of confusion, as evident in the number of questions about uniform integrability and Vitali convergence theorem in [MSE](https://math.stackexchange.com/search?q=uniform+integrability+vitali+convergence+theorem). However, after reading many of those questions and the answers, I feel that many students are still confused. In this post, I want to clear all the confusion once and for all.\n\n**Definitions**\n\nThroughout this post, I would use the following definitions.\n\nLet $(X, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mu)$ be a measure space and $\\\\Phi$ a collection of measurable functions on $(X, \\\\mathcal{F})$, taking values in the extended real line.\n\n1. We say $\\\\Phi$ is **uniformly bounded in $L^1$** if\n$$ \\\\sup\\_{f \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\int\\_X \\|f\\| d\\\\mu \\< \\\\infty $$\n2. We say $\\\\Phi$ **does not escape to vertical infinity** if for any $\\\\epsilon \\> 0$, there exists $M \\> 0$ such that\n$$\\\\sup\\_{f \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\int\\_{\\|f\\| \\\\geq M} \\|f\\| d\\\\mu \\< \\\\epsilon $$\n3. We say $\\\\Phi$ **does not escape to width infinity** if for any $\\\\epsilon \\> 0$, there exists $m \\> 0$ such that\n$$\\\\sup\\_{f \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\int\\_{\\|f\\| \\\\leq m} \\|f\\| d\\\\mu \\< \\\\epsilon $$\n4. We call $\\\\Phi$ **equi\\-integrable** if for any $\\\\epsilon \\> 0$, there exists $\\\\delta \\> 0$ such that whenever $A \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}$ is a measurable set with $\\\\mu(A) \\< \\\\delta$, we have\n$$\\\\sup\\_{f \\\\in \\\\Phi} \\\\int\\_A \\|f\\| d\\\\mu \\< \\\\epsilon $$\n5.

Measure theory textbooks usually define uniform integrability as being equi\\-integrable.\n2. Probability theory textbooks usually define uniform integrability as not escaping to vertical infinity.\n3. In [Tao's blog post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/245a-notes-4-modes-of-convergence/), uniform integrability was defined as being uniformly bounded in $L^1$, not escaping to vertical infinity and not escaping to width infinity.\n4. Yet some other authors define uniform integrability as being uniformly bounded in $L^1$ and equi\\-integrable.\n\nWhat adds to more confusion is, the different definitions of uniform integrability are only equivalent under certain assumptions, while in general they are not equivalent. Moreover, different authors formulate the Vitali convergence theorem under different definitions of uniform integrability.\n\n**Claim**\n\nIt is well\\-known that if $\\\\mu$ is a finite measure, then $\\\\Phi$ does not escape to vertical infinity if and only if it is uniformly bounded in $L^1$ and equi\\-integrable. For the general case, I would like to propose the following claim. To avoid confusion, I would avoid the term \"uniformly integrable\" altogether.\n\n> Let $(X, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mu)$ be a measure space and $\\\\Phi$ a collection\n> of measurable functions on $(X, \\\\mathcal{F})$, taking values in the\n> extended real line. We do not make any other assumption on $\\\\mu$ or $\\\\Phi$.\n> Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n> \n> \n> 1. $\\\\Phi$ is uniformly bounded in $L^1$, does not escape to vertical infinity and does not escape to width infinity\n> 2. $\\\\Phi$ does not escape to vertical infinity and is tight\n> 3. $\\\\Phi$ is uniformly bounded in $L^1$, equi\\-integrable and tight\n> \n> \n> Now, let $(f\\_n)$ be a sequence of measurable functions and $f$ another\n> measurable function on $(X, \\\\mathcal{F})$. Suppose that:\n> \n> \n> 1. the collection $\\\\Phi \\= \\\\{f\\_n : n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\}$ satisfies any one of the equivalent conditions above,\n> 2. the sequence $(f\\_n)$ converges to $f$ either almost everywhere or in measure,\n> \n> \n> then we have $f \\\\in L^1(\\\\mu)$, and $(f\\_n)$ converges to $f$ in\n> $L^1(\\\\mu)$.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. Is my claim correct?\n2. Is there any book or paper that makes a concerted effort to clear the confusion around uniform integrability and Vitali convergence theorem?\n\n*Edit:*\n3\\. [Iosif Pinelis' answer](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/405294/confusion-around-uniform-integrability-and-vitali-convergence-theorem/405336#405336) gives an counter\\-example in which a sequence of functions is uniformly bounded in $L^1$, does not escape to vertical infinity, and does not escape to width infinity. However, the sequence is neither equi\\-integrable nor tight. So how to connect [Tao's definition of uniform integrability](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4042711/different-definition-of-uniform-integrability) with equi\\-integrability and tightness?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Edge matching problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge-matching_puzzle), such as the [Eternity II puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_II_puzzle) are NP\\-complete.

Here are some discussions of the quustion in various reference works.\n\nFrom Mitford Mathews, *A Dictionary of Americanisms on Historical Principles* (1951\\):\n\n> **gee string**, a breechclout or breech\\-cloth. Also **G\\-string**. \\[Cited occurrences:] **1878** BEADLE *Western Wilds* 249 Around each boy's waist is the tight geestring from which a single strip of cloth runs between the limbs from front to back. **1891** *Harper's Mag\\[azine]* Dec. 36/2 Some of the boys wore only 'G\\-strings' (as for some reason the breech\\-clout is commonly called on the prairie). **1948** *Time* 5 April 12/3 The American Airlines' lost \\& found department was looking interestedly for whatever party had lost a case of beer, an automatic back\\-scratcher, three burlesque\\-type G\\-strings, a strait jacket.\n\nFrom Don Wilmeth, *The Language of American Popular Entertainment: A Glossary of Argot, Slang and Terminology* (1981\\):\n\n> **G\\-string:** A thin strip of cloth passed between the legs of a stripteasrs and supported by a waist cord or band. Ann Corio claims that the term was originated by early striptease artist Carrie Finnell. Presumably, when she tossed the apparatus on her dressing table one night it fell in the shape of a \"G.\" *see* CHICAGO G\\-STRING \\[the entry for which reads \"An especially revealing type of G\\-string used by strippers which is sewn to an elastic band in a manner that allows \"the bauble to fly\" and reveal pudendum underneath.\"]\n\nFrom Robert Chapman, *New Dictionary of American Slang* (1986\\):\n\n> **gee string** or **G\\-string** ***n phr*** or ***n*** *fr middle 1800s* A breech\\-cloth, or brief covering for the genitals, worn especially by striptease dancers: *Thus the* G\\-string *became an integral part of a stripper's apparatus* \u2014Toronto Life {origin unknown}\n\nFrom Barbara Kipfer \\& Robert Chapman, *Dictionary of American Slang*, fourth edition (2005\\):\n\n> **G\\-string** or **gee string** ***n phr*** or ***n*** A breechcloth, or brief covering for the genitals, worn esp by striptease dancers \\[citation omitted] {1878\\+; origin unknown; the dated use refers to Plains Indian use of a loincloth; the stripper sense is found in the 1930s}\n\nFrom Robert Hendrickson, *The QPB Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins*, fourth edition (2008\\):\n\n> **G\\-string** Stripteasers, who sometimes call this a \"gadget,\" aren't responsible for the word. *G\\-string* is an Americanism first used to describe an Indian's loin cloth or breechclout in the 19th century. It could be that some fiddler in the West compared the heaviest of violin strings, the G string, to the length of sinew or gut the Indians tied around their waists to hold up their breechclouts. But even the heavies of violin strings wouldn't really do the job. Perhaps the g i is just a euphemistic shortening of \"groin,\" an indecent word at the time. The burlesque G\\-string is of course far smaller than the Indian variety and must have seemed even skimpier a century ago, considering the Brunhildean builds of yesterday's ecdysiasts. One burlesque company of the day proudly advertised \"two tons of women\" and had only 20 strippers.\n\nSo your question about the origin of *G\\-string* might actually be separated into three distinct questions: (1\\) why did U.S. settlers on the Great Plains in the 1870s call the rawhide band used to hold a Native American's loincloth in place a \"geestring\"? (2\\) why did U.S. dance\\-art enthusiasts call the genital covering used by striptease artists a *G\\-string*? (3\\) what connection is there between the nineteenth\\-century \"gee string\" and the 1930s\u2013present \"G\\-string\"?\n\nI will run some database searches into those questions and add to this answer if I find anything interesting.\n\n---\n\n***On the transition from 'geestring' to G\\-string'***\n\nWith regard to the question of the connection between *geestring* and *G\\-string*, it is noteworthy that *G string* appears as early as 1881 as spelling variant for *geestring*. From \"[Society Report](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84021913/1881-07-16/ed-1/seq-2/#words=%22a+G+string%22+%22a+g+string%22+%22a+g+string%22),\" in the *\\[Globe City] Arizona Silver Belt* (July 16, 1881\\):\n\n> Mrs. Natch\\-il\\-a\\-tilly was magnificently attired with a **g string** around her waist with some suggestions of faded magnificence suspended therefrom.\n\nAs for the transition between *geestring* as a breechclout and **G\\-string** as striptease accoutrement, a newspaper instance of \"gee string\" from 1921 may provide a missing link. From \"[Fringe Sewed on Beach Queens Who Lack Conscience](https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=CJ19210820.2.8&txq=%2522gee+string%2522),\" in the *\\[Coronado, California] Strand* (August 20, 1921\\):\n\n> Chicago.\u2014Censors at the bathing beaches in Chicago, just now densely populated with gay crowds have solved the problem of dealing with girls who are a trifle shy on clothes.

Here's a question based on the provided documentation about the G-string:\n\nQuestion: A linguistic historian is researching the evolution of the term \"G-string\" in American English. Based on the information provided, which of the following statements most accurately describes the term's development and usage?\n\nA) The term originated in burlesque shows of the 1930s and was later adopted to describe Native American loincloths.\n\nB) It first appeared as \"geestring\" in the 1870s referring to Native American garments, then transitioned to \"G-string\" in burlesque by the 1930s.\n\nC) The term was coined by striptease artist Carrie Finnell and has no connection to earlier Native American clothing.\n\nD) It began as a musical term referring to violin strings before being applied to both Native American and burlesque garments simultaneously.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation shows a clear chronological progression of the term. It first appeared as \"geestring\" in the 1870s, specifically referring to Native American loincloths or breechcloths. The earliest cited occurrence is from 1878 in \"Western Wilds.\" The term then evolved, with \"G-string\" appearing as a variant spelling as early as 1881. By the 1930s, the term had transitioned to refer to the minimal garment worn by striptease dancers, as evidenced by the 1935 newspaper article from the Breckenridge American. This evolution demonstrates how the term migrated from describing Native American clothing to becoming associated with burlesque performances, while maintaining a similar meaning of a minimal covering. The other options either reverse this chronology, suggest an unsubstantiated origin, or propose a connection to music that isn't supported by the primary evidence presented in the documentation."}, "80": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/11/11", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/200350", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/30449/"], "docs_id": 200350, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it safe to use thin sections of copper traces as one\\-shot fuses when cost is important, but when it is also vital to protect the rest of the circuitry?

The trace should not be exposed. An exposed trace will be subject to contamination, possibly conductive contamination, which changes the amount of conductor you designed for a certain current. Admittedly a minor concern, but I don't see any pros for exposing the trace.\n\nThe above board was designed with pads to replace the fuse, it's from a car stereo system so they're likely expecting shorts downstream rather than surges from upstream. Having exposed pads for the latter case would be less desirable as a surge might burn the fuse and leave a conductive creepage path between the pads.\n\n[This paper](http://www.ultracad.com/articles/fusingr.pdf) explores and provides calculations for determining trace size for a printed fuse with a variety of copper weights.\n\nA salient point from the paper, in case it isn't always available is the approximation for the time in seconds (\\\\$ t \\\\$) before a trace reaches melting temperature given current passing through it (\\\\$I\\\\$) and its cross sectional area in mils squared (\\\\$A\\\\$):\n\n$$t \\= 0\\.0346 \\\\times {{A}\\\\over{I}}^2$$\n\nNote that this is the approximate time to *melt* the copper given a 20\u00b0C ambient temperature.

Keeping the trace covered prevents contamination that could alter its current-carrying capacity, which is crucial for predictable fusing behavior. Using the provided formula (t = 0.0346 \u00d7 (A/I)\u00b2) allows for a more precise calculation of the time it takes for the trace to reach melting temperature, enabling better design decisions. Adding pads for potential replacement, as seen in the car stereo example, provides a means for repair if necessary. This approach balances cost-effectiveness with protection reliability, addresses contamination concerns, incorporates mathematical modeling for performance prediction, and allows for potential repair - all key considerations mentioned in the documentation.

You could have 10 variables that each individually account for 90% of the variance, but if that is the same 90% of the variance then that may not be interesting to you. Performing regression with L1 and/or L2 norms can help you to identify variables or groups of variables that correlate well with your data.

They have 32 variables from an original survey and want to select 10 that best represent overall wealth. Which approach would be most effective in identifying the optimal set of variables while addressing potential multicollinearity and redundancy issues?\n\nA) Perform stepwise regression using the full set of 32 variables and select the top 10 with the highest individual R-squared values\nB) Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on all 32 variables and choose the 10 with the highest factor loadings on the first component\nC) Apply Lasso regression with cross-validation to select 10 variables that best predict the wealth index derived from all 32 variables\nD) Use Random Forest feature importance ranking and select the top 10 variables based on their Gini importance scores\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts related to feature selection and wealth index creation. Option C, using Lasso regression, is the most effective approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is specifically designed for feature selection, which aligns with the goal of choosing 10 out of 32 variables.\n\n2. It addresses multicollinearity issues, which are likely present in household asset data, by encouraging sparsity and effectively eliminating redundant variables.\n\n3. Cross-validation helps ensure the selected variables generalize well to new data, reducing overfitting risk.\n\n4. Lasso considers the joint predictive power of variables, unlike option A which looks at individual R-squared values.\n\n5. It directly optimizes for predicting the wealth index, unlike PCA (option B) which focuses on explaining variance without considering the target variable.\n\n6. While Random Forest (option D) can rank feature importance, it doesn't inherently perform feature selection and may not account for redundancies as effectively as Lasso.\n\nThis approach balances statistical rigor with practical implementation, addressing the researcher's need for a shorter questionnaire while maximizing the explanatory power of the selected variables."}, "82": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/11/12", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/338774", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/117834/"], "docs_id": 338774, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using enumerate environment to create a list of answers on tasks in my book where item label is a number of a task.

This will call the product view configurable template into your list.\n\n```xml\n  <referenceBlock name=\"category.products.list\">\n            <block class=\"Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Block\\Product\\View\\Type\\Configurable\" name=\"category.product.configurable\" as=\"configurable_options\"  template=\"Magento_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml\" />\n</referenceBlock>\n\n```\n\nYou will need to do the same for catalogsearch\\_result\\_index.xml as the xml is different for search results though uses the same catalog list template\n\n```xml\n <referenceBlock name=\"search_result_list\">\n            <block class=\"Magento\\ConfigurableProduct\\Block\\Product\\View\\Type\\Configurable\" name=\"category.product.configurable\" as=\"configurable_options\"  template=\"Magento_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml\" />\n </referenceBlock>\n\n```\n\nNow we have this you need to overide the Magento\\_Catalog::product/list/view/type/options/configurable.phtml template again in the theme or module, you then need to make it look like the below.\n\n```php\n<?php\n/**\n * Copyright \u00a9 Magento, Inc.

Here's why:\n\n1. Creating a custom module with a plugin for ConfigurableProduct is necessary to modify the behavior of the \"Add to Cart\" functionality for configurable products in the list view.\n\n2. Adding custom layout XML (both catalog_category_view.xml and catalogsearch_result_index.xml) is crucial to inject the configurable options block into the category and search result pages.\n\n3.

Which combination of techniques would be most effective for achieving this goal while avoiding common pitfalls in motion depiction?\n\nA) Using multiple static images of the character with motion lines, but no blurring effects\nB) Implementing smear frames with exaggerated distortions and adding motion blur in post-processing\nC) Creating a series of ghosting images with decreasing opacity and incorporating subtle motion lines\nD) Applying a uniform blur effect to the entire character and adding speed lines to the background\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from animation techniques. The correct answer, C, combines several effective methods for depicting motion:\n\n1. Ghosting images: This technique creates multiple semi-transparent copies of the character, which helps convey the path of motion.\n2. Decreasing opacity: By reducing the opacity of each ghost image, it creates a sense of fading, enhancing the illusion of movement.\n3. Subtle motion lines: These add to the sense of direction and speed without overwhelming the visual.\n\nThis combination provides a balance between conveying rapid motion and maintaining visual clarity. It avoids common pitfalls such as:\n\n- Option A relies too heavily on static images and motion lines, which may not effectively convey the sense of speed for a fast-moving character.\n- Option B's use of smear frames with exaggerated distortions might be too extreme and potentially unclear, especially when combined with heavy motion blur.\n- Option D's uniform blur could make the character difficult to discern, and relying solely on background speed lines might not effectively convey the character's motion.\n\nThe question tests the ability to integrate multiple animation concepts, consider their real-world application in game design, and critically evaluate the effectiveness of different techniques in achieving a specific visual goal."}, "88": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/01/10", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/8805839", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/278521/"], "docs_id": 8805839, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to set environment variable in linux and did the same by giving command\n\n```\n export PATH=$PATH:.\n\n```\n\nBut getting error Bad : modifier in $ (.).\n\nCan some one help this.\nI tried with bash shell and ksh\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n```\nBad : modifier in $ (.).\n\n```\n\nThis is not a [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) error, nor is it from [Ksh](http://www.kornshell.com/): it's from C\\-shell or one of its clones such as [Tcsh](http://www.tcsh.org/Home).\n\nYou want:\n\n```\nsetenv PATH ${PATH}:.\n\n```\n\nBut you should not put `.` in your `${PATH}`, it's a well\\-known security risk."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A junior developer is setting up a new Linux environment and wants to add the current directory to their PATH.

I can figure out the centre of Normal Reaction but not how it's distributed over the surface.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have to consider the elastic properties of the contact to determine the distribution of forces. Actually, it is the distribution of pressure you are interested, since you sum up the pressures to get force, and sum of the moment of pressure to get torque. Imagine a contact area with the center is on the contact point, the *z*\\-axis normal to the contact, and the *xy* plane along the contact.\n\n$$ \\\\begin{aligned}\n F\\_z \\& \\= \\\\int P(x,y) \\\\, {\\\\rm d} A \\\\\\\\\n M\\_x \\& \\= \\\\int (\\-y) P(x,y) \\\\,{\\\\rm d} A \\\\\\\\\n M\\_y \\& \\= \\\\int (\\+x) P(x,y)\\\\, {\\\\rm d} A\n\\\\end{aligned} $$\n\nSo given a pressure distribution $P(x,y)$ you can find the forces, but how to get the pressure distribution? \n\nThe most basic example is an object pushing on a flat plane. Consider the case where there is a known overlap amount $a(x,y)$ as a function of location on the contact\n\n![overlap](https://i.imgur.com/FDcm2Lc.png)\n\nAs a result, the surface of the object (red curve) must deform by $\\\\delta(x,y)$ in order to conform to the overlap. Surface pressure (yellow curve) must be applied to the object to do this\n\n![pressure](https://i.imgur.com/BQHR15q.png)\n\nThe pressure deflection relationship was developed by [Boussinesq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics#Point_contact_on_a_(3D)_half-space) and it looks like this\n\n$$ \\\\delta(x,y) \\= \\\\frac{1\\-\\\\nu^2}{\\\\pi E} \\\\iint \\\\frac{P(u,v)}{r} {\\\\rm d} A $$ \n\nwhere $r\\=\\\\sqrt{(x\\-u)^2\\+(y\\-v)^2}$ and $\\\\nu$ is the [Poisson's ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio) of the material and $E$ is the [Elastic modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus).\n\nA special case for the above is the [Hertzian contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics#Classical_solutions_for_non-adhesive_elastic_contact) which deals with a sphere on a plane, sphere on a sphere, cylinder on a cylinder (2D contact) and general football shape (two radii) contact.\n\nThe general case can only be treated numerically with the contact are divided into a grid and a giant system of equations is developed of the form $\\\\delta\\_i \\= C\\_{i j} P\\_j$ (Hartnett solution).\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n1. Assume a certain amount of overlap $a(x,y)$ derived from the maximum penetration amount.\n2. Set the deflections equal to the overlap, and solve for the pressures $P(x,y)$.\n3. Calculate the total load and moments, and adjust the overlap accordingly. If the total load is less than the applied load then increase the overlap, and if the total moment is less than the applied torque then tilt the object\n4. If the forces and moments are still imbalanced, then go to step 2 and repeat until convergence has been achieved.\n\n---\n\nSee [this detailed paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768309003047) for one example on numerical contact analysis.

The most appropriate approach is C) Apply the Boussinesq equation and solve it numerically using a grid-based approach. Here's why:\n\n1. The problem involves a non-point contact between surfaces that are not perfectly matching (flat gripper, slightly curved component), which rules out simple point-contact models (eliminating option D).\n\n2. Assuming a uniform pressure distribution (option A) would be an oversimplification that doesn't account for the curved surface of the component or the elastic deformation at the contact point.\n\n3. While Hertzian contact theory (option B) is useful for specific geometries like sphere-on-plane, it's not the most accurate for this scenario with a flat surface contacting a slightly curved one.\n\n4. The Boussinesq equation, as described in the documentation, allows for modeling the pressure distribution over an arbitrary contact area. By discretizing the contact area into a grid and solving the equation numerically, we can account for:\n   - The actual geometry of the contacting surfaces\n   - Elastic deformation of both the gripper and the component\n   - Non-uniform pressure distribution that will likely occur due to the curved surface\n\nThis approach requires more computational effort but provides the most accurate representation of the pressure distribution, which is crucial for handling delicate components safely.

Consider the action by $G$ by conjugation on $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ (the space of subgroups of $G$, endowed with the Chabauty topology). Then the orbits of $G\\_0$ (connected component of 1\\) coincide with the connected components of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$.*\n\nAs a corollary, for $G$ a compact group, $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is totally disconnected if and only if $G\\_0$ is central in $G$ (equivalently, $G/Z(G)$ is totally disconnected), a result obtained in \\[FG]. More generally, it can be checked that for an arbitrary locally compact group $G$, $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is totally disconnected if and only if either totally disconnected, or $G$ is pointwise elliptic with $G\\_0$ central. ($G$ pointwise elliptic means that every single element generates a cyclic subgroup with compact closure.)\n\n**Lemma 2**\n*Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $F$ be a finite group. Then there are finitely many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $F\\\\to G$.*\n\n*Proof.*\nThe space $\\\\mathrm{Hom}(F,G)$ can be described as a real algebraic variety, so has finitely many components. By \\[LW], all homomorphisms in a given component are conjugate under $G\\_0$.\n\\\\end{proof}\n\n**Lemma 3**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $S$ be a connected compact semisimple Lie group. Then there are finitely many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $S\\\\to G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nThe space $\\\\mathrm{Hom}(S,G)$ is canonically identified with the space of Lie algebra homomorphisms $\\\\mathfrak{s}\\\\to\\\\mathfrak{g}$, which is an algebraic variety as well, so has finitely many connected components. So we can again use \\[LW].\n\n**Lemma 4**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $D$ be a connected compact abelian Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $D\\\\to G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nAny such homomorphism maps into a maximal torus, and all maximal tori are conjugate \\[Bourbaki, Groupes et Alg\u00e8bres de Lie, Chap 9, \u00a72\\.2]. This reduces to the case when $G$ is a torus, but then the result just follows from the fact that $\\\\mathrm{Hom}((\\\\mathbf{R}/\\\\mathbf{Z})^a,(\\\\mathbf{R}/\\\\mathbf{Z})^b)\\\\simeq\\\\mathbf{Z}^{ab}$, which is countable.\n\n**Lemma 5**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of closed connected subgroups in $G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nSince there are finitely many isomorphism types of compact semisimple groups in a given dimension, we can fix this type, so by Lemma 3, it is enough to consider the set of closed connected subgroups whose semisimple part is a given subgroup $S$. Therefore, it is enough to count conjugacy classes of closed abelian connected subgroups in $N(S)/S$, where $N(\\\\cdot)$ denotes the normalizer, and Lemma 4 applies. \n\n**Proposition 6**\nLet $G$ be a compact Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in $G$.\n\n*Proof.*\nBy Lemma 5, we can consider those subgroups for which $H\\_0\\=L$ is given. So it is enough to count conjugacy classes of finite subgroups in $N(L)/L$, there are countably many because of Lemma 2\\.\n\n*Proof of Proposition 1*\nWe begin with the case when $G$ is a Lie group. Since $G\\_0$ has finite index in $G$, Proposition 6 implies that there are countably many $G\\_0$\\-conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in $G$. Let $C$ be a connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$. Clearly, it is invariant under conjugation by $G\\_0$. We just obtained that the quotient of $C$ by the action of $G\\_0$ is countable. It is also a compact connected Hausdorff space, so is reduced to a point (it is Hausdorff because the acting group is compact, see \\[Bourbaki, Topologie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, III, \u00a74\\.1]. This means that $G\\_0$ acts transitively on each connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$, and we are done.\n\nNow let us deal with a general compact group $G$. (It is no longer true in general that the set of connected components of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ is countable). We write $G$ as a projective limit of compact Lie groups $G/K\\_i$. Clearly, if two elements $H,H'$ of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$ are conjugate under $G\\_0$, then they lie in the same component. Conversely, suppose they belong to the same connected component of $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)$. Then since $K\\_i$ is compact, the projection map $\\\\mathcal{S}(G)\\\\to\\\\mathcal{S}(G/K\\_i)$ is continuous. Because of the case of Lie groups, there exists $g\\_i\\\\in G\\_0$ such that $(g\\_iHg\\_i^{\\-1}K\\_i\\=H'K\\_i)$ (we use the fact that the inverse image of the unit component of $G/K\\_i$ is the unit component of $G$). Let $g$ be a limit point of $(g\\_i)$. If $h\\\\in H$, then $g\\_ihg\\_i^{\\-1}$ can be written as $h'\\_ik\\_i$ with $h'\\_i\\\\in H'$ and $k\\_i\\\\in K\\_i$. Necessarily $k\\_i\\\\to 1$, so $h'\\_i\\=g\\_ihg\\_i^{\\-1}k\\_i^{\\-1}$ also converges, necessarily to an element $h'$ of $H'$. We have $ghg^{\\-1}\\=h'$. This proves that $gHg^{\\-1}\\\\subset H'$, and the converse inclusion $g^{\\-1}H'g\\\\subset H'$ is strictly similar.\n\n\\[FG] S. Fisher, P. Gartside.

Which of the following statements best captures the relationship between the connected components of the space of subgroups S(G) of a compact group G and the action of G\u2080 (the connected component of the identity in G)?\n\nA) The connected components of S(G) are always countable, regardless of the structure of G.\nB) G\u2080 acts transitively on each connected component of S(G) if and only if G is a Lie group.\nC) The orbits of G\u2080 coincide with the connected components of S(G) for any compact group G.\nD) The number of G\u2080-conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in G determines the connectivity of S(G).\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C, as stated in Proposition 1 of the documentation. This result holds for any compact group G, not just Lie groups. The proposition states that for the action of G by conjugation on S(G), \"the orbits of G\u2080 (connected component of 1) coincide with the connected components of S(G).\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while this is true for compact Lie groups (as implied by Proposition 6), it's not necessarily true for all compact groups. The documentation explicitly states that \"It is no longer true in general that the set of connected components of S(G) is countable\" for non-Lie compact groups.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the result holds for all compact groups, not just Lie groups. The proof is given in two parts, first for Lie groups and then extended to general compact groups.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the number of conjugacy classes is related to the structure of S(G), it doesn't directly determine its connectivity. The key relationship is between the G\u2080 orbits and the connected components, not the number of conjugacy classes.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the relationship between G\u2080 actions and connectivity of S(G), the differences between Lie and non-Lie compact groups, and the significance of conjugacy classes in this context. It tests the ability to analyze and apply these concepts to a broader statement about the structure of compact groups and their subgroups."}, "99": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/02/11", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/386978", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/328314/"], "docs_id": 386978, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am making a program that tracks whether an employee has checked in on a software app that day. The employee can check in at any time, so long as they check in before their shift ends. If they don't check in, then a notification gets sent to their supervisor (where they might get in some trouble :) ). My question is how to best implement this considering that user shifts may change and some days they may be absent, so notifications shouldn't be sent.\n\nRight now I'm thinking about making a Shift table and assigning each user their own shift. In other words, each user has one shift, and each shift has one user. I could include it in the user table, but it's getting way too crowded. That way it can be edited easily. Maybe a second table where supervisors can save and load presets. But in this case, what type of data structure can I use to store excused absences and how can I store the days they work (Mon, Tues, Wed...)? Does their need to be another table just for approved absences? Can I just store the days in an array. I'm using postgresql, so this is possible.\n\nAnyway, those are my ideas. Do they seem reasonable to you, or can you think of a better way to do this? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An employee (or shift crew) works in a periodic shift, maybe an extra day outside the shift, and maybe some day not during the shift. Also holidays can be planned in advance.\n\nThe planning should be as comfortable as possible.\n\n* An employee group system (shift, better department) seems in order \\- a hierarchy.\n* Official days off \\- a manual List.\n* Shift times (your preset shift times) \\- a recipy like mon\\-fri from jan 2 alternately 06:00 \\- 15:00 or 14:00 \\- 23:00\\.\n\nThen planned exception per employee:\n\n* Annual holidays\n* Leaves\n* Extra shifts \\- when they are to be reported\n\nFrom these data one may dynamically derive a day\\-by\\-day pattern.\n***This seems better maintainable than storing the day\\-by\\-day pattern.***\n\nProbably one also has to register the exceptions to the employees presences.\n\nThis is a bit more work.\n\nOne of the first things to do:\n\n* A final overview per employee\n* Overviews of the groups, shift times etc.\n\nOf course all is a bit harder on the data definition side: a detailed concept must be created *in advance* (important).

The system needs to accommodate variable shift schedules, excused absences, and send notifications to supervisors for missed check-ins. Which of the following database design approaches would best balance flexibility, maintainability, and performance for this system?\n\nA) Create a single table with columns for employee ID, shift times, work days, and absence dates, using array data types to store multiple values\n\nB) Implement separate tables for employees, shifts, and absences, with a day-by-day pattern stored for each employee's schedule\n\nC) Use a hierarchical structure with tables for employee groups, shift templates, and exception records, dynamically deriving daily schedules\n\nD) Store all data in a JSON format within a single table, using document queries to retrieve and update employee schedules\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate solution for this complex scheduling system. It offers several advantages:\n\n1. Flexibility: The hierarchical structure allows for easy management of employee groups (departments or shifts) and shift templates, accommodating variable schedules.\n\n2. Maintainability: By storing shift templates and exceptions rather than day-by-day patterns, the system reduces redundant data and makes it easier to update recurring schedules.\n\n3. Scalability: This approach can handle a large number of employees and complex scheduling patterns without significant performance issues.\n\n4. Exception handling: It easily accommodates holidays, leaves, and extra shifts as exceptions to the regular schedule.\n\n5. Dynamic scheduling: Daily schedules can be derived on-the-fly, ensuring up-to-date information without the need to update a static schedule constantly.\n\nOption A, while simple, lacks the flexibility to handle complex scheduling scenarios and would be difficult to maintain. Option B, storing day-by-day patterns, would be less efficient and harder to update for recurring schedules. Option D, using a single JSON table, would sacrifice query performance and make it challenging to enforce data integrity.\n\nThe chosen solution (C) aligns with the top answer's recommendation to use a more structured approach with separate entities for employee groups, shift times, and planned exceptions. This design supports easier maintenance, better scalability, and more efficient data retrieval for the check-in system."}}
