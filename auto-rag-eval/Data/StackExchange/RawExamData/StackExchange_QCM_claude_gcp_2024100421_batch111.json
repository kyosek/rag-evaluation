However, the level often ends before that, once the enemies in the village have been killed, before the Big Spiders and Cannons are even spawned.\n\nSimilarly, in the first level of Kronor, *Area 5100*, the level is supposed to end after you enter the tunnel and kill all the aliens, then pick up the minigun that materializes. However, the level keeps ending early, after the other monsters outside are killed (and before the prisoners are even freed).\n\n---\n\nLater, while playing **Serious Sam: Next Encounter** (GameCube), I notice the same behavior in a couple of the bonus levels.\n\nIn *The Silk Road*, there is a gauntlet in which you fight numerous monsters, then at one point, you get in the combine to mow down even more monsters. Eventually, you get to the gates of the palace and enter to end the level. However, the level often ends whether or not you reach the palace. It definitely ends if the combine is destroyed or runs out of fuel, but even if you get in then get out and an unknown amount of time passes.\n\nIn *The Geothermal Tunnels*, you are in the submarine, underwater. Whether or not you take damage, eventually the air/gas runs out so it makes some sense that the level would end at that point even if you have not reached the end, though it could just as easily kill you, thus *require* reaching the end to complete.\n\n---\n\nIf I ignore all the goodies, monsters, secrets, etc. and just go straight towards the end, I can get to it, but trying to get everything in the levels seems to cause this to happen. It seems as though there may be a timer of some sort, but if there is, where/when it is triggered or how long it has is unknown.\n\nAnother thing that they all have in common is that they all include vehicles, but then, there are other levels that include vehicles which do not exhibit this behavior.\n\nDoes anyone know what the trigger or triggers are for the levels or why they may be completing prematurely?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think this bug can be fixed by patching the game up to v2\\.070\\. You can download the patch from these sites: \n\n* [http://www.fileplanet.com/157668/150000/fileinfo/Serious\\-Sam\\-2\\-Patch\\-v2\\.070](http://www.fileplanet.com/157668/150000/fileinfo/Serious-Sam-2-Patch-v2.070)\n* [http://files.seriouszone.com/download.php?fileid\\=1093](http://files.seriouszone.com/download.php?fileid=1093)\n* [http://www.gamershell.com/download\\_13456\\.shtml](http://www.gamershell.com/download_13456.shtml)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the game Serious Sam II, players encountered a bug where levels would end prematurely.

This patch addresses the issue and allows players to complete levels as intended. Options A and B are not actual solutions, but rather workarounds that may sometimes allow players to reach the intended end of a level.

This approach addresses the Hindi font rendering issue in Chrome without completely removing the font files, which could be considered too drastic. The commands to implement this solution are:\n\nsudo mv /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf.backup\nsudo mv /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSans.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSans.ttf.backup\n\nThis method is based on a workaround suggested in a bug report for this specific issue, and it's less invasive than deleting the fonts entirely.

"answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the word list:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following words is NOT a verb in its base form, but rather a noun that can be mistaken for a verb due to its similarity to other common verbs?\n\nA) Yelp\nB) Yean\nC) Yawl\nD) Yoke\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) Yelp - Incorrect. \"Yelp\" is a verb meaning to give a short, sharp cry, especially of pain or alarm.\n\nB) Yean - Incorrect. \"Yean\" is a verb meaning to give birth to (a lamb).\n\nC) Yawl - Correct. \"Yawl\" is primarily a noun referring to a type of boat, specifically a two-masted sailboat. It can be mistaken for a verb due to its similarity to words like \"yell\" or \"yowl\", but it is not used as a verb in standard English.\n\nD) Yoke - Incorrect. \"Yoke\" can be used as a verb meaning to put a yoke on (an animal) or to join or link with another.\n\nThis question tests vocabulary knowledge, understanding of word forms, and the ability to distinguish between similar-sounding words with different grammatical functions. The correct answer requires recognizing that \"yawl\" is primarily a noun, unlike the other options which are commonly used as verbs."}, "5": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/03/04", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/484549", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/244373/"], "docs_id": 484549, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a shaver (Philips QP2530\\) which I would like to be able to charge via a USB outlet (in order to allow me to use it on a motorcycle ride from London to Tokyo, but that's another story!)\n\nThe shaver's standard power adapter output is 8 V and 100 mA DC\n\nWhat would happen if I connect the shaver to a regular USB outlet (5 V, 500 mA)?\n\nI calculate the shaver charger to be 0\\.8 W and the USB to be 2\\.5 W \\- but will the shaver only pull the wattage it needs as the voltage is higher?\n\nKeen to hear your thoughts!

Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The shaver can be directly plugged into the USB port and will charge normally, as USB provides more power than the original adapter.\n\nB) A step-up DC-DC converter is needed to boost the USB's 5V to the required 8V for the shaver to charge properly.\n\nC) The shaver will charge at a slower rate if connected directly to USB, but no additional components are needed.\n\nD) A linear voltage regulator should be used to drop the USB's 5V down to a safe level for the shaver.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The shaver requires 8V to charge properly, likely due to the internal configuration of its lithium-ion batteries. Connecting it directly to a 5V USB port would likely result in no charging at all. A step-up (boost) DC-DC converter is needed to increase the voltage from 5V to 8V while maintaining the necessary current. This allows the shaver to charge from a USB port during the trip.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the voltage is too low, even though the available current is higher.\nOption C is incorrect because the shaver likely won't charge at all with only 5V input.\nOption D is incorrect because a linear regulator can only step down voltage, not increase it."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/07/17", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/53437", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/21273/"], "docs_id": 53437, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I don't like the themes I have in my system (Xubuntu 11\\.04\\) by default.\n\n* Is [Xfce Look](http://xfce-look.org/) the only place where I can get new themes?\n* Can I run themes that are made for Gnome, for example?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can use gtk2 themes from [Gnome\\-Art](http://art.gnome.org/themes/gtk2) as well.\n\nSimilar websites:\n\n1.

For instance, I can define successor as the minimal cardinal greater than the given cardinal. \n\nObviously, I need to make some assumptions as to the basic cardinal arithmetics, so that it looks like the standard one in $ZFC$ \\+ (possibly) generalized continuum hypothesis. \n\nNow, assuming one has done all of the above, it appears that the \"small\" large cardinals, such as weak inaccessible, Mahlo, etc are definable in this theory (even in standard presentations, such as Drake, their definition is arithmetic ). \n\nBut what about the others, the heavy\\-weight ones? Do I necessarily have to resort to the ambient set theory ( stationary points, elementary embeddings, etc ) to talk about very large cardinals, or there is always a direct (algebraic/arithmetical/topological) way to provide their definition? \n\nPrima facie, it looks like the answer is no, but maybe there is a clever path to answer in the affirmative. Or perhaps, there is some kind of intrinsic boundary, beyond which you need to think of cardinals within the context of set theory\n\nAny thought, refs, or known fact? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most of the large cardinals have a variety of equivalent\nformulations in ZFC, and some of them are characterized by long\nlists of diverse equivalent properties. For a few examples, take a\nlook at the [Cantor's Attic](http://cantorsattic.info) entries for [weakly compact](http://cantorsattic.info/Weakly_compact),\n[strongly compact](http://cantorsattic.info/Strongly_compact) and [weakly measurable](http://cantorsattic.info/Weakly_measurable) cardinals.\n\nThere is a phenomenon, however, that in weaker set theories such\nas ZF some of these characterizations are no longer equivalent.\nFor example, one cannot expect to prove the embedding\ncharacterization of measurable cardinals from the ultrafilter\ncharacterization in ZF, since one needs the axiom of choice in\norder to establish the Los theorem on ultrapowers. A similar situation arises with most all of the larger large cardinals. There has been some work understanding the various large cardinals in ZF worlds, for example, under the axiom of determinacy, which implies that many successor cardinals including $\\\\omega\\_1$ are measurable according to the ultrafilter definition. \n\nSecondly, most of the largest large cardinals are defined by second order\nproperties, such as the existence of proper class objects, often\nembeddings of a particular kind. These definitions cannot be made\nin ZFC, which has no capacity for second\\-order quantifiers, but\nrather are usually made in G\u00f6del\\-Bernays set theory or\nKelly\\-Morse set theory. It turns out, however, that these\nsecond\\-order definitions in every case (except [Reinhardt\ncardinals](http://cantorsattic.info/Reinhardt#Reinhardt_cardinal)) have a first\\-order equivalent. For example, a cardinal $\\\\kappa$ is measurable if and only if\n(second\\-order) it is the critical point of an elementary embedding\n$j:V\\\\to M$, if and only if (first\\-order) there is a\n$\\\\kappa$\\-complete ultrafilter on $\\\\kappa$. These equivalences are\nnot provable in ZFC, and not even statable in ZFC, but are proved\nin GBC.\n\nMeanwhile, the theory $\\\\text{ZFC}^\\-$, meaning ZFC without the\npower set axiom (see my paper, [What is the theory of ZFC without\npower set axiom?](http://jdh.hamkins.org/what-is-the-theory-zfc-without-power-set/) for some subtleties about how to axiomatize\nthis theory properly) is sufficient to formalize the basic\nproperties of those large cardinals with a $\\\\Sigma\\_2$ definition,\nsuch as inaccessible, Mahlo, weakly compact, measurable,\nsuperstrong, Woodin and huge cardinals, whose existence is\nabsolute between $H\\_\\\\delta$ and $V$. Meanwhile, notions such as\ntall, strong and supercompact cardinals involve another quantifier\nthrough all the ordinals, which makes them not usually absolute\nbetween $H\\_\\\\delta$ and $V$.\n\nAlthough you seem to object to the embedding characterization of\nlarge cardinals, I would say that it is the embedding\ncharacterizations that have proved the most fruitful in their use\nand analysis. It is surely the embedding outlook that unifies an\nenormous part of the theory."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about large cardinal axioms in set theory is correct?\n\nA) All large cardinal axioms can be defined using only first-order logic within ZFC.\n\nB) The embedding characterizations of large cardinals have proven to be less useful than other formulations in developing the theory.\n\nC) In weaker set theories like ZF without the axiom of choice, all characterizations of large cardinals remain equivalent.\n\nD) Some large cardinal properties that are equivalent in ZFC may not be equivalent in weaker theories like ZF without choice.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because many of the largest large cardinals are defined using second-order properties that cannot be expressed in first-order ZFC.\n\nOption B is false.

There are lots of bugs you can catch early via code review. And there are certain types of bugs you can hardly catch any way else than code review (e.g. some concurrency bugs).

They show their real benefit only in the long term, so it takes perseverance to get there, and most managers (and developers alike) have never experienced it.\n2. In our current project, we have been doing it only occasionally up to now, but it is bound to change. The new aim is to get every code change reviewed by someone else before it gets into production. In an earlier project, we did that and it was useful. In an even earlier project, we did formal group code reviews, and it was still useful, but fairly slow and time consuming. We couldn't have reviewed every code change in that manner without slowing down our pace of development enormously. But for some types of projects, even that pays off.

Herman Wold, who invented *partial least squares (PLS)* approach, hasn't started using term *PLS* (or even mentioning term *partial*) right away. During the *initial period* (1966\\-1969\\), he referred to this approach as **NILES** \\- abbreviation of the term and title of his initial paper on this topic *Nonlinear Estimation by Iterative Least Squares Procedures*, published in 1966\\.\n\nAs we can see, procedures that later will be called partial, have been referred to as *iterative*, focusing on the iterative nature of the procedure of estimating weights and latent variables (LVs). The \"least squares\" term comes from using *ordinary least squares (OLS)* regression to estimate other unknown parameters of a model (Wold, 1980\\). It seems that the term **\"partial\"** has its roots in the NILES procedures, which implemented **\"the idea of split the parameters of a model into subsets so they can be estimated in parts\"** (Sanchez, 2013, p. 216; emphasis mine).\n\nThe first use of the term PLS has occurred in the paper *Nonlinear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS) estimation procedures*, which publication marks next period of PLS history \\- the *NIPALS modeling* period. 1970s and 1980s become the *soft modeling* period, when, influenced by Karl Joreskog's LISREL approach to SEM, Wold transforms NIPALS approach into soft modeling, which essentially has formed the core of the modern PLS approach (the term PLS becomes mainstream in the end of 1970s). 1990s, the next period in PLS history, which Sanchez (2013\\) calls \"gap\" period, is marked largely by decreasing of its use. Fortunately, starting from 2000s (*consolidation period*), PLS enjoyed its return as a very popular approach to SEM analysis, especially in social sciences.\n\n**UPDATE** (in response to amoeba's comment):\n\n* Perhaps, Sanchez's wording is not ideal in the phrase that I've cited. I think that \"estimated in parts\" applies to *latent* **blocks** of variables. Wold (1980\\) describes the concept in detail.\n* You're right that NIPALS was originally developed for PCA. The confusion stems from the fact that there exist both linear PLS and nonlinear PLS approaches. I think that Rosipal (2011\\) explains the differences very well (at least, this is the best explanation that I've seen so far).\n\n**UPDATE 2** (further clarification):\n\nIn response to concerns, expressed in amoeba's answer, I'd like to clarify some things. It seems to me that we need to distinguish the use of the word \"partial\" between NIPALS and PLS. That creates two separate questions about 1\\) the meaning of \"partial\" in NIPALS and 2\\) the meaning of \"partial\" in PLS (that's the original question by Phil2014\\). While I'm not sure about the former, I can offer further clarification about the latter.\n\nAccording to Wold, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and Eriksson (2001\\),\n\n> The \"partial\" in PLS indicates that this is a partial regression, since ...\n\nIn other words, \"partial\" stems from the fact that data *decomposition* by NIPALS algorithm for PLS may *not include all components*, hence \"partial\". I suspect that the same reason applies to NIPALS in general, if it's possible to use the algorithm on \"partial\" data. That would explain \"P\" in NIPALS.\n\nIn terms of using the word \"nonlinear\" in NIPALS definition (do not confuse with *nonlinear PLS*, which represents nonlinear variant of the PLS approach!), I think that it refers **not** to the *algorithm itself*, but to **nonlinear models**, which can be analyzed, using linear regression\\-based NIPALS.\n\n**UPDATE 3 (Herman Wold's explanation):**\n\nWhile Herman Wold's 1969 paper seems to be the earliest paper on NIPALS, I have managed to find another one of the earliest papers on this topic. That is a paper by Wold (1974\\), where the \"father\" of PLS presents his rationale for using the word \"partial\" in NIPALS definition (p. 71\\):\n\n> *3\\.1\\.4\\. NIPALS estimation: Iterative OLS.* If one or more variables of the model are latent, the predictor relations involve not only unknown\n>  parameters, but also unknown variables, with the result that the\n>  estimation problem becomes nonlinear. As indicated in 3\\.1 (iii),\n>  NIPALS solves this problem by an iterative procedure, say with steps s\n>  \\= 1, 2, ... Each step s involves a finite number of OLS regressions, one for each predictor relation of the model. Each such regression\n>  gives proxy estimates for a sub\\-set of the unknown parameters and\n>  latent variables (hence the name *partial* least squares), and these\n>  proxy estimates are used in the next step of the procedure to\n>  calculate new proxy estimates.\n\n**References**\n\nRosipal, R.

What you have is two uni\\-directional signals.\n\nRead up on [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) for an example of bi\\-directional signalling, where device pins can act as both inputs and outputs.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the level shifting requirements?\n\nA) A single bi-directional level shifter is required because the TX and RX signals are bi-directional.\nB) Two separate uni-directional level shifters are needed, one for TX and one for RX.\nC) No level shifter is required as ESP32 and 5V displays are usually compatible.\nD) A single bi-directional level shifter can be used, even though TX and RX are uni-directional signals.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While the TX and RX signals are uni-directional (TX from ESP32 to display, and RX from display to ESP32), a single bi-directional level shifter can still be used effectively. This is because each channel of a bi-directional level shifter can handle the conversion in either direction. The Sparkfun bi-directional logic level converter mentioned in the documentation is suitable for this application, especially at lower baud rates like 9600. It's important to note that while separate uni-directional shifters could also work (option B), they are not necessary, and the single bi-directional shifter is a more efficient solution. Option A is incorrect because it misunderstands the nature of the signals. Option C is incorrect as level shifting is indeed required between 3.3V and 5V logic levels."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/08", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/377419", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/224241/"], "docs_id": 377419, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm looking for a word that would describe someone's behaviour or personality which says that they enjoy it when things are fair.

Is this an example of entanglement swapping? Or in a broader sense is entanglement both time and space independent? Could someone try the impossible and help me understand the idea?\n\nRelated: [Entanglement in Time](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/27641/entanglement-in-time?rq=1)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The title of the article and the abstract of the article both say it is entanglement swapping and you described entanglement swapping, so it seems like entanglement swapping.\n\nThe authors also mention that one interpretation is the measuring the first particle on the first entangled pair steers the dynamics of the second pair. In fact, this is normal, if you have two maximally entangled particles and you measure one of them, you have now placed the other one into a definite state.\n\nSo effectively you have a photon in a definite polarization state and then you do a projection (measurement) onto a bell state. The result of the bell state measurement is to find out which bell state it is now in. And it performs an entanglement swap.\n\nIf the first pair were entangled to have the same polarization as was the second, then when you do a measurement of one of each pair into a bell state you entangle the other two.\n\nFor instance you could get a bell state where the two particles measured into the bell state have the same polarization so now the other two have the same as each other. If instead you get them in a bell state where they have opposing polarization then the other two now have opposite polarizations.\n\nThis should sound entirely undeep. And it isn't deep, it is a regular entanglement swap, and even the authors say that you can interpret it as the measurement of the first particle influencing the latter results. It isn't like the polarization measurement result on the first particle determined everything, it doesn't tell us which bell state you get, but if you did the experiment with matter then there is a well defined probability current and which part of the beam ends up where is influenced by \"irrelevant\" factors like if you adjust the spacing for the bell measurement to give an extra half wavelength to one of the paths to adjust which detector corresponds to which bell state.\n\nAnd all the interesting quantum correlations come not from a single measurement, but from correlations of different kinds of measurements on particles 1 and 4\\."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the experiment described, which of the following best explains the apparent entanglement between photons P1 and P4, despite them not coexisting in time?\n\nA) Quantum tunneling allows information to travel backwards in time\nB) Entanglement swapping occurs through the intermediate measurements of P2 and P3\nC) P1 and P4 are directly entangled through quantum superposition\nD) The experiment violates causality, allowing future events to influence past ones\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping, where the entanglement between P1 and P2 is transferred to P1 and P4 through intermediate measurements. This process doesn't require P1 and P4 to coexist in time. The measurement of P1 influences the state of P2, which then affects the Bell state measurement of P2 and P3, ultimately leading to the entanglement of P1 and P4.

The order within each group doesn't matter, but the positioning of the groups relative to each other does.\n\nTo find the probability, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose positions for one group (let's say the actresses) out of the total number of positions:\n\nTotal positions: 7 + 5 = 12\nPositions for actresses: 5\n\nThis can be represented as (12 choose 5), which equals 792.\n\nThe favorable outcome (all actresses in front) is just 1 out of these 792 possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/792.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this further:\n1/792 = 1/((12 choose 5)) = 1/66\n\nThus, the correct answer is B) 1/66.\n\nOption A is the unsimplified fraction.\nOption C (1/12) might result from misunderstanding the problem as simply choosing one group to be in front.\nOption D (5/12) could come from incorrectly dividing the number of actresses by the total number of people."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/05/16", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/346478", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/208485/"], "docs_id": 346478, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to change negative values to positive from my linear model.\n\nHere is my attempt:\n\n```\ndist <-\nc(2, 2.1, 2.21, 2.31, 2.41, 2.52, 2.62, 2.72, 2.83, 2.93, 3.03,\n3.14, 3.24, 3.34, 3.45, 3.55, 3.66, 3.76, 3.86, 3.97, 4.07, 4.17,\n4.28, 4.38, 4.48, 4.59, 4.69, 4.79, 4.9, 5)\n\naccuracy <-\nc(0.13, 1.21, 2, 0.78, 0.4, 1.47, 0.28, 2.18, 0.74, 0.51, 1.12,\n0.48, 1.71, 3.35, 1.36, 0.95, 0.78, 3.51, 0.24, 5, 3.25, 4.29,\n7.33, 4.12, 20.25, 7.05, 36.25, 2.78, 14.93, 13.45)\n\n> summary(lm(glm(log(accuracy)~log(dist))))\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = glm(log(accuracy) ~ log(dist)))\n\nResiduals:\n Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.57614 -0.72039  0.02401  0.56570  1.73818 \n\nCoefficients:\n        Estimate Std.

There is nothing wrong with this; that is what the line\\-of\\-best\\-fit for this model looks like. (If you really want to change the intercept estimate to be positive, you could change to a logarithmic scale with a small base, which would scale your intercept up by a corresponding constant. This would add nothing of substance to the analysis, and I would not recommend it.)\n\nRemember that a negative intercept on a log\\-scale still gives you a non\\-negative value for the underlying response variable. From your model you have the regression line:\n\n$$\\\\ln (\\\\hat{\\\\text{acc}}) \\= \\-3\\.7278 \\+ 3\\.6107 \\\\cdot \\\\ln(\\\\text{dist}).$$\n\nReversing the logarithm yields the corresponding regression equation:\n\n$$\\\\hat{\\\\text{acc}} \\= \\\\exp (\\-3\\.7278\\) \\\\cdot \\\\text{dist}^{3\\.6107} \\= 0\\.02404615 \\\\cdot \\\\text{dist}^{3\\.6107}.$$\n\nIn the case corresponding to the intercept term you have where $\\\\text{dist} \\= 1$ (so that $\\\\ln (\\\\text{dist}) \\= 0$) which gives $\\\\ln (\\\\hat{\\\\text{acc}}) \\= \\-3\\.7278$, so that the predicted response is $\\\\hat{\\\\text{acc}} \\= 0\\.02404615$.

You've identified that the journal logs are taking up a significant amount of space. Which combination of actions would be most effective in managing this issue while ensuring proper system functionality?\n\nA) Delete the entire /var/log/journal directory and restart the systemd-journald service\nB) Modify /etc/systemd/journald.conf to set SystemMaxUse=50M, delete files inside /var/log/journal/*, and restart the systemd-journald service\nC) Use journalctl --vacuum-size=50M to reduce log size, then kill the systemd-journald process\nD) Set MaxCrashReportsSize = 0 in /etc/abrt/abrt.conf and delete all files in /var/cache/abrt-di/*\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most effective and safe approach to manage journal logs and free up disk space:\n\n1. Modifying /etc/systemd/journald.conf to set SystemMaxUse=50M limits the future size of journal logs.\n2.

On most fuses, there is an inscription which identifies the fuse. For example, one of the fuses I have in my desk is marked as F10AL250V. That means that it's a fast fuse rated at 10 A up to voltage of 250 V. Another I have is marked T500mAL250V. That means that the fuse is slow acting rated at current of 500 mA for voltages up to 250 V.\n\nThe marking will be somewhere on the case of the fuse. On glass tube fuses, it's usually engraved (sometimes very badly) on the metal part of the body.

you a step further.  \n\nAdd this method in your data provider \n\n```\npublic function addFilter(\\Magento\\Framework\\Api\\Filter $filter)\n{\n    return null;\n}\n\n```\n\nSince you are extending `AbstractDataProvider` you need to override the method.  \n\nIf something else crashes, you might need to do the same thing for other methods involving `$this->getCollection()`.  \n\nI'm thinking one of these methods `addField`, `addOrder`, `setLimit`, `removeField`, `removeAllFields`, `count`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given Magento 2 documentation:\n\nQuestion: You

The answer is: Boxing. And now that seemingly **male spectacle** is attracting women.\n\nDoes ***male spectacle*** mean dominated by men?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary sense of **male** denotes the sex of an animal, as an adjective: men, boys, rams, bulls, and peacocks are all **male**; women, girls, ewes, cows, and peahens are all **female**.\\*\n\nThe sentence that you are asking about uses **male** in an extended sense. Since boxing is not an animal, you can safely infer that the author wants you to understand **male** not in its primary sense, but in some way *related to* its primary sense. You must infer the exact meaning from context.\n\nIn this case, **male spectacle** means an activity that men, but not women, perform, which creates a visually conspicuous show that attracts other people's attention (a \"spectacle\"). This usage of **male** is similar to its meaning in **[male display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship_display#Male_display)**, referring to things like the spreading of a peacock's [tail feathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl#/media/File:Paonroue.JPG). The display is not itself literally male. The display is an action distinctive to males of that species; the females don't do it.\n\nI don't understand the word **male** in this context to mean **male\\-dominated**, though the meanings are somewhat ambiguous. The primary (though rare) sense of **dominate** is to hold power over someone; a common secondary sense is to exist in the greatest number or proportion in some area. If thousands of women took up boxing, they would still be outnumbered by male boxers, and so the sport would still be male\\-dominated in that secondary sense. Men might still control the sport, too, so it would still be male\\-dominated in the primary sense. I understand **male spectacle** in the quoted sentence to regard boxing as something like the peacock's tail display: an activity performed exclusively by men. However, the phrase and context are not fully clear about this, and I doubt that the author thought about it carefully.\n\nNote that, in this context, there is a slight difference in meaning between **male spectacle** and **masculine spectacle**. **Masculine** denotes the qualities distinctively associated with maleness, but not maleness itself. It's not a self\\-contradiction to say that a certain woman has some masculine qualities\u2014for example, a deep voice, or an urge to get into fistfights. Through the choice of the word **male** or **masculine**, the author guides the reader to understand the phrase by extending one primary sense or the other: the male sex, or the qualities associated with it. The choice of **male** rather than **masculine** agrees with the author's meaning of \"Boxing was formerly performed only by men, but now women are starting to box, too.\"\n\n---\n\n\\*\u00a0By the way, English has a peculiar ambiguity regarding the words **animal**, **man**, **cow**, and **peacock**. One sense of **animal** is any organism that moves itself from place to place and has consciousness, human or otherwise; another sense of **animal** means only non\\-human animals. One sense of **man** includes humans of both sexes; another sense, much more common, means only male humans. One sense of **cow** includes all animals of the genus *[Bos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bos);* another sense means only females of the genus *Bos.* Even the word **peacock** commonly refers to both sexes of the [peafowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl), despite the fact that **\\-cock** specifically designates a male bird. The word **peacock** is well\\-known, **peahen** is not well\\-known, and **peafowl** is almost unheard\\-of in everyday English."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the sentence \"And now that seemingly male spectacle is attracting women,\" which of the following best describes the author's intended meaning of \"male spectacle\" as it relates to boxing?\n\nA) An activity dominated by men in terms of participation numbers\nB) A sport controlled and managed primarily by men\nC) A display or performance traditionally exclusive to males\nD) A masculine form of entertainment enjoyed mostly by male spectators\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"male spectacle\" in this context is best understood as describing an activity or display that has traditionally been performed exclusively by men, similar to the concept of \"male display\" in nature (like a peacock's tail display). The author's choice of \"male\" rather than \"masculine\" suggests they are emphasizing the sex of the participants rather than gender-associated qualities. The sentence implies that boxing was formerly an activity performed only by men but is now beginning to attract female participants. This interpretation aligns most closely with option C, which describes it as \"a display or performance traditionally exclusive to males.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while boxing may be male-dominated in terms of numbers, the phrase \"male spectacle\" implies more than just numerical superiority. Option B focuses on control and management, which is not the primary implication of \"spectacle\" in this context.

There is a (rare) word to describe this kind of redundancy: \"Pleonastic\". It means using more words than needed.\n\nMany style guides recommend reducing redundancy in your writing: You should say \"tuna\" not \"tuna fish\". You should not say \"the two twins\" (since twins implies two) you do not need to say \"new innovations\" (since innovations are always new).\n\nBut pleonastic expressions are not ungrammatical, and some are very common and natural, especially in speech or less formal writing. Sometimes a writer will use a redundant word to emphasise a point.\n\n> There are three types of hunting: Legal trophy hunting, illegal poaching and subsistence hunting for food.\n\nThe author wants to emphasise and contrast trophy hunting, which is legal, with poaching, which is illegal.\n\nAs pointed out in comments, there may be situations in which there is a legal defence to poaching, such as \"necessity\". And there are extended or metaphorical uses of \"poaching\" which do not refer to illegal acts.

Pleonasm involves using more words than necessary to express a concept. In this case, \"poaching\" already implies illegality in the context of wildlife hunting, so \"illegal\" is technically redundant. However, this redundancy can serve a purpose in emphasizing the unlawful nature of the act, especially when contrasting it with legal forms of hunting. While it's not the most concise phrasing, it's not grammatically incorrect and can be effectively used for emphasis in certain contexts.

The expert mentions that after years of use, thermal paste can dry out and become inefficient, leading to overheating issues.\n\nD) A defective graphics card is unlikely to cause the described symptoms, especially since the user mentioned that unplugging the GPU did not change the behavior.\n\nThe question tests the ability to analyze symptoms, consider the age of the system, and prioritize potential causes based on expert advice."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/05/19", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/351503", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/44445/"], "docs_id": 351503, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm playing Bioshock Remastered for PC (via Steam).

This method allows for precise control over node placement, enabling you to position nodes from the \"Provost Office\" column underneath the \"Library\" column.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the forest package doesn't have an automatic repositioning feature for this specific scenario.\n\nOption C is incorrect because adjusting the grow' parameter wouldn't allow for the desired bidirectional placement of nodes.\n\nOption D is plausible but overly complex and not the method shown in the solution. Creating a custom TikZ shape would be unnecessary for this task.\n\nThe correct solution involves drawing the nodes that need to be repositioned manually, setting their position relative to other nodes in the tree using the name property, and connecting them with drawn lines.
