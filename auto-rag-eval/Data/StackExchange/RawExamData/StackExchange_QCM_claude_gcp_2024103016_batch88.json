Your workflow could be:\n\n1. Define a point\n2. Buffer the point and create a circle\n3. Make minimum bounding box around the circle\n4. Use this newly build box for selecting the features\n\nThus, if we forget the trouble with geometric coordinates, the SQL query would be like:\n\n```\nSELECT * from your_table AS a\nwhere ST_Intersects(a.geom,\nST_Envelope(\nST_Buffer(\nST_GeomFromText('POINT (-108 43)',4326),10)));\n\n```\n\nThe buffer of 10 degrees with EPSG:4326 may not make sense but the SQL per se gives an answer to your question as you put it. If your data and the Envelope that you build are in some projected SRS like some UTM zone the result should be fine."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You need to find all points within a specific area around a given point in a spatial database. Which of the following approaches is most accurate for creating a square bounding box around a point and selecting all intersecting points?\n\nA) Use ST_DWithin to create a circular buffer around the point and select all points within it.\n\nB) Create a square buffer directly around the point using ST_Buffer with a square end cap style.\n\nC) Use ST_Buffer to create a circular buffer, then use ST_Envelope to create a minimum bounding rectangle around this buffer, and finally use ST_Intersects to select points.\n\nD) Use ST_MakeEnvelope to create a square box directly, specifying the coordinates of opposite corners based on the original point's coordinates.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate approach for creating a square bounding box around a point and finding intersecting points. This method involves three steps:\n\n1. Use ST_Buffer to create a circular buffer around the point. This ensures equal distance in all directions.\n2. Use ST_Envelope to create a minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) around this circular buffer. This converts the circular area into a square bounding box.\n3. Use ST_Intersects to select all points that intersect with this square bounding box.\n\nThis approach avoids the inaccuracies of using ST_DWithin (which creates a circular area, not a square) and is more flexible than creating a square buffer or envelope directly, as it allows for easy adjustment of the area size by modifying the buffer radius.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it creates a circular area, not a square bounding box. Option B is incorrect because creating a square buffer directly can be less precise and more complicated to implement correctly. Option D is incorrect because manually calculating envelope coordinates can be error-prone and doesn't easily account for the curvature of the Earth in geographic coordinate systems."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/02/26", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1629213", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/748764/"], "docs_id": 1629213, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a self built PC which is running for around seven years now without a problem. Yesterday, in the middle of streaming Netflix on Ubuntu, the screen froze. Only a hard reset worked. After the reset, the PC went on and off a couple of times, one time I briefly saw that it booted into BIOS. Then it booted back into the OS, but network was down. I turned it off and tried again. Now I see the \"power on\" light for \\~2 seconds, then it goes off again. The fans all briefly turn on and then off again. Then there is a pause of \\~10 seconds until which the cycle starts again. It does not boot into BIOS or the OS anymore. My screen also briefly goes on without showing anything, so there seems to be a signal, which then disappears again.\n\nCan this be due to a faulty motherboard? I visually inspected the board, but could not see any burned capacitors or any other signs of damage. Is there any way to determine, where the problem is? Unfortunately I do not know how to gather any more information. What I did was unplug the GPU to see if reduced power consumption solves the problem, but no change in behavior.\n\nThis is my system:\n\n* Mainboard: GigaByte H87\\-HD3\n* CPU: Xeon E3\\-1230v3\n* GPU: GeForce GTX 760\n* PSU: Cooler Master G550M\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From a hardware perspective, this is similar to an issue I had with an old FX series computer I built nearly 8 years ago. In my case, it was a failed cooler. Check to make sure if it is an air cooler its fins are clear of debris and the fan on top works. Additionally, after years the thermal paste on the processor is most likely dry thus inefficient. DO NOT REMOVE your cooler to check until you have new thermal paste as old and dry is better than none in most cases.\n\nIf it is liquid\\-cooled and uses an AIO it more than likely is the cooler.\n\nA few things you can do is check to see if the cooler is hot, or if the backside of the MOBO where the CPU die is, is hot, if so it's most likely is a thermal problem.\n\nPSU do go bad but it's actually quite rare in an old system with a Xeon processor the first thing I suspect is auto\\-power\\-off due to thermal limits being reached. In 15 years of building PC's thermals are one of the first things to check on a system that's more than 4 years old."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A 7-year-old custom-built PC suddenly shuts down and exhibits a cycle of powering on for 2 seconds, then off for 10 seconds, without booting into BIOS or OS. Based on the symptoms and the expert's advice, what is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) Faulty motherboard\nB) Failed power supply unit\nC) Thermal problems with the CPU\nD) Corrupted operating system\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The expert suggests that for an old system with a Xeon processor, thermal issues are one of the first things to check. The symptoms described (short power cycles without booting) are consistent with the system reaching thermal limits and automatically shutting off to protect components. The expert mentions that after years, the thermal paste on the processor likely becomes dry and inefficient, leading to overheating. Additionally, the expert's personal experience with a similar issue was resolved by addressing cooling problems. While other options like faulty motherboard or PSU are possible, the expert indicates that thermal issues are more common in systems over 4 years old."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/06/23", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/283271", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/67923/"], "docs_id": 283271, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to use httrack website copier but the program is running and reporting \"no\\-ssl\" (ie: it does not have the capability to copy secure sites). \n\nFrom looking over [this thread](http://forum.httrack.com/readmsg/14979/14946/index.html), it seems that the problem is either when I make \\& configure the program, or when I run the program, it is not finding the lib\\-ssl / open\\-ssl that I have installed.

might want to analyse the capture in WireShark \\- much easier). This is how your IPv6 host knows how to get out to the internet. Also watch for `Neighbor Solicitation` as this is the replacement for ARP.\n\nIf you see these requests coming in, but not going back out, then your internal firewall is blocking IPv6 traffic. If you see them going out (requests), but not back in, then you need to make sure that your prefix length is correct (that's the `/64` part. Although I've seen a lot of `/64`s being passed out that are actually a `/48`).\n\nBig Important Bold Bit\n======================\n\n**ICMP is absolutally critical for IPv6 functionality.** In IPv4 it can be blocked without huge impact, but in IPv6, the whole network relies on ICMP for all its functionality. Don't block it.\n\nIn reference to\n\n> My provider gave me a \"/64\" (whatever\n>  that is \\- I'm still confused) of IPv6\n>  addresses\n\nThat's your Prefix Length, previously known as your [Subnet Mask](https://serverfault.com/questions/49765/how-does-subnetting-work) that's used for [CIDR](https://serverfault.com/questions/12854/cidr-for-dummies). The lower the number, the more IP addresses you have. For IPv6, `/64` and `/48` are very common and should give you more IP addresses than you will ever need in your entire life."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: An organization is implementing IPv6 and experiencing connectivity issues. Which of the following troubleshooting steps would be MOST effective in diagnosing potential IPv6 routing problems?\n\nA) Blocking ICMP traffic on the internal firewall to prevent security vulnerabilities\nB) Using tcpdump to capture and analyze Router Advertisements and Neighbor Solicitation packets\nC) Configuring the default gateway manually on each IPv6 host\nD) Changing the IPv6 prefix length from /64 to /128 to increase address space\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect. ICMP is critical for IPv6 functionality and should not be blocked. The passage explicitly states \"ICMP is absolutely critical for IPv6 functionality\" and \"Don't block it.\"\n\nB) Correct.

Recently, while investigating best practices and tools for Python development I found [`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv). I find it useful (it takes care of using the right method for creating the virtual environment depending on the Python version) and clean (since the `venv` directory is not entangled with your codebase).\n\nThe problem I find is that previously (when using `pyenv` and `virtualenv` separately) I would push my `requirements.txt` file and my `.python-version` file to the repository. When cloning the project a few months later I could recreate my virtual environment using `requirements.txt` and could check `.python-version` to see which Python version I was developing on.\n\nWith `pyenv-virtualenv`, however, the `.python-version` file is less useful. Since in `pyenv-virtualenv` a virtual environment is treated like a new version of Python inside `pyenv`, and the way to link your project to the virtual environment is by \"setting the Python version\" to that virtual environment, the file no longer contains the exact Python version you are using.\n\nLet's pretend I'm working on project Euler and decide to create a virtual environment for it using `pyenv-virtualenv`, and I call it project\\_euler. In order to make my code base to run on that virtual environment I need to go to the project's directory and type: `pyenv local project_euler`.\n\nNow everything works great locally, but when I push to my repository and grab it again in a few months, `.python-version` won't be too useful, since it will only say \"project\\_euler\". Furthermore, if the person who downloads the repository has a virtualenv named `project_euler` as well which is configured differently to the one I was using when I pushed, **they might use a wrongly\\-configured environment without realising it**. This wasn't a problem when using `pyenv` and `virtualenv` separately, since `.python-version` only included information about the Python version then, not the name of the virtual environment in use.\n\nWhat are the best practices to deal with these issues? I can think of several options:\n\n* Include the Python version in the name of your virtual environments: `project_euler_3.5.3` (note that this does not solve the issue with using the wrong virtual environment by mistake).\n* Do not push `.python-version`, instead document the minimum supported Python version in the `README`.\n* Do not push `.python-version`, and do not document the Python version (doesn't seem right, since there are retrocompatibility issues even between minor revisions \\-\\-e.g. 3\\.5 vs 3\\.4\\-\\- so it shouldn't be up to the user to have to guess).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would recommend using [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for python development which solves a bunch of problems. \n\nIt is now the [official](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/managing-dependencies/#managing-dependencies) tool recommended from python.org\n\nIf you have experience with say npm or something like that, pipenv behaves in similar ways. It does its bookkeeping in two files (`Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`).It helps you to create *deterministic* builds. In order to get a working environment, you commit both as you would with a `requirements.txt` alongside your code, check out the code, run `pipenv install` and voil\u00e0. With `pipenv shell` you enter your virtual environment.\n\nIn your `Pipfile` is a section for the purpose of defining the required python version, e.g. \n\n```\n[requires]\npython_version = \"3.6\"\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A developer is setting up a new Python project and wants to ensure consistent environments across different machines. Which of the following approaches best addresses version control, dependency management, and Python version specification while avoiding potential conflicts with similarly named virtual environments?\n\nA) Use pyenv-virtualenv and push the .python-version file to the repository, naming the virtual environment after the project (e.g., \"project_euler\")\n\nB) Use virtualenv and pyenv separately, pushing both requirements.txt and .python-version files to the repository\n\nC) Use pipenv, committing both Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to the repository, and specifying the Python version in the Pipfile\n\nD) Use pyenv-virtualenv, but include the Python version in the virtual environment name (e.g., \"project_euler_3.5.3\")\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the best approach because:\n\n1. Pipenv is the officially recommended tool by python.org for managing dependencies.\n2. It creates deterministic builds, ensuring consistency across different machines.\n3. The Pipfile allows specifying the required Python version explicitly.\n4. Pipfile and Pipfile.lock together provide a complete record of dependencies and versions.\n5. It avoids potential conflicts with similarly named virtual environments that can occur with pyenv-virtualenv.\n6. It combines virtual environment and dependency management in one tool, simplifying the workflow.\n\nOption A doesn't solve the issue of potential conflicts with similarly named environments and doesn't provide clear Python version information. Option B, while functional, uses multiple tools and doesn't provide the same level of deterministic builds as pipenv. Option D attempts to solve the naming conflict but doesn't address other issues and adds complexity to environment names."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/05/04", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/355489", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/61352/"], "docs_id": 355489, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am referring this ([https://www.mageplaza.com/devdocs/magento\\-2\\-create\\-shipping\\-method/\\#step\\-1\\-declare\\-a\\-shipping\\-module](https://www.mageplaza.com/devdocs/magento-2-create-shipping-method/#step-1-declare-a-shipping-module)) to create a custom shipping method.

If the question remains unanswered after this period, it's acceptable to email him with a link to the Stack Overflow question. This approach is preferred because it gives the community a chance to answer first, and it ensures that the question is documented publicly, which can benefit others.

Of course, you are right that $\\\\mathbb Q\\[\\\\sqrt n]\\=\\\\mathbb Q(\\\\sqrt n)$ is always a field, so in particular a UFD.\n\nThe referenced sequence lists the [class numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_class_group#Properties) of real quadratic fields, i.e. $\\\\mathbb Q(\\\\sqrt n)$ with $n\\>0$ (and $n$ squarefree to really get different fields for different values of $n$). The class number is an arithmetical quantity attached to a field, or more precisely to its ring of integers, which measures the failure of unique factorization. It is equal to $1$ if and only if the ring of integers is a UFD.

In general, a good way of investigating if a ring is a UFD is to find different factorizations and show that all factors are irreducible but not associated.

It also eliminates extra setup (NAS configuration) for people who want to run the test. And it makes refreshing the data fairly painless (it's versioned).\n\n**What's too big to put in revision control**\n\nThere is a large gray area. And if you decide something doesn't belong in a RCS, what are your alternatives? It's an easier decision if you limit your choices between the RCS and a binary repo (maven style).\n\nIdeally, you'd only want in the RCS stuff that is humanely editable, diffable, or where you'd want to track the history. Anything which is the product of a build or some other sort of automation definitely doesn't belong there.

Summers are from March to July with temperatures reaching early 40 degree Celsius and a lot of humidity. It rains from July to September with temperatures in mid to late 30 degree Celsius. Octobers are hot like summers. November to March the temperatures dip to late 20 degree Celsius.\n\nWe live on the sixth floor of an apartment building in an non\\-air\\-conditioned house. Ceiling fans provide ventilation. We do not want to have air\\-conditioning as we believe it's harmful for the environment. \n\nOur bedroom and living room have a 10ft X 4ft East facing window each. Two other rooms have same sized windows facing North and 5ft X 4ft windows facing East.\n\nIn the summers, things heat up quite a lot. What type of curtains should we use to make the house as comfortable as possible? Will it help if we plant vines in pots and let them crawl up the window grills? Also, should we use the same curtains during winters?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I grew up in the 1940s and 1950s in hot, humid south Louisiana and hot, less humid Dallas, Texas. We had no a/c in Louisiana and starting in about 1954 in Dallas we had window units in some rooms, but not in the bedroom I shared with my brother. In 1960 we moved to a new house in Dallas, Texas with central a/c. The improvement in comfort was astounding.\n\nAfter leaving home I sometimes lived in downscale student digs without a/c and it was sub\\-optimal, but obviously tolerable. One place was cooled with an \"evaporative cooler\" or water fan. Mumbai is presumably too humid for those to be effective. For two years in my mid twenties I lived comfortably without a/c in Fiji near Suva, but Fiji's summer high temperatures are low compared to Dallas or Mumbai. \n\nIf you can afford it, I do not think you should deny yourself a/c in Mumbai on the grounds of damage to the environment.\n\nBut as far as other interventions on your existing house, outside louvers over the windows would be better than curtains inside.

They reduce solar gain by blocking direct sunlight before it enters the apartment, while still allowing for airflow. This helps keep the interior cooler without completely blocking ventilation, which is crucial in a non-air-conditioned space.\n\nD) Evaporative coolers, while effective in dry climates, are not suitable for Mumbai's humid environment.

Instead, the power of the proof lies in specifying a method for defining a number that is guaranteed to be different from every number in the given sequence. This specification is finite and can be stated clearly: for each position n, choose a digit different from the nth digit of the nth number in the sequence. This finite specification is sufficient to prove that the resulting number must be different from all numbers in the original list, thereby showing that the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (i.e., it is uncountable).

Specifically, according to Wikipedia \"To each point on a Riemannian manifold, it assigns a single real number determined by the intrinsic geometry of the manifold near that point.\". Now, I am confused. What does $R$ being determined means in the case. Does it mean I can use the metric, or some other quantity, to solve for the scalar curvature? If this is the case, why is the Hilbert\\-Einstein action contain both $R$ and $g$ if $R$ is solved from $g$? If this is not the case, then the Wikipedia explanation would be inside\\-out; would it rather be the scalar curvature that defines the intrinsic geometric of the manifold near that point?\n\nFor a given $g$, can $R$ be any choice of arbitrary, possibly smooth, function \\- each choice of $R$ defining a different manifold?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Riemannian geometry, there are in principle two fundamental quantities: the metric $g$ and the connection $\\\\nabla$. Each one may be chosen independently of the other, or even be left undefined (that is, you can have only the metric, or only the connection).\n\nThe Riemann curvature tensor $R^a{}\\_{bcd}$ depends only on the connection, as can be seen from its expression in a coordinate chart:\n\n$$R^a{}\\_{bcd} \\= \\\\partial\\_c \\\\Gamma^a{}\\_{db} \\+ \\\\Gamma^a{}\\_{ce} \\\\Gamma^e{}\\_{db} \\- (c \\\\leftrightarrow d).$$\n\nThe Ricci tensor can be defined directly from this as $R\\_{bd} \\= R^a{}\\_{bad}$. If you also have a metric, you can define the curvature scalar as $R \\= g^{bd} R\\_{bd}$.\n\nYou can see that in general, the curvature scalar depends on both the metric and the connection. If you have one of them (say, the metric) and you want to choose $R$ as an independent quantity, you'll have to set up equations and see if you can choose the other one (the connection if you fixed the metric) so that $R$ equals your desired function; this may or may not be possible in general, I don't know.\n\nThis is the general situation, but in general relativity the connection is not independent; we use the Levi\\-Civita connection, which depends only on the metric, so that all the other quantities also depend only on the metric. And the same logic applies: if you want $R$ to be some specific function, you might be able to choose a metric that gives you your desired $R$, but it's not straightforward.\n\nAnd to answer your last paragraph: the EH action (or the field equations) contain $R$, but it is understood that it is really a function of the metric, which we don't write out explicitly because, well, it's just $R$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of general relativity and differential geometry, which of the following statements about the scalar curvature R is most accurate?\n\nA) The scalar curvature R is completely independent of the metric g and can be chosen arbitrarily for any given manifold.\n\nB) The scalar curvature R is directly derived from the connection \u0393 alone, without any dependence on the metric g.\n\nC) In general relativity, the scalar curvature R is a function of both the metric g and an independently chosen connection \u0393.\n\nD) In general relativity using the Levi-Civita connection, the scalar curvature R is ultimately a function of the metric g, though its explicit form is often not written out.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because in general relativity, we use the Levi-Civita connection, which is determined by the metric g. This means that the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci tensor, and consequently the scalar curvature R are all ultimately functions of the metric g. While R appears alongside g in equations like the Einstein-Hilbert action, it's understood that R is implicitly a function of g.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the scalar curvature cannot be chosen arbitrarily; it's constrained by the geometry of the manifold.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the Riemann curvature tensor depends only on the connection, the scalar curvature requires both the Ricci tensor (derived from the Riemann tensor) and the metric to contract indices.\n\nOption C is incorrect in the context of general relativity, where we don't use an independently chosen connection, but rather the Levi-Civita connection derived from the metric."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/11/13", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111967", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/161808/"], "docs_id": 111967, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Would it be possible to (or do you think there should be) place a grace period on the reversal / removal of a bounty, and (past the grace period) have a time limit on changing the description for the bounty?\n\n**For example:**\n\nSay I create a quesiton in Flex, and nobody's seen it for a week.

According to the documentation, nested lists in Markdown on StackExchange can be created by indenting each sublevel with four spaces. This applies to both ordered and unordered lists. The example provided shows that this method works for creating multiple levels of nesting and even allows mixing ordered and unordered lists within the same structure. \n\nOption A is incorrect because StackExchange doesn't use '#' and '*' symbols for nesting as suggested in the question. \n\nOption B is incorrect because increasing numbers of '#' symbols is not the method used for creating nested ordered lists on StackExchange. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the example clearly shows that it is possible to mix ordered and unordered lists in a nested structure by using the proper indentation."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/06/29", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/93431", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/55773/"], "docs_id": 93431, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm quite scared every time I have to use NEMA plugs (I live in Japan).\n\nComing from europe, the bottom of the two connectors is insulated [![EU PLUG; public domain](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dGQBS.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dGQBS.jpg)\n\nThis ensure that even if you touch them while plugging/unplugging, it will always be safe to touch.\n\nMeanwhile with NEMA ones, there is no such insulation and I often see my appliance partially disconnected (but power still flowing) because of either the weight of the AC/DC or the cable has been pulled accidentally.\n\n[![Nema plug, public domain](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uDiAM.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uDiAM.jpg) \n\nAm I right to be worried about accidentally touching the connectors, and what to do about it ? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> **How can NEMA \\[[1\\-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEMA_connector#NEMA_1), IEC [Type A](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeA.htm)] electric plug \\[in Japan] be safe?**\n\nNothing is safe.

However, they are not completely unsafe. The correct approach is to consider them less safe and take extra precautions when using them, such as ensuring plugs are fully inserted, not pulling cords, and keeping fingers away from the pins. The lower voltage (100V in Japan vs 230V in Europe) doesn't necessarily make NEMA plugs safer, as other factors like design features also play a role in overall safety.

In the original, as you say, *he did* is understood. You could also write:\n\n> ... if he did look like a monstrous yellow slug and did smell of piss.\n\nIn your example, only the subject *he* is understood and so you would still need to mark the verb as past. Personally, I don't like the combining of the two different forms of the past tense with *and*.\n\nFor example, I don't like:\n\n> He *did go* home and *ate*.\n\nThis is essentially what your second sentence is.\n\nA better comparison would be:\n\n> He is walking and talking on his phone.\n> \n> \n> He is walking and is talking on his phone.\n\nTo me, both are equally correct, but the first is much more common in English. The repetition of the auxiliary verb *is* (or any other auxiliary for that matter) is more common when there is a large separation between the two verbs.

It consistently uses the \"did + infinitive\" construction for both verbs (look and smell), avoiding the awkward mixing of past tense forms. This structure implies \"he did\" before both verbs, making it concise yet clear.\n\nOption A mixes tenses inappropriately, using simple past \"looked\" with \"did smell.\"\nOption B also mixes tenses, using \"did look\" with simple past \"smelled.\"\nOption D, while grammatically correct, is less common and sounds more awkward due to the repetition of \"did\" before both verbs.\n\nThe question tests understanding of verb tense consistency, the \"did + infinitive\" construction, and natural English phrasing."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/04/11", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/137179", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/84648/"], "docs_id": 137179, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an Aniston gas boiler.

Sync logs with the upstream WSUS show no errors.\n\n**update 2**: So it seems as if there's something weird with my upstream. I've found that if I install a new WSUS instance \\& sync it from Microsoft, all works perfectly well. If I make it a downstream replica of my existing WSUS server, either during the configuration, or afterwards, it breaks. Even more strange, my upstream itself and another existing replica appear to be functioning just fine. It looks as if I'm just going to build new WSUS instances in all 3 sites and start fresh, ignoring the existing upstream.\n\n**update 3**: I built a new WSUS upstream server, started clean so as to not bring over whatever weirdness was going on in the original upstream's DB. Pointed my 2 replicas at my new upstream. Everything was fine for several days. 5 days ago the replicas stopped getting status updates from clients again. WTF?!?!\n\n**update 4**: I have logged a support request with Microsoft on this, hopefully some good will come out of it.\n\n**update 5**: After Microsoft product support spent countless hours checking and re\\-checking all the same stuff I'd already checked, I suspect I have stumbled upon the cause. Our Junior sysadmin recently discovered [Local Update Publisher](http://localupdatepubl.sourceforge.net/) and started using it to push Adobe \\& Java updates to workstations. The time of Local Update Publisher's installation coincides perfectly with the time the downstream clients last reported status. I am going through the product documentation to determine what I need to do to fix this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I had a similar issue not to long ago when migrating to WSUS 3\\.0 SP2 on Windows Server 2008 R2\\. After quite a few frustrating hours I finally resolved it with KB2720211\\. I'm not sure why it worked since it doesn't seem to directly address the error code I was receiving from clients at the time (800b0001\\), however it seemed logical to make sure the WSUS version was fully patched before getting further into diagnostics.\n\nYou can use the instructions from <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2720211>\n\nSince my setup only involved one WSUS server I only had to use the following instructions from the site after downloading the patch.\n\n1\\.Set up WSUS. To do this, at a command prompt, type one of the following commands, as applicable to your system:  \n\n`WSUS-KB2720211-x64.exe /q C:\\MySetup.log  \n\nWSUS-KB2720211-x86.exe /q C:\\MySetup.log` \n\nThe update will install immediately, without any prompts. \n\n2\\.Review the setup log to verify the upgrade was successful. To do this, at a command prompt, type `C:\\MySetup.log`.\n\n3\\.Make sure that IIS and the WSUS service are stopped. To do this, at a command prompt, type the following commands:\n\n`iisreset/stop  \n\nnet stop wsusservice`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is experiencing issues with a newly migrated WSUS 3.0 SP2 server on Windows Server 2008 R2. Clients are unable to find updates and don't report status. After investigating, the administrator discovers an error code 0x8024400E in the WindowsUpdate.log file. What is the most appropriate first step to troubleshoot this issue?\n\nA) Decline, approve, and then decline the Office 2003 SP1 update\nB) Run the Microsoft WSUS client & server diagnostic tools\nC) Install KB2720211 patch for WSUS 3.0 SP2\nD) Rebuild the WSUS server from scratch\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) While this solution is mentioned in the context as a potential fix for some old issues, it didn't resolve the problem in this specific case and is not the most appropriate first step.\n\nB) The diagnostic tools don't run on x64 systems, as mentioned in the passage, so this is not a viable option.\n\nC) This is the correct answer. The top answer suggests installing KB2720211 as a solution that resolved a similar issue. It's a logical first step to ensure the WSUS version is fully patched before proceeding with further diagnostics.\n\nD) Rebuilding the server from scratch is an extreme measure and should only be considered after other troubleshooting steps have been exhausted. It's not the most appropriate first step in this scenario.\n\nThe correct approach is to first ensure that the WSUS server is fully patched, which includes installing KB2720211. This patch has been known to resolve similar issues, even when the specific error codes don't seem directly related."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/04/05", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/36420604", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3852771/"], "docs_id": 36420604, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to use UiPath for the installation of a customer delivery\nThe delivery contains multiple deliverables and actions :\nOpen ETL tools ,Database\nEdit lines in a configuration file\nrun a script ...\nIs it possible to automate the installation with UiPath? \nIf it is possible, how can I do it ?... \n\nThanks in advance for your answers\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I used uipath to delivery a nice reporting robot in a similar way.

They also state that \"There seem to be few limitations on what uipath can do\" and that \"Calling scripts and passing data between them is very easy.\" This suggests that UiPath can indeed automate the entire process described in the question, including opening various tools, editing configuration files, and running scripts, making option C the correct answer."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/10/04", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/77175", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/1106/"], "docs_id": 77175, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In calculus classes it is sometimes said that the tangent line to a curve at a point is the line that we get by \"zooming in\" on that point with an infinitely powerful microscope.

It would be nice to illustrate each of these examples with a little movie of the \"zooming in\" process, but I am not sure how to put such things on MO. Any hints?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In algebraic geometry, this construction is known as the *tangent cone* to the graph. More generally, suppose we have the zero set of any polynomial $f(x,y) \\= 0$, and assume $f(0,0\\)\\=0$. Then we can write\n\n$f(x,y) \\= a\\_m (x,y) \\+ a\\_{m\\+1}(x,y) \\+a\\_{m\\+2}(x,y) \\+\\\\cdots$\n\nwhere $a\\_i(x,y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $i$ and $a\\_m$ is nonzero. The zero set of $a\\_m$ is called the tangent cone to the curve at the origin. It is a product of $m$ linear forms (over $\\\\mathbb{C}$), and $m\\=1$ exactly when the zero set is smooth at the origin. In this case, the tangent cone coincides with the tangent space.\n\nFrom your point of view, when we substitute $x\\\\mapsto x/c$ and $y\\\\mapsto y/c$ it is clear that the term left in the limit is $a\\_m$.\n\nWe can of course find tangent cones at other points of the zero set by changing coordinates.\n\nIn general, for a smooth function $f$ you should be able to take a multivariate Taylor expansion and read off the tangent cone from the lowest degree part. This is where the difficulty comes in for actually defining the tangent line in terms of the tangent cone in a calculus class, as computing the Taylor expansion demands we already have a notion of derivative. This difficulty is obviously not seen in the case of polynomials, although recentering the Taylor expansion of a polynomial at a different point is perhaps easiest done with the aid of derivatives.\n\nHigher dimensional analogues are also available without any real work, although in the singular case the tangent cone is much more interesting than just a union of hyperplanes: it will be a cone over some variety. The homogeneous polynomial $a\\_m(x\\_1,\\\\ldots,x\\_n)$ typically doesn't factor into a product of linear forms when $n\\>2$.\n\nTangent cones are treated in any reasonable introduction to algebraic geometry, such as Harris' \"First course\" book or Shafarevich."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Consider the curve defined by the equation f(x,y) = y^3 - x^2y + x^4 = 0.

The higher-degree terms (-x^2y and x^4) affect the shape of the curve away from the origin but do not contribute to the tangent cone.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it includes a non-homogeneous term.\nOption C is incorrect because x^4 is of higher degree and doesn't contribute to the tangent cone.\nOption D is incorrect because it's the full equation, not just the lowest-degree homogeneous part."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/01/02", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/321180", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/127096/"], "docs_id": 321180, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am revising linear regression. \n\nThe textbook by Greene states:\n\n> [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nEOtG.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nEOtG.png)\n> [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cNIoy.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cNIoy.png)\n\nNow, of course there will be other assumptions on the linear regression model, such as $E(\\\\epsilon\\|X)\\=0$.\nThis assumption combined with the linearity assumption (which in effect defines $\\\\epsilon$), puts structure on the model.\n\nHowever, the linearity assumption **by itself** does not put any structure on our model, since $\\\\epsilon$ can be completely arbitrary. **For any variables $X, y$ whatsoever, no matter what the relation between the two we could define an $\\\\epsilon$ such that the linearity assumption holds.** Therefore, the linearity \"assumption\" should really be called a **definition** of $\\\\epsilon$, rather than an assumption. \n\n**Therefore I am wondering**: \n\n1.

Is Greene being sloppy? Should he actually have written: $E(y\\|X)\\=X\\\\beta$? This is a \"linearity assumption\" that actually puts\n>  structure on the model.\n\nIn a sense, yes and no. In the one hand, yes, [given current modern causality research](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/249767/which-theories-of-causality-should-i-know/299090#299090) he is sloppy, but just like most econometrics textbooks are, in the sense that they do not make a clear distinction of causal and observational quantities, leading to common confusions like this very question. But, in the other hand, no, this assumption is not sloppy in the sense that it is indeed different from simply assuming $E(y\\|X)\\=X\\\\beta$.\n\nThe crux of the matter here is the [difference between the conditional expectation, $E(y\\|X)$, and the *structural* (causal) equation of $y$, as well as its structural (causal) expectation $E\\[Y\\|do(X)]$](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/60430/correlation-regression-and-causal-modeling/302486#302486). The linearity assumption in Greene is a *structural* assumption. Let's see a simple example. Imagine the structural equation is:\n\n$$\ny\\= \\\\beta x \\+ \\\\gamma x^2 \\+ \\\\epsilon \n$$\n\nNow let $E\\[\\\\epsilon \\|x] \\= \\\\delta x \\- \\\\gamma x^2$. Then we would have:\n\n$$\nE\\[y\\|x] \\= \\\\beta'x \n$$\n\nwhere $\\\\beta' \\= \\\\beta \\+ \\\\delta$. Moreover, we can write $y \\= \\\\beta'x \\+ \\\\epsilon'$ and we would have $E\\[\\\\epsilon'\\|x] \\= 0$. This shows we can have a *correctly specified* linear conditional expectation $E\\[y\\|x]$ which by definition is going to have an orthogonal disturbance, yet the structural equation would be nonlinear. \n\n> 2.

The other assumptions are used either for **identification** of the structural parameters (for instance, the assumption of exogeneity of $\\\\epsilon$ allows you to identify the structural expectation $E\\[Y\\|do(X)]$ with the conditional expectation $E\\[Y\\|X]$) or for derivation of **statistical properties of the estimators** (for instance, the assumption of homoskedasticity guarantees OLS is BLUE, the assumption of normality makes it easy to derive \"finite sample\" results for inference etc).\n\n> However, the linearity assumption **by itself** does not put any\n>  structure on our model, since $\\\\epsilon$ can be completely arbitrary.\n>  **For any variables $X, y$ whatsoever, no matter what the relation between the two we could define an $\\\\epsilon$ such that the linearity\n>  assumption holds.**\n\nYour statement here goes into the main problem of causal inference in general! As shown in the simple example above, we can cook up structural disturbances that could make the conditional expectation of $y$ given $x$ linear. In general, several different structural (causal) models can have the same observational distribution, [you can even have causation without observed association.](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/26300/does-causation-imply-correlation/301823#301823) Therefore, in this sense, you are correct \\-\\-\\- we need more assumptions on $\\\\epsilon$ in order to put \"more structure\" into the problem and identify the structural parameters $\\\\beta$ with observational data.\n\n**Side note**\n\nIt's worth mentioning most econometrics textbooks are confusing when it comes to the distinction between regression and structural equations and their meaning. This has been documented lately. You can check a paper by [Chen and Pearl here](http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r395.pdf) as well as [an extended survey by Chris Auld](https://chrisaulddotcom.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/remarks-on-chen-and-pearl-on-causality-in-econometrics-textbooks/).

The air defenses are pretty well upgraded (wizard towers and AD's, primarily) while ground defenses are kind of weaker (archer towers, cannons, although mortars are fully upgraded). \n\nI'd probably try to run Giants on this, backed up by archers or wizards. I'd probably go with healing spells or a mix of heal and rage, although if you know the CC troops are strong ground units, you might take lightning. You can put some healers in your camps if you want, but with all that AD chances are good they're going to get shot down quickly. Wall breakers aren't as critical here, since there's not a lot of layers of wall to be dealt with. \n\nI'd start by drawing the clan castle out. The upper right area seems like it should be possible to get close enough to draw it with a barbarian. Checking the radius in the preview is a good way to get a closer look. If you can't get close enough with a barb, a giant would work although it's kind of a waste. \n\nIf the CC troops are to be lightning'ed, draw them over the lower right mortar and try to take them out and the mortar out in the same go. Otherwise, draw them into a corner and drop archers or wizards to obliterate them. \n\nThe right side and/or lower right side seem like good spots to attack from \\- the weakest wizard tower is here, and the goal is really to get 2 stars if possible, so we want to \"wedge\" into the base to hit the town hall. \n\nI'd drop one giant to check for traps, and then drop the rest en masse.

They arise from a parametric, non\\-linear transformation of a random variable (RV) $X \\\\sim F$, to a heavy\\-tailed version $Y \\\\sim \\\\text{Lambert W} \\\\times F$. For $F$ being Gaussian they reduce to Tukey's $h$ distribution. \n\nThey have one parameter $\\\\delta \\\\geq 0$ that regulates the degree of tail heaviness (you can also choose different left and right heavy tails). In its most basic form it transforms a standard Normal $U \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0,1\\)$ to a Lambert W $\\\\times$ Gaussian $Z$ by\n$$\nZ \\= U \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\delta}{2} U^2\\\\right)\n$$\n\nIf $\\\\delta \\> 0$ $Z$ has heavier tails than $U$; for $\\\\delta \\= 0$ $Z$ falls back to your initial RV $U$. \n\nIf you don't want to use the Gaussian distribution as your baseline, you can just create other Lambert W versions of your favorite distributions, e.g. t, uniform, gamma, exponential, beta, ... However, for the purpose of heavy\\-tails the Gaussian seems to be the obvious baseline reference.\n\nSince this heavy\\-tail generation is based on transformations of RVs/data rather than a manipulation of cdfs or pdfs, it is very convenient to implement: just use your code to simulate any standard RV, add one line that transforms it, and then you have a random sample from the heavy\\-tail version of your initial RV.\n\nIn R this becomes (using the [LambertW](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LambertW/index.html) package)\n\n```\nlibrary(LambertW)\nset.seed(1)\nzz = rLambertW(n=1000, distname = \"normal\", beta = c(0,1), delta = 0.5)\nnormfit(zz)\n\n```\n\nYou can also fit the best model to the data using a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)\n\n```\nmodel = MLE_LambertW(zz, distname = \"normal\", type = \"h\")\nsummary(model)\nplot(model)\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is working on an algorithm that requires generating random numbers from a distribution with heavy tails and no skew.

This result, when combined with properties of sufficiently strong arithmetic systems (such as \u03c9-consistency), leads to a contradiction if we assume such a system is complete. \n\nSpecifically, if a system T were complete and \u03c9-consistent, we could theoretically determine the solvability of any polynomial equation by enumerating proofs in T until we find either a proof of solvability or unsolvability.

The DC power also conducts broadband spectrum on unbalanced impedance wires from the switched current transients. The purpose of this Ferrite, Folding clamp, split clamshell, ungapped component is to act as a BALUN or to BALance UNbalanced lines at RF frequencies. The other functional name is a Common Mode (CM) Choke.

What is its primary function and why is it typically placed near the plug end?\n\nA) To protect the power supply unit from voltage spikes, placed near the plug to intercept surges before reaching the adaptor\nB) To act as a BALUN (balance unbalanced lines) at RF frequencies, placed near the plug to reduce far-field EMI emissions\nC) To filter out low-frequency noise from the power grid, placed near the plug for maximum effectiveness\nD) To protect the powered device from harmonics, placed near the plug to be closer to the device\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The ferrite bead on DC power adaptor cords primarily functions as a BALUN (BALance UNbalanced lines) at RF frequencies. It's also known as a Common Mode (CM) Choke. Its purpose is to raise the impedance of both DC+/- lines at high frequencies, making them balanced radiators that cancel each other out for far-field EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) emissions.\n\nThe bead is typically placed near the plug end because this location is most effective for reducing EMI emissions along the entire length of the cord. By balancing the lines close to the source, it helps suppress high-frequency noise generated by the AC-DC converter, which can produce harmonics up to 10MHz.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect or incomplete. While the ferrite bead does offer some protection against high-frequency noise, its primary function in this context is EMI reduction through balancing the lines, not surge protection, low-frequency filtering, or device protection specifically."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/10/29", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/301262", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/699/"], "docs_id": 301262, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A logical error, contrary to a fatal runtime error, is a run time error which doesn't fatally terminate a program, but does something not intended.\n\nIs a logical error necessarily caused by the line of code for the earliest state which is wrong?\n\nOr can a logical error be caused by a line of code before the line for the earliest wrong state?\n\nMy question mainly comes from \n\n* I think debugging can only help to tell if a state of a program is right or wrong, and not beyond that.\n* I guess by debugging we can locate the line of code that causes a logical error, because I think a logical error is always caused by the line of code for the earliest state which is wrong, not by a line of code that precedes the line of code for the earliest state which is wrong.\n\nI will be wrong if\nyou provide an example of logical error whose cause can't be found by using a debugger to track the states of the program. In other words, can you provide an example of logical error whose cause is earlier than the earliest states of the program which is wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By your wording, you have defined your answer to be true.\n\nYou talk about the first \"wrong state.\" What defines a wrong state? What makes it wrong? Typically the answer is \"it wasn't the state that was correct.\" By definition, the first wrong state is preceded by only correct states (or something went wrong on the first step, but that starts to be an OS issue). Thus there is a transition from a right state to a wrong state.\n\nIf you assume that the only thing which can change a state is a statement (line of code), then by definition the statement which has just completed and resulted in the first wrong state is \"the problem.\"\n\nThese assumptions are not always valid. For example, its trivial to show that if you use a \"memory trainer\" which allows one program to push values into another program's memory space, any error caused by this trainer is clearly not caused by any line of code at all!\n\nAlso, it is possible to have cases where there is no one line \"causing\" the problem. One such example is a multithreading race case. In such a case it is not always possible to specify which thread \"caused\" the problem, because the problem actually originated from the interaction between two threads to cause a \"wrong state.\" Since statements (lines of code) are executed on a thread, and the error is not \"on a thread,\" no line of code is at fault.\n\nA more \"constructive\" approach might be to change the wording. Instead of talking about \"the line which caused the error,\" think about \"The line which should be changed to fix the error.\" That wording changes things up just enough to avoid a blame\\-game.\n\nThis is also very important for dealing with memory bugs. In the case of those bugs, it is often very difficult to identify the actual first \"wrong state,\" but easy to identify the state which segfaults. It's easy to accidentally presume the error had to be some line of code near where it segfaulted because you presume the segfault is the first \"wrong state\" and forget to look for the actual root cause."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of debugging logical errors in software, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The line of code causing a logical error is always the one immediately preceding the first observable incorrect program state.\n\nB) Logical errors can always be precisely located using a debugger by identifying the exact moment a program's state becomes incorrect.\n\nC) The root cause of a logical error may sometimes occur earlier in the program execution than the first observable incorrect state.\n\nD) Multithreading issues and race conditions cannot be classified as logical errors because they don't originate from a single line of code.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the cause of a logical error may not always be in the line immediately preceding the first incorrect state. The root cause could be earlier in the program's execution.\n\nB is incorrect because debuggers, while useful, cannot always pinpoint the exact cause of a logical error, especially in complex scenarios like multithreading or when the error's effects are not immediately observable.\n\nC is correct. The root cause of a logical error can indeed occur earlier in the program's execution than the first observable incorrect state. This is particularly true for complex scenarios, memory-related issues, or cases where the effects of an error are not immediately apparent.\n\nD is incorrect because multithreading issues and race conditions are indeed types of logical errors, even though they don't originate from a single line of code.

My guess is that your disk (or some other disk\\-related component, like a cable or your motherboard's disk controller circuitry) was on its last legs, and the \"exercise\" involved in installing Ubuntu caused it to fail. You don't say what prompted you to install Ubuntu, but if you were having problems with Windows reliability, it's possible that this was an earlier symptom of the problem.\n\nYou might try unplugging your disk (from both ends of the cable if it's a desktop system) and plugging it back in again.

What would be changed if I rephrase it as \"she finally asked\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under normal circumstances, \"finally asked\", and \"finally would ask\" are not quite the same. \n\n\"Asked\" is for an event that happened in the past. \"Would ask\" can be used in either of 2 ways: for an event that used to happen as a *general recurring pattern* (probably more than once) in the past, OR for an event which, *from a past perspective*, will happen in the future (i.e. the past tense of \"will ask\"). \n\nBut in this particular passage, I also am puzzled as to why the author chose to say \"she finally *would ask*\" (possibly repetitive action in the past) followed immediately by \"He murmur*ed*\"(simple past), and then another indication of habitual/recurring events, namely the phrase \"from one phone call to the next\". \n\nThis passage has a fascinating ambiguity to it that makes it hard to decide if this event really happened just once, or if it is part of a pattern of occurrences in the past, or if it the whole thing is taking place in the character's imagination.\n\nOr, it is possible that it's just bad writing, but if so, I would say it's \"good quality bad writing\", if that's possible.\n\nI do get the feeling that the female character is in a very distraught or mixed\\-up mental state, either because of emotion or mental illness, or maybe some other reason.

This interpretation is supported by the context of the passage, which describes a pattern of repeated phone calls and notes \"from one phone call to the next.\" The choice of this verb tense contributes to the ambiguity of the situation and may reflect the character's confused mental state or the repetitive nature of her interactions with the man she's infatuated with.
