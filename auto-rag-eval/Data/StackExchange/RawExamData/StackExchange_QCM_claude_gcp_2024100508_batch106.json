Personally, I frequently use $\\\\implies$ when doing mathematics, but I am curious in what situations each should be *correctly* used. \n\nAlthough I frequently use $\\\\implies$, I have realised that I often do it incorrectly; for instance, I am sometimes told that I should not have used an implication ($\\\\implies$) symbol, because the equation is not necessarily directly implied (or something along those lines). In the context of mathematics, it seems that my use of these symbols is sloppy, which itself signals a lack of understanding.\n\nWhat is the difference between $\\\\implies$, $\\\\Longleftarrow$, and $\\\\Longleftrightarrow$ in mathematics, and when is it appropriate/correct to use each? Please speak about this in the context of elementary (high school and early university) mathematics so that it is easily understandable. \n\nI would greatly appreciate it if people could please take the time clarify these concepts.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The use of $\\\\implies$ is appropriate if what follows it is a consequence of what precedes it. For example,\n$$x\\=5 \\\\implies x^2\\=25$$\nis a proper use. However in most contexts\n$$x^2\\=25 \\\\implies x\\=5$$\nis an invalid use, as from $x^2\\=25$ you'd not be able to conclude that $x\\=5$, since also $(\\-5\\)^2\\=25$. Note however in a context where you've established that $x$ is a natural number, the above use *is* valid, as in that case indeed, from $x^2\\=25$ you can conclude that $x\\=5$ (since $\\-5$ is not a natural number).\n\n$A\\\\impliedby B$ is exactly the same as $B\\\\implies A$, therefore e.g.\n$$x^2\\=25 \\\\impliedby x\\=5$$\nis a correct usage. You can use it if you for some reason want to tell the implication first. Which of the forms you use is a matter of style, as long as you make sure that the conclusion is on the pointy end of the arrow.\n\n$A\\\\iff B$ means that both $A\\\\implies B$ and $B\\\\implies A$ (resp. $A\\\\impliedby B$). It is used if either side follows from the other. For example,\n$$x^2\\=25 \\\\iff x\\=\\-5 \\\\lor x\\=5$$"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements correctly uses logical symbols in the context of elementary mathematics?\n\nA) x > 0 \u21d4 x^2 > 0\nB) x^2 = 4 \u21d2 x = 2\nC) x is even \u21d0 x is divisible by 4\nD) x = 3 \u21d2 x^2 = 9 \u21d0 x = -3\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\n\nA) This is incorrect. While x > 0 implies x^2 > 0, the reverse is not always true. For example, (-2)^2 > 0, but -2 is not greater than 0. The correct symbol here would be \u21d2, not \u21d4.\n\nB) This is incorrect. While x = 2 implies x^2 = 4, the reverse implication is not always true. x could also be -2. The statement should either use \u21d0 instead of \u21d2, or include both possibilities: x^2 = 4 \u21d4 x = 2 or x = -2.\n\nC) This is correct. The statement \"x is divisible by 4\" implies \"x is even\", but not vice versa. The \u21d0 symbol is used appropriately here, showing that the left side follows from the right side.\n\nD) This is incorrect. While both x = 3 and x = -3 imply x^2 = 9, the statement uses \u21d2 and \u21d0 inconsistently. It should either be x = 3 \u21d2 x^2 = 9 \u21d0 x = -3, or x = 3 \u21d2 x^2 = 9 \u21d2 x = -3 (noting that this second form would be incorrect logically)."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/04/13", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/5650366", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/680675/"], "docs_id": 5650366, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In my experience, even though there is a SQL standard, it is quite difficult to write SQL that works, unmodified, over a large number of RDBMS.\n\nThus, I'd like to know if there is a subset of SQL (including DDL, schemas, etc) that is known to work on all major RDBMS, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server and, last but not least, Oracle. What kind of pitfalls should be avoided when writing portable SQL?\n\nBy the way, is there a project whose goal is to translate a valid subset of SQL into the specific dialects used by all these vendors? I know that Hibernate and other ORM systems have to do this, but I don't want ORM, I want to write straight\\-to\\-database SQL.\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem is that some DBMS even ignore the most simple standards (e.g. like quoting characters or string concatenation). \n\nSo the following (100% ANSI SQL) does not run on every DBMS:\n\n```\nUPDATE some_table\n    SET some_column = some_column || '_more_data';\n\n```\n\nAnd I'M not even thinking about more advanced SQL standards like recursive common table expressions (even those that support it don't always comply) or windowing functions (some only implement a very narrow subset, some do not support all options).\n\nRegarding DDL, there is the problem with data types. `DATE` is not the same everywhere, just as `TIMESTAMP`. Not every DBMS has a `BOOLEAN` type or `TIME` type. \n\nWhen it comes to constraints or domains you get even more differences. \n\nSo in a nutshell: unless you really, **really** need to be DBMS independent, don't bother with it.\n\nHaving said all that: if you do have the choice between a proprietary and standard syntax do choose the standard syntax (`OUTER JOIN` vs `(+)` or `*=`, `decode` vs `CASE`, `nvl` vs. `coalesce` and so on)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about SQL portability across different database management systems (DBMS) is most accurate?\n\nA) All major DBMS fully support the ANSI SQL standard, making it easy to write portable SQL code.\n\nB) Using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools is the only way to achieve SQL portability across different DBMS.\n\nC) Sticking to basic SQL operations and avoiding advanced features guarantees full portability across all major DBMS.\n\nD) Even simple SQL operations and data types can have compatibility issues across different DBMS, making true portability challenging.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The documentation highlights that even simple SQL operations, such as string concatenation or basic data types like DATE and BOOLEAN, can vary across different DBMS. For example, the ANSI standard UPDATE statement using string concatenation (||) doesn't work on all systems. Additionally, data types like DATE, TIMESTAMP, and BOOLEAN are not uniformly implemented across all DBMS.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation clearly states that some DBMS ignore even the most simple standards.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while ORM tools can help with portability, they are not the only solution, and the question specifically mentions wanting to write straight-to-database SQL.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the documentation shows that even basic operations and data types can have compatibility issues, so avoiding advanced features alone doesn't guarantee portability.\n\nThe key takeaway is that true SQL portability across all major DBMS is challenging due to varying implementations of even basic SQL features and data types."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/10/15", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/191162", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/51457/"], "docs_id": 191162, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Since SSL is the backbone of the internet, (now technically called TLS), what are some good books I should read up on to understand all aspects of it.\n\nI suppose I'll need to learn some math, some PKI books, crypto, and Sysadmin books as well.

For the default Computer Modern font in LaTeX, the interword space has a natural width of 3.33pt, can stretch up to 1.66pt, and can shrink by 1.11pt. This flexibility allows for proper justification of text. Option A incorrectly swaps the stretch and shrink values. Options C and D present entirely incorrect arrangements of these values. It's important to note that these values are specific to the Computer Modern font and may vary for other fonts.

The fancyvrb package provides the \\fvset command, which allows setting various parameters for verbatim environments. The xleftmargin option specifically sets the left margin of the verbatim text. By setting it to \\mathindent, we ensure that the verbatim environment aligns with equation indentation when using the fleqn option.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the standard verbatim package doesn't provide a \\verbatimindent command.\n\nOption C is close, but incorrect.

The home network does not need internet to work internally. The router will still assign IP addresses, if the option is enabled and the network will still work. You just cannot connect to the internet or to your router from the internet. This is why a NAS like this will still work, but only on your internal network, which means only via WiFi provided by said router and from devices connected via Ethernet (LAN) cable. No access from the internet will be possible. This includes phones not connected to the internal WiFi.\n\nNAS means Network Attached Storage, which means, that the device is, in it's essence, a small computer with a connected hard drive. So all the storage remains locally and is, normally, not uploaded to the Internet, unless configured otherwise. The NAS is sharing access to the device via network folders and, most commonly, uses the [SMB Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block). Most NAS also provide other means of access, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and various others. \n\nIf this NAS is not allowing usage without Internet Access, then it is a serious flaw that should not exist and flat out a bad product. It is essentially doing what is commonly called \"phoning home\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A home network with a router and a NAS (Network Attached Storage) device loses internet connectivity.

A properly designed NAS operates independently of internet connectivity within the local network. The router continues to assign IP addresses and manage local network traffic even without an internet connection. This means devices connected to the router, whether through Wi-Fi or Ethernet, can still access the NAS. The NAS primarily uses protocols like SMB for local file sharing, which don't require internet access. Options A and D are incorrect because a well-designed NAS should not require internet connectivity for basic local network functionality.

It would be great for everyone who uses configurable products to fix that.\n\nIf somebody wants to see that, you can do it [here](http://installatron.com/magento/demo/hana-flat-charcoal) in magento demo store.\nI wasnt able to sort the sizes correctly.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Note:** It has been brought to my attention that this solution does not work for Magento 1\\.9\\.2\\. In order to save others wasted time I'd like to point this out at the top of this post. If I develop my own solution or find someone else's solution that works for 1\\.9\\.2 I will update this post at that time.\n\n**Notice:** The solution laid out here extends a block class file in Magento's core library. I reviewed Magento's source code prior to this approach and determined that there was not a good event to observe to avoid this approach. If in a future version of Magento this sorting issue is resolved, you may undo these changes below simply by disabling the extension in it's app/etc/modules XML file.\n\n**Step 1:** create the file **app/etc/modules/FirstScribe\\_CatalogOptionSortFix.xml** \n\nContents:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config>\n    <modules>\n        <FirstScribe_CatalogOptionSortFix>\n            <active>true</active>\n            <codePool>local</codePool>\n            <depends>\n                <Mage_Catalog />\n            </depends>\n        </FirstScribe_CatalogOptionSortFix>\n    </modules>\n</config>\n\n```\n\n**Note:** For step 2 and 3, create directories for these files as necessary. For example, you may already have the directory **app/code/local**, or you may not, depending on what extensions you have already installed on your site.\n\n**Step 2:** Create the file **app/code/local/FirstScribe/CatalogOptionSortFix/etc/config.xml**\n\nContents:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!--\n/**\n * Magento 1.9.1.0 has a bug in that the configurable options are sorted

The audio is AC coupled to the PCM1803 chip input, just look at the example schematics in the datasheet. The PCM1803 applies a 2\\.5V bias to the input analog signal so that it doesn't go below 0V if the 3Vpp condition for the input singal is met.

The signal oscillates between negative and positive voltages. Which of the following approaches is the most appropriate for handling this input signal with the PCM1803 chip?\n\nA) Use an ADC that can directly handle negative voltages, such as the Maxim part mentioned\nB) Implement a voltage level shifter circuit to lift the audio signal to a purely positive range\nC) Use AC coupling with a capacitor and rely on the PCM1803's internal 2.5V bias\nD) Redesign the stage box to output only positive voltages\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to use AC coupling with a capacitor and rely on the PCM1803's internal 2.5V bias. This method is recommended in the PCM1803 datasheet and is a standard practice for audio ADC designs. The AC coupling capacitor blocks any DC component of the input signal, allowing the chip's internal 2.5V bias to center the signal within its input range without affecting the audio source.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using an ADC that handles negative voltages, like the Maxim part, is unnecessary and not optimal for audio applications. \n\nOption B is incorrect because implementing a voltage level shifter is more complex and can potentially introduce noise or distortion to the audio signal. \n\nOption D is incorrect and impractical, as it would require redesigning the source equipment rather than adapting the ADC circuit to work with standard audio signals."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/06/08", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/309834", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/125197/"], "docs_id": 309834, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to sense the current through a wire, and so far I decided to use a 1mOhm shunt resistor to convert it to voltage.

(duh on my part) So I want to use 110V across the 220V primary leads to give me half the voltage at each secondary, resulting in a single secondary of 32V and a center tap.\n\nI know that this works because I have done it and observed that the output is 32V RMS with a center tap, but I want to make sure I'm not throwing away half the VA rating by doing so. I read TONS about transformers trying to get a definitive answer to this, and I think that the core saturation and the secondary wire size and associated voltage drop and heat are the main concerns, along with the fact that the ratio of number of turns is proportional to the ratio of the voltages and inversely proportional to the ratio of the currents in the primary and secondary. So on those points, I think I'm not reducing the usable 200VA, with the possible exception of secondary wire heating.\n\nTo illustrate what I mean using the image below, I would wire\\-nut the middle black and red primary wires together and connect 110V across the top red and bottom black wires. And on the secondary, I would connect the middle blue and green wires and use that connection as my center tap. I would use the top green and the bottom blue wires as my supply rails and there would be 32V RMS across these rails.

The Amps will be unchanged, that's limited by wire heating. You've halved the Volts, so you've halved the VA, to first order at least. Running the core at half the field reduces the core losses, so the thermal load on the transformer is not quite so high. This means you can increase the thermal loading on the copper a little, at the expense of voltage drop aka voltage regulation. Maybe then the rated VA has only fallen to 55% and not to 50% of what it was.\n\nIf you have a centre\\-tapped 32 V, ie 16\\-0\\-16, you can bridge rectify that to about \\+/\\- 22 V. If you want \\+/\\- 45 V (that is, a total of 90 V from positive to negative, with ground in the middle), then the simplest way to get there is with a centre\\-tapped 64 V secondary (two 32 V secondaries in series), leaving your transformer configured and supplied as it sounds like it was meant to be, and like my audio amp transformer is.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Vyrj.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f8Vyrj.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An audio amplifier designer has a 200VA, 32V transformer without a center tap, but needs a center-tapped secondary for their design. They propose using 110V across the 220V primary to achieve this. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this approach?\n\nA) This method will maintain the full 200VA rating of the transformer without any significant drawbacks.\n\nB) This approach will reduce the VA rating to approximately 100VA, but the core losses will remain unchanged.\n\nC) The VA rating will be reduced to about 50-55% of the original, primarily due to halving the input voltage while maintaining the same current limit.\n\nD) This method will double the current capacity of the secondary windings, effectively increasing the VA rating to 400VA.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When using half the rated input voltage (110V instead of 220V), the maximum current remains limited by wire heating, but the voltage is halved. This results in approximately halving the VA rating. However, running the core at half the field reduces core losses slightly, which may allow for a small increase in copper loading. As a result, the effective VA rating is reduced to about 50-55% of the original 200VA, not exactly half. Options A and D are incorrect as they overestimate the available power. Option B is partially correct about the VA reduction but incorrectly states that core losses remain unchanged."}, "20": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/05/25", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/100006", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/28524/"], "docs_id": 100006, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am fairly sure that I understand the how Monte Carlo integration works but I am not understanding the formulation of how it is used to estimate Pi.

Pi is equal to 4 times the area of a quarter of the unit circle.

Maybe show how that integral was derived in a step\\-by\\-step way?\n\nEDIT:\n\nI was able to gain a better understanding by relating the expectation to an area.

First start with relating Pi to the area of the top\\-right quadrant of the unit circle\n\n$\\\\pi\\=4\\\\times A\\_{tr}$\n\nThen we place the top\\-right quadrant into the unit square.

It follows that the following equality holds\n\n$P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)\\=\\\\frac{A\\_{tr}}{A\\_{square}}$\n\nand $A\\_{square}\\=1$ so\n\n$P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)\\=A\\_{tr}$\n\nAnd substituting into the original equation\n\n$\\\\pi\\=4\\\\times P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)$\n\nand it is also true that $P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)\\=E\\[I(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)]$ which is equal to the original double integral.\n\nSo I understood it by relating the area to a probability then relating that probability to an expectation that is equivalent to the integral. Let me know if I have made any mistakes.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The area of a circle circle of radius $l$ is equal to $\\\\pi l^2$. It means that a quarter of circle has area $l^2\\\\pi/4$. This means that the square with side the radius of the circle as $area\\=l^2$. \n\nThis means that the ratio between the area of a quarter of circle and the area of the square is $\\\\pi/4$. \n\nA point $(x,y) $ is in the square if $ 0\\<x\\<1, 0\\<y\\<1$. \nand it is in the quarter of circle if $ 0\\<x\\<1, 0\\<y\\<1 ,x^2\\+y^2\\<1$. \n\nYour integral is so $\u222cI((x^2\\+y^2\\)\\<1\\)P(x,y)\\= \u222cI((x^2\\+y^2\\)\\<1\\) I(0\\<x\\<1\\)I(0\\<y\\<1\\)$ That is exactly the area described by a quarter of circle\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wh7mG.gif)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the Monte Carlo integration method for estimating \u03c0:\n\nQuestion: In a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate \u03c0, 10,000 random points are generated within a 1x1 square. 7,854 of these points fall within the inscribed quarter circle. Based on this information, calculate the estimated value of \u03c0 and determine which of the following statements is correct:\n\nA) The estimated value of \u03c0 is 3.1416, which is more accurate than the true value of \u03c0 to 4 decimal places.\n\nB) The estimated value of \u03c0 is 3.1416, which underestimates the true value of \u03c0 by approximately 0.0001.\n\nC) The estimated value of \u03c0 is 3.1416, which overestimates the true value of \u03c0 by approximately 0.0001.\n\nD) The estimated value of \u03c0 is 3.1416, which is exactly equal to the true value of \u03c0 to 4 decimal places.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nTo estimate \u03c0 using this Monte Carlo method, we use the formula:\n\u03c0 \u2248 4 * (points inside circle / total points)\n\nIn this case:\n\u03c0 \u2248 4 * (7,854 / 10,000) = 4 * 0.7854 = 3.1416\n\nThe true value of \u03c0 to 5 decimal places is 3.14159.\n\nThe estimated value (3.1416) is slightly less than the true value, underestimating it by about 0.0001. This makes option B the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the estimate is not more accurate than the true value.\nOption C is incorrect because the estimate underestimates, not overestimates, the true value.\nOption D is incorrect because the estimate is close to, but not exactly equal to, the true value of \u03c0 to 4 decimal places."}, "21": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/11/29", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/622097", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/442259/"], "docs_id": 622097, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When a line of the b.txt file is matched, I would like to modify the a.txt line in entrance (ie replace $1 by $2 of the b.txt file) but it doesn't work.\n\n**Inputs**\n\n```\n*a.txt*\n201 A B 580 D1\n208 A B 581 D2\n214 A B 582 D3\n\n*b.txt*\n10 101 E1 A Z1 B Z2 580 Z3\n11 104 E2 C Z1 B Z2 581 Z3\n12 107 E3 A Z1 B Z2 581 Z3\n14 111 E3 B Z1 S Z2 582 Z3\n15 116 E2 A Z1 B Z2 582 Z3\n\n```\n\n**Outputs**\n\n```\n*c.txt*\n101 A B 580 D1\n107 A B 581 D2\n116 A B 582 D3\n10 101 E1 A Z1 B Z2 580 Z3\n12 107 E3 A Z1 B Z2 581 Z3\n15 116 E2 A Z1 B Z2 582 Z3\n\n```\n\n**MyCode**\n\n```\nawk 'NR==FNR{pattern[$0]; next} {if($4\" \"$6\" \"$8 in pattern) {print $0; gsub(pattern[$1],$2); print pattern[$0]}}' a.txt b.txt >> c.txt\n\n```\n\nWhat's wrong with my code, I have no result ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Answer to revised question:\n\n```\nawk 'NR==FNR {$1=\"\"; afile[$2, $3, $4]=$0; next; }\n    (($4, $6, $8) in afile){ print $2 afile[$4, $6, $8]; }1' a.txt b.txt\n\n```\n\n---\n\nValid for old revision of the question:\n\n```\n$ awk 'NR==FNR { afile[$2, $3, $4]=1; next; } \n       (($4, $6, $8) in afile){ print $2, $4 ,$6 , $8; }1' a.txt b.txt >c.txt\n\n```\n\nread the `a.txt` only columns 2, 3 and 4 into an associated array called `afile`; then compare on corresponding columns on the second file `b.txt` on 4, 6 and 8, if there were seen in the array so print the desired columns from the second file `$1` intact and rest of the columns 4, 6 and 8 as well; else print by default `1` for unmatched lines.\n\nResult `c.txt`:\n\n```\n101 A B 580\n10 101 E1 A Z1 B Z2 580 Z3\n11 104 E2 C Z1 B Z2 581 Z3\n107 A B 581\n12 107 E3 A Z1 B Z2 581 Z3\n14 111 E3 B Z1 S Z2 582 Z3\n116 A B 582\n15 116 E2 A Z1 B Z2 582 Z3\n\n```\n\n---\n\nBut your codes issues:\n\n```\nawk 'NR==FNR{pattern[$0]; next} {if($4\" \"$6\" \"$8 in pattern) {print $0; gsub(pattern[$1],$2); print pattern[$0]}}' a.txt b.txt >> c.txt\n\n```\n\n1. `pattern[$0]`: with this you add each entire line into the *pattern* associated array from the first input \"`a.txt`\";\n2. next you compare columns \\#4, \\#6 and \\#8 with `$4\" \"$6\" \"$8` from the second file `b.txt` on against the lines in that array; these will never match, since you are comparing entire lines with specific columns values that do not exist in your *pattern* array.\n3. since step 2 never meet your inner block for if statement also never run; and I'm not going to explain that what you are doing with that."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Given two input files a.txt and b.txt, you want to modify lines in a.txt based on matching patterns in b.txt.

This is not to say the Professional version will lack the features, but the license will specifically prohibit the developer from using the compiler for a specific class of development, even with 3rd party or home grown solutions.\n\n**So my question is if there is a precedent of a compiler or similar creative tool prohibiting the class of work you can use it for.

Also I know that a lot of computing software and equipment will have a disclaimer that it is not for use in \"life support equipment\" or \"nuclear power\" but that is more of avoiding liability than prohibiting activity.\n\nSeems like I recall Microsoft putting a restriction in FrontPage that you couldn't use it to create a web site that reflected poorly on Microsoft, but they pulled that restriction before it could be tested legally.\n\n**Update:** The EULA was dropped before the product shipped because of public resistance. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's not entirely unprecedented. \n\nSQL Server is limited by users/server/database size, etc., effectively limiting its use as a client'server platform, and it's essentially a programming environment (albeit one with a rich data infrastructure).

The base station could have more transmission and receiving power than the client, which should be portable (ideally, it should be light and battery powered). The data rate is very low with a 30 character string being transmitted every 10 minutes.\n\nI saw that XBee\\-PRO\u00ae 868 modules claim a range of 80\u00a0km in LOS, but in a severe environment like a wild mountain place, how well would it perform? What are the alternatives?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As with any radio system the bottom line is what can be achieved without the hindrance of obstacles. In free\\-space the baseline is dependent on what frequency you transmit at and how sensitive your receiver can be. The power path loss equation is this:\n\nLoss (dB) \\= 32\\.45 \\+ 20\\\\$log\\_{10}\\\\$(f) \\+ 20\\\\$log\\_{10}\\\\$(d)\n\nWhere f is in MHz and d is in kilometres. This equation tells you how many dB of power loss you can expect at a given distance with a given carrier frequency.\n\nIt's formulated from work by [Harald T. Friis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_T._Friis) and a decent reference is [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_path_loss). It doesn't assume any gain in the antennas, so it is a real baseline. Antenna gain brings lower path loss but greater directionality, and for a dipole the gain is about 1\\.76\u00a0dB.\n\nIf you are transmitting 10\u00a0dBm (10\u00a0mW) at 100\u00a0MHz over a distance of 10\u00a0km, you can expect to receive a power of:\n\n10\u00a0dBm \\- (32\\.45 \\+ 40 \\+ 20\\)\u00a0dBm \\= \\-82\\.45\u00a0dBm (5\\.7\u00a0nW)\n\nHow much power does your receiver need? A useful equation is this:\n\nPower (dBm) needed by a receiver is \\-154\u00a0dBm \\+ 10\\\\$log\\_{10}\\\\$(data rate) and as you have a data rate that is quite low you can expect better performance than [Wi\\-Fi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi)!\n\nThe question states 30 characters every ten minutes. I'm going to assume that this is transmitted as a burst of 30 x 10\u00a0bits in 10 seconds plus a preamble of 100 bits to get the receiver locked in \\- that's 400\u00a0bits in 10 seconds or 40\u00a0bits per second.\n\nThe receiver power required is therefore \\-154\u00a0dBm \\+ 10\\\\$log\\_{10}\\\\$(40\\) dBm \\= \\-138\u00a0dBm\n\nThis assumes that the transmitter and receiver are bespoke items designed to run with this low data rate. It's not easy to get a receiver sensitivity below \\-120\u00a0dBm, so whatever radio system you use read the small print and investigate. Off\\-the\\-shelf items are probably incable of transmitting at very low data rates, so they should be avoided.\n\nAnyway, you need to receive \\-138\u00a0dBm and, over 10\u00a0km with a 100\u00a0MHz carrier, you can expect to receive \\-82\\.45\u00a0dBm. This sounds good enough considering that you may get a few more dBs from antenna gain. \n\nBut on earth, no matter what the terrain appears to be, there will be added attenuations that are really difficult to account for and describe here. There's a thing called fade margin and this, as a rule of thumb basically says \\- try to ensure your received power is at least 20\u00a0dB greater than its baseline sensitivity \\- this means that if you designed a receiver requiring \\-120\u00a0dBm you should expect to receive \\-100\u00a0dBm on a good day.\n\nGiven the terrain I'd hazard a wild guess that you need to have 20\u00a0dB more up your sleeve and this just about brings you to being able to get 10\u00a0km from a 10\u00a0mW transmission.\n\nHopefully you now have the formulae to work out what power you need to get 15\u00a0km. Another helpful fact is that the target may not be moving very fast and can be tracked from one end using a high gain antenna such as a [Yagi\\-Uda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagi-Uda_antenna) antenna. You might have seen wild\\-life films where a bear or a puma has a radio transmitter attached to them and some guy in a field is pointing the Yagi\\-Uda antenna this way and that in order to locate the direction the animal is in. This might work to improve things."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A radio communication system is being designed for a mountainous environment with a 15 km distance between the base station and client.

Add 20 dB fade margin:\n   Required sensitivity with fade margin = -138 dBm + 20 dB = -118 dBm\n\n5. Compare received power (-93.97 dBm) to required sensitivity (-118 dBm):\n   The received power is about 24 dB above the required sensitivity.\n\n6. Choose appropriate receiver sensitivity:\n   We need a sensitivity that's about 20 dB more sensitive than the received power.\n   -93.97 dBm + 20 dB \u2248 -74 dBm\n\nThe closest option is -100 dBm, which provides a good balance between the required sensitivity and the fade margin.

If your PSU is major source of heat because it's too weak, obtaining more powerful one will make PSU produce less heat. This way it could reduce system temperature, but if your PSU isn't overloaded, there will not be any major difference and probably no measurable difference. \n\nJust so you know, if the GPU is overtaxing the PSU, PSU will overheat and not GPU.

Really cheap ones may die in such cases.\n\nBy the way, for system such as yours, I'd definitely buy better PSU.

Upgrading to a more powerful PSU may indirectly help the GPU run cooler, but only if the current PSU is a major source of heat due to being overtaxed. A more powerful PSU will produce less heat when not operating at its limit, potentially reducing overall system temperature. However, the effect on GPU temperature may be minimal or even unnoticeable if the current PSU isn't significantly overloaded. It's important to note that if a GPU is overtaxing a PSU, it's typically the PSU that overheats, not the GPU.

This policy is strictly enforced by moderators and high\\-reputation users likewise.\n\nWhile Code Review has a significantly different model than Stackoverflow, there is a common element:\n\n> Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; Teach a man to fish, you will feed him for the rest of his life\n\nAs a result of this policy, users gain significant understanding of the subject matter which results in huge learning effects, making the internet a better place not only for these single users, but for all people who read such answers. Also answers are *subjectively* of higher quality in the mean.\n\nCode\\-Only answers is equivalent to handing out free fish, and it's a strengthening factor for the problems I mentioned above. I think it's one of the reasons that FGITW *works*, that people post \"Can I haz teh codez\" questions **and receive answers**.\n\nAdditionally free fish often results in users not understanding the code they use later and when the time comes to modify it, they have \"no choice\" but to ask another Stackoverflow question, which shows similarly lacking understanding. This just amplifies the flood of questions.\n\nMoreover every so often new\\-ish users join the ranks of community\\-moderation and time and time again they come to meta asking why code\\-only answers are not deleted. I conclude they intuitively *think* that code\\-only answers **should be** delete material. And time and time again the wall \"Code\\-Only\" is an attempted answer, so it shouldn't be deleted stops them in their tracks. Even experienced community moderators with thousands and thousands of reviews under their belts say (freely adapted):\n\n> I usually either use \"delete\" or \"skip\" for code\\-only answers in the VLQQ. From a curation standpoint these answers are useless.\n\nOverall code\\-only answers are big signal that SO shouldn't want to send in my opinion.\n\nI understand that there is users, who are not good with formulating explanatory text.[1](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/262695/1803692) But I think the \"damage\" done by enabling no\\-effort users and *at best* mediocre answers is higher than the damage from explicitly putting such answers up ~~nuking~~ cleanup.\n\nAm I assessing this situation wrongly, or should we start curating such answers more aggressively (by editing or even deleting)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I tend to think repeatedly, \"look to the questions, not the answers.\"\n\nIf someone asks a question like:\n\n> I've been unable to turn on the computer. I've tried opening it,\n>  looking inside at things I don't understand. A google search on the\n>  topic didn't reveal any insight. I tried cleaning the case and making\n>  it shiny. I tried pushing the on button twice in a row really quickly,\n>  still no avail. I've been trying to study electrical engineering to\n>  help me understand what is going on, but as of yet, I've been unable\n>  to turn on this computer for the past 6 months. I'm running out of\n>  ideas. Does anyone have any suggested steps to help me diagnose or\n>  solve my problem?\n\n... and the best answer could be,\n\n> Try plugging the cord you see in the back to an electrical socket.\n\nThat could be the precise solution, and the one that gets all the up\\-votes.\n\nEven though that's not a code\\-only answer, I see it as pretty much the same thing. It's terse, straight\\-to\\-the\\-point, has little educational value beyond providing the author of the question with an immediate answer. It provides the free fish.\n\nThe extreme opposite kind of fishing rod in this case might end up going into how electricity works, starting with a history revolving around Benjamin Franklin, and then healthy levels in between these two ends.\n\nYet that would hardly be the right place and time for someone to share his/her expertise on the matter in a way that would be exposed and educational for many others. It might even be seen as a poor answer to the question and down\\-voted to oblivion.\n\nIt's why I think the more we get closer to a fishing rod answer, the more it can only be effectively provided for a reasonably general question. *\"How do computers conduct electricity?\"* Now the experts have excuses to compose very detailed answers and even *compete* to provide the most accurate and detailed response, even going into a deep background covering topics like history. They start correcting each other on little inaccuracies and getting into really expert\\-territory discussions about the accuracy of their answers. These moments, albeit rare, are when SO starts to become outright *magical*, doing something few other community sites do.\n\nThe question might even be posed in the context of someone lazy and seeking a homework solution. The context matters little to me, the experts have already been given an excuse to compete to build the best fishing rod they can. What matters is that such a question can leave something behind that may catch the attention of many and educate a whole bunch of people.\n\nSO's voting system is most effective when it's used for quality control in this kind of context, in a question where the quality of the answer is highly variable and not chiseled down to a binary \"is it correct or not?\" kind of answer based on the narrow applicability of the question.\n\nBut a troubleshooting question often wants a fast answer. Those are so narrowly chiseled down to a black and white, *\"Did the answer solve the problem or did it not? If yes, how quickly was it provided?\"* That becomes the \"quality\" metric in those troubleshooting scenarios: speed.\n\nSo I really think the problem is the question. I don't think it's very effective to try to curate answers providing terse or code\\-only answers. Sometimes they are the \"best\" answer as most would judge based on the context of the question. The question sets the stage. So I really think if we want to even find more incentives to provide fishing rods, we need to encourage questions that seek those kinds of answers."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the discussion, which of the following approaches is most likely to encourage high-quality, educational answers on Stack Overflow?\n\nA) Aggressively deleting code-only answers to discourage low-effort responses\nB) Enforcing a policy that all answers must include detailed explanations along with any code\nC) Focusing on encouraging more general, conceptual questions rather than narrow troubleshooting queries\nD) Implementing a mandatory waiting period before answers can be posted to prevent the \"Fastest Gun in the West\" problem\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The top answer emphasizes \"look to the questions, not the answers.\" It argues that narrow troubleshooting questions often lead to terse, immediate solutions (like code-only answers) because that's what the question demands.

This time the Git repository was not empty. It had .gitIgnore file before hand. This time fore\\-mentioned message did not appear.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's not the upstream *repository* (`origin` itself) but rather the specific branch you cloned (`master` on origin) that is missing.\n\nMoreover, git's message is misleading: the branch `master` on origin did not *go away*, it was *never there*. When you cloned the empty repository, it had no branches at all. It continued to have no branches. Hence, your local `master`, which was set to track `origin/master`, was (is) tracking a branch that did (does) not exist.\n\nThe message is meant more for a situation like this:\n\n```\n$ git clone ...\n$ git checkout featureX   # track some feature branch\n[go away for a week, come back]\n$ git fetch -p            # update remote branches\n\n```\n\nwhere, during that week you were away, the `featureX` branch was deleted (presumably merged into its development line and then no longer needed). At this point you're on a local branch, `featureX`, set to track remote\\-branch `origin/featureX`, but there is no `origin/featureX` any more.\n\nIn this case, though, you have local branch `master` tracking `origin/master` when there is no `origin/master` *yet*. Once you create it (via the push that makes the repository non\\-empty), the problem will go away. This cropped up only because by default you start with `master` even if the remote is empty and does not actually have a `master` yet."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided Git documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer clones an empty Git repository and receives a warning message.

When cloning an empty repository, there are no branches on the remote. The local master branch is set to track origin/master by default, even though it doesn't exist yet on the remote.

By creating a functional interface (CustomerOperation) and passing lambda expressions or method references to a common input method, we achieve flexibility in method calls while keeping the input logic centralized. This approach allows for easy addition of new operations without modifying the common input method.\n\nOption A, using a static utility class, would require modifying the utility method each time a new operation is added, violating the Open-Closed Principle.\n\nOption B, the Strategy pattern with concrete classes, is a valid object-oriented approach but introduces more complexity and boilerplate code compared to the functional interface solution.\n\nOption D, using reflection, is powerful but can lead to runtime errors, reduced type safety, and decreased performance.

I want to make all the methods consistent, but I'm not sure how to handle the number of arguments some API routes accept. One API request accepts up to 30 arguments.

Currently, I'm writing it to accept the required arguments as method paramaters, while all the optional ones are accepted in a final \"additionalOptions\" array.\n\n```\npublic function sampleApiMethod($reqVal1, $reqVal2, $additionalOptions) {\n    //Method Code\n}\n\n```\n\nUnfortunately, there are API requests that have only optional arguments. In this case, either the only parameter is the array of options, or the method has individual parameters for optional arguments. When only passing an array, the method is consistent with the other methods, but it's not the most intuitive. With the latter option, I lose the consistent structure. Is there any sort of best practice or structure for an API wrapper that I should follow to try to have a consistent developer usage experience? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a couple good ways to handle this and it really comes down to your personal preference and just how complex your API interface really is. For a simple complexity interface I would increase the number of functions to be just the most specific calls to a given set of use cases. You might be lucky and find that if there are only 10 different use case actions where an actor might need different combinations of required and optional arguments then one might just create ten different functions for this.\n\nThis may not be the best solution however if there are a large combination of arguments and use cases to consider.\n\nCheck out the [Builder Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern#PHP)\n\nThe premise of the Builder pattern is that your object class will contain a special builder class object that can construct your object through function calls that return the same object. This allows for fluid code that is much more verbose and clear to a client of the API. This can be much more useful in representing a function's parameters than an extremely long list of arguments and prevents the common problem of a client accidentally mismatching arguments. The client is forced to be verbose in building his arguments.\n\nsendPizza ( pizzaBuilder\\-\\>buildPeppers()\\-\\>buildSausage()\\-\\>etc...)\n\nOne is able to instantly look at the client code and decipher the breadth of arguments passed to sendPizza."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When designing a PHP API wrapper for a third-party API with varying numbers of optional arguments, which of the following approaches is recommended for maintaining consistency and providing a good developer experience?\n\nA) Always use a single array parameter for all arguments, both required and optional, in every method.\n\nB) Use individual parameters for required arguments and a final array parameter for all optional arguments.\n\nC) Implement the Builder pattern, allowing method chaining to set optional parameters before making the API call.\n\nD) Create separate methods for every possible combination of optional parameters.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Builder pattern (option C) is recommended as the best practice for handling complex APIs with many optional parameters. It allows for a consistent and intuitive developer experience by enabling method chaining to set optional parameters. This approach is more flexible than using a single array (A) or separating required and optional parameters (B), which can become unwieldy with many options. It's also more maintainable than creating separate methods for every combination (D), which could lead to an explosion of method definitions.

Rocks, arrows, skulls and pots all work. So do weapons and other carriable items.\n* Dead or alive bodies (damsels, cavemen, etc) will soak up the arrow for you \\- even if you're carrying them, regardless of which direction you are facing.\n* Throw a mystery box or a supply crate in front of the trap. The arrow will open the box and release the item.\n* Whip a wearable item to move it forward in front of the trap.\n* Blow up the trap with a bomb. Watch out for the arrow, as this will not be destroyed and can sometimes fly up into the air.\n* Destroy the trap with a mattock.\n* Throw a rope down in front of the trap. If you crouch next to a ledge and use a rope it will go downwards.\n* You can pick up critters (rat, frog, penguin, cricket) and drop them down in front of the arrow trap to set it off. Critters you are carrying will also soak up arrows, like bodies.\n* You can hit an arrow with your whip as long as there is at least two spaces between you and the trap.\n* It is possible to trigger an arrow trap but avoid the arrow if you are falling fast enough and there are enough spaces between you and the trap. Be careful, however, as the arrow can ricochet off walls and spear you anyway.\n\nYou will always begin the game next to a throwable item. Pick it up and carry it with you to disable any arrow traps you come across. Try to find a throwable item to carry to the next level with you as well.\n\nIf you have a dead body, or you find a critter, carry that with you to soak up any arrows.

This is likely due to them having identical MAC addresses, which causes the NAT DHCP to assign the same IP. Ensuring each guest has a unique MAC address is the first and most crucial step in resolving this issue. Once the MAC addresses are unique, the DHCP should assign different IP addresses, allowing the guests to communicate without conflicts. This solution addresses the root cause of the problem without requiring major network configuration changes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because port forwarding alone won't solve the IP conflict.\nOption B could work but is a more complex solution than necessary and doesn't address the underlying cause.\nOption D is unnecessary and may create other networking issues."}, "49": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/10/04", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/565398", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/226028/"], "docs_id": 565398, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have written the following code in LaTeX for three tables.

I have used it before without enforcing the foreign key that goes to multiple different tables. I had to take care of all the relationships in code. Generally it's considered a bad idea.\n\nThe \"right\" way is to have a `CardLocation`, `PhotographLocation`, etc. tables each with its own Guid primary key (e.g. `CardLocationId`). If you happen to need to hang common data off each relationship, then you create another table called `LocationRelationship` and you make the primary key of the relationship tables (e.g. `CardLocationId`) also a foreign key that references the `LocationRelationshipId`. So, each record in `CardLocation` has a corresponding record in `LocationRelationship`. That way you can enforce all the relationships in the relational database. Unfortunately it's a lot more complicated.\n\nEdit\n----\n\nAfter thinking a bit more, the other way to do it is to have `Card`, `Photograph`, etc., all derive from a common base (let's call it `Locatable`). So you create a new table called `Locatable` with primary key `LocatableId`. Then `CardId` is both a primary key and should also be a foreign key that references `LocatableId`, and `PhotographId` is a foreign key to `LocatableId` as well. Then you just have one many\\-to\\-many table called `LocatableLocation` with foreign keys to `LocatableId` and `LocationId`.\n\nThat's fewer tables and seems to imply the intent better."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is designing a database schema for a system that needs to associate multiple types of items (Cards, Photographs, Illustrations, and Vectors) with locations in a many-to-many relationship.

This involves creating a base table called Locatable with a primary key LocatableId.

This time I want to focus on motion. I've got a laser accelerometer on my desk. It tells me that I'm accelerating at $9\\.8\\~\\\\rm m/s^2$. For the first experiment I'm travelling in space. I pick a nearby star and discover that I move about $490$ meters in $10$ seconds from that star. For the next experiment I'm on the surface of Earth. I measure the same acceleration with my laser accelerometer. I pick a spot (the center of the Earth) and discover I don't move at all in $10$ seconds. How is acceleration without motion possible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In relativity (both flavours) we consider trajectories in four dimensional spacetime, and acceleration is a four\\-vector not a three\\-vector as in Newtonian mechanics. We call this [four\\-acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration) while the Newtonian acceleration is normally referred to as *coordinate acceleration*.\n\nSupoose we pick some coordinate system $(t,x,y,z)$ and measure the trajectory of some observer in these coordinates. The way we usually do this is to express the value of the coordinates as a function of the [proper time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time) of the observer, $\\\\tau$. That is the position is given by the functions $\\\\left(t(\\\\tau), x(\\\\tau), y(\\\\tau), z(\\\\tau)\\\\right)$. The proper time $\\\\tau$ is just the time recorded by a clock travelling with the observer, so we are describing the trajectory by how the position in our coordinates changes with the observer's time.\n\nIf we start by considering special relativity, i.e. flat spacetime, then the four\\-velocity and four\\-acceleration are calculated by differentiating once and twice respectively wrt time, just like in Newtonian mechanics. However we differentiate wrt the proper time $\\\\tau$. So the four\\-velocity $U$ and four\\-acceleration $A$ are:\n\n$$ \\\\mathbf U \\= \\\\left( \\\\frac{dt}{d\\\\tau}, \\\\frac{dx}{d\\\\tau}, \\\\frac{dy}{d\\\\tau}, \\\\frac{dz}{d\\\\tau} \\\\right) $$\n\n$$ \\\\mathbf A \\= \\\\left( \\\\frac{d^2t}{d\\\\tau^2}, \\\\frac{d^2x}{d\\\\tau^2}, \\\\frac{d^2y}{d\\\\tau^2}, \\\\frac{d^2z}{d\\\\tau^2} \\\\right) $$\n\nThe four acceleration defined in this way is coordinate independent, and it behaves in a very similar way to Newtonian acceleration. For example we can (though we usually don't) write a relativistic equivalent of Newton's second law:\n\n$$ \\\\mathbf F \\= m \\\\mathbf A $$\n\nwhere $\\\\mathbf F$ is the [four\\-force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-force).\n\nTo complete the comparison with Newtonian mechanics we can choose our $(t,x,y,z)$ to be the coordinates in which the accelerating observer is momntarily at rest, and in these coordinates the four\\-acceleration becomes the [proper acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration), which is just the acceleration felt by the observer. Let me emphasise this because we'll use it later:\n\n> the four\\-acceleration is equal to the acceleration felt by the observer in their rest frame.\n\nAnyhow, this is all in flat spacetime, and in flat spacetime a non\\-zero four\\-acceleration means that in every inertial frame the position of the observer is changing with time. This ties up with the first part of your paragraph where you're talking about your position relative to a star changing with time. However in general relativity the expression for the four\\-acceleration has to include effects due to the curvature, and it becomes:\n\n$$ A^\\\\alpha \\= \\\\frac{d^2x^\\\\alpha}{d\\\\tau^2} \\+ \\\\Gamma^\\\\alpha\\_{\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\nu}U^\\\\mu U^\\\\nu \\\\tag{1} $$\n\nI've written this using Einstein notation as it's rather long to write out otherwise. The index $\\\\alpha$ is zero for $t$, one for $x$, two for $y$ and three for $z$. The new parameters $\\\\Gamma^\\\\alpha\\_{\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\nu}$ in the equation are the [Christoffel symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols) that describe how the spacetime is curved.\n\nThe difference from flat spacetime is that now we can have a (locally) inertial frame, where the spatial coordinates are not changing with time, and we can still have a non\\-zero four\\-acceleration. That is even if $x$, $y$ and $z$ are constant, so $d^2x/d\\\\tau^2$ etc are zero, the contribution from the Christoffel symbols means the four\\-acceleration $\\\\mathbf A$ can still be non\\-zero.\n\nAnd in general relativity it's still true that the four acceleration is the same as the acceleration felt by the observer in their rest frame, and this is the link to the second part of your question. Because of the curvature you can be (spatially) at rest on the surface of the Earth with respect to the distant star but still have a non\\-zero four\\-acceleration. But remember that above we said:\n\n> the four\\-acceleration is equal to the acceleration felt by the observer in their rest frame.\n\nThat means even though you are at rest in your coordinates your non\\-zero four\\-acceleration means you still feel an acceleration. That acceleration is of course just what we call gravity.\n\n**Response to comment: Moving in a straight line**\n\nThe obvious way to define motion in a straight line is to say that the acceleration is zero. In Newtonian mechanics this is just Newton's first law, where the acceleration is the coordinate acceleration $\\\\mathbf a$. Likewise in relativity (both flavours) a straight line means the four\\-acceleration $\\\\mathbf A$, defined by equation (1\\) above, is zero. Looking at equation (1\\), the only way for $\\\\mathbf A$ is if the $dx^\\\\alpha/d\\\\tau^2$ term exactly balances out the Christoffel symbol i.e.\n\n$$ \\\\frac{d^2x^\\\\alpha}{d\\\\tau^2} \\= \\-\\\\Gamma^\\\\alpha\\_{\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\nu}U^\\\\mu U^\\\\nu \\\\tag{2} $$\n\nThis equation is called the [geodesic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics_in_general_relativity), and it describes the trajectory of a freely falling particle in a curved spacetime. That is, it is the equation for a straight line in curved spacetime or more formally a [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic).\n\nActually solving the geodesic equation is usually hard (like most things in GR) but for an overview of how this equation describes things falling in Earth's gravity see [How does \"curved space\" explain gravitational attraction?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/222390/how-does-curved-space-explain-gravitational-attraction).\n\n**Footnote: The elevator, the rocket, and gravity: the equivalence principle**\n\nThe above discussion provides a nice way to understand the elevator/rocket description of the equivalence principle. [See this article for a full discussion](http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/equivalence_principle), but in brief suppose you are inside a lift with the doors closed so you can't see out. You can feel a force pulling you down with an acceleration of $1$g, but you can't tell if the lift is stationary on the Earth and you're feeling gravity, or if you're in outer space and the lift has been attached to a rocket accelerating at $1$g.\n\nTo see why this is we take equation (1\\) and rewrite it as:\n\n$$ \\\\mathbf A \\= \\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{SR} \\+ \\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{GR} \\\\tag{3} $$\n\nwhere $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{SR}$ is the term we get from special relativity, $d^2x^\\\\alpha/d\\\\tau^2$, and $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{GR}$ is the term we get from general relativity, $\\\\Gamma^\\\\alpha\\_{\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\nu}U^\\\\mu U^\\\\nu$.\n\nBut all you can measure is $\\\\mathbf A$. Remember that $\\\\mathbf A$ is equal to the acceleration in your rest frame, so if you have a set of scales in the lift you can measure your weight, divide by your mass, and you get your proper acceleration $\\\\mathbf A$.\n\nThe point is that although you can experimentally measure the left side of equation (3\\) the equivalence principle tells us that you can't tell what is on the right hand side. If the elevator is blasting through space on a rocket $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{GR}$ is zero and all your acceleration comes from $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{SR}$. Alternatively if the elevator is stationary on Earth $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{SR}$ is zero and your acceleration comes from the $\\\\mathbf A\\_\\\\text{GR}$ term. The equivalence principle tells us that there is no way for you to tell the difference."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An astronaut in a spaceship far from any gravitational fields measures their proper acceleration using an accelerometer and finds it to be 9.8 m/s\u00b2.

If you are using the geography type, that won't happen, the edges will be great circles and will run in directions you'd never guess. \n\n[http://boundlessgeo.com/2012/04/the\\-earth\\-is\\-not\\-flat\\-volume\\-2/](http://boundlessgeo.com/2012/04/the-earth-is-not-flat-volume-2/)\n\nIn any event, no edge in geography can be longer than 180d, since any two points define a great circle, the system has to decide what portion of the circle the points bound, and chooses the shortest one (the one less than 180d). If you want longer edges you have to add intermediate points that fall in the places you'd expect.\n\nBut remember, you aren't going to get \"straight lines\" out of this, you're going to get great circles.\n\nIf you want a straight line solution, work in geometry, and recognize that you're going to have to put in your own logic to handle dateline splitting.\n\n(Dateline splitting is not hard to do, *if* your input box is not defined as \"two points\" but rather as a \"lower left point\" and \"upper right point\". Then you can easily test for cases in which the \"lower left\" point appears to be to the right of the \"upper right point\" and say \"aha! this is actually a dateline crossing case!\" and construct two query polygons with the dateline as the bounding edge.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A geospatial analyst is working on a global navigation system and needs to calculate distances between coordinates using the spherical law of cosine formula.

These routes may appear curved when projected onto a flat map, such as a Mercator projection. The answer is not A because the formula does not assume a flat Earth. It's not C because the formula is limited to distances less than 180 degrees of arc length.

We can express tan(6x) as sin(6x)/cos(6x), and then use the double angle formula for sine: sin(6x) = 2sin(3x)cos(3x). This gives us:\n\n(tan(6x)) / (sin(3x)) = (sin(6x)) / (cos(6x)sin(3x)) = (2sin(3x)cos(3x)) / (cos(6x)sin(3x)) = 2cos(3x) / cos(6x)\n\nAs x approaches 0, both cos(3x) and cos(6x) approach 1, but cos(6x) approaches 1 slightly faster.

There are two main steps involved with this. If you really want to keep the towel hanger in the same location then there is another way you could repair it in place but it involves more work. It's not really hard to do but takes longer to patch it up.\n\n**Remounting the towel hanger**\n\n1. Find and loosen the screw or hex head set screw that allows the mounting bracket part of the towel hanger to be removed from the decorative outer shell.\n2. Remove the old molly bolt screw from the bracket and discard the old fastener.\n3. Locate a stud in the wall where you can accept having the towel bar mounted. (A stud finder tool can be handy for this but you can also use a magnet to find screws or nails that hold the drywall to the studs knowing that there is a stud behind the screw).\n4. Mount the bracket at the new location over the stud. Use screws long enough to penetrate the drywall and about 1\" into the stud. This would likely be a screw of length 1\\.5\\. to 1\\.75\". Some brackets take 1 screw and some 2 or three. Note that it will be best to predrill pilot holes for the screws. They will go in easier and prevent splitting the stud.\n5. Remount the towel bar itself onto the bracket and tighten the screw / hex set screw that secures the towel bar to the bracket.\n\n**Patching the old hole**\n\n1. The hole can be easily patched using one of the popular small patch repair kits that you can purchase at the big box store. These have a stickon plastic or metal grid or web piece that has adhesive on the back. Peel off the backer and paste it onto the wall surface centered over the old hole.\n2. Follow directions with the kit to apply successive layers of drywall mud over the patch and feather it out for about 6 \\- 8 inches on each side of the repair site. Depending on how nice you can apply each coat of the drywall compound it may or may not be necessary to sand between coats. After the feathered out coats are dry you can sand the surface smooth.\n3. Since the present wall is textured you will want to apply some texture in the patch area. There are available spray cans if texture material that you can purchase at the big box store. These will sputter out a coating of material similar to drywall mud to leave a texture on the wall area. When using these spray cans it is advisable to practice first on some scrap plywood, cardboard or similar material to get the hang of applying the texture material.\n4. After the texture has dried then prime the rework area with a good quality wall primer paint.\n5. Finally you can repaint the patch area with paint to match the rest of the wall area. If the wall area where the patch is located is relatively small you may want to consider repainting that whole surface from corner to corner and top to bottom. The repainting will be much less noticeable that way.\n\n**Repairing in existing location**\n\n1. You would start by marking and then cutting out the damaged drywall area in a rectangular area about 2\\.5\" x 4\". Use an inexpensive hand drywall hole cutter saw for this.\n2. Acquire a piece of pine 1x3 that is about 8 to 9 inches long. (That size of board will be just narrower than the width of the hole you have cut out). Attach a drywall screw partway into the center of one flat face of this piece of board and then tie a long string to that drywall screw.\n3. Fit the wood piece into the hole in the wall. Lower it in so that the whole thing goes in the wall behind the hole with the length of the board inline with the long dimension of your hole. Use the string to pull the board up against the inside face of the wall and then you can use the drywall screw as a handle to hold the board in place.\n4. Install some drywall screws through the existing drywall about 1/2 inch from the hole and into the 1x3 pine board. I would use two screws side by side above and below the hole. Use a hand screw driver to install the screws because easy does it. When the screws approach the almost in state finish off with them just dimpling the surface of the drywall and not tearing through the paper. (Too easy to mess this up with a power driver in this case).\n5. When the board is installed you can remove the string and the handle screw.\n6. After this you need a small piece of drywall that will just fit in the hole and back up against the wood board behind it. If you do not have some drywall pieces laying around they sell smallish 2 foot by 2 foot pieces at big box stores.\n7. Screw the small piece of drywall in place using two drywall screws. Stay away from putting screws in the center are.\n8. Patch over this hole. You can do this with a medium sized stick on drywall patch repair kit and follow the steps I mentioned above including the texture and painting.\n9. Once the hole is all patched up you can remount the towel bar bracket as described before with regular type screws. The screws will go into center area of that 1x3 board instead of over a stud. This repair will secure the towel bracket for all but the very most aggressive treatment of the towel hanger.\n\nGood Luck."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When repairing a towel hanger that has been ripped out of drywall, which of the following steps is NOT part of the process for repairing the hole in its existing location?\n\nA) Cutting out a rectangular area of damaged drywall around the hole\nB) Installing a piece of 1x3 pine board behind the drywall\nC) Applying spray foam insulation to fill the cavity behind the drywall\nD) Patching the hole with a small piece of drywall and a repair kit\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Applying spray foam insulation is not mentioned in the repair process described in the documentation. The actual steps involve cutting out the damaged area, installing a wooden backing, fitting a new piece of drywall, and then patching and finishing the surface.
