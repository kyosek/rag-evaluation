This approach doesn't require a full reinstallation and can often fix boot issues caused by partition changes. If the repair option doesn't work, the same bootable USB can be used to perform a clean installation. Option A is not viable as the recovery partition is not working.

While the Shapiro-Wilk test suggests non-normality, it's important to remember that with large sample sizes, even small deviations from normality can lead to significant results. Creating a QQ-plot allows for visual inspection of how the data deviates from normality and can provide insights into the nature and extent of this deviation. This visual representation can help in deciding whether the deviation is practically significant and guide further analytical decisions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it jumps to a conclusion based solely on the test result without considering the test's limitations with large sample sizes.

Every plugin developer (or every store developer / systems integrator) truly believes that **there will never be another plugin rewriting the same controller**. The fact is, though, that one day it will happen (in the case of CartController.php it happens way too often). In my experience you then have to rewrite two plugins to create a chained inheritance. **This is non\\-optimal.**\n\nSo. In my opinion, instead, you should always use controller dispatch events. In your case the event looks something like this:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config>\n    <global>\n        <events>\n            <controller_action_predispatch_catalog_category_view>\n                <observers>\n                    <yourcompany_capccv_predispatch>\n                        <class>YourCompany_YourModule_Model_Observer</class>\n                        <method>catalogCategoryViewPredispatch</method>\n                    </yourcompany_capccv_predispatch>\n                </observers>\n            </controller_action_predispatch_catalog_category_view>\n        </events>\n    </global>\n</config>\n\n```\n\nAnd the observer model:\n\n```\n<?php\n\nclass YourCompany_YourModule_Model_Observer\n{\n\n    public function catalogCategoryViewPredispatch($observer)\n    {\n        $helper = Mage::helper('core');\n        $controller = $observer->getEvent()->getControllerAction();\n\n        Mage::log(\"this works\");\n\n        //you can intercept and massage data on the request object\n        $request = $controller->getRequest();\n        $params = $request->getParams();\n\n        $request->setParam('escapeme', $helper->escapeHtml($params['escapeme']));\n    }\n}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Magento 1.x, what is considered the best practice for modifying the behavior of the Catalog Category View action without directly overriding the controller?\n\nA) Create a new module and rewrite the Mage_Catalog_CategoryController class\nB) Modify the core files directly in Mage/Catalog/controllers/CategoryController.php\nC) Use controller dispatch events and create an observer\nD) Create a plugin that injects code into the viewAction method\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The best practice for modifying controller behavior in Magento 1.x is to use controller dispatch events and create an observer. This approach is preferred because:\n\n1. It avoids potential conflicts with other modules that might also try to rewrite the same controller.\n2.

This is of course less likely than having at least one of them large. But there are cases with at least one of them large that count at least as strongly against the $H\\_0$, such as having $T\\_1$ extremely large even if $T\\_2$ doesn't indicate problems with the $H\\_0$, so the event $\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\} \\\\cap \\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\}$, of which you get the probability by multiplying the p\\-values, does not cover all possibilities to observe *something that is even less in line with the $H\\_0$* than what you observed, and is therefore smaller than a valid \"combined\" p\\-value would need to be.\n\nIn my example above, surely after having observed $t\\_1$ with $P\\_0\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\}\\=0\\.06$, observing $t\\_2$ with $P\\_0\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\}\\=0\\.6$ doesn't make the overall result indicate any stronger against the $H\\_0$ (as multiplying the p\\-values would suggest), because observing something with $P\\_0\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\}\\=0\\.6$ is perfectly reasonable under $H\\_0$; however observing $T\\_1$ even larger than $t\\_1$ would arguably count stronger against $H\\_0$ even with observing a smaller $T\\_2$.\n\nThe problem with combining p\\-values from more than one test is that if you only have a one\\-dimensional test statistic, as long as this statistic is suitably defined, it is clear how you can find all possible outcomes that are less in line with $H\\_0$ than your observation (depending on the test statistic either by looking at all larger, or all smaller values, or combining the two sides). However, with two or more values of the test statistic, in the higher dimensional space of possible outcomes it is much more difficult to define what \"less in line with $H\\_0$\" actually means. One possibility to play it safe is to look at $P\\_0(\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\})$, the probability that at least one of $T\\_1$ and $T\\_2$ is too large. This for sure covers all possibilities that the pair $(T\\_1,T\\_2\\)$ is less in line with $H\\_0$ than the observations $(t\\_1,t\\_2\\)$. It actually covers far too much and is therefore very conservative. It may in fact be seen as useless, because its probability will always be bigger than $P\\_0\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\}$, so this won't allow you to find a significance based on $(T\\_1,T\\_2\\)$ if you don't find one based on $T\\_1$ alone. If the two tests are independent, as apparently assumed here, $P\\_0(\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\})\\=1\\-(1\\-P\\_0\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\})(1\\-P\\_0\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\})\\=0\\.624$ in the example, so there you have your multiplication.\n\nNote that $2\\\\min(P\\_0\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\},P\\_0\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\})\\=0\\.12$ in the example is the so\\-called Bonferroni\\-corrected p\\-value, which gives an upper bound on the probability that any of the two indicates at least as much against $H\\_0$ than the one that has the stronger indication, which is somewhat better than $P\\_0(\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\})$, but still will not allow you to have an overall combined p\\-value that is smaller than all those you observe for the isolated tests.

It is possible to solve your problem exactly, by enumerating the multinomial combinations that satisfy the required inequality, and summing the distribution over that range. In the case where $N$ is large this may become computationally infeasible. In this case it is possible to obtain an approximate distribution using the normal approximation to the multinomial. A generalised version of this approximation is shown below, and then this is applied to your specific example.\n\n---\n\n**General approximation problem:** Suppose we have a sequence of exchangeable random variables with range $1, 2, ..., m$. For any $n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$ we can form the count vector $\\\\boldsymbol{X} \\\\equiv \\\\boldsymbol{X} (n) \\\\equiv (X\\_1, X\\_2, ..., X\\_m)$, which counts the number of occurences of each outcome in the first $n$ values of the sequence. Since the underlying sequence is exchangeable, the count vector is distributed as:\n\n$$\\\\begin{array}\n\\\\boldsymbol{X} \\\\text{ \\~ Mu}(n, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}) \\& \\& \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} \\= \\\\lim\\_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\boldsymbol{X}(n)/n.\n\\\\end{array}$$\n\nNow, suppose we have some vector of non\\-negative weights $\\\\boldsymbol{w} \\= (w\\_1, w\\_2, ..., w\\_m)$ and we use these weights to define the linear function:\n\n$$A(n) \\\\equiv \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^m w\\_i X\\_i.$$\n\nSince the weights are non\\-negative, this new quantity is non\\-decreasing in $n$. We then define the number $N(a) \\\\equiv \\\\min \\\\{ n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\| A(n) \\\\geqslant a \\\\}$, which is the smallest number of observations required to obtain a specified minimum value for our linear function. We want to approximate the distribution of $N(a)$ in the case where this value is (stochastically) large.\n\n---\n\n**Solving the general approximation problem:** Firstly, we note that since $A(n)$ is non\\-decreasing in $n$ (which holds because we have assumed that all the weights are non\\-negative), we have:\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{P} (N(a) \\\\geqslant n) \\= \\\\mathbb{P} (N(a) \\> n \\- 1\\) \\= \\\\mathbb{P} (A(n\\-1\\) \\< a).$$\n\nHence, the distribution of $N$ is directly related to the distribution of $A$. Assuming that the former quantity is large, we can approximate the distribution of the latter by replacing the discrete random vector $\\\\boldsymbol{X}$ with a continuous approximation from the multivariate normal distribution. This leads to a normal approximation for the linear quantitiy $A(n)$, and we can calculate the moments of this quantity directly. To do this, we use the fact that $\\\\mathbb{E}(X\\_i) \\= n \\\\theta\\_i$, $\\\\mathbb{V}(X\\_i) \\= n \\\\theta\\_i (1 \\- \\\\theta\\_i)$ and $\\\\mathbb{C}(X\\_i, X\\_j) \\= \\-n \\\\theta\\_i \\\\theta\\_j$ for $i \\\\neq j$. With some basic algebra, this gives us:\n\n$$\\\\mu \\\\equiv \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n} A(n)\\\\right) \\= \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^m w\\_i \\\\theta\\_i,$$\n\n$$\\\\sigma^2 \\\\equiv \\\\mathbb{V}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}} A(n)\\\\right) \\= \\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^m w\\_i \\\\theta\\_i \\- \\\\left(\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^m w\\_i \\\\theta\\_i\\\\right)^2 \\= \\\\mu (1 \\- \\\\mu).$$\n\nTaking the normal approximation to the multinomial now gives us the *approximate* distribution $A(n) \\\\text{ \\~ N} (n \\\\mu, n \\\\mu (1 \\- \\\\mu))$. Applying this approximation yields:\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{P} (N(a) \\\\geqslant n) \\= \\\\mathbb{P} (A(n\\-1\\) \\< a) \\\\approx \\\\Phi \\\\left(\\\\frac{a \\- (n\\-1\\) \\\\mu}{\\\\sqrt{(n\\-1\\) \\\\mu (1 \\- \\\\mu)}}\\\\right).$$\n\n(The symbol $\\\\Phi$ is the standard notation for the standard normal distribution function.) It is possible to apply this approximation to find probabilities pertaining to the quantity $N(a)$ for a specified value of $a$. This is a basic approximation which has not attempted to incorporate continuity correction on the values of the underlying multinomial count values. It is obtained by taking a normal approximation using the same first two central moments as the exact linear function.\n\n---\n\n**Application to your problem:** In your problem you have probabilities $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} \\= (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\\\tfrac{1}{6}, \\\\tfrac{1}{3})$, weights $\\\\boldsymbol{w} \\= (0, \\\\ln 2, \\\\ln 3\\)$, and cut\\-off value $a \\= \\\\ln 100000$. You therefore have (rounding to six decimal points) $\\\\mu \\= \\\\tfrac{1}{6}\\\\ln 2 \\+ \\\\tfrac{1}{3}\\\\ln 3 \\= 0\\.481729$. Applying the above approximation we have (rounding to six decimal points):\n\n$$\\\\mathbb{P}(N(a) \\\\geqslant 25\\) \\\\approx \\\\Phi \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\ln 100000 \\- 24 \\\\cdot 0\\.481729}{\\\\sqrt{24} \\\\cdot 0\\.499666}\\\\right) \\=\\\\Phi (\\-0\\.019838\\) \\= 0\\.492086\\.$$\n\nBy application of the exact multinomial distribution, summing over all combinations satisfying the requirement $\\\\mathbb{P}(A(24\\) \\< a)$, it can be shown that the exact result is $\\\\mathbb{P}(N(a) \\\\geqslant 25\\) \\= 0\\.483500$. Hence, we can see that the approximation is quite close to the exact answer in the present case.\n\nHopefully this answer gives you an answer to your specific question, while also placing it within a more general framework of probabilistic results that apply to linear functions of multinomial random vectors. The present method should allow you to obtain approximate solutions to problems of the general type you are facing, allowing for variation in the specific numbers in your example."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A fair six-sided die is rolled repeatedly.

In your examples, notice how you had to switch the form of the word *buy* to make both sentences sound okay.\n\nBoth *for* and *to* can be used to **explain a reason or motivation for something**. However, when used in this way, *to* is followed by a verb, but *for* is followed by a noun. Consider:\n\n> She goes to the spa on Friday **to** relax.  \n> \n> She goes to the span on Friday **for** relaxation.\n\n---\n\nHere's another interesting example:\n\n> The library is a good place **for** study.  \n> \n> The library is a good place **to** study.\n\nIn this case, the sentences are the identical except for the preposition. However, does this mean the two words are interchangeable? No, it doesn't! These two sentences are both acceptable only because *study* can function as a noun **or** as a verb. So, in the first sentence, *study* functions as a noun, aligning with meanings 8a at [Collins](http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/study):\n\n> **study** (*n.*)  \n> \n> the act or process of studying\n\nIn the second sentence, the two\\-word phrase *to study* functions as an infinitive, and therefore *study* is used as a verb, meaning:\n\n> **study** (*v.*)  \n> \n> to apply the mind to the learning or understanding of (a subject), esp by reading\n\n---\n\nI agree with some of the comments about your two sentences; that is, I think \"to buy some cake\" sounds better than \"for buying some cake.\" But I can see why you'd be confused by this, because we can find some very similar sentences in published books, like:\n\n> See if the hotel has a specified area [for walking your dog](https://books.google.com/books?id=u5eiAwAAQBAJ).\n> \n> \n> Nurses have evaluated a variety of products and methods [for bathing older adults](https://books.google.com/books?id=yUx01gmNLboC).\n> \n> \n> The whole procedure [for getting a license](https://books.google.com/books?id=yJSVZkBS7qgC) is rather complicated and requires a lot of time.\n\nWe could change those sentences to read: *to walk your dog, to bathe older adults*, and *to get a license*; any differences in meaning would be minimal. However, sometimes such changes will sound natural and acceptable, and sometimes they won't.\n\n---\n\nMost importantly, remember that little words like *for, in, of, at, with, on,* and *to* are extremely flexible. They typically have several meanings and are used in various ways, including phrasal verbs and prepositional phrases. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to pick two of these words, and give you foolproof guidance that will help you know \"which one is correct and wrong.\" When it comes to these little words, there are simply too many variations to explain everything succinctly."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the prepositions \"for\" and \"to\" when used to express purpose or motivation?\n\nA) \"For\" and \"to\" are always interchangeable when expressing purpose.\nB) \"To\" is followed by a verb, while \"for\" is followed by a noun when expressing purpose.\nC) \"For\" is always used with gerunds, while \"to\" is always used with infinitives.\nD) The choice between \"for\" and \"to\" depends solely on the speaker's preference.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. When expressing purpose or motivation, \"to\" is typically followed by a verb in its base form (infinitive without \"to\"), while \"for\" is followed by a noun or gerund. This distinction is illustrated in the examples from the documentation, such as \"to relax\" vs. \"for relaxation\" and \"to study\" vs. \"for study.\" While there can be some overlap in usage, and in some cases both prepositions might sound acceptable, this general rule helps distinguish their typical usage patterns. Options A and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the relationship between these prepositions, ignoring the grammatical distinctions.

It allows us to write high powers of generators as linear combinations of lower powers, ultimately showing that FGA implies FGM for integral extensions.\n\nThis equivalence is a key property of integral extensions in algebra and is important in various areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry and commutative algebra."}, "22": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/04/22", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/206552", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 206552, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is given a pair of sentences and I have to join the two sentences into one using \na participle.\n\n***We started early.

The quadratic divergence suggests a scalar mass of order $\\Lambda^2$, which is problematic for theories requiring light scalars (e.g., the Higgs boson). However, this result comes from a perturbative calculation that breaks down at such high energies, so we can't definitively conclude the exact mass. The hierarchy problem persists because even if the actual mass is different, explaining a light scalar still requires fine-tuning or new physics.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the certainty of the perturbative result.

I have found that after a few thousand bounces, it converges on \"rolling\" behavior; that is, the bounces get shorter and shorter and it essentially sticks to the surface. The simulation basically can't progress beyond this point as a result. Below is the part of the trajectory that illustrates this behavior; the trajectory goes from chaotic to convergent along the surface of the torus:\n\n[![trajectory](https://i.stack.imgur.com/828zu.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/828zu.png)\n\nOn the left can be seen the discrete bounces, and on the right is where the particle sticks to the surface (until program termination).\nIt seems counter\\-intuitive that a the trajectory could become trapped like this after demonstrating chaotic behavior for thousands of prior bounces. Closer examination reveals that the angles become more and more grazing with each bounce, and the distances between bounces shorter, until no progress can be made.\n\nIf I had infinite numerical precision to peek past this event horizon, would I eventually find that the particle breaks free again? Or is it possible that this is also a theoretical limit, and the motion of the particle has transitioned from finite segments to a continuous curve constrained to the surface? Can this happen in 3D billiards problems, or does chaos dictate that this behavior would reverse after some unknown amount of time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: These so\\-called \"whispering gallery modes\" are familiar from studies of microcavity lasers; they can trap the light indefinitely, only limited by diffraction; this [web site](http://pages.uoregon.edu/noeckel/microlasers/) by Jens N\u00f6ckel nicely summarizes the issues; an efficient way to untrap the trajectory is to introduce flattened portions in the boundary (in 2D this would be a stadium rather than a circle, in 3D it could be an ellipsoidal shape).

The phenomenon described is known as a \"whispering gallery mode,\" which is well-documented in studies of microcavity lasers. In these modes, light can become trapped indefinitely, limited only by diffraction effects. This is not a result of numerical imprecision (ruling out A), nor is it a temporary state that will naturally revert to chaos (ruling out C).

But Energy and Mass are the same thing, so does that mean a closed system is the same as an open system (a system in which both mass and energy can be exchanged)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ensembles in thermodynamics are defined in terms of quantities that are conserved between the system and the bath. Typically, that means energy $E$ and particle number (mass) $N$. However, this needs to be modified to account for relativity. To say that your system can only gain or lose a particle by exchanging it with the bath is necessarily declaring it to be non\\-relativistic. Let's go through the three ensembles.\n\n1. The **microcanonical ensemble** says that nothing can leave the system. The available microstates are therefore the ones that have the fixed energy $E$. Knowing that each one has probability $e^{\\-S}$ allows you to derive Boltzmann's formula.\n2. The **canonical ensemble** says that energy is the only conserved quantity that can leave the system and it does until the system and bath are at the same temperature. Now the probability of a microstate $e^{\\-S}$ is most usefully expressed using $F \\= E \\- TS$ which is the quantity that will be minimized in equilibrium. Note that other things besides energy can leave the system too as long as they are not conserved. Total velocity in the $x$ direction would be an example.\n3. If particle number is a conserved quantity, you can also have the **grand canonical ensemble**. Now particles are exchanged to get a constant chemical potential and $e^{\\-S}$ involves the grand potential $\\\\Omega \\= E \\- TS \\- \\\\mu N$.\n\nWhen you have all three, the systems are described as isolated, closed and open respectively. If you can only define the first two ensembles, I don't know whether it's best to call them (isolated, closed), (isolated, open) or (closed, open). However it's worth noting that several applications, such as electron gases, have a microscopic notion of charge.

The documentation states that \"several applications, such as electron gases, have a microscopic notion of charge. As this is another conserved quantity, you can therefore get a relativistic analogue of the grand canonical ensemble by simply replacing N with Q.\" This means that instead of using particle number (N) as in non-relativistic systems, relativistic systems use charge (Q) as the conserved quantity exchanged with the bath in the grand canonical ensemble.

The administrator cannot access or change the contents of the Keychain without knowing the user's password. This makes the Keychain the exception to the administrator's access capabilities.

This is because the complex conjugate operation z\u0304 is not differentiable in the complex sense.

I have an idea to improve my classification analysis that I feel is not terribly unique, but I can not find a reference to such a procedure with my limited knowledge. In short, I am using ML classification to try to partition my data. That is, I don't care for any given sample what class it is, but I want to know the fraction of each class in my dataset.\n\nExample problem\n===============\n\nConsider a binary classification, where I have some signal $S$ and background $B$. I train up my classifier, and get the following confusion matrix:\n\n```\n\n+---+-----+-----+\n|   |  S  |  B  |\n+---+-----+-----+\n| S | 0.9 | 0.1 |\n| B | 0.2 | 0.8 |\n+---+-----+-----+\n\n```\n\nThat is, 90% of signal is correctly identified and 80% of background.\n\nNow, I give my classifier a set of testing data with a 20/80 S/B split, and this classifier tells me that my data consists of\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_0 \\\\\\\\ B\\_0\\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\.9 \\& 0\\.2 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.1 \\& 0\\.8 \\\\end{pmatrix}\n\\\\begin{pmatrix} S \\\\\\\\ B \\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\.34 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.66 \\\\end{pmatrix} \n$$\nNot super great.\n\nImprovement \\#1\n---------------\n\nI think I am allowed to use my knowledge of the category leakage (expressed in the confusion matrix) in order to correct my population estimates. I.e.,\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_1 \\\\\\\\ B\\_1\\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\.9 \\& 0\\.2 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.1 \\& 0\\.8 \\\\end{pmatrix}^{\\-1}\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_0 \\\\\\\\ B\\_0\\\\end{pmatrix} \n$$\nwhich in this case gives back the input signal and background perfectly. In a real case of course the mismatch won't be exactly the same as the confusion matrix on the training data, but **it must still be better than taking the numbers at face value, right?**\n\nImprovement \\#2\n---------------\n\nLet's say I modify my classifier so that, for a given input sample, if the classification probability is below some threshold (e.g. 10%), classify as \"Uknown\". Now I have a new confusion matrix:\n\n```\n\n+---+------+------+------+\n|   |  S   |  B   |  U   |\n+---+------+------+------+\n| S | 0.9  | 0.02 | 0.08 |\n| B | 0.05 | 0.75 | 0.2  |\n+---+------+------+------+\n\n```\n\nand when I give it the same 20/80 split, I get\n$$\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_0 \\\\\\\\ B\\_0 \\\\\\\\ U\\_0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\begin{pmatrix}0\\.22 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.604 \\\\\\\\ 0\\.176\\\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow to estimate the true signal and background fractions, I could perform e.g. a $\\\\chi^2$ minimization of the different weights in the confusion matrix to my test output. I.e. minimize $\\|\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}\\|^2$ in\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{pmatrix}S\\_0 \\\\\\\\ B\\_0 \\\\\\\\ U\\_0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\= \n\\\\mathbf{M\\_c} \\\\begin{pmatrix} S\\_1 \\\\\\\\ B\\_1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\+ \\\\vec{\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}}\n$$\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{M\\_c}$ is the confusion matrix (transposed).\n\nImprovement \\#3\n---------------\n\nFor any sample I give to the classifier, I get a score that tells me the probability that the sample is signal. Using my training data (or better, a different, independent set of training data), I can build PDFs for the score distribution separately for signal and background events. When I want to evaluate a test dataset, I get the distribution of scores from the classifier and fit that to the weighted sum of my signal and background PDFs, and the resulting weights give me the fraction of signal and background in the test dataset.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nIs this sort of approach standard, and where can I find more information?  \n\nIf it's not already standard, are these approaches valid, and likely to add anything useful in a real\\-world scenario?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The fact that your first graph merely oscillates between two values suggests to me that you are resetting the prior each time you perform an iteration.

The likelihood function for observing x_i = 1 is \u03b8^x_i * (1-\u03b8)^(1-x_i), which simplifies to \u03b8 when x_i = 1.\n3. The example shows \u03b8 taking values from 0/10 to 10/10, which is 11 possible values.\n4. The denominator \u03a3_\u03b8 \u03b8^x_i * (1-\u03b8)^(1-x_i) * \u03c0_(i-1)(\u03b8) is the normalizing constant that ensures the posterior probabilities sum to 1."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/11", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/283485", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/179537/"], "docs_id": 283485, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The doubt or question i have is something every developer might be facing time to time. it is related to testing and development team and their perspective.\n\nI have observed that most of the Defects which are getting logged are purely based on judgement rather than requirement. apart from that there is attitude that bugs which are getting logged has to be resolved which is causing lot of trouble and rework.\n\n***What we as developer should do? How to tackle these scenarios?***\n\nApproach which i have adopted so far is to reject the issues which are not as per the requirement.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This sounds to me like a break\\-down of communication at a couple of levels. Since you've also not stated what your position in the project is, I'll assume that you're a regular dev who's working under an architect.\n\n### Breakdown of Workflow\n\nFirstly it sounds like there's not a properly defined way to handle bugs as they're entered into the tracking system. Someone has to rank them according to importance and then assign them to be fixed within budget and time\\-line constraints. \n\nEven basic bug\\-tracking systems have the ability to classify, rank and document various aspects of the issue. If you feel like these features could be used better, have a discussion with your architect or manager.\n\n### Breakdown of Trust\n\nMore importantly, it seems like there's a little bit of defensiveness and mistrust of whoever your testers are. \n\nUnderstand that their role is to act as the user, so it might be better if they're not too bogged down with the details of the requirements specification. If they're raising bugs for you, don't immediately assume that they haven't understood the requirements well enough; try and drill down into what exactly they were trying to do and why they landed at that use\\-case.\n\nAlso if it's something that keeps coming up then there might be something that wasn't properly defined in the requirements.\n\n### Summary\n\nAll in all, just understand that you and the testers are on the same team and that you'll are both just trying to make a better product for the user. After all, customers aren't going to get your requirements document; either the thing works or it doesn't."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a developer facing numerous defect reports that seem based on judgment rather than requirements, what is the most effective approach to improve the situation and product quality?\n\nA) Reject all issues that are not explicitly mentioned in the requirements document\nB) Implement a robust bug tracking system with classification and ranking features\nC) Improve communication with testers, understand their perspective, and collaborate to refine requirements\nD) Escalate the issue to upper management and request a new testing team\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is not ideal as it may lead to ignoring valid user experience issues that weren't explicitly stated in requirements. \nOption B is helpful but doesn't address the root cause of the communication breakdown.\nOption C is the best approach as it fosters collaboration, improves understanding between developers and testers, and can lead to better-defined requirements and a superior product.\nOption D is an extreme measure that doesn't solve the underlying communication issues and could worsen team dynamics.\n\nThe correct answer (C) aligns with the advice given in the StackExchange post, which emphasizes the importance of understanding that developers and testers are on the same team, working towards a better product for the user.

Why it's so complex and expensive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's just supply and demand. The market for RAID controllers is much smaller than the market for routers or MPEG decoders."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary reason for the high cost of hardware RAID controllers compared to other seemingly more complex technologies like Linux-based network routers or MPEG decoders?\n\nA) RAID controllers require more advanced and sophisticated technology\nB) The manufacturing process for RAID controllers is inherently more expensive\nC) The limited market size for RAID controllers drives up their price\nD) RAID controllers contain rare and costly materials\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation indicates that the main factor contributing to the high cost of RAID controllers is the principle of supply and demand. The market for RAID controllers is significantly smaller compared to more common technologies like routers or MPEG decoders. This limited demand leads to higher prices, as manufacturers cannot benefit from economies of scale and must recover their development and production costs from a smaller customer base.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documentation suggests that RAID controllers are not necessarily more technologically advanced than other devices like routers or MPEG decoders.\n\nAnswer B is not supported by the given information. There's no mention of the manufacturing process being inherently more expensive for RAID controllers.\n\nAnswer D is also incorrect. The documentation doesn't mention any rare or costly materials being used in RAID controllers.\n\nThe key point is that the smaller market size, rather than technological complexity or material costs, is the primary driver of the higher prices for RAID controllers."}}
