You can also use energy links to power steam engines and combustion engines \\- I did a quick test in creative, and even while still cooled down these will transfer a minimum of half a stack in one go.

You can power gold pipe with a redstone torch and it will significantly increase the speed of the items that go through it for 16 blocks. In creative I tried a golden pipe after a transfer pipe powered by a steam engine, an energy link, and a a batbox; and I was really pleased with the results. \n\nEDIT: the tekkit wiki says that the boost lasts twice as long if you use stone pipe as opposed to cobble.\n\nUPDATE: Be cautious with the kind of power you supply an engine. It'll explode if you give it too much, and it'll overload if it runs too long. Redstone engines won't blow as long as something is running through the tube, so either be content with low volume and high speed, or increase the volume as discussed above but remember to shut your engines off every so often and let things cool.\n\nFinally you could try using pneumatic tubes with accelerators and magtubes.

This means that the masses involved in momentum exchanges are orders of magnitude larger than the mass of an electron, and because of this practically no energy is transferred to the lattice. ( similar to a ball bouncing off a wall). \n\nBecause of the large mass of the lattice, the center of mass \"photon \\+ lattice\" and the laboratory \"lattice at rest\" coincide within measurement errors.

The photon interacts with the entire atomic lattice of the mirrors, not individual electrons. This interaction involves a much larger mass, resulting in negligible energy transfer to the lattice (similar to a ball bouncing off a wall). The center of mass of the \"photon + lattice\" system essentially coincides with the laboratory frame \"lattice at rest\" within measurement errors. As a result, the lattice acts as a boundary condition for the quantum mechanical problem, defining the effective potential well for the photon's wavefunction without significantly altering its coherence.

Weights start to behave better when one extends coefficients from $F$ to its algebraic closure i.e. passes from $X\\_0$ to $X$.\n\nNow, BBD was published in 1982\\. Are any significant improvements and/or generalizations known in this field now? There is a paper by Huber and a book by Jannsen where mixed sheaves and weights for them are mentioned. Yet these authors were not able to generalize the results of BBD (in fact, an example of Jannsen shows that this is probably impossible). They also didn't extend scalars. So, are there any other papers on this subject?\n\nUpd. There seems to be two basic ways to define weights (for sheaves) explicitly. The first method uses weights of Hodge structures. It seems that this method can work only for something like the category of mixed Hodge modules. Possibly, I will study these categories in the future. Yet at the moment I study motives, and it seems that 'motivic' people usually do not understand mixed Hodge modules (and so did not relate them with motives). \n\nSo, I am currently interested in the second method.

BBD's work in 1982 defined mixed sheaves and weights for sheaves over varieties defined over finite fields.\n\n2. The documentation asks if there have been significant improvements or generalizations since 1982, indicating that major breakthroughs have been limited.\n\n3. It mentions work by Huber and Jannsen, but notes they were unable to generalize BBD's results significantly.\n\n4. The update suggests two approaches to defining weights: one using Hodge structures (related to mixed Hodge modules) and another using Frobenius eigenvalues.\n\n5.

The term \"tense\" implies a state of agitation or uncomfortable feelings, but not necessarily open conflict or hostility. In this case, the father and child don't have frequent quarrels, yet they don't interact much either. Importantly, their lack of interaction is not due to dislike, which aligns with the definition of a tense relationship where there's discomfort but not outright animosity.\n\nOption A describes a \"stormy\" relationship with frequent fights and dislike.\nOption B implies a more hostile situation than just \"tense.\"\nOption D describes a relationship with \"great enmity,\" which goes beyond tension to outright hostility.\n\nTherefore, C is the most appropriate answer that captures the essence of a \"tense\" relationship as described in the given context."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/07/26", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2372391", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/350219/"], "docs_id": 2372391, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose we have a finite $s$\\-dimensional grid $J\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{Z}^{s}$ containing $0\\_{s}$. \n\nLet $n\\_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^{s}$, $i\\=1,\\\\ldots,N$ be the vectors with ending points the points of the grid. \n\nCan we always find a vector $u\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{s}$ such that all dot products $n\\_{i}\\\\cdot u$, $i\\=1,\\\\ldots, N$ are distinct?\n\nMy intuition leads me to believe the answer is yes, since I tried to find counterexamples in $1$ and $2$ dimensions but failed.

The existence of such a vector u is guaranteed, and there are infinitely many such vectors in \u211d^s. This can be understood by considering the problem in terms of hyperplanes. For each pair of vectors n_i and n_j (i \u2260 j), the equation (n_i - n_j) \u00b7 u = 0 defines a hyperplane in \u211d^s. Any vector u not lying on any of these hyperplanes will produce distinct dot products with all n_i. Since there are only finitely many such hyperplanes (corresponding to the finite number of vector pairs), and hyperplanes have measure zero in \u211d^s, almost all vectors in \u211d^s will satisfy the condition. This means there are infinitely many suitable vectors u.\n\nOption A is incorrect because u need not be an integer vector.

cache data in `/var/cache/yum`, which is not writable to normal users. So, when you ran it as your own user account, it had to be downloaded again and stored in another temporary directory.\n\nTo resolve this issue, always run `yum` in a root shell, or with `sudo`."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Why does running yum commands as a normal user and then as root (with sudo) appear to repeat the same update process, and what is the best practice to avoid this issue?\n\nA) The yum cache is stored in different locations for normal users and root, causing redundant downloads. To avoid this, always run yum commands as root or with sudo.\n\nB) Yum intentionally runs updates twice for verification purposes. This behavior cannot be changed.\n\nC) The slowdown is caused by network issues and is unrelated to user permissions. Changing network settings can resolve this.\n\nD) Yum requires two separate update processes for security reasons. This is a built-in feature and cannot be bypassed.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The question addresses the issue described in the documentation where running yum commands as a normal user and then as root causes seemingly redundant update processes. The correct answer, A, explains that this occurs because yum stores its cache data in different locations based on user permissions.

[Docs can be found here](http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/470.74/README/installdriver.html#modulesigning).\n\nHere are all the commands you need in order to install the drivers you download from NVIDIA:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential libglvnd-dev pkg-config dkms -y\n\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf\n\n```\n\nOnce inside the file add:\n\n```\nblacklist nouveau\noptions nouveau modeset=0\n\n```\n\nand then we continue with:\n\n```\nsudo update-initramfs -u\nsudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target\nsudo reboot now\n\n```\n\nAfter reboot you will be in terminal only mode, so you need to have another way to open this page to read the next commands, which are:\n\n```\n#navigate to the folder where you downloaded the drivers\nsudo bash NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-510.{version-number}.run\nsudo bash NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-510.*.run\n\n```\n\nAfter this you do \"Continue\" and only \"Yes\" until installation is finished (of course read what you click on and decide for your self)\n\nthen you finally you do:\n\n```\nsudo systemctl set-default graphical.target\nsudo reboot now\n\n```\n\nThis should give you your desired NVIDIA older drivers."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You're experiencing issues with the latest NVIDIA driver (510.85) on your Ubuntu 22.04 system and want to revert to an older version (510.60).

There is however one drawback to the characteristic function: it has no obvious probabilistic significance. My teacher William Feller was aware that the religious invocation of characteristic functions is extraneous to probabilistic reasoning. He managed to avoid characteristic functions in his treatise on probability. To be sure, characteristic functions made an occasional appearance in the second volume, when he just could not do without them. However, it was his intention to write a third volume, dealing with Brownian motion and diffusion processes, in which characteristic functions would be relegated to the dustbin of history. Unfortunately, he died before he could accomplish this task.\"\n\nOther important objects that can better represent many properties of random variables than moments are cumulants.\n\nFor $n\\\\geq 1$, we consider a vector of real\\-valued random variables $X\\_{\\[n]}\\= (X\\_1,\\\\ldots, X\\_n)$ such that $\\\\mathbb{E}(\\|X\\_j\\|^{n}) \\<\\\\infty, \\\\forall\\\\ j \\= 1,\\\\ldots,n$.

From the $k$\\-dimensional vector $X\\_b$,\none cane define the multivariate characteristicfunction of this vector as\n$$\\\\phi\\_{X\\_b}(z\\_1,\\\\ldots,z\\_k)\\=\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\Bigg\\[\\\\exp\\\\Big(\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\sum\\_{l\\=1}^{k}z\\_l X\\_{j\\_l}\\\\Big)\\\\Bigg].$$\nThe joint cumulant of the components of the vector $X\\_b$ is defined as\n\\\\begin{align\\*}\nk(X\\_b)\\=(\\-\\\\mathrm{i})^{k} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{k} }{\\\\partial z\\_1\\\\ldots\\\\partial z\\_k}\\\\log\\\\phi\\_{X\\_b}(z\\_1,\\\\ldots,z\\_k)\\|\\_{z\\_1\\=\\\\ldots\\=z\\_k\\=0}.\n\\\\end{align\\*}\n\nI know that cumulants are polynomials in moments, invariants by the translation and additive if the the components of the vector $X\\_b$ are partly independents.\nThey have also common properties with characteristic and generating function in the sense they characterize uniquely the distribution of a random variable as also they can characterize the independence of random variables.\n\nMy question: why is a random variable is better described by its cumulants, which are combinatoric nature, than by its generating function or its characteristic function, which are analytical nature.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The quote actually belongs to C.G.Rota.\n\nBecause cumulant sequences are closed under addition while moment sequences are not. That makes cumulant a more tractable algebraic structure altogether. Although umbral calculus provides a algebraic framework for both cumulants and factorial moments. \\[Di Nardo et.al]\n\nSecondly, cumulants are more naturally regarded as tensors of components of the random variables. But you can still argue that moments can also be regarded as tensors since they have one\\-to\\-one transformation correspondence. \\[Morton\\&Lim]\n\nThirdly, cumulants are Mobius inversions from partition lattice ordered by inclusion of the sample space. \\[Speed] Thus adoption of cumulants actually simplifies many combinatorial proofs. \\[Rota]\n\nBut cumulants come from characteristic functions, which are Fourier transforms of random variables. Moments are coming from Laplace transforms of random variables, so you can argue that Fourier transforms are generally \"better than\" Laplace because they always exist...But I can also argue that Laplace is better because they are more tractable...(to me).\n\n**Reference**\n\n\\[Di Nardo et.al]Di Nardo, Elvira, and Domenico Senato. \"An umbral setting for cumulants and factorial moments.\" European Journal of Combinatorics 27\\.3 (2006\\): 394\\-413\\.\n\n\\[Morton\\&Lim] Morton, Jason, and Lek\\-Heng Lim. \"Principal cumulant component analysis.\" preprint (2009\\).

According to the expert response, when a mixer tap is leaking from where the neck meets the body, the most effective solution is often to remove the entire tap from the sink. This allows access to the washers at the base, which are likely the source of the leak. Simply tightening connections or applying sealant (options B and D) are unlikely to solve an internal seal problem.

In Linux, threads have a different process ID to the other threads in the process. When you look at the PID column in `ps`, you're actually looking at the thread group ID (TGID), which is common amongst all threads in a process. This is for historical reasons due to the way threads evolved in Linux.\n\nFor example, on my system, chromium has a number of threads in a process (multiple processes too):\n\n```\n$ ps -efL | grep chromium\n[UID       PID  PPID   LWP  C NLWP STIME TTY          TIME CMD]\n[...]\ncamh     10927  5182 10927  0    4 11:07 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/chromium/chromium ...\ncamh     10927  5182 10929  0    4 11:07 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/chromium/chromium ...\ncamh     10927  5182 10930  0    4 11:07 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/chromium/chromium ...\ncamh     10927  5182 10933  0    4 11:07 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/chromium/chromium ...\n\n```\n\nThe second column is the TGID (although it is labelled as PID) and the forth column is LWP (light\\-weight process).\n\n```\n$ ls /proc | grep 10927\n10927\n$ ls /proc | grep 10929\n$ cd /proc/10929\n$ head -n 5 status\nName:   Chrome_ChildIOT\nState:  S (sleeping)\nTgid:   10927\nPid:    10929\nPPid:   5182\n\n```\n\nYou can see that process 10929 does not show up in `/proc`, but you can `cd` to it. If you look in the `status` file, you'll see that it is part of \"process\" (thread group) 10927, and from the output above, that process does appear in `/proc`."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Linux systems, what does the LWP column represent in the output of 'ps -efL', and how does it relate to the process ID (PID) and thread group ID (TGID)?\n\nA) LWP stands for Large Work Process and is always equal to the PID\nB) LWP stands for Light-Weight Process and represents individual thread IDs within a process\nC) LWP stands for Linux Work Process and is always different from the TGID\nD) LWP stands for Long-Wait Process and represents processes that are sleeping\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: LWP stands for Light-Weight Process and represents individual thread IDs within a process. In Linux, threads within a process have different process IDs, but share the same thread group ID (TGID). The PID column in 'ps' output actually shows the TGID, which is common among all threads in a process. The LWP column shows the unique identifier for each thread, allowing you to distinguish between different threads in the same process. This can be seen in the example output where multiple entries have the same PID (TGID) but different LWP values, indicating separate threads within the same process."}}
