But...\n\n*looking into PHP tag on Stack Overflow, one would say that it's an awfully outdated language, stuck in early 2000s, with every single task performed manually, by means of re\\-inventing the wheel in the form of an ugly, hasty, untested and unsafe on\\-site sketch.*\n\nSo I suppose it is because PHP professionals seldom have time to answer questions, leaving the field for the *enthusiasts*.\n\nYes, formally we have top\\-grade PHP contributors on Stack Overflow.\nBut they all took refuge in the chat room and you seldom can see them answering a question.\n\nI cannot tell for the other tags but I suppose the situation is similar for all the widely\\-adopted languages and technologies.\n\nSo the question is: how to make Stack Overflow a desirable platform for sharing knowledge?\nHow to make it home not only for people interested in the virtual points and badges, but for people, whose interest is different \\- for those who have the knowledge and are willing to share it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Please note:** Following is my *personal* opinion after several years of PHP and [php](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php \"show questions tagged 'php'\") experience, it does not represent Stack Overflow, or my actions as moderator. Sadly, I'm not going to offer a solution here, so if that's what you're looking for, skip this answer.\n\nStack Overflow, originally, was a site where experts came to ask each other interesting and engaging questions. The weaker devs were predicted (with great accuracy) to be attracted to the high level information, and participate, increasing their own skill levels.\n\nThe issue is that Stack Overflow then became steadily more popular, and especially in tags like [php](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php \"show questions tagged 'php'\"), [jquery](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jquery \"show questions tagged 'jquery'\") and others, we saw a huge degradation in quality, attributed to a decrease in signal:noise ratio, as well as experts giving up and leaving due to that same decrease.\n\nThis is a system\\-wide problem. Stack Overflow, as the system currently stands, whether by design or not, is a compromise more in\\-favor of the newbs, than it is of the experts. (Stack Overflow's quality levels are still well above the competitors, in my opinion)\n\n* It takes 5 high rep users to close, and 1 no rep user to answer.\n* It takes a user a long time to find and research, and no time to ask and have his question closed and pointing at the right one for him.\n* Answerers are expected to answer concisely and Solve The Problem\u2122. Asking \"what have you tried\" or pointed to google is frowned upon.\n* etc\n\nSome of these were out there since the beginning, some evolved because the expert\\-oriented nature of the site was unfriendly to users.\n\nI don't have a good solution for you. There's no magic powder you can coat [php](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php \"show questions tagged 'php'\") in and suddenly make it interesting. People don't use PHP because it's shiny, people use it because it Solves The Problem\u2122 and is easy enough to use. And just Solving The Problem\u2122 doesn't really make for an interesting discussion.\n\nThis is an advanced stage in the life cycle of any community, what comes next... isn't good. I don't have the solution here, I don't think anyone on the internet does, if Stack Overflow manages to solve this problem, I'll take my hat off and clap.\n\nThere is no other expert community that had reach this size before. All of them imploded and died much sooner. We don't have anyone else to compare ourselves to, no one to learn the mistakes of. Which makes this all the harder to implement right. It's a matter of scale, and we would need to think carefully about every step we take."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the documentation, what is one of the main challenges faced by Stack Overflow in maintaining its quality and expert participation, particularly in popular tags like PHP?\n\nA) Lack of modern features in programming languages like PHP\nB) Insufficient number of users on the platform\nC) Degradation of question quality due to an influx of novice users\nD) Absence of a package manager for PHP\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation highlights that Stack Overflow has experienced a \"huge degradation in quality, attributed to a decrease in signal:noise ratio\" in popular tags like PHP and jQuery. This is primarily due to the influx of less experienced developers asking basic questions, which has led to many experts giving up and leaving the platform.

Similarly the OpenJDKs are not universal.\n\nThus to run on ARM and Intel you need two different JREs\n\nPure Java code should run on any operating system (Linux, Solaris, Windows, macOS and others) and on any architecture e.g. Intel, Arm, SPARC. So you only need one jar for all.\n\nThe C code could be built universal and your app could be packaged to include both JREs and the launcher (i.e. executable file given in Info.plist) works out from the architecture which JRE to call)\n\nJava 8 worked as it is Intel and so the whole process ran under Rosetta"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A Java application that runs on both Intel and ARM-based Macs is experiencing issues after upgrading to an M1 Mac with ARM architecture. The application uses native libraries through JNI. What is the most likely cause of the problem and the best solution?\n\nA) The Java bytecode is incompatible with ARM architecture. Recompile the Java code specifically for ARM.\n\nB) The JDK installed on the M1 Mac is not compatible. Install a universal JDK that supports both Intel and ARM architectures.\n\nC) The native libraries used by the application are compiled only for Intel architecture. Obtain or compile ARM versions of the native libraries and package both versions with the application.\n\nD) The Java Virtual Machine is not optimized for ARM. Switch to a different JVM implementation designed for ARM processors.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The root cause of the issue is that the application is using native libraries (like libgluegen_rt.dylib) that are compiled only for Intel architecture (x86_64). When running on an M1 Mac with ARM architecture, these libraries cannot be loaded, resulting in an UnsatisfiedLinkError.\n\nThe best solution is to obtain or compile ARM versions of the native libraries and package both Intel and ARM versions with the application. This allows the application to run natively on both Intel and ARM-based Macs by loading the appropriate version of the library based on the system architecture.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Java bytecode is platform-independent and doesn't need to be recompiled for different architectures.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there isn't a single \"universal\" JDK that runs natively on both Intel and ARM. Separate JDK installations are typically required for each architecture.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the JVM itself is not the primary issue here. The problem lies with the native libraries, not the Java Virtual Machine implementation."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/07/06", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/118602", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/3119/"], "docs_id": 118602, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I\u2019m not very clear with the implication of the following sentence in the article titled \u201cThe Science of Romance: Why we love\u201d that appeared in Time magazine (Jan.28, 2008\\):\n\n> \u201cBut if it was that kind of sex that\u2019s the whole reason you took up\n>  having sex **in the first place** \u2013 the out\\-of breath, out\\-of\\-body,\n>  can\\-you\\-believe\\-this\u2013is\\-actually\\-happening kind of sex \u2013 **the rational\n>  you had probably taken a powder.\u201d**\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. \u201cin the first place\u201d \u2013 Does it mean (sex you have) for the first time as a first experience or \u201cas the primary reason (for having sex)?\n2.

Use of an article (*the*) with a personal pronoun (*you*) is normally wrong, but it is normal in some circumstances.\u00b9\n\nTo *take a powder* is to absent yourself.

In this context, \"the rational you\" refers to the logical or rational part of one's mind or personality.

Usually, when a door is installed, the opening is 1/2 \\- 1\" wider than the door casing so there's plenty of room to get the frame nice and square in the opening. This extra space is filled with shims to hold it in alignment, then it's nailed or screwed through the shims to hold it steady. It's these screws/nails that I'm referring to. They may have been covered with wood putty before the frame was painted, so they may not be very obvious.\n\nIf it was nailed into place, the nails may be slowly slipping out of place, but the heads are remaining buried under the putty. As you pull the frame back straight, it may actually pop the nail through. This will be obvious, and you only need to hammer it back in, then use a nail\\-set to get it below flush. Some putty \\& touch\\-up paint and you're done.\n\nIf it was screwed into place, the screw could cause the casing to bow as the threads hold the casing in place while your new, longer screws pull the hinge back in line. Use a long straight edge to detect this. The high spot will likely be a screw location \\& a magnet should confirm it. You may have to scrape some paint \\& putty away, loosen these screws, tighten the ones in the hinges then drive these back home.\n\nFinally, do *not* try to bend the hinge.

Maybe I'm being stupid?\n\n---\n\nEDIT to ask a directly related question: \\-\n\nI've correctly calculated that a 1mm radius ball will possess a so\\-called \"self capacitance\" of 0\\.111pF. If two such balls existed and were placed a million miles away from each other (in an empty universe) would the capacitance between them approximately equal 0\\.0555pF i.e. half of 0\\.111pF? This \"guess\" is based on the capacitance of a 1mm ball to an infinite sphere being 0\\.111pF and from the infinite sphere to the other ball is another 0\\.111pF.\n\nTherefore, with 2 capacitors in series of the same value, the net capacitance is halved. I can't believe that this is true but I'm not really sure.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To expand on my comment, [this notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance#Self-capacitance) of self\\-capacitance is a theoretical one, much like, say, an ideal operational amplifier is; the latter has infinite \\[open\\-loop] gain. Here you have a capacitor with infinite distance between plates and the 2nd, reference electrode/sphere also has infinite area. When one comes across such idealizations based on thought experiments, the question to ask is not whether it can exist, but ask why is it a useful notion.\n\nBasically this notion is useful as a first\\-order approximation to problems where the distance is finite but large. [For example](https://books.google.com/books?id=fP4wBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA172), [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fRfU9.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fRfU9.png)\n\n\"Equation 5\\.4\" there simply estimates the mutual capacitance of two \\[identical] conductors at large distance as one\\-half of the self\\-capacitance.\n\nSimilarly, a first\\-order approximation of the capacitance\\-to\\-ground (which is a mutual capacitance) of a conductor (placed at some significant distance from ground) is the self\\-capacitance of the conductor. Ground here is approximated to have infinite area.\n\nAlso worth noting here is that mutual capacitance of two finite\\-area electrodes differs from their self\\-capacitance, even with infinite distance between them.\n\nAlso, as you probably discovered already, \"self\\-capacitance\" is also used (e.g. [in transformer contexts](https://books.google.com/books?id=aN0gBQAAQBAJ&pg=SA15-PA3&dq=self-capacitance)) to refer to the mutual, [parasitic capacitance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_capacitance) of the winding. These two are rather different notions. I don't think the former notion of self\\-capacitance helps much with estimating the latter in a transformer.\n\n---\n\nActually, I can prove the last part even here. From Zangwill, *Modern Electrodynamics* (p. 140\\), the capacitance of a two\\-conductor capacitor is given by\n\n$$C\\= \\\\frac{C\\_{11}C\\_{22}\\-C^2\\_{12}}{C\\_{11}\\+C\\_{22}\\+2C\\_{12}}$$\n\nWhere \\\\$C\\_{ij}\\\\$ are the [capacitance coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficients_of_potential); in general, this is a symmetric matrix. So if \\\\$C\\_{11} \\= C\\_{22}\\\\$ and \\\\$C\\_{12} \\= 0\\\\$ then \\\\$C\\=C\\_{11}/2\\\\$, i.e. the capacitance of the two\\-spheres \\[at large distance] is half of the self\\-capacitance of a sphere.\n\nFrom [Banerjee](http://www.electrostatics.org/images/ESA_2014_G_Banerjee_et_al.pdf) you can see that the following happens as the distance gets large:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lmF45.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lmF45.png)\n\nThose dimensionless capacitance coefficients plotted there are simply:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHPEe.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHPEe.png)\n\nwhich means exactly what I wrote above in terms of the non\\-dimensionless ones."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing a system with two identical spherical conductors, each with a radius of 1 mm, placed far apart in space.

What is the approximate mutual capacitance between these two spheres when they are placed at a very large distance from each other?\n\nA) 0.111 pF\nB) 0.0555 pF\nC) 0.222 pF\nD) 0.0278 pF\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B (0.0555 pF). This problem relates to the concept of self-capacitance and mutual capacitance of conductors at large distances.\n\nA) 0.111 pF is incorrect. This is the self-capacitance of each individual sphere, not the mutual capacitance between them.\n\nB) 0.0555 pF is correct. As explained in the documentation, for two identical conductors at a large distance, the mutual capacitance can be approximated as one-half of the self-capacitance. Since each sphere has a self-capacitance of 0.111 pF, the mutual capacitance would be approximately 0.111 pF / 2 = 0.0555 pF.\n\nC) 0.222 pF is incorrect. This would be the sum of the self-capacitances, not the mutual capacitance.\n\nD) 0.0278 pF is incorrect. This would be one-quarter of the self-capacitance, which is not the correct relationship for mutual capacitance at large distances.\n\nThe answer can be further verified by the formula provided in the documentation: C = (C11*C22 - C12^2) / (C11 + C22 + 2C12). When the distance is very large, C12 approaches 0, and C11 = C22 (self-capacitance of each sphere).

The documentation explains that these \"smart\" testers can be misleading in their interpretations. When a GFCI trips, it should disconnect both hot and neutral wires. The \"Open Hot\" reading on older GFCIs actually indicates that there's no power at all, which is the intended function. The tester's interpretation is overly simplistic and designed for new construction assembly errors, not for diagnosing issues in existing wiring. The difference in readings between older and newer GFCIs is likely due to changes in how the tester interprets the lack of power, rather than a fundamental difference in how the GFCIs function.

They arise from a parametric, non\\-linear transformation of a random variable (RV) $X \\\\sim F$, to a heavy\\-tailed version $Y \\\\sim \\\\text{Lambert W} \\\\times F$. For $F$ being Gaussian they reduce to Tukey's $h$ distribution. \n\nThey have one parameter $\\\\delta \\\\geq 0$ that regulates the degree of tail heaviness (you can also choose different left and right heavy tails). In its most basic form it transforms a standard Normal $U \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0,1\\)$ to a Lambert W $\\\\times$ Gaussian $Z$ by\n$$\nZ \\= U \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\delta}{2} U^2\\\\right)\n$$\n\nIf $\\\\delta \\> 0$ $Z$ has heavier tails than $U$; for $\\\\delta \\= 0$ $Z$ falls back to your initial RV $U$. \n\nIf you don't want to use the Gaussian distribution as your baseline, you can just create other Lambert W versions of your favorite distributions, e.g. t, uniform, gamma, exponential, beta, ... However, for the purpose of heavy\\-tails the Gaussian seems to be the obvious baseline reference.\n\nSince this heavy\\-tail generation is based on transformations of RVs/data rather than a manipulation of cdfs or pdfs, it is very convenient to implement: just use your code to simulate any standard RV, add one line that transforms it, and then you have a random sample from the heavy\\-tail version of your initial RV.\n\nIn R this becomes (using the [LambertW](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LambertW/index.html) package)\n\n```\nlibrary(LambertW)\nset.seed(1)\nzz = rLambertW(n=1000, distname = \"normal\", beta = c(0,1), delta = 0.5)\nnormfit(zz)\n\n```\n\nYou can also fit the best model to the data using a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)\n\n```\nmodel = MLE_LambertW(zz, distname = \"normal\", type = \"h\")\nsummary(model)\nplot(model)\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is working on an algorithm that requires random numbers from a distribution with heavy tails and no skew.

Steam tells me \"there is not enough free disk space\".\nInstead, I've solved the issue by manually moving the game to the HDD and then back again to the SSD every time a patch is up, so it downloads the patch on the HDD then I move the game back to the SSD.\n\nI would like to find an automatic patching of the game so I don't have to manually move the game between drives/discs every time there is a new patch. **Ideally, the game would stay on the SSD and the download and patching would happen from the HDD so that it allocates the space on the HDD instead.** \n\n*Can it be solved by removing the association to the library on the SSD for Steam and create a link that leads to the game folder on the SSD?* I'd think that this way, Steam would download the patch on the HDD and then update the files on the SSD thinking that Steam would still be working on the HDD. *Is this the best way to do it or does it involve future problems with patching TWW?*\n\nMy question touches the concept of [the answer to this question](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/8179/183080), \"How can I move Steam games to another disk?\", asked in 2010\\.

I ran into the same issue with Hollow Knight last week, when an update was sent out. The update itself was only 1GB, but Steam automatically allocated an additional 9GB for the update.

Here's one such glossary (there are numerous others): [Jazz Slang](http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=1404).\n\nI'm wondering if this is based on some actual history of the term, or if a bunch of \"jazz glossaries\" are just copying from each other, especially since there are some other comprehensive glossaries that do not include the term. I also very much thought the term was more modern than the Jazz Era, but I could be falling for the recency fallacy there. Then again, considering that the atomic bomb was dropped in the 40's it's feasible that the term originated in the Jazz scene.\n\nThe oldest reference I could find of this usage is from 1973 [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=4YfsEgHLjboC&pg=PA220&lpg=PA220&dq=%22the%20bomb%22%20slang&source=bl&ots=7JXDI6l14c&sig=6PAMrKc-8yq8j7YxvkcyqXKIEPg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_pT6Uu3aI5W0sQTpqoGgDA&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=%22the%20bomb%22%20slang&f=false), but I don't have access to the OED, so I'm not sure if there's an older reference in there.

Numerous folks indicate that Windows doesn't register the `Fn` key as a keypress but using [Mihov ASCII Master 2\\.0](http://www.mihov.com/eng/am.html), that gives the ASCII value of a keypress, I see the Fn key returning FF (perhaps FF in this case means 'not registered'). I also see that keys like `Ctrl` register with one ASCII code when pressed alone and another when pressed in combo with another key. `Fn` will only register when pressed alone, so Windows definitely isn't seeing the combo. This took a solution like AutoHotKey off the table.\n2. I ran [KeyTweak](http://webpages.charter.net/krumsick/) (which shows you the hardware scan codes of a keypress and the `Fn` key registerd as 57443\\). Using this program I remapped `Fn` to the `Ctrl` key; this worked perfectly. However, I suspect that because of the issue in \\#1, the combo of, for example, `Fn` \\+ `C` did *not* execute a copy.\n\nShort of retraining my pinky I'm actually considering removing the keyboard and resoldering the connections to swap those keys.\n\nI'd love to get some input as to the root technical issue(s) and possible solutions here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Apparently the FN key is not handled by the Windows keyboard driver, but rather by drivers developed by Lenovo. Hence remapping of the FN key is impossible by any Windows utility that switches keys, because the Fn key doesn't generate any scan\\-codes.\n\nApparently Lenovo is currently considering a modification to the BIOS that will make this possible.

The documentation explains that the Fn key is not handled by the Windows keyboard driver, but rather by drivers developed by Lenovo.

I mainly wanted to know the case why ringing is observed in the open circuit termination at both ends. What is the mechanism behind it? \n\nPlease consider answering the questions in edit.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We'll start with what a square wave is.\n\nA [square wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave#Fourier_analysis) is a bunch of sine waves added together. You have a primary, and a bunch of harmonics added to it. The harmonics are in a particular phase relationship to the primary. The sum of all the waves is a square wave. If you leave any of the sine waves out (or change their phase,) then the sum looks less like an ideal sine wave.\n\nThis image from the Wikipedia page illustrates it clearly:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sdaUx.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sdaUx.gif)\n\nNow, on to the reflections.\n\nIf your transmission line were terminated in a perfect resistor that doesn't match the line impedance (and there were no effects from capacitance or inductance) then the reflection would be a nice, sharp copy of your original square wave.\n\nIn any real circuit, you will have capacitances and inductances to deal with.\n\nThe inductance, capacitance, and resistance of your transmission line will interact with the inductance, capacitance, and resistance of the termination. The result is an impedance that varies with frequency.\n\nA square wave is a collection of sine waves of different frequencies, so different parts of it are more or less strongly reflected. Some frequencies will be slightly delayed, and some won't.\n\nThe result is often that some part is reflected as a somewhat proper looking square wave while other parts are reflected differently enough that you can see the sine wave itself.\n\nWhen neither end is properly terminated, then each sine in the square wave is reflected depending where exactly it \"hits the end.\" \n\nSay you have a transmission line 1 meter long, and a wave one meter long. In this case, there will be no reflection \\- the wave fits exactly in the transmission line.\n\nNow keep the 1 meter transmission line, but change to a wave that is 67 centimeters long. The wave doesn't fit exactly in the transmission line anymore. Part of it will be reflected.\n\nPut the one meter wave and the 67 centimeter wave into the same transmission line at the same time, and you will only see reflections from the 67 centimeter wave.\n\nNow consider your square wave (made of waves of different lengths.) Some parts will reflect more strongly than other parts. If most of the sine waves reflect together, then you might get something that looks like a square wave. You might also get a situation where only a few (or one) frequency reflects strongly \\- in which case you get something that looks like a sine wave as a reflection. That's ringing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A square wave signal is applied to a transmission line with mismatched impedance at both ends. Which of the following best describes the resulting reflections and ringing phenomenon?\n\nA) Only the fundamental frequency of the square wave is reflected, resulting in a pure sine wave ringing.\n\nB) The entire square wave is reflected intact, maintaining its original shape without any distortion.\n\nC) Different frequency components of the square wave are reflected differently based on the transmission line characteristics, potentially resulting in a combination of square-like reflections and sinusoidal ringing.\n\nD) Only the highest frequency harmonics are reflected, causing high-frequency oscillations without any resemblance to the original square wave.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because a square wave is composed of multiple sine wave components (fundamental and harmonics). In a mismatched transmission line, these different frequency components interact differently with the line's impedance characteristics. Some frequencies may be reflected more strongly or with different phase shifts than others. This can result in a complex reflection pattern where parts of the signal may maintain a square-like appearance while others exhibit sinusoidal ringing. The overall reflection and ringing are a result of how these various frequency components are reflected and combine at the terminations. This explanation aligns with the complex behavior described in the original text, accounting for the interaction between the square wave's composition and the transmission line's frequency-dependent impedance characteristics."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/03/19", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/172481", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/210658/"], "docs_id": 172481, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I entered today in SO and there is not the small hyper\\-link to \"Tag Subscription\\>\\>\" that was on the right side of the page anymore.

I understand that is the velocity of mass flow relative to body. But in the rotational equation, I don't see a similar corresponding term such as the 'relative angular velocity $\\\\omega\\_{re}$'. I thought the mass flow has it own angular velocity and angular momentum when it is added or ejected from the body. Why does the rotational equation not include the relative angular velocity of the mass flow?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Two spherical objects A and B are at rest in empty space and are charged in such a way that the net force between them (gravitational and electromagnetic) is exactly zero.\n\nDale's answer seems to suggest that this isn't possible in general relativity because gravity isn't a force, but I think that's wrong, or at least misleading.\n\nIf the cosmological constant is zero, there's [a family of exact solutions to GR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudhansu_Datta_Majumdar#Majumdar%E2%80%94Papapetrou_solution) describing black holes at relative rest with their charges and masses proportional such that there is no net relative force between them. There's no reason (I think) that you couldn't replace the black holes with lumps of ordinary matter.\n\nIf the cosmological constant is positive, then in addition to the usual attractive force, there is an effective repulsive force proportional to $r$ (not $1/r^2$). It should be possible in principle to counter this by decreasing the charge on the bodies, though not realistically in practice since it would be an unstable equilibrium. I'll assume for the rest of this answer that it is possible.\n\n> After a certain period of time, the space between the two objects is measured to have expanded.\n\nNo, it won't expand. This is the key misunderstanding. We constructed this system to be static, and static it is. The distance between the objects will not change over time.\n\nThe only reason the universe is expanding is that (for unknown reasons, possibly related to inflation) it was expanding in the past, and it wasn't dense enough for gravity to stop and reverse the outward inertia. In recent times, the repulsive force due to the cosmological constant has become large enough to be important, but we countered that too in this system. There's nothing else that would make the distance between the objects increase. The universe doesn't *want* to expand. There is no physical process that enforces the expansion by inserting space between objects. I wrote [another answer](/a/601323) about this."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a hypothetical scenario, two spherical objects A and B are at rest in empty space, charged such that the net force between them (gravitational and electromagnetic) is exactly zero. According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The space between the two objects will inevitably expand over time due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nB) This scenario is impossible in general relativity because gravity is not a force.\n\nC) The objects will remain at a constant distance from each other, assuming the cosmological constant is accounted for.\n\nD) The objects will oscillate back and forth due to the interplay of gravitational and electromagnetic forces.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided states that it is possible to construct a static system where two charged objects remain at rest relative to each other, even in the context of general relativity. This can be achieved by balancing the gravitational attraction, electromagnetic repulsion, and the effect of the cosmological constant (if non-zero). The key point is that such a system, once set up, would remain static - the distance between the objects would not change over time. The expansion of the universe does not inherently cause objects to move apart if other forces are keeping them in place. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest movement that wouldn't occur in this carefully balanced system. Option B is incorrect because, while gravity is treated differently in general relativity, the scenario described is still possible with the right conditions."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/01/21", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/47359", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/14263/"], "docs_id": 47359, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to know how to make a sentence with 'determine'.\n\nfor example, I want to determine a recommendation blog by selecting a blog which has a high quality score from among a plurality of blogs.\n\nSo, should I say 'determine a blog which has a high score as a recommendation blog'? \nor should I say 'determine(decide) a blog which has a high score to be a recommendation blog.?\n\nI mean, it's like setting something as A. but I don't know if it's the right way to say 'determining/deciding something as\" or 'to be'.\n\nThanks in advance \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Judging by definition \\#2 when [Googling](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=determine&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), *determine* implies an exact thing, like an answer to something.

In the above example I'm also pushing it in `$logger`, the `Logger` instance.\n\n(And also note that simply adding this processor to your code won't solve your issue, since the call to `Logger::info()` would always happen in `app_log::info()`).\n\nRemember that you'll need to add the corresponding `use` statement: `use Monolog\\Processor\\IntrospectionProcessor;`\n\nI do not know all the details of your system, and can't build it all for you anyway, but if dependency injection is still too much for you, you could just cheat temporarily with a global\\-state approach.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```\nfunction get_logger() {\n   static $logger;\n\n   if ($logger !== null) {\n      return $logger;\n   }\n\n   $logger  = new Logger('applog');\n   $handler = new RotatingFileHandler('useractivity.log', 0, Logger::INFO);\n   $handler->setFormatter(new LineFormatter(\"[%datetime%] %extra.process_id% %channel%.%level_name%: %message% %extra% %context% \\n\"));\n   $logger->pushHandler($handler);\n   $logger->pushProcessor(new WebProcessor);\n   $logger->pushProcessor(new IntrospectionProcessor);\n\n   return $logger;\n}\n\n```\n\nYou could put this in a file that you `require_once`, and in each of these places where you need access to the logger you can simply do:\n\n```\n get_logger()->info('write to the log!');\n\n```\n\n**This is not something I'd endorse**, but a crummy workaround for you to get moving until you advance somewhat in your understanding of other OOP topics.

According to the StackExchange response, the primary reason for the high cost of RAID controllers is the principle of supply and demand. The market for RAID controllers is significantly smaller compared to more common devices like routers or MPEG decoders. This limited demand means that manufacturers cannot benefit from economies of scale, resulting in higher prices per unit. \n\nOption A is incorrect because RAID controllers are not necessarily more technologically advanced than routers or decoders.

However, the exterior of the wall has some wood siding that is about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. So I'm not sure if these wood planks are necessary.

In this case, the probability of seeing those two test statistics under the null hypothesis would be $0\\.05 \\\\times 0\\.1 \\= 0\\.005$, which is a less likely and thus more significant value?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"I believe the interpretation of the p\\-value is that it is the probability of seeing your sample's test statistic under the null hypothesis.\"\n\nNo. It is the probability to see your sample's test statistic *or something that is even less in line with the null hypothesis* ($H\\_0$) under the $H\\_0$, which I write as $P\\_0\\\\{T\\\\ge t\\\\}$, where $T$ is the test statistic and $t$ is its observed value, assuming here that a large value of $T$ provides evidence against $H\\_0$ (the argument can as well be made for the $\\\\{T\\\\le t\\\\}$ or the two\\-sided case).\n\nIf you have, say, $p\\=0\\.06$ in one test $T\\_1$ with result $t\\_1$ and $p\\=0\\.6$ in the next ($T\\_2, t\\_2$; let's assume they were done on independent observations), if you multiply these two, what you get is the probability of $\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\} \\\\cap \\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\}$, i.e., the probability that $T\\_1$ *and* $T\\_2$ are large under the $H\\_0$. This is of course less likely than having at least one of them large. But there are cases with at least one of them large that count at least as strongly against the $H\\_0$, such as having $T\\_1$ extremely large even if $T\\_2$ doesn't indicate problems with the $H\\_0$, so the event $\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\} \\\\cap \\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\}$, of which you get the probability by multiplying the p\\-values, does not cover all possibilities to observe *something that is even less in line with the $H\\_0$* than what you observed, and is therefore smaller than a valid \"combined\" p\\-value would need to be.\n\nIn my example above, surely after having observed $t\\_1$ with $P\\_0\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\}\\=0\\.06$, observing $t\\_2$ with $P\\_0\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\}\\=0\\.6$ doesn't make the overall result indicate any stronger against the $H\\_0$ (as multiplying the p\\-values would suggest), because observing something with $P\\_0\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\}\\=0\\.6$ is perfectly reasonable under $H\\_0$; however observing $T\\_1$ even larger than $t\\_1$ would arguably count stronger against $H\\_0$ even with observing a smaller $T\\_2$.\n\nThe problem with combining p\\-values from more than one test is that if you only have a one\\-dimensional test statistic, as long as this statistic is suitably defined, it is clear how you can find all possible outcomes that are less in line with $H\\_0$ than your observation (depending on the test statistic either by looking at all larger, or all smaller values, or combining the two sides). However, with two or more values of the test statistic, in the higher dimensional space of possible outcomes it is much more difficult to define what \"less in line with $H\\_0$\" actually means. One possibility to play it safe is to look at $P\\_0(\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\})$, the probability that at least one of $T\\_1$ and $T\\_2$ is too large. This for sure covers all possibilities that the pair $(T\\_1,T\\_2\\)$ is less in line with $H\\_0$ than the observations $(t\\_1,t\\_2\\)$. It actually covers far too much and is therefore very conservative. It may in fact be seen as useless, because its probability will always be bigger than $P\\_0\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\}$, so this won't allow you to find a significance based on $(T\\_1,T\\_2\\)$ if you don't find one based on $T\\_1$ alone. If the two tests are independent, as apparently assumed here, $P\\_0(\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\})\\=1\\-(1\\-P\\_0\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\})(1\\-P\\_0\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\})\\=0\\.624$ in the example, so there you have your multiplication.\n\nNote that $2\\\\min(P\\_0\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\},P\\_0\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\})\\=0\\.12$ in the example is the so\\-called Bonferroni\\-corrected p\\-value, which gives an upper bound on the probability that any of the two indicates at least as much against $H\\_0$ than the one that has the stronger indication, which is somewhat better than $P\\_0(\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_2\\\\})$, but still will not allow you to have an overall combined p\\-value that is smaller than all those you observe for the isolated tests. Under independence this can be improved to $1\\-(1\\-\\\\min (P\\_0\\\\{T\\_1\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\},P\\_0\\\\{T\\_2\\\\ge t\\_1\\\\}))^2\\=0\\.116$, not much change here.

Option A is incorrect because simply multiplying p-values doesn't account for all possibilities less in line with the null hypothesis. Option B, while mathematically correct for the probability of at least one significant result, is too conservative and doesn't provide a useful combined p-value. Option C, the Bonferroni correction, is overly conservative and not the most appropriate in this case.
