But one standard definition goes as follows. Let $P(x\\_1,x\\_2,\\\\dots,x\\_k)$ be a polynomial with *integer* coefficients. A *solution* of the Diophantine equation $P(x\\_1,x\\_2,\\\\dots,x\\_k)\\=0$ is a $k$\\-tuple $(x\\_1,x\\_2,\\\\dots,x\\_k)$ of *integers* that satisfies the equation. An equation is Diophantine partly because of its shape, but much more because of the *kinds* of solutions we are looking for.\n\nGeneral Diophantine equations can be exceedingly difficult. However, in principle one variable equation are simple. We have a polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients. Let \n$$P(x)\\=a\\_0x^n\\+a\\_1x^{n\\-1}\\+a\\_2x^{n\\-2}\\+\\\\cdots \\+a\\_n.$$\nWithout loss of generality we may assume that the constant term $a\\_n$ is not equal to $0$. It is straightforward to show that any integer solution of the equation $P(x)\\=0$ must divide the constant term $a\\_n$.\n\nSo there is a simple (in principle!) algorithm for finding all the integer solutions of $P(x)\\=0$: \n\n(i) Find all the divisors (positive and negative) of the constant term and then \n\n(ii) Find out, by substitution, which ones of these divisors \"work.\"\n\nAs you know, factorization of large numbers can be computationally difficult. However, there certainly is an algorithm for factoring.\n\n**Remark:** There is a very famous related problem, called *Hilbert's 10th Problem*. Hilbert asked for a general algorithm that would, for any polynomial $P$ with integer coefficients, and possibly many variables, determine whether the equation $P\\=0$ has integer solutions. After earlier progress by a number of people, Matijasevich showed that there is *no* general algorithm of the type that Hilbert asked for. But as we noted in our answer to your question, there certainly *is* an algorithm that works for polynomials in one variable.\n\nDiophantus himself in his *Arithmetica* looked mainly for *rational* solutions. Often, a problem is called Diophantine if we are interested in solutions that are somehow fairly closely related to the integers. \n\nNote that (at least to people in Logic) the famous Fermat equation $x^n\\+y^n\\=z^n$ is not a Diophantine equation, since the exponents are also variable. Such equations are sometimes called *exponential Diophantine*, or, more casually, Diophantine. \n\n**A simple example:** Consider the equation $3x^4\\-12x^3\\-x^2\\+4x\\=0$. We want to find all integer solutions of this equation. First rewrite our equation as \n$x(3x^3\\-12x^2\\-x\\+4\\)\\=0$. This has the obvious solution $x\\=0$. Any other solutions must be solutions of the equation \n$$3x^3\\-12x^2\\-x\\+4\\=0\\.$$\nBy the result mentioned in the main post, any integer solution of this equation must divide the constant term $4$. The divisors of $4$ are $\\\\pm 1$, $\\\\pm 2$, and $\\\\pm 4$. Substitute these values in turn for $x$. We find that $x\\=4$ is a root, but none of the others are. So we have found all the integer solutions of our original equation: they are $x\\=0$ and $x\\=4$."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider the Diophantine equation 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 5x - 15 = 0.

The divisors of 15 are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b15, and \u00b115. \n\nBy substituting these values into the equation:\n\n2(3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 5(3) - 15 = 54 - 54 + 15 - 15 = 0\n\nWe find that x = 3 is indeed a solution.

Since momentum is conserved in the collision (assuming its elastic), some momentum of the moving particle is transferred to the stationary particle. As a result, the momentum of the moving particle decreases upon collision, an effect of the \"equal and opposite force\" exerted by the stationary particle. \n\nBut when it comes to gravitational (and electric) fields, Newton's Third Law seems to hold because of the equation $F\\=G\\\\frac{m\\_1m\\_2}{r^2}$. Also the previous example wouldn't make sense because the total momentum/kinetic energy of objects in a field is always changing (not conserved). **Edit**: The momentum is conserved, because the system here includes the earth which also experiences a force of equal magnitude. the system should be a closed system for momentum to be conserved.\n\nThe justifications for Newton's Third Law seem to vary from case to case. Would there be any way to relate the two above cases and other cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Newton's third law *doesn't* work for fields. There isn't even any way to state it for fields. (It's stated for instantaneous action at a distance between material particles, not for systems that include fields carrying their own momentum.) Consider the situation shown below, with two positive charges moving with the velocities indicated by the arrows.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9Zkf.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9Zkf.jpg)\n\nThe electric forces are not equal and opposite, because the electric field of a moving charge is not spherically symmetric. The magnetic forces are not equal and opposite, because the magnetic force acting on 1 is zero, while the magnetic force acting on 2 is nonzero and upward. Momentum is still conserved, because momentum is being taken away from the system through electromagnetic radiation.\n\nRe the question of why Newton's third law is true, this depends on what principles you consider to be more fundamental than Newton's third law. You can't prove theorems unless you pick axioms to start with. If you ask most physicists today, they would probably say that conservation of momentum follows from translation symmetry via Noether's theorem, and Newton's third law is the only obvious way of making up a physical law that enforces conservation of momentum, in the special case of a system of point particles interacting through instantaneous action at a distance.\n\nWithin the more restrictive scenario of Newtonian systems of particles, another good justification for Newton's third law is that you need it for conservation of momentum, and without conservation of momentum you don't get conservation of energy. This is because requiring conservation of energy to hold in all frames of reference, not just in one frame, is equivalent to conservation of momentum."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the applicability and implications of Newton's Third Law in different physical scenarios?\n\nA) Newton's Third Law applies universally to all physical interactions, including field interactions like electromagnetism and gravity.\n\nB) Newton's Third Law is only valid for direct collisions between particles and fails in all field interactions.\n\nC) Newton's Third Law holds for gravitational fields due to the symmetry of the force equation, but breaks down for electromagnetic interactions involving moving charges.\n\nD) Newton's Third Law is not universally applicable, particularly in field theories, but conservation of momentum is still maintained through other mechanisms in those cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \n\nOption A is incorrect because the given information explicitly states that Newton's Third Law doesn't work for fields and there isn't even a way to state it for fields.\n\nOption B is too extreme.

It acknowledges that Newton's Third Law is not universally applicable, especially in field theories like electromagnetism. However, it also recognizes that conservation of momentum, which is the underlying principle that Newton's Third Law helps maintain in simpler systems, is still preserved in these more complex scenarios through other mechanisms (like the momentum carried by fields themselves)."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/09/20", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/667090", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/182409/"], "docs_id": 667090, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have read extensively about neutrino energies, including in the popular press, and yet velocities of the neutrinos themselves (not the detectors they 'run into' or the leptons they 'create' after interaction) are rarely mentioned....\n\nHow can a neutrino's speed be measured to begin with?\n\nHow sure are experimenters and theorists about their calculations of neutrino energies, anyway?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> How can a neutrino's speed be measured to begin with?\n\nis answered in [the link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurements_of_neutrino_speed) given in a comment to the question ,\n\n> Astronomical searches investigate whether light and neutrinos emitted simultaneously from a distant source are arriving simultaneously on Earth.

English isn't perfect yet, so if anyone can give either Russian, Arabic, or Mandarin translations of complex terms, this would also help very much.\n\nMany of the responses mentioned the big bang, and I thought that maybe it's continuous expansion, if the expansion is throughout and not new mass added on the edge of expansion, is this what balances out gravity? And if so, can its rate of movement (due to the loss of energy over time) decrease to a point that gravity overpowers it, and all mass would collapse in on itself?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The mere fact that the universe is expanding doesn't mean that it can't collapse, any more than a stone moving upward means it can't turn around and come back down. The universe eventually *would* stop expanding and collapse back to a Big Crunch if it had enough matter and no dark energy.\n\nBut there apparently *is* dark energy, and it is making the universe expand faster and faster, not slower and slower! The *anti*\\-gravity of dark energy has been the dominant force in the universe for the last five or six billion years. Matter is no longer particularly important. According to the standard [Lambda\\-CDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model) model of cosmology, dark energy now constitutes 69\\.11% percent of the energy density of the universe, and matter (both visible and dark) only 30\\.89%.\n\nAccording to the model, the universe will continue to expand forever, faster and faster, with the Friedmann scale factor $a(t)$ that determines its size eventually doubling every 11\\.6 billion years. The fraction of the energy density due to matter will approach 0%, while the fraction of the energy density due to dark energy will approach 100%. There is no Big Crunch in our future, according to the model.\n\nNote: There is no \"edge\" to the expanding universe. Galaxies are not expanding into empty space \"beyond the edge\". Instead, space is expanding everywhere between galaxies, and there is no distance far from us at which you stop finding galaxies. Also, there is no new mass being added.\n\nIf there were no dark energy, the universe would be expanding slower and slower rather than faster and faster. If there was enough matter, it would turn around and collapse. If there was not enough matter, it would keep expanding. It would be like a rocket launched from Earth. If a rocket isn't launched with escape velocity, it falls back to Earth. If it has exactly escape velocity, it can reach infinity with zero velocity. If it has more than escape velocity, it can reach infinity with positive velocity. This is similar to how the universe would work if there were no dark energy.\n\nCORRECTION\n\n11\\.6 billion years is actually the eventual $e$\\-folding time of the scale factor $a(t)$. The doubling time is $\\\\ln{2}$ times this, or 8\\.04 billion years."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the current understanding of the universe's expansion and its future, according to the Lambda-CDM model?\n\nA) The universe will eventually stop expanding and collapse into a Big Crunch due to the gravitational pull of matter.\n\nB) The universe is expanding at a constant rate, with dark energy and matter equally contributing to its expansion.\n\nC) The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, and will continue to expand forever with dark energy becoming increasingly dominant.\n\nD) The universe is expanding slower over time as it loses energy, and may eventually collapse when gravity overpowers the expansion.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Lambda-CDM model, dark energy is currently the dominant force in the universe, constituting about 69.11% of the energy density. This dark energy is causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. The model predicts that the universe will continue to expand indefinitely, with the expansion rate increasing over time. As this happens, the fraction of energy density due to matter will approach 0%, while dark energy will approach 100%.

But I want to clarify that from the person's view who is on the spaceship, things look differently.\n\nI need to state four things:\n\n1. John Rennie is only right in a mathematical case from the stationary observer's view where we have a theoretical spaceship that can accelerate forever.\n2. As per SR/GR we know that anything with rest mass, as it reaches near the speed of light, will not be able to physically accelerate any more, because it would need infinite energy to do so.\n3. From the view of the person on the spaceship at some FINITE time on his clock, he will then see that the spaceship is not able to accelerate anymore(because he would need infinite energy to do so), it's speed will stay constant less than $c$. After that, the light will catch up to him.\n4. So if this happens at some finite time on the clock of the person in the spaceship, then the stationery observer's clock will show some much bigger, but still finite time, as the spaceship, now from the stationery observer's view, will stop accelerating, and it's speed will stay constant less than $c$. After that the stationery observer will see light catch\\-up to the spaceship.\n\nBecause in theory in John Rennie's explanation of course you can outrun the light, assuming that you can accelerate forever. But in our world, since nothing can go faster than light (because after a while, near speed $c$ the spaceship would need infinite energy to accelerate), at approx $61162111$ seconds (on the person's clock on the spacecraft), he reaches almost the speed of light and stops accelerating, and the light will catch\\-up to him soon after. Because we know that anything with rest mass will not be able to accelerate any more as it reaches close to the speed $c$. So at that point from the view of the person on the spaceship, his speed will not increase anymore and the light will catch up to him.\n\nSo I would like someone to please explain to me why the accelerating twin would outrun light in our world (I proved he can't) and then why is it necessary to use the Rindler metric instead of the Minkowski metric?\n\nMy question is about what he person on the spacecraft will see at $61162111$ seconds on his own clock (supposed the clocks start at $0$).\n\nAnd I am talking about the theoretical case when the spaceship would be able to accelerate forever.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Calculating the clock difference with either the simple SR length contraction will give the same result as if we calculate using this more complicated GR acceleration Rindler metric?\n2. What will the person on the spaceship see on the ships speedometer, when his own clock shows around $61162111$ seconds (supposed that his clock was set to $0$ at the time of start)?\n3. According to SR we know that the person on the spaceship will see his own clock tick normally (as long as he does not compare it to the observer's clock). And he will see the accelerometer showing the constant acceleration too. So at $61162111$ seconds he must see his own spacecraft reaching speed $c$. At that point his clock must stop ticking. So time froze for him?\n4. Since he sees his own clock tick at a normal speed (as long as he does not compare it), is that time freeze sudden? At a certain point? According to SR he having rest mass cannot reach the speed $c$. So he must stop accelerating before that. Then the light will catch up to him?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The exercise to make everything clear\n=====================================\n\nLet me take a simpler example. Suppose we're talking purely 1D classical mechanics, and you have two particles, one moving with constant speed $u$ and the other one moving with a time\\-varying speed parametrized by $\\\\alpha$, $$v(t) \\= \\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\~u\\~ t}{\\\\sqrt{u^2 \\+ (\\\\alpha\\~t)^2}}.$$\nWe start off the first one at position $x\\=0$ and the second one at position $x\\=L$ and set them both moving with these speeds in the $\\+x$ direction.\n\n**Exercise**: prove that there is some $L$ such that they will never meet, that the constantly\\-decreasing speed difference means that the time when they actually meet goes to $\\\\infty$.\n\nWhat? Why does that clarify *anything*?\n---------------------------------------\n\nNow what does this have to do with relativity? Well it turns out that the above $v(t)$ is the $v(t)$ prescribed by the relativistic rocket equation, if $u \\= c$. Therefore from the standpoint of the person on the ground, a light ray never catches up with the relativistic rocket if it is emitted behind a certain distance.\n\n(What does that look like from the perspective of the rocket? It looks like there is a black\\-hole\\-like event horizon behind them; these events are being emitted from behind that horizon.)\n\nThe rest of the paradox is just a standard confusion at a sort of *tension* between two ideas in relativity: relativity enforces some form of speed limit where you would need an infinite amount of energy to go faster than speed $c$, but nobody actually *experiences* this limitation *as a limitation*. The very principle of relativity is that nobody is ever saying, \"here is my absolute motion through absolute space\" and so people must experience themselves as being at rest, with light still moving away from them in all directions at speed $c$ in their rest\\-frame, even though it also recedes at speed $c$ in other reference frames that are moving relative to me. But this is the standard relativistic tension.\n\nSome tension\\-relief: it's all about the simultaneity.\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nI guess my first remark that I like to make to people starting this out is, please pay careful attention to the first\\-order Lorentz transform. Every other Lorentz transform in relativity can be understood as the limit of \"do a little Lorentz transform, then do another little Lorentz transform, then do another little Lorentz transform... repeat until you've built up your whole transform.\" And this is where we see a difference with Newtonian mechanics. Transform by any $\\\\vec v \\= \\[v\\_x;\\~v\\_y;\\~v\\_z]$ large\\-or\\-small, and you will find that Newton prescribes that you convert time coordinates $t$ and space coordinates $\\\\vec r \\= \\[x;\\~y;\\~z]$ according to:$$\n\\\\begin{array}{rcl} t' \\&\\=\\& t,\\\\\\\\\\\\vec r' \\&\\=\\&\\\\vec r \\~\\-\\~ \\\\vec v \\~ t.\\\\end{array}\n$$However Einstein's crazy idea is that this does not represent what's actually happening when we accelerate relative to each other. Instead for small velocities $\\\\vec \\\\epsilon \\= \\\\vec v/c,\\~\\|\\\\vec \\\\epsilon\\| \\\\ll 1,$ you should transform your time coordinate $w \\= c\\~t$ and your space coordinates $\\\\vec r$ to the values: $$\n\\\\begin{array}{rcl} w' \\&\\=\\& w \\~\\-\\~ \\\\vec \\\\epsilon \\\\cdot \\\\vec r,\\\\\\\\\\\\vec r' \\&\\=\\&\\\\vec r \\~\\-\\~ \\\\vec \\\\epsilon \\~ w.\\\\end{array}\n$$\nNote that the second equation is essentially unchanged but the first equation now \"looks like\" the second equation in that the velocity is coming in to 'desynchronize' our clocks. This is called the \"relativity of simultaneity\" and I am just mentioning in passing that the other two core effects of relativity, \"length contraction\" and \"time dilation\", really come from adding up the way that these little desynchronizations get transformed and retransformed by these above equations. Then it gets more useful to confine the motion to one particular direction, like $\\\\vec v/c \\= \\[\\\\beta;\\~ 0;\\~ 0],$ in which case you can write that the general result is:\n$$\n\\\\begin{array}{rcl}\nw' \\&\\=\\& (w \\~\\-\\~ \\\\beta\\~x)\\~/\\~\\\\sqrt{1 \\- \\\\beta^2},\\\\\\\\\nx' \\&\\=\\& (x \\~\\-\\~ \\\\beta\\~w)\\~/\\~\\\\sqrt{1 \\- \\\\beta^2},\\\\\\\\\ny' \\&\\=\\& y,\\\\\\\\\nz' \\&\\=\\& z.\n\\\\end{array}\n$$\nSo, that's what happens when you propagate a ton of these little desynchronizations from little transforms through each other into a bigger transform. These terms $1/sqrt{1 \\- \\\\beta^2}$ appear that start to affect \"here is how long I think your spaceship is, it's much shorter than you think!\" You can derive them a totally different way, by seeing that the cross term $2\\~\\\\beta\\~w\\~x / (1 \\- \\\\beta^2\\)$ is the same for the square of both, so that $(w')^2 \\- (x')^2 \\= w^2 \\- x^2\\.$ This is very important because this property that $\\\\big(w^2 \\- x^2 \\- y^2 \\- z^2 \\\\big)' \\= w^2 \\- x^2 \\- y^2 \\- z^2$ is really a statement about everyone agreeing on the speed of light receding from you: imagine that an event happens suddenly at your location, the light notifying the rest of the cosmos about that event now recedes from you as a thin spherical shell at the speed of light, which means obeying $\\\\sqrt{x^2 \\+ y^2 \\+ z^2} \\= c\\~t.$ Well we defined earlier that $w \\= c\\~t$ and so this number $w^2 \\- x^2 \\- y^2 \\- z^2$ is zero for this expanding\\-light\\-bubble: and what we've just proven is that zero\\-for\\-me means zero\\-for\\-everyone; nobody sees this \"light cone\" that notifies the universe about this event as anything other than a perfect sphere expanding with velocity $c$. So this is what these little desynchronizations are really doing in the background, they're making everyone agree on the structure of these light bubbles, which makes everyone agree on things like causality and stuff.\n\nNow be brutally honest about spaceships.\n----------------------------------------\n\nMy second remark is that we have to think very brutally and physically about what we are describing, if we want to understand what's really going on. What happens to the spaceship that keeps accelerating faster and faster but never hits the speed $c$? Well, let me model its constant acceleration in a simple way: it drops some sort of \"beacon\" and then accelerates until it detects that beacon is travelling away from it with speed $u,$ then it throws down another beacon and accelerates until *that* beacon travels away with speed $u,$ and so on, and so on. To accelerate with constant acceleration, the clock where these beacons are thrown down must be throwing them down at constant intervals.\n\nCombine those two last paragraphs and you realize that trying to outrace a beam of light is a real\\-life Zeno paradox! You accelerate to $c/4$ relative to this beacon, measure the speed that the beam of light is moving away from you, and it's still moving at speed $c$ away. You throw down another beacon, accelerate to $c/4$ relative to that, measure the speed that the beam of light is moving away from you, and it's still moving at speed $c$ away. You cannot win! Therefore nobody can travel faster than the speed of light. These bubbles of light then enforce a very powerful form of **causality** that's not technically present in Newtonian mechanics; it says: no form of matter can get to a destination faster than the information about that matter's history, which moves at speed $c$.\n\nThen, learn to love rapidities.\n-------------------------------\n\nNow when the spaceship tries to measure all of the beacons as a whole, it does not see a straightforward linear progression of speeds: those speeds would go off to infinity, therefore they would exceed $c$! Rather, it sees a progression which goes like a function called the **hyperbolic tangent**, $\\\\tanh x \\= (e^x \\- e^{\\-x})/(e^x \\+ e^{\\-x}).$ In fact if we stick with motion in one dimension we find out that each velocity can be characterized by a **rapidity**, $\\\\beta \\= \\\\tanh \\\\phi,$ and that the velocity addition formula actually then becomes *linear in rapidities*. So that's why you see this hyperbolic tangent pattern in the speeds of the beacons! It's because your single\\-beacon Lorentz boost shifts its rapidity by some $\\\\phi\\_1$, then every other rapidity must be $\\\\phi\\_n \\= n \\~ \\\\phi\\_1,$ therefore every velocity must be $v \\= c \\\\tanh (n \\~\\\\phi\\_1\\),$ for cases of constant acceleration.\n\nFinally, one integral gets the original formula.\n================================================\n\nActually rapidities are even more useful than that, because our expression $\\\\gamma \\= 1/\\\\sqrt{1 \\- \\\\beta^2} \\= (e^\\\\phi \\+ e^{\\-\\\\phi})/2 \\= \\\\cosh \\\\phi$ by the variant of the Pythagorean theorem that holds for hyperbolic trigonometry, $\\\\cosh^2\\\\phi \\- \\\\sinh^2\\\\phi \\= 1\\.$ This lets us perform the following integral. We know that the spaceship emits beacons at some interval of proper time $\\\\delta \\\\tau$ and can easily reconstruct the time on the clock $\\\\tau \\= n\\~\\\\delta \\\\tau$ from that plus the number of emitted beacons. Since each time the spaceship gains a constant boost to its rapidity $\\\\delta \\\\phi,$ making everything exact to first\\-order gives the straightforward result that the speed of the spaceship is $v \\= c\\~\\\\tanh(a\\~\\\\tau/c).$ But *our* time coordinates $t$, watching all of this, are going to be different than these $\\\\tau$ coordinates in the spaceship! Well that's where we just integrate: the basic time\\-dilation formula says that $dt \\= \\\\gamma\\~d\\\\tau \\= \\\\cosh(a\\~\\\\tau / c)\\~d\\\\tau.$ Integrating that and discarding the constant gives $t \\= (c/a) \\~ \\\\sinh(a\\~\\\\tau/c),$ therefore its velocity using *our* time coordinates for *our* reference frame is simply:$$v(t) \\= c\\\\tanh\\\\big(\\\\sinh^{\\-1}(a t/c)\\\\big).$$But, one of these basic results from $\\\\cosh^2 \\\\phi \\- \\\\sinh^2 \\\\phi \\= 1$ is that $\\\\tanh \\\\phi \\= \\\\sinh \\\\phi / \\\\cosh \\\\phi \\= \\\\sinh \\\\phi / \\\\sqrt{1 \\+ \\\\sinh^2 \\\\phi},$ so therefore $\\\\tanh\\\\big(\\\\sinh^{\\-1} x\\\\big) \\= x / \\\\sqrt{1 \\+ x^2},$ and the above simplifies to,$$\nv(t) \\= \\\\frac{a t}{\\\\sqrt{1 \\+ (at/c)^2}}.\n$$\nMultiplying both top and bottom by $c$ gives precisely the form in the above exercise I provided with $u \\= c.$ Then we have a perfectly valid reference frame in our ground reference frame, and we know that this spaceship moving with speed $v(t)$ will not be hit by some incident beams of light with speed $c$, if they start out a distance $L$ behind it. All of the rest of the reasoning is identical between classical mechanics and special relativity; special relativity **only** affects how you change between reference frames.\n\nQuick recap\n===========\n\nTo recap, **because** the spaceship is emitting these beacons at constant time intervals, with no concern about its own state; and **because** the universe has the particular desynchronizing structure it has, we discover that *we* at rest don't think that the beacons are emitted at constant time intervals, nor is the spaceship linearly accelerating. Instead we measure the beacons as actually emitted slower and slower, and we measure the velocity of the spaceship as a $v(t)$ curve which as we learn from the exercise above, cannot be hit by light rays from a certain distance $L$ before where it started. **Therefore** we realize that when you accelerate, there is some strange event horizon created at a very long distance behind you, and it gets closer and closer as you accelerate harder and harder. Events from behind this \"wall of death\" contain information that cannot possibly reach you; objects that you pass appear to slow down as they approach the wall of death, getting slower and slower as they fade closer and closer into the wall, never quite falling all the way through. You can only get rid of it by ceasing to accelerate, which will push that wall of death further and further away.\n\nJust to complete the reasoning, John Rennie is claiming that one of the twins must see this wall of death and cannot use an inertial reference frame with special relativity to describe his/her situation; instead he/she needs to use general relativity with the Rindler metric, which basically forces him/her to acknowledge a form of gravitational time dilation is applying specially to him/her. Thereby, both twins agree again."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A spaceship accelerates at a constant rate a from rest.

The scenario is as follows:\nConsider, at a junction, there is a traffic signal, having red, yellow and green lights respectively. There are vehicles facing the traffic signal post. When it shows red, the vehicles stop, when it shows green, the vehicles move on. In case, it is yellow, the driver must decide whether to go or to stop, depending on whether he/she has crossed the stop line or not. At the same time, there are vehicles that do not care about the signal. They would do as they like.\n\nThe similarities are that, the Traffic Signal happens to be the subject, notifying its states by glowing the appropriate lights. Those looking at it and following the signal are the ones subscribed to it, and behave according to the state of the subject. Those who do not care about it, are sort\\-of un\\-subscribed from the traffic signal.\n\nPlease tell me, if you think this is a correct analogy or not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The analogy will work, but you added more complication such as what to do at yellow light.\n\nA simpler way is to only have green and red light; the traffic light would indicate two state changes:\n\n* red to green: traffic can go.\n* green to red: traffic must stop.\n\nNote that actions that should take place as a result of this state change does not concern the observed subject (i.e. the traffic light doesn't make a car stop).\n\nWithout the subscription, interested parties would have to continuously poll the traffic light state.

The traffic light (subject) notifies its state changes to subscribed observers (vehicles that follow traffic rules). These observers then react based on the subject's state. Vehicles that don't follow signals are essentially unsubscribed and don't participate in this pattern.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because in the Observer Pattern, the subject (traffic light) doesn't control the observers' actions; it merely notifies them of state changes.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as it describes polling, which the Observer Pattern aims to avoid.

He's standing in the same line as your soldier, and the full\\-cover\\-box you can see behind the doorway.\n\nI think it's that specific box that is blocking your LOS. Even if we consider that your soldier sidesteps (so let's assume she's standing one tile to her left); it's possible that the slight elevation of the train cart combined with the angle of the box (relative to how your unit would see the enemy soldier) leads the game to decide it's not in LOS.\n\nThat being said, this is just a guess. I remember being in similar situation and seeing my target. The only thing different here is that box, which is why I'm thinking that's the reason.\n\n**Edit**  \n\nFor those who argue that the enemy (model) is in sight of the soldier, therefore it should be targetable, keep in mind that the game calculates based on the *tile* a unit is on, not the actual visibility of their character model. \n\nI find that units in cover really cling to the cover, or try to pop out their heads, and it throws off your vision on where the tile is located.

I then lift the stone up and uniformly select an unoccupied site to place it back down which satisfies the dual criterion of: (a) being at most a distance $d$ from both of the stone's nearest neighbors, and (b) not disturbing the initial ordering of the stones along the integer interval (note that the stone's original position can be reselected). If $d\\=1$, no stone can be moved from its original position and the center of mass of the stones/system, $C\\_m$, will be immobile. However, if $d\\=2$, starting from the state $(\\-2,\\-1,0,1,2\\)$, the center of mass will move to either the right or left with some per step probability of $\\\\frac{1}{k}$ (until we leave this initial system state).\n\nMy question is \\- provided some number of stones $k$, and some \"leashing distance\" $d$, how can we characterize the dynamics of the random walk taken by the above system's center of mass, $C\\_m$? What is the average step time and size, and, in terms of Euclidean distance, what mean square displacement can we expect after some number of steps, $T$?\n\nUpdate (due to a suggestion by Douglas Zare) \\- The $k$ stones must be kept in order, and the distance between a stone and its two nearest\\-neighbors along the interval (or one nearest\\-neighbor if the stone occupies the left\\-most or right\\-most position of the chain) can be at most $d$.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a particular case of **random walks with internal degrees of freedom** (aka semi\\-Markov random walks or covering Markov chains). In the case when the translation group is just $\\\\mathbb Z$ (like in this question) this is a Markov chain on $\\\\mathbb Z \\\\times X$ with translation invariant transition probabilities. In the \"inchworm\" situation one can take for $X$ the (finite) set of all configurations in which the leftmost stone is at the point $0\\\\in \\\\mathbb Z$. Then states of the worm are described by the pairs $(n,\\\\phi)\\\\in \\\\mathbb Z\\\\times X$, where $n$ is the position of the leftmost stone, and $\\\\phi$ is the shifted configuration. The center of masses will then be within uniformly bounded distance from $n$. It is obvious that in these coordinates the transition probabilities of the chain describing worm's motion are translation invariant, so that this is a random walk with internal degrees of freedom on $\\\\mathbb Z$. \n\nThe paper \"Random walks with internal degrees of freedom.

The center of mass does not remain stationary (eliminating option A) because the leashing distance d=2 allows for movement. It's not a simple random walk with constant step size (eliminating option B) because the step size depends on the internal configuration of the stones. Option D is incorrect because there's no inherent bias in the system to cause a constant drift.\n\nThe correct answer is C because:\n1. The system can be modeled as a Markov chain on \u2124 \u00d7 X, where X represents the set of possible stone configurations.\n2. The center of mass movement is related to the position of the leftmost stone, which performs a random walk with internal degrees of freedom.\n3.

As explained in the documentation, flamethrowers fire particles in a conic shape, and the behavior of these particles interacting with walls can vary. Thin walls in the Source engine may sometimes allow particles to pass through, while thicker walls may block them.

This variability means that the effectiveness is not consistent (ruling out A and B) and that gradually \"worming in\" is not always necessary (ruling out D)."}, "42": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/12/09", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/1045568", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/603937/"], "docs_id": 1045568, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have created a working ubuntu image in europe\\-west2\\-c.

If you have access to the server config then you'd perhaps use a `<Directory>` container.\n\n### Using mod\\_rewrite\n\nIn `.htaccess` you can use mod\\_rewrite to restrict access to anything other than `/index.php` or `/app/dist/`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nRewriteEngine On\n\nRewriteRule !^(index\\.php$|app/dist/) - [F]\n\n```\n\nThe above will respond with a 403 Forbidden for any request that is not `/index.php` or does not start `/app/dist/`. If you wish to return a 404 instead then change `F` to `R=404`.\n\nThe `!` prefix on the regex negates the regex. Note that the URL\\-path matched by the `RewriteRule` *pattern* does not start with a slash.\n\nIf you only want to respond with a 403 for requests that would map to actual files or directories (and 404 otherwise) then add a couple of conditions that check the filesystem (but note that filesystem checks are relatively expensive, so unless you need them, don't use them). For example:\n\n```\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d\nRewriteRule !^(index\\.php$|app/dist/) - [F]\n\n```\n\nOnly if the requested URL is not in the allowed \"group\" *and* maps to a file or directory is the `RewriteRule` directive actioned.\n\nHowever, I would assume your URLs don't actually contain `index.php` (do they?), in which case the user requests `/` and mod\\_dir issues an internal subrequest for `/index.php` (the `DirectoryIndex`). In which case, you'll need to make the `index.php` optional.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nRewriteRule !^((index\\.php)?$|app/dist/) - [F]\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### Using an Apache Expression\n\nAlternatively, you can do this with an Apache expression (Apache 2\\.4\\)\n\n```\n<If \"%{REQUEST_URI} !~ m#^/((index\\.php)?$|app/dist/)#\">\n    Require all denied\n</If>\n\n```\n\nThe above responds with a 403 for any URL request that is not `/`, `/index.php` or start with `/app/dist/`.\n\nNote that `Order`, `Allow`, `Deny`, etc. are older Apache 2\\.2 directives and are officially deprecated on Apache 2\\.4\\.\n\n---\n\n### Using mod\\_setenvif\n\nAnother alternative is to use mod\\_setenvif and set an environment variable if one of the permitted URL\\-paths is requested and only permit access if this env var is set.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nSetEnvIf Request_URI \"^/((index\\.php)?$|app/dist/)\" ALLOWED\nRequire env ALLOWED\n\n```\n\nThe above sets the `ALLOWED` env var if the any of the permitted URL\\-paths are requested. The `Require` directive then requires this env var to be set to grant access, otherwise a 403 is returned."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You are managing an Apache web server and need to restrict access to all URLs except for \"/index.php\" and those starting with \"/app/dist/\".

I hope my idea would make it cheaper to construct paved roads in my region. So to start with, I want to **find out how expensive it is to construct road** today.\n\nI have access to **a listing of all roads constructed in the past few years**. What I want to do is **make a random sample of these roads**, then contact the relevant people to **find out how many feet were constructed, and at what total cost**. From this, I expect to be able to compute an **average dollar\\-cost per foot of road** in my region.\n\nThis sounds simple enough. Here's my problem: I can think of two ways of doing the computation:\n\n* Either I treat the roads themselves as units. Then I would compute dollars/feet for each, and then average together those numbers.\n* Alternatively, I treat the feet\\-of\\-paved\\-roads as units. This would result in each sampled road contributes a different number of feet to the average \u2013 hypothetically, if there's a really long road that turned out to be very expensive, it would drive up the average compared to the previous method.\n\nEither way, from what I can tell, each foot of road has an equal opportunity to end up in the sample. **So the decision is mainly \"do I count average foot\\-cost per road, or average cost per foot of road?\"**\n\nOn this, I have two questions:\n\n1. Which of these two approaches give the most correct result? I honestly cannot tell you if \"foot\\-cost per road\" or \"cost per foot of road\" is the more meaningful measurement. What am I missing?\n2. If the most meaningful measurement is \"cost per foot of road\" then the computation effectively becomes, for the entire sample, sum(dollars)/sum(feet) \u2013 how do I get the variance of this statistic?\n\nSorry if this sounds basic. I know I should know this stuff, but for some reason it escapes me and I haven't been able to figure it out the past few days. I've been looking both into Cochran's *Sampling Techniques* and Levy's *Sampling of Populations* \u2013 I know both books come close to this specific question, but they never linger on it and go deeper into it.\n\nI'll continue my research into the sampling literature I have at home, but in the meantime if any of you happen to know the answers \u2013 please share!\n\n---\n\nI'm aware stratifying the sample would allow me to treat very long roads separately in case they practically make up a separate population cost\\-wise, but that ends up being the same problem: do I weigh the strata by number of roads in each, or by the total length of road in each?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, notation. Suppose there are $N$ total roads constructed in the region, each with road length $x\\_i$ feet, total cost $y\\_i$, and cost per foot $r\\_i \\= y\\_i/x\\_i$. Let the population averages be $\\\\mu\\_r \\= \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum r\\_i$, similarly for $\\\\mu\\_y$ and $\\\\mu\\_x$, the total length of all roads $T\\_x \\= \\\\sum x\\_i$, total cost $T\\_y \\= \\\\sum y\\_i$, and the overall cost per foot $R \\= T\\_y/T\\_x$ ($\\= \\\\mu\\_y/\\\\mu\\_x$). We sample $n$ of these roads. $r$ will be an estimate of $R$.\n\nFor question 1, You correctly notice that the average of the costs per foot is not the same as the overall ratio, $\\\\mu\\_r \\\\ne R$. This is not an issue of one being \"correct\" and the other being \"wrong\", both are perfectly well defined values that are useful in different scenarios. Different use cases and objectives will care more about one than the other, so subject matter experience is essential here. A lower value of $\\\\mu\\_r$ indicates that most projects had lower costs, while a lower value of $R$ indicates that the region's overall costs were lower.\n\nPersonally, I think $R$ is generally more useful/applicable, but it's possible to imagine situations where either would be desirable. For example, the region's financial manager cares about the total budget spent on roads, but is willing to pay higher expenses on many small projects to save on a large highway. Or conversely, a group of landowners care about the costs on their small individual projects, but don't care about the region's total spending.\n\nFor question 2, I'll dump the formulas for Ratio Estimation from *Elementary Survey Sampling, Scheaffer, Mendenhall, Ott, and Gerow, 2012*, section 6\\.3\\. These formulas assume simple random sampling. The estimate of $R$ is $r$,\n\n$$\nr \\= \\\\frac{\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n}y\\_i}{\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n}x\\_i} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\bar{y}}{\\\\bar{x}}\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hat{V}\\[r] \\= \\\\left(1\\- \\\\frac{n}{N}\\\\right)\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu\\_x^2}\\\\frac{s\\_r^2}{n} \\\\\\\\\ns\\_r^2 \\= \\\\frac{1}{n\\-1}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{n}(y\\_i \\- r x\\_i)^2\n$$\n\n$\\\\mu\\_x$ can be replaced by $\\\\bar{x}$ if it's unknown, but Scheaffer et al recommend that it should be known as accurately as possible. (cv($\\\\bar{x}$) \\= SD($\\\\bar{x}$)/$\\\\mu\\_x$ should be less than 0\\.1\\) An approximate 95% confidence interval for $R$ can be constructed as $r \\\\pm 1\\.96\\*\\\\sqrt{\\\\hat{V}\\[r]}$.\n\nA few closing thoughts, note that $r$ is a biased estimate of $R$ and the above confidence interval sometimes performs poorly. Various corrections are available, but they get more complicated. You can read more by searching for \"Ratio Estimation\". You will need to pay attention between resources for estimating the population ratio $R$ and estimating the population total, $T\\_y$, which is also commonly done with ratio estimates. The [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_estimator) seems like a solid place to start."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A city planner is analyzing road construction costs. They have data on 500 roads built in the last 5 years, including each road's length and total cost. They want to estimate the average cost per foot of road construction. Which of the following methods would provide the most appropriate estimate for the city's overall road construction costs?\n\nA) Calculate the cost per foot for each road, then take the simple average of these values.\nB) Sum the total costs of all roads and divide by the sum of all road lengths.\nC) Randomly sample 50 roads, calculate the cost per foot for each, and take their median.\nD) Use stratified sampling based on road length, then calculate a weighted average of cost per foot for each stratum.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most appropriate method for estimating the overall cost per foot of road construction for the city. This approach calculates the ratio estimator R = T_y / T_x, where T_y is the total cost of all roads and T_x is the total length of all roads. This method gives equal weight to each foot of road constructed, regardless of which project it belongs to, and thus provides the best estimate of the city's overall road construction costs.\n\nOption A (the average of individual road costs per foot) would give equal weight to each road project, regardless of its length. This could skew the result if there are many short, expensive projects or a few very long, cheaper projects.\n\nOption C introduces unnecessary sampling error and doesn't utilize all available data. The median could also be misleading if the distribution of costs is skewed.\n\nOption D might be useful in some contexts, but it introduces additional complexity without clear benefits in this case, especially since we have data for all roads and don't need to sample.\n\nThe ratio estimator (Option B) provides the most meaningful measure of overall cost efficiency for the city's road construction projects."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/10/30", "source": ["https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/337151", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com", "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/41758/"], "docs_id": 337151, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a CD4026BE Connected as follows.

I suppose I may be looking for military, or naval terminology.\n\nFor example, if you were in a submarine, being buffeted by currents, so your vessel was being pushed sideways, how would you correctly say, \"we are being pushed east but we are facing north?\" Would it be correct to say \"we are bearing 0\u00b0, but our heading is 270\u00b0?\" It doesn't *sound* correct.\n\n**Edit**\n\nAs I note in a comment below: when I clumsily wrote that I was \"looking for two words to correctly assign to these physical components of a vehicle,\" what I meant was, single\\-word attributes to distinguish between the direction a vehicle was facing, and the actual direction the vehicle was moving in, voluntarily or not.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Bearing** is regularly defined as the direction (relative to true north) in which your destination lies. If you could go in a straight line to your destination, this would be the most direct way of getting there.\n\nYou also have **relative bearing**, where the front of the vehicle is considered \"north\"; you'll see this when pilots claim, for example, that something is \"at your 3 o'clock\"; in naval terminology, port (left) and starboard (right) are always relative to the bow (front of the vessel).\n\n**Heading** is the direction your face/nose/front/bow is currently pointing at (relative to true north), assuming default movement by your vehicle's impulse mechanism is forward. If there are no obstacles between you and your destination, and nothing aside from your vehicle's own impulse mechanism is moving it, heading should always be equal to bearing.\n\n**Course** describes the entire planned route to get to your destination. A course correction implies that your planned route encountered an obstacle, and that you have to correct that plan.\n\nAs an example, let's assume a car is the vehicle, and it's navigating in a standard grid\\-like street structure. If you're at point (0, 0\\) with your car facing north and your destination is at (3, 3\\), your course would be \"Three blocks north, then three blocks east\". Your bearing at the start of your journey would be north\\-east, and your heading would be north, since that's the way your car is facing.\n\nAfter you travel three blocks north, you're stopped at a red light. You should plan to turn right, to change your heading to east, since your bearing is now east. Your remaining course is \"3 blocks east\".\n\nIn aviation, where winds can and often will push you off\\-course, heading is rarely equal to bearing when the total travel distance is large. This makes for frequent course corrections to account for wind.\n\nIn my opinion, **direction** is the most basic term of all, and describes a directed vector between two points.\n\nFor your example, it seems like the proper phrasing would be \"We are heading north, but we're being pushed off\\-course eastwards.\""}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A submarine is navigating through strong ocean currents.

To ensure that methods annotated with @BeforeStep are called, you need to explicitly register the delegate processor as a listener in your step configuration.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the @BeforeStep method is not automatically called when using an AsyncItemProcessor.\n\nAnswer B, while touching on a valid concern about thread-safety, is not the primary solution to the problem described. Using thread-local variables is one possible approach to handle multi-threaded contexts, but it doesn't address the core issue of the @BeforeStep method not being called.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because asynchronous item processing does support access to StepExecution and the execution context. However, care must be taken when accessing shared resources in a multi-threaded environment.\n\nIt's worth noting that while C is the correct answer to make the @BeforeStep method work, the documentation advises caution when relying on the execution context in multi-threaded setups, as this context is shared between threads and could lead to race conditions or inconsistent state."}, "54": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/11/29", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/248678", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/140493/"], "docs_id": 248678, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Q9iC.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Q9iC.png)\n\nThat is mean, variance and standard deviation.\n\nMy question is how to get from point 4 to 5 and also with the variance from point 6 to 7\\. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: These equations represent a particularly obscure way to make some important points that everybody ought to understand. I will therefore provide an indirect answer by highlighting the fundamentals (1\\-4 below), demonstrating them, and then applying them in what amounts to an equivalent proof.\n\n1. **When you add a constant $a$ to all data $x\\_i$, the mean of the new values is $a$ plus the mean of the old values.** This should be obvious, because adding $a$ to each of $n$ values adds $na$ to the sum. When the sum is divided by $n$ to get the mean, $na$ is divided by $n$ to show $na/n\\=a$ is added to the sum.\n2. **When you multiply each $x\\_i$ by a constant $b$, the mean of the new values is $b$ times the original mean.** This truly is obvious (it's a direct application of distributive and commutative laws of arithmetic).\n3. **When you add a constant $a$ to all data, the variance is unchanged.** This is because the variance is the average of the squared residuals, $(x\\_i\\-\\\\bar x )^2$. By (1\\), $\\\\bar x$ increases by $a$ and that exactly cancels the addition of $a$ to each $x\\_i$, whence *the residuals are unchanged.* Consequently the variance is unchanged.\n4. **When you multiply all data by a constant $b$, the variance is multiplied by $b^2$.** Since (3\\) tells us each $x\\_i$ as well as their mean $\\\\bar x$ are multiplied by $b$, the residuals $x\\_i \\- \\\\bar x$ are also multiplied by $b$. Consequently the squared residuals are multiplied by $b^2$ and so (exactly as in (2\\)) the mean squared residual is multiplied by $b^2$.\n\nThe equations in the question attempt to demonstrate that the mean and variance of $z\\_i$ are zero and one, respectively, when the $z\\_i$ are formed by *standardizing* the data: that is, $\\-\\\\bar x$ is first added to the data (giving the residuals) and those results are divided by the square root of the variance. Call the square root $s$, so the variance is $s^2$.\n\n**Here, then, is an alternative to the equations in the question:** \n\nBy (1\\), the mean after the first step is $\\\\bar x \\- \\\\bar x \\= 0$. \n\nBy (2\\), the mean remains zero upon division by the square root of the variance. (This should remind you of step \"5\" in the question.)\n\nBy (3\\), the variance is unchanged after the first step. \n\nBy (4\\), the variance $s^2$ is divided by the square of $s$ in the second step: but that just divides the variance by itself (step \"7\" in the question), giving $s^2/s^2\\=1$, *QED*."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A dataset X has a mean of 10 and a variance of 25.

It's running Windows Server and serving all the files in our office. We have external drives to back it up to we just need some software to automate it for us. What kind of general recommendations can the SF crowd make as to what piece of software we should use and best practices for backing up a company networked file server?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **General statements re: backup**\n\nI'm not going to get into specifics of backup technologies, software, operating systems, etc. in this part. Nor am I going to get into specific techniques and policies (various rotation schedules, using synthetic backup, etc). I'm going to stick to basics here, but I'd advise you, once you understand the basics, to dig deeper into how the requirements of your environment affect your needs.\n\nAbove all else, the *point of backup is to be able to restore data*. We don't run backups for backup's sake. Above all else you need to know that your backup strategy (including the specific data storage technology used, the software used to perform the backup, your media rotation strategy, and all the other factors that go into making your backup strategy work) will actually work to allow you to restore data. This means that you need to test your backup strategy under as close to real world conditions as you can to be sure that it really works. The time to test your backup strategy is *NOT* when you have a real need to restore data.\n\nBackup should provide several basic attributes:\n\n* Sufficient coverage to make a restoration efficient. While you might think that backing\\-up only your data files is necessary (because you can just re\\-install the application software) the trade\\-off in using less space on the backup media and less time in taking the backup is often not a \"win\" when you figure the time taken during a high\\-pressure restore scenario to re\\-install software that could have just been restored from backup. Assume that you should backup *everything* and think long and hard about why you would exclude something from backup.\n* Sufficient frequency as to balance the cost of data loss with the cost and practicality of backup. A source that stores files for many users may have tens of thousands of dollars (or more) of worker\\-productivity invested in the files stored on it each day. More frequent backups will cost more, but the cost may be justified by the expense associated with data loss if the backups don't happen frequently enough. You need to understand, from the users who use the source data being backed\\-up, what the cost associated with data loss would be to the business and make the case for backup with sufficient frequency as to minimize that cost.\n* Off\\-site storage to mitigate physical disaster. Keeping all your backups in physical proximity to the source data is a recipe for data loss during physical disaster. Floods, fires, thefts, etc, can all destroy the source data. If the backup medias are co\\-located with the source data then you risk destruction of the backup media at the same time as the source data. Be sure to think about confidentiality and integrity requirements in off\\-site storage strategy. Sending an unencrypted copy of your data home with an employee (who, invariably, leaves it in their car to be stolen) isn't necessarily a great off\\-site rotation strategy. Securing your off\\-site copies from tampering and unauthorized disclosure is just as important as having off\\-site copies.\n* A history of multiple backups to allow future restores. It may be necessary to restore data from some time in the past, and keeping only a few (or worse, only one) generation of backup media is a terrible idea. Someone may not realize that they need data restored until days, weeks, or months after the data is lost. Having multiple generations of backup media allows for restoration in the future. This is another area where a trade\\-off of cost versus business need is very important. The backup should fulfill any legal or organizational needs the business with respect to retention of data for restore. (It's important not to confuse backup with archival here, either. They're orthogonal concerns that share some similar attributes and may use the same technology, but they're not the same thing.) In some cases, retaining too many backups can be a bad thing, so be sure that the business understands any legal ramifications for backup retention.\n* Integrity of backed\\-up data. Part of testing your backups should involve verifying the integrity of the data that's restored. For some businesses this may be as simple as restoring a few files regularly and checking them out. For businesses with very strict security requirements this may amount to periodically sending a backup media to a third party for restoration and validation in a \"clean room\" environment. At the very least, you should be able to validate that mission critical applications and data are able to be restored with integrity preserved. An attacker who is corrupting your data may also corrupt your backup so that it reports that data has integrity when it doesn't. Be aware that keeping your multiple backup history in an \"online\" state may cause it to be subject to breaches of integrity by attackers. Some backup technologies (tape, for example) allow data to be kept in a totally offline capacity to allow physical barriers to help protect integrity (keeping the media under lock and key with a documented chain\\-of\\-custody).\n* Backup and restore within an allotted time window. Your backup and, even more importantly your restore, should be able to be accomplished in an amount of time that satisfy's the needs of the business. An online backup, for example, sounds like a great deal until you find out, in an emergency, that restoring your 200GB of data will take 3 days of constant streaming of data over your DSL line. Keep restoration windows in mind when choosing a backup technology.\n\nWhen you're evaluating specific technologies (disk\\-based backup, tape backup, online backup, etc) and specific backup strategies (grandfather / father / son media rotation, daily differential and weekly full backups, etc) think about how the interplay of software, hardware, and procedure work together to create solutions (or problems) that help (or hinder) fulfilling the requirements of backup. There are no blanket \"right answers\" and it varies for each business and, within a business, for different types of resources being backed\\-up.\n\nSpecific application software may have its own requirements that affect how to your run backups. Database servers (and database\\-like servers, like Microsoft Exchange) have their own peculiarities that you may have to contend with when designing your backups strategy. \n\nStorage and filesystem features, like snapshots or live duplication, may help you perform backups of \"live\" data under tight windows. \n\n---\n\n**Your specific needs**\n\nIn the case of your specific application you describe you should probably look at how the built\\-in Windows Image Backup functionality can help you protect the operating system, configuration, and data. The built\\-in backup functionality isn't very sophisticated when it comes to policy and scheduling, though, so you may want to evaluate third\\-party software offerings (Symantec Backup Exec, CommVault, Bacula, etc) if you need a more sophisticated solution.\n\nTalk to the people who store data on your server and find out what their tolerance is for data loss, what kind of retention windows they'd like to have, what their security concerns are, and what type of restoration timeline is required to help justify the budget for hardware, software, and labor. I'd strongly urge you to consider an off\\-site component, as well. Perhaps you'll find that using hard disks for off\\-site storage works well, but I'm personally of the opinion that there isn't an \"enterprise ready\" hard disk\\-based backup solution yet (one that's cost effective, reliable, and that operates consistently)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company is implementing a new backup strategy for their networked file server. Which combination of practices best addresses the key attributes of an effective backup solution as described in the documentation?\n\nA) Daily incremental backups, storing backups on-site, retaining only the most recent backup, and testing restores annually.\n\nB) Weekly full backups, storing backups off-site, retaining multiple generations of backups, and never testing restores to avoid disrupting production systems.\n\nC) Daily full backups, storing backups both on-site and off-site, retaining multiple generations of backups, and regularly testing restores under simulated real-world conditions.\n\nD) Monthly full backups, storing backups in the cloud, retaining only the last three backups, and testing restores only when data loss occurs.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C best addresses the key attributes of an effective backup solution as outlined in the documentation:\n\n1. It provides sufficient frequency with daily full backups, balancing the cost of data loss with practicality.\n2. It includes both on-site and off-site storage, mitigating the risk of physical disasters.\n3. It retains multiple generations of backups, allowing for future restores and meeting potential legal or organizational needs.\n4. It emphasizes regular testing of restores under simulated real-world conditions, which is crucial for ensuring the integrity and reliability of the backup system.\n\nOptions A, B, and D each have significant flaws:\nA lacks off-site storage and multiple generations of backups.\nB has insufficient frequency and lacks proper testing.\nD has inadequate frequency, limited retention, and insufficient testing practices."}}
