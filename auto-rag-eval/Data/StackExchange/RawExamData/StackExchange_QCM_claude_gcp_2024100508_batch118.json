(there are eight figures that are given to ca. 10 s.f.; and there are eight figures for number of months being averaged. One might make the case of there being additional coefficients too: 1\\.0 for dS, and the exponents)\n\nSo of course your out\\-of\\-sample data is going to be well outside the model: all you've done is curve\\-fitted without any causal basis, and over\\-specified the model. Fast, large divergence is exactly what one would expect in the circumstances.\n\nNASA has some helpful thoughts on [how to predict sunspot cycles](http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/predict.shtml), including references to papers. They report that predicting in\\-cycle behaviour is \"fairly reliable\" once the cycle is at least three years in; they use the length and size of one cycle, and the amount of activity at the minimum, to estimate the next cycle. To this, they add data from measurements of changes in Earth's magnetic field, because these changes are caused by solar storms.\n\nI'd start with NASA's modelling, because they have some skin in the game: In their words (from the above link:\n\n> \"Planning for satellite orbits and space missions often require\n>  knowledge of solar activity levels years in advance.\""}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher used the EUREQA package to analyze monthly smoothed sunspot data from 1750 to 2010, producing a complex formula with 8 coefficients and a correlation coefficient of 0.99214404. However, when attempting to project future sunspot activity, the formula quickly became divergent. Which of the following best explains this discrepancy and suggests a more reliable approach to sunspot prediction?\n\nA) The formula was too simple and needed more coefficients to accurately model sunspot behavior over longer time periods.\n\nB) The researcher should have used daily sunspot data instead of monthly averages to capture more detailed patterns.\n\nC) The model was overfitted to historical data without a causal basis, leading to poor out-of-sample performance. A physics-based approach using established solar cycle indicators would be more reliable.\n\nD) The divergence is likely due to chaotic solar behavior that cannot be accurately predicted beyond a few months, regardless of the model used.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the question highlights a classic case of overfitting in data analysis. The model used 16 or more coefficients to fit about 24 sunspot cycles, resulting in a high correlation coefficient for historical data but poor predictive power. This approach lacks a causal basis and simply curve-fits the data.\n\nThe correct answer suggests a more reliable approach based on NASA's methods, which use physics-based indicators like cycle length, size, activity at solar minimum, and Earth's magnetic field changes. These methods have practical applications in satellite and space mission planning, indicating their reliability.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect as they suggest more complexity or data would improve the model, when in fact the issue is overfitting.

Using QGIS, which tool and settings should they use to accomplish this task?\n\nA) Use the \"Move Features\" tool, manually selecting and moving each group of points.\nB) Apply the \"v.transform\" tool from GRASS provider, setting X = 200 for right-side points and X = -200 for left-side points, with Y = 0 and scale = 1 for both.\nC) Utilize the \"Affine Transform\" tool, inputting a custom transformation matrix for each group.\nD) Employ the \"Translate\" tool, specifying 200 meters east for right-side points and 200 meters west for left-side points.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to use the \"v.transform\" tool from the GRASS provider in QGIS. This tool allows for precise translational movements of vector features. By setting X = 200 for right-side points, we move them 200 meters east, and X = -200 for left-side points moves them 200 meters west. Keeping Y = 0 ensures no north-south movement, and scale = 1 maintains the original scale of the features. This method is efficient for moving groups of points and maintains accuracy. Options A and D are less efficient and prone to errors for large datasets, while C is overly complex for this simple translation task."}, "9": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/09/03", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/177791", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/23153/"], "docs_id": 177791, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an ADSL with 4 public static IP Addresses.

I took the directions from [http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu\\_Oneiric\\_Installation\\_Guide\\#Installing\\_Catalyst\\_Manually\\_.28from\\_AMD.2FATI.27s\\_site.29](http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Oneiric_Installation_Guide#Installing_Catalyst_Manually_.28from_AMD.2FATI.27s_site.29)\n\nThese are my steps, which were important since it turns out that 64\\-bit breaks down in the latest 11\\-9 default installation.\n\n1. Install packages: \n\n`sudo apt-get install build-essential cdbs fakeroot dh-make debhelper debconf libstdc++6 dkms libqtgui4 wget execstack libelfg0 dh-modaliases`\n\nSince I'm on 64\\-bit, I had to add to that:\n\n`sudo apt-get install ia32-libs`\n2. Download the latest Catalyst package:\n\n`cd ~/; mkdir catalyst11.9; cd catalyst11.9`  \n\n`wget http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/ati-driver-installer-11-9-x86.x86_64.run`  \n\nor for the new latest  \n\n`wget http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/ati-driver-installer-11-11-x86.x86_64.run`\n3. Create the deb packages\n\n`sh ./ati-driver-installer-11-9-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/oneiric`\n4. Install the deb packages\n\n`sudo dpkg -i fglrx*.deb`\n5. Create basic aticonfig xorg file\n\n`sudo aticonfig --initial -f`\n6. Set PCS:\n\n`sudo aticonfig --set-pcs-str=\"DDX,EnableRandR12,FALSE\"`\n7. Restart\n8. Opened `amdcccle` with sudo and configured to dual screen (proceeded to get kicked out and log back in).\n9. At this point, go to the Displays option in ubuntu (dropdown from top\\-right screen) and uncheck mirror and set the desktop to span the two monitors.\n\nAnd now I can finally enjoy OpenCL with two monitors in 11\\.10 amd64\\."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You've installed a new Radeon HD 6970 graphics card with dual DVI outputs on Ubuntu 11.10 (64-bit). After following the manual Catalyst driver installation process, you're experiencing issues with dual monitor setup. Which combination of steps is most likely to resolve the problem?\n\nA) Install ia32-libs, create deb packages with --buildpkg Ubuntu/oneiric, set PCS with aticonfig, and configure dual screens in amdcccle\n\nB) Install build-essential, download Catalyst 11.9, run aticonfig --initial, and reboot the system\n\nC) Install fglrx drivers from Ubuntu repositories, run sudo amdcccle, and set the mode to single desktop multiple monitors\n\nD) Download Catalyst 11.11, install with dpkg, create xorg.conf manually, and use xinerama for dual monitor setup\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A because it addresses the specific issues mentioned in the documentation for a 64-bit system with a Radeon HD 6970 card. Installing ia32-libs is crucial for 64-bit systems. Creating deb packages with the --buildpkg Ubuntu/oneiric option ensures compatibility with the Ubuntu version. Setting PCS with aticonfig helps prevent potential conflicts. Finally, configuring dual screens in amdcccle, followed by adjusting the Displays option in Ubuntu, is the recommended approach for setting up dual monitors with this setup.\n\nOption B is incomplete and doesn't address 64-bit specific steps. Option C uses the problematic method mentioned in the original question that caused Unity to crash. Option D uses an incorrect driver version and suggests using xinerama, which isn't necessary or recommended for a single card with two outputs."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/02/26", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/28253", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/-1/"], "docs_id": 28253, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I tried installing Ubuntu 10\\.10 on a Lenovo V460\\.

Lets briefly touch what each buff does for your team:\n\n**Red**\n\nMost Jungler Champs will get the **Red** buff second to the *Blue* buff, as they require mana to quickly clear Creep Camps. Jungler Champs such as: Lee Sin, and Shyvana tend to go red first as it is most beneficial to them clearing Creep Camps. The **Red** buff also provides a huge advantage to the ADC/Top Laners, although most Junglers dont give up the **Red** buff till the laning phase is over. So making sure it is constantly in use is completely beneficial to your team and can generally be solo'd by Meta Jungle Champs at level 1\\.\n\n**Blue**\n\nAs stated previously the *Blue* buff provides champs a steady amount of mana, so they can burn through their rotations without having to worry to much about being mana starved. Most Junglers will usually allow their mid to have this buff upon its respawn, giving them huge sustaining power for a short period of time and can definitely be the difference between winning mid lane or losing it. This buff should also be grabbed everytime it is up and is easily solo'd by Meta Jungle Champs at level 1\\.\n\n**My Two Cents**\n\nAs someone who jungles occasionally with Udyr, I usually go for a fast Invade on their red (preferably unseen). Grabbing my *Blue* fast then moving on to handing over red to w.e lane is closest. This provides a nice little boost to either top or bot lane (these lanes failing tends to have the biggest impact on the outcome of the match and a mid has very little use for **Red**.) Doing this successfully will win you the game. Now not only is their jungle gonna be behind clearing Creep Camps, but one of your lanes should be winning. This will allow you to sit between the other two lanes and gank over and over while either stealing the enemy camps (since you will be stronger then their jungle) or safely farming your own.\n\nDragon and Baron are very tricky and when you should grab them generally depends on how well your team is doing.\n\n**Dragon**\n\nKilling the Dragon for your team can bring you back from a deficate or put you in a sizable lead. The importance of the Dragon is serious business, as their is no way for your enemies team to gain that gold once you've scored the kill. What I mean is you can take a tower, but all your enemy has to do is take your tower and they are even with you. Same goes for kills, anyone can get a kill because your enemy decides to constantly get out of position. Now getting a Dragon kill, thats the way to help your team. In short 190 gold for your team is a huge advantage, maybe not game winning immediately, but keep getting dragon 2\\-3 times in a row and the game is yours.\n\nWhen to get Dragon, is a little tricky. Never get Dragon without knowing the location if the entire enemy team. For Example if you see them make a 4 man gank up top this is a great time to grab the dragon, or you manage to counter a gank without losing anyone killing off atleast the jungler and adc this is another instance to grab the Dragon. If you would like to sneak in a Dragon make sure you have a vision ward to remove the wards or someone with Oracles, a few minutes **before** you attempt it. The action of taking the Dragon should always be done with the Jungler (atleast early game) and should be quick.\n\n**Baron**\n\nBaron, for most part is just a game ender. Obviously if you are losing and manage to get Baron it can very easily change the tide of battle. But in reality most teams can't manage a Baron kill unless they are dominating the enemy, and do it after crushing the enemy in a team fight. Occasionally you can manage a sneak Baron, or steal it or something but be reasonable, it shouldn't be your game plan. So yah, take Baron when your team has pushed the enemy inside their base or come out of a team fight in good shape. And never attempt to sneak a Baron kill without checking for enemy wards, its a recipe for disaster.\n\nAnd yes, they are all very important to kill, games are won and lost over the buffs and gold they provide."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A jungler is planning their early game strategy. Which of the following sequences would typically be most beneficial for maximizing team advantage in the first few minutes of the game?\n\nA) Secure own blue buff -> Secure own red buff -> Gank mid lane -> Contest enemy red buff\nB) Invade enemy red buff -> Secure own blue buff -> Give red buff to closest lane -> Gank remaining lanes\nC) Secure own red buff -> Secure own blue buff -> Give blue buff to mid laner -> Contest dragon\nD) Secure own blue buff -> Gank top lane -> Secure own red buff -> Invade enemy blue buff\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B aligns best with the strategy outlined in the \"My Two Cents\" section of the documentation. This approach involves a fast invade on the enemy's red buff (preferably unseen), followed by quickly securing your own blue buff. Then, the jungler hands over the red buff to whichever lane is closest (top or bot), providing an early advantage. This strategy puts the enemy jungler behind in clearing camps and gives one of your lanes an edge. The jungler can then focus on ganking the other lanes while either stealing enemy camps or safely farming their own. This aggressive and efficient early game plan can set up the team for success by creating advantages across the map."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/05/20", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/61295", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/18156/"], "docs_id": 61295, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to use `ST_GeomFromText()` to load vector data to PostGIS.

This fundamental change in the nature of the model means that the proportional hazards assumption, which is central to the standard Cox model, becomes irrelevant in this context. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the proportional hazards assumption does not hold when time-varying covariates are introduced. \nOption C is misleading because the assumption isn't just modified, it becomes inapplicable. \nOption D is incorrect as time-varying covariates do have a significant impact on the model's assumptions.\n\nThe correct answer, B, accurately reflects the information provided in the documentation and highlights the important conceptual shift that occurs when incorporating time-varying covariates into a Cox model."}, "24": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/08/15", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/229914", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/127724/"], "docs_id": 229914, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using a non linear least squares method to fit an analytical function to some experimental data.

Numerically, you can just take the difference between data points and find which two points have the biggest difference. Then the midpoint of the x\\-values for these two points is your location of biggest change. \n\nThis simple method is susceptible to the noise. So you can first filter the data using a filter that does not shift the data to the right or left. If you use a simple FIR filter, then filter front to back and then filter the result from back to front. The result is a doubly filtered and NON shifted data set. Then follow the procedure above to find the point with the largest difference between values.\n\nYou can also use more sophisticated numerical differential calculations that use more then the difference of two points."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is analyzing experimental data that exhibits a step change and wants to automatically detect the position of this change.

I want to have a laser project numbers like a 7 segment display. Is there a way to hook a 7 segment display up to a laser to have the laser display the numbers onto a flat surface? \n\nThe design needs to be as compact as possible. Do you know if maybe there is an electronic converter or way that can be used to hook it up in place of the 7 segment display? Like this:\n\nBinary for the 7 segment display \\-\\> ??Mystery part described above??? \\-\\> Laser display module.\n\nI just started electronics a few days ago, I've got some grasp on the basic stuff, but I could really use some help here. I have a very limited amount of resources available and needed to ask people who know what they're doing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Laser displays, at least for entertainment, generally involve the following components:\n\n* Laser: This can be any of several types. If you want a full\\-color display, often two or more lasers are employed with combining optics to achieve a white light. HeNe produce red, Argon produce blue\\-green, etc. The size of the display intended determines the size and power of laser needed. I've seen small displays that use diode lasers, and large displays that use 10W lasers that require exciters and water cooling.\n* Scanner pair: A scanner pair is essentially a pair of servo motors with first\\-surface mirrors mounted to them. One acts as a bounce mirror to control the X\\-axis while the other controls the Y\\-axis. The scanner pair \"aims\" the beam at the desired point on the display surface.\n* Blanking: You will need a way to blank the output. Imagine a \"C\" shape, if you draw such an arc from top to bottom, if you do not blank the output while traveling from the stop point back to the start point, you will wind up with a backward \"D\". Blanking is therefore done to cause the light output to stop while positioning the scanner pair during periods of travel that do not involve drawing. This can be done with a PCAOM or, with some lasers, actually switching them off. High\\-power lasers cannot be switched at a high frequency, but diode lasers can.\n* Color selection: A PCAOM (Poly\\-chromatic Acoustic Optic Modulator) is essentially a crystal that can deform its shape based on an input radio frequency. Some can act as a blanking device, to bend light such that it is not aimed at the scanner pair. A PCAOM takes an input of white light, and allows the output of a specific color. It is essentially a variable prism.\n* Controller: A computer or microcontroller is required to coordinate all of the above. You need a way to orchestrate the motion of the scanner, the color or blanking of the beam, and generally at a high frequency. The dimensions and viewing distance of the display surface govern these requirements.\n\nThere are other ways to use lasers to project images, but this is the way I am familiar with. If you research these topics, I think you will find that you can focus your questions more specifically."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which combination of components is essential for creating a basic laser display system that can project numbers similar to a 7-segment display?\n\nA) Laser, Scanner pair, Blanking mechanism, Color selection module\nB) Laser, Prism, Mirrors, Computer\nC) Laser, Scanner pair, Blanking mechanism, Controller\nD) Laser, PCAOM, Servo motors, Color wheel\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C) Laser, Scanner pair, Blanking mechanism, Controller. \n\nThis combination provides the essential components for a basic laser display system:\n\n1. Laser: The light source for projection.\n2. Scanner pair: Servo motors with mirrors to control the X and Y axes of the projection.\n3. Blanking mechanism: To turn the laser on and off rapidly, allowing for the creation of distinct shapes and preventing unwanted lines.\n4.

When you have an object of mass $m$ which is held a height $h$ above some reference point, you think of it as having potential energy (considering only gravitational interactions) $U\\= m g h$, and gravity will exert an amount of work $W\\_g \\= m g h$ on the object. When you drop the object, it shall fall towards the ground, towards \u201cequilibrium\u201d, so to speak. You do not speak of the amount of \u201cwork\u201d that the mass has when at its original height, nor of the amount of \u201cwork\u201d lost, but of its energy (relative to a reference point) at any given **state**, $U$. Moreover, we say that this potential energy is a state function because it depends **only** on the initial and final heights of the mass in question.\n\nIn the same way, one does not concern his or her self with the amount of \u201cheat\u201d that an object has, since it is merely a term used to denote the amount of transferred energy between systems as they move in and out of equilibria. We speak of thermal energy, internal energy, free energies and such that are state functions of the system \\- in exactly the same way that the gravitational potential energy $U$ was in the mechanical analogue to this thermodynamical case. In the same way, we say that the thermal energy of the system is a state function insofar that it generally depends (more or less) on the initial and final temperatures and thermodynamic quantities of the mass in question.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve reread your question and I want to make another point to clear things up. Yes, indeed, different paths can result in different amounts of heat transfer \\- the first law of thermodynamics states:\n\n$\\\\delta E \\= Q \\+ W$,\nwherein $Q$ is the amount of heat flow into the system, $W$ is the work done onto the system, and $\\\\delta E$ is the total state internal energy change of the system. One can see that one can input say, 100 J of heat and do no work on a system to result in a net change $\\\\delta E$ of 100 J, and in the same way, one can divide that $100 J$ amongst $W$ and $Q$ to get the same effect. \n\nThe intuition is as follows. Imagine you have a jar of gas. You can increase the temperature (and so impart a positive $\\\\delta E$) by adding $100 J$ of heat, or you may compress it by doing $100 J$ of work to gain the same effect. I hope that clears things up!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A system undergoes a thermodynamic process from state A to state B. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the heat (Q) and work (W) involved in this process?\n\nA) Q and W are state functions and will always be the same regardless of the path taken between states A and B.\n\nB) Q and W are path functions, but their sum (Q + W) is always constant for any path between states A and B.\n\nC) Q and W are path functions, and their individual values can vary depending on the path taken, but the change in internal energy (\u0394E) of the system will be the same for all paths.\n\nD) Q and W are state functions, but their sum (Q + W) can vary depending on the path taken between states A and B.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because Q (heat) and W (work) are not state functions. They depend on the path taken between states.\n\nOption B is incorrect. While Q and W are indeed path functions, their sum is not necessarily constant for all paths. The sum Q + W equals the change in internal energy (\u0394E), which is a state function.\n\nOption C is correct. Q and W are path functions, meaning their individual values can differ depending on how the system moves from state A to B. However, their sum (Q + W) equals the change in internal energy (\u0394E), which is a state function and thus the same for all paths between two given states.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Q and W are not state functions. Also, their sum (Q + W) is equal to \u0394E, which is a state function and doesn't vary with path.\n\nThis question tests understanding of state functions versus path functions in thermodynamics, as well as the relationship between heat, work, and internal energy as described by the First Law of Thermodynamics."}, "36": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/11/09", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/9998", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/4242/"], "docs_id": 9998, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We have a toilet cistern with a concentric float valve fill mecanism.

As soon as the client notices the bad path error it tries connecting with the server IP address, that succeeds, but the client does not ask for a directory listing and displays the Connection Failed.\n3. The connection does not fall back to AFP when SMB fails.\n\nThis seems like a bug in the OS's handling of invalid characters to the SMB protocol and proper fallback to either IP or AFP in the case of a failure.\n\nI tested all of the US face special characters are the following characters are cause this problem: `.` (period) and `\\` (backslash).

I am confused about what information the \"magnitude\" values of the transfer function are supposed to contain. I am mainly confused about why the magnitude can be negative. Is this a convention to aid in calculations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The magnitude is just the length of the *space diagonal* of an n\\-dimensional right rectangular prism. In two dimensions this is often just called the *diagonal* of a right rectangle or else the *hypotenuse*. And it is always a positive real number, as you say. (Never really zero, though it can approach it arbitrarily closely.)\n\nHowever, such numbers can also be expressed as logarithms, instead. An advantage gained by expressing positive numbers as logarithms is that multiplication of two positive real numbers can be performed by the addition of their equivalent logarithms, instead. (This fact was used on slide\\-rules, whose use has since fallen by the way because of the advent of computing machines.) Another advantage is that one can more quickly get an idea of the order of magnitude of \\\\$C\\\\$ and the dominance of \\\\$A\\\\$ vs \\\\$B\\\\$ by just a simple glance.\n\nSuppose you want to multiply two numbers, \\\\$A\\\\$ and \\\\$B\\\\$, so that you have to find \\\\$C\\\\$ where \\\\$C\\=A\\\\cdot B\\\\$. You could instead use \\\\$a\\=\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)\\\\$ and \\\\$b\\=\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(B\\\\right)\\\\$, sum the two to get \\\\$c\\=a\\+b\\\\$, and then find that \\\\$C\\=10^c\\\\$.\n\nIn short, you can say that \\\\$C\\=A\\\\cdot B\\=10^{^{\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)}}\\\\cdot 10^{^{\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)}}\\=10^{^{\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(A\\\\right)\\\\:\\+\\\\:\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(B\\\\right)}}\\\\$.\n\nBut this is really just the same thing as saying \\\\$c\\=a\\+b\\\\$.\n\nWhen you are doing a lot of multiplication (and division), using logarithms helps a lot.\n\nThe only issue is that now positive numbers that are less than 1 \\-\\- but still positive \\-\\- will be represented by negative values when turned into logarithms. That's just a quality of logarithms.\n\n2 is larger than 1 so its logarithm will be positive. For example, \\\\$\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(2\\\\right)\\\\approx \\+0\\.30103\\\\$. But 0\\.5 is smaller than 1 so its logarithm will be negative. For example, \\\\$\\\\log\\_{10}\\\\left(0\\.5\\\\right)\\\\approx \\-0\\.30103\\\\$. Note that if I wanted to multiply \\\\$2\\\\times\\\\frac12\\=1\\\\$ this is the same thing as addition of their logarithms, \\\\$\\+0\\.30103\\-0\\.30103\\=0\\\\$, noting though that to get the final answer you perform \\\\$10^0\\=1\\\\$ (so 1 is the answer.)\n\nWith logarithms, a negative number is similar to division. So if you already know that \\\\$\\+0\\.30103\\\\$ is the logarithm of 2 then if you notice the addition of a logarithm of \\\\$\\-0\\.30103\\\\$, then you know this means the same thing as division by 2\\. (Even though you are adding it.)\n\n*Amplification* multiplies and *attenuation* divides. Or you could say that *amplification* occurs when multiplying by a value larger than 1 (logarithm is positive) and that *attenuation* occurs when multiplying by a value less than 1 (logarithm is negative.) And you immediately know which is happening by just looking at the sign. So it's often convenient to use logarithms in electronics.\n\nThe only trick in electronics is that there are two common contexts \\-\\- power and voltage. For power, you multiply the logarithm by 10 and for voltage you multiply the logarithm by 20\\. So in the context of power you'd say an amplifier that doubles the power is the same thing as \\\\$\\+3\\\\:\\\\text{dB}\\\\$. Or doubling the voltage is the same thing as \\\\$\\+6\\\\:\\\\text{dB}\\\\$. (A few minor decimal points were tossed out.) It's a lot easier to talk about amplification and attenuation that way. (The downside is that you have to keep the 10x or 20x factor in mind.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An amplifier has a voltage gain of 8 at a certain frequency.

For voltage, we use the formula:\n\nGain (dB) = 20 * log10(voltage gain)\n\nIn this case, the voltage gain is 8.

A perfect score on the test is 100, but most of Company A's students receive scores between 60\\-90\\. To help their students prepare to take the real standardized test, Company A offers a series of 10 practice tests on consecutive weekends.\n\nCompany A would like to assess whether any of the tests in their practice test line (some of which have been created by the company itself) are, on average, too hard or too easy. Company A has a data set consisting of hundreds of students, all of whom have taken the full series and who eventually take the real test. Since Company A helps students prepare for the test, they expect that, given tests of equal difficulty, students' ability will improve over the 10 tests. Company A does not wish to assume that the improvement is necessarily linear.\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. What sampling procedure should the company use? Company A wants to sample as few students as possible because accessing old data is time intensive.\n2. What statistical tests should the company apply to the data to see whether there is a statistically significant difference in difficulty between tests?\n3. How should Company A account for the fact that they expect students' scores to improve naturally over the course of the 10 tests?\n\n(This is a slightly concealed version of a problem I ran into at work, and it seemed like a tricky statistical problem.

But note, this highly depends on having two great weapons to use on your monk.\n\nHere are the main advantages for dual wielding over a shield:\n\n* Additional socket on weapon for HUGE critical hit damage boost (**This is the most important factor, I've severly underestimated how much DPS having more crit hit damage can provide with modest crit hit chance (\\~30%).**)\n* A ton of more stats\n* More Life On Hit Proc (This is the second most important factor)\n* 15% faster attack\n* 15% more dodge\n\nMy primary weapon right now is a \\~850 dps 250dex 250vit 500 life on hit axe.\n\nMy secondary is a \\~750 dps 850 life on hit 97% critical hit chance axe.\n\nThe main goal of this setup is to have high dps with huge life on hit and high critical hit damage. I'd prefer my primary to be socketed to have even more critical hit, but those weapons with similar stats to mine are too expensive right now and far beyond my reach.\n\nNow that I have 3x more DPS than the old tank build, even though I'm down quite a bit on defense, its easier since I kill them faster so I don't have to tank as long. Also, the really deadly effects such as arcane turret and ground effects can't be blocked anyway, making blocking less useful than killing the target faster.\n\nFinally, dual wielding axes is major style points, imo looks much nicer than axe/shield ;)\n\nOld Answer\n==========\n\nThis answer is still applicable since having 2 great weapons is really really expensive compared to 1 and a shield.\n\nFrom my experience, a shield is extremely necessary in late game inferno and ponies (the 1\\.03 damage nerf has made shield even better by reducing the spikiness of damage). Lets compare and contrast:\n\nShield Benefits \n\n1. 1000 \\- 1500 armor (double that if you use deadly reach)\n2. 70\\-140 resist all (70\\+ res all and another element of choice for stacking)\n3. 30\\-40% block (high block shield with JL \\+ HoC) for 3k damage (note this is after reduction!)\n4. 1 free passive slot (you don't have to take guardian's path so you can devote 1 more passive for defense, such as resolve)\n\nOverall, you gain HUGE damage reduction benefits for 1 equipment slot. If you are trying to be a tank this is almost a no brainer.\n\nDuel Wield Weapon Benefits\n\n1. 15% Faster attack speed for more LoH\n2. More stats (weapons can get higher stats than armor can), and more unique effects like transcendence (having 100\\+ life per spirit spent is a great way to heal).\n3. Faster spirit regen (even faster if you have 2 spirit regen weapons)\n4. 15% dodge (if you take the passive)\n\nOverall, you gain a little dodge (doesn't work when frozen, etc, and you can't dodge ground effects like desecrate and plague, which are the main sources of death in late game inferno), some more potential sources of healing and spirit regen, more damage, but way less survivability. Either way you won't be a tank.\n\nTo summarize, using a shield is a lot more defensive oriented, and thus provides the most survivability in late inferno acts (3\\+ and ponies). Not to mention finding a good shield is a heck lot cheaper than finding a good 1 hander with high damage, ias, stats, and LoH. You might be able to get away with duel wielding up to act 2, but I wouldn't expect you to last long beyond that unless you have godly gear and weapons."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Monk player in Diablo III is considering their equipment strategy for tanking in higher difficulty levels.

This is very much the kind of condition that applies to such things as firing airbags and other such things concerned with harm mitigation. \n\nIs my suspicion about the difficulty of testing such things correct, and what are the strategies to reduce the size of the state space that must be explored to achieve coverage of such a requirement? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Testing that something *doesn't* happen is generally very difficult. However, testing is not the only available QA technique. Here, combining a convenient architecture with static analysis and some testing may be optimal:\n\n* abstract over the IO registers so that they are only manipulated through macros, functions, or variables with a few easily distinguishable names.\n* find all places that use the airbag\\-related registers. If possible, move them into a single source file.\n* Implement a kind of static analysis to ensure that:\n\n(1\\) no code accesses the registers without going through the abstraction layer\n\n(2\\) no code except for specific files uses the airbag\\-related registers\n\nThis might be as simple as a shell script that greps all source files for specific pattern, and compares the matching file list:\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/sh\nfor file in `find src/ include/ \\\n    -type f \\( -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h' \\) \\\n    -exec grep -l 'REG_TRIGGER_AIRBAG' {} +`\ndo\n  case \"$file\" in\n    include/registers.h) ;;  # ok\n    src/airbags.c) ;;  # ok\n    *)\n      echo \"unexpected file is accessing airbag registers: $file\"\n      exit 1\n      ;;\n  esac\ndone\n\n```\n* Those source files that do use the airbag\\-related registers, test thoroughly. Consider using white\\-box techniques to construct a test suite with high coverage. This can be simplified by organizing the code linearly, and expressing the preconditions through guard clauses:\n\n```c\n/* called every 5ms */\nvoid trigger_airbag_if_necessary(bool A, bool B, bool C) {\n  if (!A) return;\n  if (!B) return;\n  if (C) return;\n  SET_REGISTER(REG_TRIGGER_AIRBAG, 1);\n}\n\n```\n\nIf the conditions are linear, it is easier to build a mental model of the conditions leading up to the event being triggered. Also, we only need 4 test cases for complete coverage of that function. More complex conditions do not fit into this schema, and the tests could be based on a flowchart or a truth table.\n\nThis strategy of isolating the relevant code is not perfect. It is possible to subvert these checks. But this should protect against *accidental* mistakes. E.g. if I set the airbag\\-related registers in a different part of the code, the static analysis will alert you quickly to the problem.\n\nYour first hunch that we would have to verify the complete program state is not entirely wrong. But fortunately, we can shape that state space so that airbag\\-triggering events must go through a specific area, and we can pay extra attention to that area."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A safety-critical embedded system has a requirement: \"if and only if A and B and not C, then D must happen within 10ms\".

Totally we get RHS of your formula.\n\nWhy we get LHS is explained in Claude Lenormand's comment for A000435 (there we count the sum of distances from the fixed vertex 0 to other vertices in all trees, of course it is $n$ times less than the sum of all distances.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the formula:\n\n$$\\sum_{i = 2}^{n}{{n \\choose i} i! n^{n - i}} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}{{n \\choose i}i^i (n - i)^{n - i}}$$\n\nThis formula relates to a sequence (A001864 in OEIS) that counts certain structures on n labeled vertices.

The left-hand side counts this sum by fixing one vertex and summing its distances to all other vertices in all trees, then multiplying by n to account for all vertices. The right-hand side counts the same sum by considering all ways to choose an edge that lies on a path between two vertices, then summing over all possible sizes of the two subtrees created by removing this edge.

Actually for my purposes it would be enough to prove that the functor is conservative, i.e. reflects isomorphisms.\n\n[Here](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/35309/categorical-kunneth-theorem-for-module-categories) was a similar question on MO, but it adresses (as with the answer by David Ben\\-Zvi) only the derived setting, but I want to work with the usual category of quasi\\-coherent modules.\n\n---\n\nThe question is answered affirmatively here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2002\\.00383](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00383)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: More generally, I have proven that for quasi\\-compact and quasi\\-separated schemes $\\\\mathrm{Qcoh}(X \\\\times\\_S Y)$ is the bicategorical pushout of $\\\\mathrm{Qcoh}(X)$ and $\\\\mathrm{Qcoh}(Y)$ over $\\\\mathrm{Qcoh}(S)$ in the bicategory of cocomplete linear tensor categories.

This is a more general and precise statement than the other options.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's not always a simple 2-coproduct. Option C is too restrictive, as the result holds for more than just affine schemes.

The symmetry of the wave function itself does not directly determine the expectation value of momentum.\n\nB) Correct. For a real-valued wave function with definite parity (in this case, an odd function), the expectation value of momentum is zero. This is because the integrand in the expression for mean momentum (-i\u210f\u222bdx \u03c8*\u03c8') becomes an odd function, which integrates to zero over a symmetric interval.\n\nC) Incorrect.

While the probability density |\u03c8(x)|^2 = x^2e^(-2x^2) is indeed symmetric about x=0, this symmetry alone is not sufficient to conclude that the expectation value of momentum is zero.

The convention is that current flows from \\+ to \\-. We now know that, in fact, the mobile charges are electrons and flow from \\- to \\+ but the convention has endured and we all use \\+ to \\- flow but keep the reality in the back of our minds.\n\nAs is universal practice in maths, physics and general engineering, \\+ is higher than \\- so we refer to the positive terminal of a battery or power supply as having higher potential. (Conventional) current will flow from the higher potential to the lower, i.e., from \\+ to \\-.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9SQlw.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f9SQlw.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nThe magnitude of the current will, for a resistance load, be proportional to the voltage or potential difference between the terminals and inversely proportional to the resistance between the terminals.
