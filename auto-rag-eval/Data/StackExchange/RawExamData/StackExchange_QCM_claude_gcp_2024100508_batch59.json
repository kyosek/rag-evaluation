I am trying to figure out what are all the things that could make this code take fewer hours. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If expressions placed inside those IFs are **constant and determinable at the time of compilation**, then you may be almost sure that the compiler has already removed them off the code for you.\n\nOf course, if you compile in Debug\\-Mode, and/or if you have optimization\\-level set to zero, then the compiler may skip that and leave those tests \\- but with plain zero/one/true/false values it is highly unlikely.\n\nFor a compile\\-time constant branches, you may be sure that the compiler removed the dead ones.\n\nIt is able to remove even complex\\-looking cases like:\n\n```\nconst int x = 5;\n\nif( 3 * x * x < 10 ) // ~ 75 < 10\n{\n    doBlah(); // skipped\n}\n\n```\n\nHowever, without that 'const' marker at X, the expression's value may be not determinable at the compile time, and it may 'leak' into the actual final product.\n\nAlso, the value of expression in following code is not necesarily compile\\-time constant:\n\n```\nconst int x = aFunction();\n\nif( 3 * x * x < 10 ) // ~ 75 < 10\n{\n    doBlah(); // skipped\n}\n\n```\n\nX is a constant, but it is initialized with value from a function. X will most probably be not determinable at the time of compilation. In runtime the function could return any value\\*) so the compiler must assume that X is unknown.\n\nTherefore, if you have possibility, then use preprocessor. In trivial cases that won't do much, because the compiler already knew that. But cases are not always trivial, and you will notice the change vrey often. When optimizer fails to deduce the values, it leaves the code, even if it is dead. Preprocessor on the other hand is guaranteed to remove disabled sections, before they get compiled and optimized. Also, using preprocessor to do that at least will speed up the compilation: the compiler/optimizer will not have to traceconstants/calculate/checkbranches etc.\n\n\\*) it is possible to write a method/function which return value will actually be determinable at the compilation and optimization phases: if the function is simple and if it gets inlined, its result value might be optimized out along with some branches.. But even if you can somewhat rely on removing the if\\-0 clauses, you cannot rely on the inlining as much.."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a performance-critical function that runs millions of times, which of the following approaches is most likely to result in the best optimization of debug code sections?\n\nA) Using if(0) { debug code } within the function body\nB) Using if(false) { debug code } within the function body\nC) Using #if 0 debug code #endif preprocessor directives\nD) Using const bool DEBUG = false; if(DEBUG) { debug code }\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C using preprocessor directives (#if 0 ... #endif) is most likely to result in the best optimization. Here's why:\n\n1. Preprocessor directives are processed before compilation, guaranteeing that disabled code sections are removed before reaching the compiler. This can speed up compilation and ensure the code is not present in the final executable.\n\n2. While modern compilers are good at optimizing out constant conditional statements like if(0) or if(false), they may not always do so, especially if the conditions or surrounding code are complex.\n\n3. The const bool approach (option D) might be optimized out by the compiler, but it's not guaranteed, especially if the constant is initialized with a function call.\n\n4. Options A and B (if(0) and if(false)) rely on the compiler's optimization capabilities. While they often work, preprocessor directives provide a more reliable method for completely removing debug code in release builds.\n\n5.

"Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When dealing with AWS SDK dependencies in a Maven project, which of the following approaches is recommended to resolve version conflicts and minimize the project's footprint?\n\nA) Include the full aws-java-sdk-bom dependency with the latest version\nB) Add individual dependencies for each AWS service you need (e.g., dynamodb, cognitoidp)\nC) Include only the aws-java-sdk-core dependency with the latest version\nD) Use spring-cloud-starter-aws-messaging for all AWS-related functionalities\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) While including the full AWS SDK BOM (Bill of Materials) can help manage versions, it may introduce unnecessary dependencies and increase the project's size.\n\nB) Adding individual dependencies for each AWS service can lead to version conflicts if not managed carefully, and doesn't provide a centralized way to manage AWS SDK versions.\n\nC) This is the correct approach. Including only the aws-java-sdk-core dependency provides the essential AWS SDK functionality while minimizing the project's footprint. It allows you to add only the specific AWS service dependencies you need, reducing potential conflicts and keeping the project lean.\n\nD) While spring-cloud-starter-aws-messaging is useful for specific AWS messaging integrations with Spring, it's not a comprehensive solution for all AWS services and may introduce unnecessary Spring Cloud dependencies.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the top answer in the provided documentation, which suggests using the core AWS SDK dependency rather than the full SDK to resolve version conflicts and minimize dependencies."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/01/15", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/130423", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/9639/"], "docs_id": 130423, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to create a buffer in meters around some points using a field with the distance.

That is probably what happened here, except that your data frame's coordinate system is distorting the area. From the [help page](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//000800000019000000) (emphasis mine):\n\n> You can completely avoid distortion when buffering points by using a feature class that has a geographic coordinate system and specifying a Buffer Distance in linear units (meters, feet, and so forth, as opposed to angular units such as degrees). When this combination of inputs is used\u2014point or multipoint features in a geographic coordinate system buffered by linear units\u2014the output will be true geodesic buffers. **Geodesic buffers appear as ovals on any flat map** and will only appear as perfect circles when displayed on a globe.\n\nA few related notes:\n\n* To confirm that the buffers are circular, change your data frame's coordinate system to an appropriate UTM zone\\-\\-the distortion should be reduced. You can also use the orthographic \"The World from Space\" coordinate system to simulate looking at a globe.\n* There's no checkbox in the buffer tool to toggle the geodesic buffering on and off\\-\\-it depends solely on the type of coordinate system of the input data.\n* Starting with ArcGIS 10\\.1, this [geodesic buffering](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#//000800000019000000) also applies to polygons.\n* Note that although this reduction in distortion is a nice feature, it is also more performance intensive."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using the Buffer tool in ArcGIS 10.0 or later on point or line features with a geographic coordinate system (e.g., WGS84, NAD83), what is the result and how might it appear on a flat map?\n\nA) The buffers are created using Euclidean distance and appear as perfect circles on a flat map.\nB) The buffers are created using geodesic calculations and appear as ovals on a flat map.\nC) The buffers are created using planar calculations and appear as squares on a flat map.\nD) The buffers are created using great circle distance and appear as straight lines on a flat map.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, starting from ArcGIS 10.0, using the Buffer tool on point or line features with a geographic coordinate system results in geodesic buffers. These buffers are free of distortion in reality, but appear as ovals when displayed on a flat map. This is because the geodesic calculations account for the Earth's curvature, which cannot be perfectly represented on a 2D surface.

Restart the web server and monitor memory usage.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The symptoms point towards a failing hard drive. The extremely high load average, coupled with 98.6% CPU wait time, indicates that the system is spending most of its time waiting for I/O operations. The ATA errors in the system logs further support this conclusion. These errors typically indicate physical issues with the hard drive.\n\nThe recommended next step is to run SMART diagnostics to confirm the drive's health status. This can be done by installing smartmontools and running the smartctl command. If the drive is indeed failing, it should be backed up and replaced as soon as possible to prevent data loss and restore normal system operation.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\nA) While high load could indicate a DDoS attack, the I/O wait and ATA errors are not typical of such an attack.\nB) A misconfigured web server wouldn't typically cause ATA errors or such high I/O wait times.\nD) A memory leak would more likely result in high memory usage rather than I/O wait and wouldn't explain the ATA errors."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/05/10", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/140488", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/27097/"], "docs_id": 140488, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a table with 1\\.4 billion records.

This API will be used internally to perform some server side actions that were triggered by AJAX calls.\n\nTo make things easier for me, I thought of using the Chain\\-of\\-Command/Responsibility pattern.\n\nHere are more details about what I want to do: \n\nI am creating a \"dashboard\" where admins of my app will be able to update information (meta data) about items stored in a database. \n\nTo make things easy and simple for the admins, I chose to use AJAX. So, if an admin wants to delete an item, (s)he clicks on the \"delete button\". A POST request is then sent to `edit.php` page with all the information needed to perform the deletion (action : delete, element : link, id : xx ...). Where `action`, `element` and of course `id` can change. \n\nThis is why I opted for a mini\\-API that will, depending on the `action` and the `element` data, call a different function from a different class. \n\nNow, to implement the API, I decided to use Chain\\-of\\-Responsibility design pattern. Why? Because I can easily add, delete or update classes without having to modify the API itself. \n\nIs the Chain of Responsibility design pattern good fit for my case? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The idea of the chain\\-of\\-command pattern is to build a chain of handlers and pass a command along this chain until one of the handlers handles the command. This behavior is typically found in event processing, where, say, a click event from a UI button bubbles up the hierarchy of UI elements till it reaches an element that has a respective handler attached. This handler can then decided whether it handles the command \\-\\- effectively ending the event processing \\-\\- or not \\-\\- in which case the event is propagated further along the chain.\n\nLet's now assume we use that pattern for you web API. What you describe sounds like a classical [CRUD(L)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) interface to me, where your actions are (a subset of) create, read, update, and delete. You say you have delete requests and I'm assume that you want some kind of update requests, too. Let's assume further that you wrote respective handlers **hupd** and **hdel** for these kinds requests. Following the chain\\-of\\-command pattern, you then build the chain **\\[hupd,hdel]** to handle requests to your API. What happens is that every update request passed into the chain gets immediately handled by **hupd**, while every delete request is rejected by **hupd** and passed along to **hdel**, which handles it. This behavior shows a fixed mapping between actions and handlers that actually makes the chain unnecessary. (In fact, the chain even lowers your system's performance, because of the check and the passing along of every delete request). Why does this happen? Because there are no two handlers responsible for different subsets of requests with the same action type. What you really want to have here is a direct mapping **\\[\"update\" \\=\\> hupd, \"delete\" \\=\\> hdel]** and a dispatcher that takes respective requests and passes them directly to the respective handler. Such a design can still be extendible with regard to new actions, if there is a dynamic registry holding the mapping.\n\nNow you could say, that you want to have different handlers for, say, the deletion of elements of type A and B. What gives you handlers for subsets of requests with the same action type. But once again, you have a direct and fixed mapping between the handlers and the element type, i.e., you can repeatedly dispatch requests based on the target element type. This gives you a two\\-level dispatch, where with a chain\\-of\\-command you would pass the request through number\\-of\\-actions times number\\-of\\-element\\-types handlers, in the worst case.\n\n*Conclusion:* I would not recommend the chain\\-of\\-command pattern to implement this kind of API. For the pattern to have value, you need a scenario where you want to dynamically add and remove handlers and where the condition of when a handler actually handles an event is not expressible by a simple mapping from constants."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is designing an API for a dashboard application where admins can update metadata about items in a database. The developer is considering using the Chain of Responsibility pattern. Which of the following statements best describes why this pattern might NOT be the most suitable choice for this scenario?\n\nA) The Chain of Responsibility pattern doesn't allow for easy addition or removal of handlers, making it inflexible for future changes.\n\nB) The pattern would result in lower system performance due to unnecessary checks and request passing for actions with fixed handler mappings.\n\nC) Chain of Responsibility cannot handle CRUD operations effectively, making it unsuitable for database-related tasks.\n\nD) The pattern is incompatible with AJAX requests, which are required for the dashboard's functionality.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Chain of Responsibility pattern is not the most suitable choice in this scenario primarily because it would result in lower system performance. As explained in the documentation, for a CRUD-like interface with fixed mappings between actions and handlers (e.g., update requests always handled by an update handler, delete requests by a delete handler), using a chain would introduce unnecessary checks and passing of requests along the chain. This overhead reduces system performance compared to a direct mapping and dispatching approach. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Chain of Responsibility pattern actually does allow for easy addition or removal of handlers, which was one of the reasons the developer initially considered it.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the Chain of Responsibility may not be the best choice here, it's not because it can't handle CRUD operations. The pattern itself doesn't limit the types of operations that can be performed.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Chain of Responsibility pattern is not inherently incompatible with AJAX requests.

These are classic, robust devices that do what they do pretty well. But their intended function is to modify small voltages a little bit to maintain relatively constant supplies for things that do not use much power, like a lot of modern low voltage logic and regulation ICs. Even the supplies that do use these regulators have things in place to kind of ball\\-park the voltage before the 7805 rounds off the top.\n\nAll voltage dropped from one end of a 7805 to the other is blown away as waste heat across some resistance. Its not a big deal for a small voltage drop for a bias supply, but you would literally be venting about half of your input power for no reason. A fairly common chopper buck circuit or half bridge switching supply could do this with efficiencies in excess of 90%.

A dedicated USB charging IC should be used instead.\n\nB) The voltage drop from 11.1V to 5V will cause significant heat generation in the LM7805, wasting about half of the input power. A buck converter or switching supply would be more efficient, potentially achieving over 90% efficiency.\n\nC) The LM7805 cannot handle the high voltage of the Thinkpad battery. A voltage divider should be used before the regulator to reduce input voltage.\n\nD) The LM7805 is too expensive for this application. A simple resistor network would be more cost-effective for dropping the voltage to 5V.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The LM7805 is a linear voltage regulator that drops excess voltage as heat. With an input of 11.1V and an output of 5V, it would waste about half the input power as heat. This is highly inefficient for battery-powered devices. A buck converter or switching supply, as mentioned in option B, can achieve much higher efficiency (over 90%) by using rapid switching techniques to step down voltage without significant heat generation.

This configuration change enables store-specific pricing without requiring modifications to the existing PHP script.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while modifying the script might work, it's not the most efficient solution and doesn't address the underlying configuration issue.\n\nOption C is unnecessary and would require significant database schema changes, which is not recommended for core Magento tables.\n\nOption D is an overly complex solution for this specific problem and would require extensive development effort.\n\nThe documentation specifically states that setting the price scope to 'Website' allows the same product to be available at different prices in different stores, which directly addresses the developer's need to update prices for a particular store (US) only."}, "23": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/09/11", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/39654", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/3116/"], "docs_id": 39654, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the beta version of Chrome on the Mac Backspace is not working as 'back' as in virtually any other browser.

I contend that to truly get a normal distribution one must have mean\\=median\\=mode, all the data must be contained under the bell curve, and perfectly symmetrical around the mean. Therefore, technically, there are virtually NO normal distributions in real studies, and we should call them something else, perhaps \"near\\-normal\". \n\nShe says I'm too picky, and if the skew/kurtosis are less than 1\\.0 it is a normal distribution and took off points on an exam. The dataset is total number of falls/year in a random sampling of 52 nursing homes which is a random sample of a larger population. Any insight?\n\n**Problem:**\n\n> QUESTION: 3\\.

Is the data normally distributed? \n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> Statistics \n> Number of falls  \n> N  Valid    52\n>    Missing   0\n> Mean        11.23\n> Median      11.50\n> Mode         4a\n> \n> ```\n> \n> a.

Error of Kurtosis    .650\n> \n> ```\n\n**My answer:**\n\n> The data is platykurtic and has only slight positive skewing, and it is NOT a normal distribution because the mean and median and mode are not equal and the data is not evenly distributed around the mean. In reality virtually no data is ever a perfect normal distribution, although we can discuss \u201capproximately normal distributions\u201d such as height, weight, temperature, or length of adult ring finger in large population groups.\n\n**Professor's answer:**\n\n> You are correct that there is no perfectly normal distribution. But, we are not looking for perfection. We need to look at data in addition to the histogram and the measures of central tendency. What do the skewness and kurtosis statistics tell you about the distribution? Because they are both between the critical values of \\-1 and \\+1, this data is considered to be normally distributed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A problem with your discussion with the professor is one of terminology, there's a misunderstanding that is getting in the way of conveying a potentially useful idea. In different places, you both make errors.\n\nSo the first thing to address: it's important to be pretty clear about what a [*distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) is.\n\nA normal *distribution* is a specific mathematical object, which you could consider as a model for a process (which you might consider an uncountably infinite population of values; no finite population can actually have a continuous distribution).\n\nLoosely, what this distribution does (once you specify the parameters) is define (via an algebraic expression) the proportion of the population values that lies within any given interval on the real line. Slightly less loosely, it defines the probability that a single value from that population will lie in any given interval.\n\nAn observed sample doesn't really have a normal distribution; a sample might (potentially) be drawn from a normal distribution, if one were to exist. If you look at the empirical cdf of the sample, it's discrete. If you bin it (as in a histogram) the sample has a \"frequency distribution\", but those aren't normal distributions. The distribution can tell us some things (in a probabilistic sense) about a random sample from the population, and a sample may also tell us some things about the population.\n\nA reasonable interpretation of a phrase like \"normally distributed sample\"\\* is \"a random sample from a normally distributed population\".\n\n\\*(I generally try to avoid saying it myself, for reasons that are hopefully made clear enough here; usually I manage to confine myself to the second kind of expression.)\n\nHaving defined terms (if still a little loosely), let us now look at the question in detail. I'll be addressing specific pieces of the question.\n\n> normal distribution one must have mean\\=median\\=mode\n\nThis is certainly a condition on the normal probability distribution, though not a requirement on a sample drawn from a normal distribution; samples may be asymmetric, may have mean differ from median and so on. \\[We can, however, get an idea how far apart we might reasonably expect them to be if the sample really came from a normal population.]\n\n> all the data must be contained under the bell curve\n\nI am not sure what \"contained under\" means in this sense.\n\n> and perfectly symmetrical around the mean.\n\nNo; you're talking about the *data* here, and a sample from a (definitely symmetrical) normal population would not itself be perfectly symmetric.\n\nHere's some simulated samples from normal distributions:\n\n[![Histograms of 9 samples of size 60 from a normal distribution with population mean 50 and population  standard deviation 5](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zuhk2.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zuhk2.png)\n\nIf you generate a number of samples of about that sample size (60\\) and plot histograms with about 10 bins, you may see similar variation in general shape.\n\nAs you can see from the histograms, these are not actually symmetric. Some, like 2, 4 and 7, are quite distinctly *asymmetrical*. Some have quite short tails, like 5 and 8, some have noticeably longer tails, at least on one side. Some suggest multiple modes. None actually look all that close to what an actual normal density looks like $\\-$ that is, even random samples don't necessarily look all that much like their populations, at least not until the sample sizes are fairly large $\\-$ considerably larger than the n\\=60 I used here.\n\n> Therefore, technically, there are virtually NO normal distributions in real studies,\n\nI [agree with your conclusion](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/204471/is-there-an-explanation-for-why-there-are-so-many-natural-phenomena-that-follow/204479#204479) but the reasoning is not correct; it's not a consequence of the fact that *data* are not perfectly symmetric (etc); it's the fact that *populations* are themselves not [perfectly normal](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/57407/what-is-the-meaning-of-all-models-are-wrong-but-some-are-useful).\n\n> if the skew/kurtosis are less than 1\\.0 it is a normal distribution\n\nIf she said this in just that way, she's definitely wrong.\n\nA sample skewness may be much closer to 0 than that (taking \"less than\" to mean in absolute magnitude not actual value), and the sample excess kurtosis may also be much closer to 0 than that (they might even, whether by chance or construction, potentially be almost exactly zero), and yet the distribution from which the sample was drawn might be distinctly non\\-normal (e.g. bimodal, or clearly asymmetric, or perhaps with somewhat heavier tails than the normal $\\-$ it's not *just* the tail that determines kurtosis)\n\nWe can go further \\-\\- even if we were to magically know the *population* skewness and kurtosis were exactly that of a normal, it still wouldn't of itself tell us the population was normal, nor even something close to normal.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n[![double gamma, shape parameter 2.302776](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNWV9.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNWV9.png)\n\nThis particular example is strongly bimodal, heavier tailed than the normal, but symmetric. It has the same skewness and kurtosis as the normal.\n\nFurther examples can be found in [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/154965/805) answer.\n\nNot all are symmetric, and some are discrete.\n\n> The dataset is total number of falls/year in a random sampling of 52 nursing homes which is a random sample of a larger population.\n\nThe population distribution of counts are *never* normal. Counts are discrete and non\\-negative, normal distributions are continuous and over the entire real line.\n\nBut we're really focused on the wrong issue here. Probability models are just that, *models*. Let us not [confuse our models with the real thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(mythology)).\n\nThe issue isn't \"are the *data themselves* normal?\" (they can't be), nor even \"is the population from which the data were drawn normal?\" (this is almost never going to be the case).\n\nA more useful question to discuss is \"how badly would my inference be impacted if I treated the population as normally distributed?\"\n\nThat is we should not be overly focused on whether the assumption is *true* (we shouldn't expect that), but whether it's useful, or perhaps what and how severe might the consequences be if we were to use such a model.\n\nIt's also a much harder question to answer well, and may require considerably more work than glancing at a few simple diagnostics.\n\nThe sample statistics you showed are not particularly inconsistent with normality (you could see statistics like that or \"worse\" not terribly rarely if you had random samples of that size from normal populations), but that doesn't of itself mean that the actual population from which the sample was drawn is automatically \"close enough\" to normal for some particular purpose. It would be important to consider the purpose (what questions you're answering), and the robustness of the methods employed for it, and even then we may still not be sure that it's \"good enough\"; sometimes it may be better to simply not assume what we don't have good reason to assume *a priori* (e.g. on the basis of experience with similar data sets).\n\n> it is NOT a normal distribution\n\nData \\- even data drawn from a normal population \\- never have exactly the properties of the population; from those numbers alone you don't have a good basis to conclude that the population is not normal here.\n\nOn the other hand neither do we have any reasonably solid basis to say that it's \"sufficiently close\" to normal \\- we haven't even considered the purpose of assuming normality, so we don't know what distributional features it might be sensitive to.\n\nFor example, if I had two samples for a measurement that was bounded, that I knew would not be heavily discrete (not mostly only taking a few distinct values) and reasonably near to symmetric, I might be relatively happy to use a two\\-sample t\\-test at some not\\-so\\-small sample size; it's moderately robust to mild deviations from the assumptions (somewhat level\\-robust, somewhat less power\\-robust). But I would be considerably more cautious about as causally assuming normality when testing equality of spread, for example, because the best test under that assumption is quite sensitive to the assumption.\n\n> Because they are both between the critical values of \\-1 and \\+1, this data is considered to be normally distributed.\"\n\nIf that's really the criterion by which one decides to use a normal distributional model, then it will sometimes lead you into quite poor analyses.\n\nThe values of those statistics do give us some clues about the population from which the sample was drawn, but that's not at all the same thing as suggesting that their values are in any way a 'safe guide' to choosing an analysis.\n\nCast your mind back to the fact that there's distributional examples where the population has very different shape from the normal, but with the same *population* skewness and kurtosis. Add to that the inherent noise in their sample equivalents (and not least of all, the considerable downbias typical of sample kurtosis), and you may well be concluding rather too much on very limited and possibly misleading evidence.\n\n---\n\nNow to address the underlying issue with even a better phrased version of such a question as the one you had:\n\nThe whole process of looking at a sample to choose a model is fraught with problems \\-\\- doing so alters the properties of any subsequent choices of analysis based on what you saw! e.g for a hypothesis test, your significance levels, p\\-values and power are all *not what you would choose/calculate them to be*, because those calculations are predicated on the analysis not being based on the data.\n\nSee, for example Gelman and Loken (2014\\), \"[The Statistical Crisis in Science](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-statistical-crisis-in-science),\" *American Scientist*, Volume 102, Number 6, p 460\n(DOI: 10\\.1511/2014\\.111\\.460\\) which discusses issues with such data\\-dependent analysis."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is analyzing the number of falls per year in a sample of 52 nursing homes.

Further investigation of the research purpose and potential consequences of assuming normality is needed.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate and nuanced response. While the sample statistics don't show strong evidence against normality, they also don't prove the population is normal. Count data can sometimes be approximated by a normal distribution if certain conditions are met. However, the key point is that we shouldn't simply rely on rule-of-thumb criteria for skewness and kurtosis.

See for example the [SpeX Spectrograph](http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~spex/) (and in particular [this](http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~spex/SpeX.pdf) article with a technical description of SpeX).\n\nMy Questions:\n\n1. Is it true that CCDs aren't used for the near\\-infrared range, and if so why?\n2. The sensor that is being used for for the near\\-infrared range: are its principals of operation similar to CCD sensors? what are the main differences?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A few thoughts \\- not a complete answer.\n\nCCD devices tend to have higher power consumption. As you go further to the IR, the bandgap of the device has to be smaller (since the photons have lower energy at those wavelengths) and you want to keep your power consumption down so the device doesn't heat up (which would create noise). Silicon cuts off at around 1100 nm \\- not far enough for the application you describe.\n\nStrictly speaking, \"CCD\" refers not to the detection of the light, but to the readout scheme. Each pixel has a corresponding capacitor that stores the integral of the light received, and through a \"bucket brigade\" type of circuit the charge can be communicated from one pixel to the next until you reach the edge of the sensor, where an ADC read the value.\n\nBy contrast, a CMOS sensor (really, CMOS refers to the complementary metal oxide semiconductor process used to place transistors on the semiconductor substrate) is \"random access\" \\- that is, you turn on a transistor to read back the voltage from a particular pixel. This has certain advantages (speed of readout of a small region of the sensor, power dissipation) but some disadvantages (noise). But as CMOS technology is very widely used, tremendous advantages of scale and cost, as well as performance, have emerged over time \\- making CMOS preferable in almost any application.\n\nWhat you need for IR is low power dissipation, low noise, and small bandgap. That means you need a different material for detecting the light; and possibly a different technology for reading out the pixels.\n\nOne of the supplies of IR imaging technology for astronomy is Teledyne, and they published [a nice description of some of the technologies they developed in 2008](http://www.teledyne-si.com/pdf-imaging/Teledyne%20Imaging%20Sensor%20-%20Infrared%20SPIE%20Paper%20_7021-20_.pdf). Reading this, I find that they use HgCdTe, with a variable cutoff wavelength depending on the exact application. The nice thing about MCT (Mercury Cadmium Telluride) is that you can \"tune\" the bandgap between 0\\.1 eV and 1\\.5 eV by changing the ratio of Hg and Cd. By growing the detector using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), this ratio can be carefully controlled \\- and thus you can tune a detector to be \"just right\" for the wavelength of interest. If the bandgap is too large, you won't see the longest wavelength of interest; if it's too small, you will get excess thermal noise. The unique flexibility of MCT makes it the preferred material for high quality IR sensors.\n\nThe figure 2 from that paper is worth reproducing here \\- it shows you the structure of these devices, and shows that the IR detection and readout are two distinct functions, and that the use of different technologies for each helps optimize performance:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/u5FKJ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/u5FKJ.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: An astronomy research team needs to select a sensor for measuring asteroid spectra in the near-infrared range (700-2500 nm).

HgCdTe (Mercury Cadmium Telluride) sensors are ideal for near-infrared detection in astronomy for several reasons:\n\n1.

The exercise is then to calculate the CoM velocity and rotation speed after the collision.\n\nA standard solution to this is to set up two equations:\n\n* **angular momentum conservation** about the axis perpendicular to $v\\_0$ and through the collision point\n* **energy conservation** of the rod, since the collision is elastic and the spike is held in place, i.e. the rod's energy does not change\n\nA friend of mine then (either by ingenious intuition or by remembering it from our dynamics course) claimed that angular momentum conservation (which can be slightly annoying to write down) can be **replaced by the following condition: the velocity in the spike frame of the point on the rod that touches the spike is reversed.**\n\nTo my surprise it worked for the specific question we were doing, we got the same result using both calculations. Now my question:\n\n1. Is this actually true for inelastic collisions in general or some kind of coincidence? I haven't tried to prove it, but I think if it is true that should be straightforward. This is not my main question though, since I believe it is probably true in general.\n2. Now assuming that it is true: **Why on earth is it true??** As in: is there an easy explanation or does it just come out of the math? The reason I find this so astonishing is that angular momentum conservation and energy conservation apply *globally* and it is important that the rod is a **rigid body**. It seems amazing to me that one can replace that by a simple and completely *local* condition, that tells you how *one point* of the rigid body will move.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"trick\" only works for elastic collisions, for which the relative velocities of approach and separation are equal and opposite, when measured along the common normal at the point of contact :  \n\n$v\\_2\\-v\\_1 \\= u\\_2\\-u\\_1$. \n\nIn general we can write :  \n\n$v\\_2\\-v\\_1\\=e(u\\_2\\-u\\_1\\)$  \n\nwhere $e$ is the Coefficient of Restitution. For elastic collisions $e\\=1$; for inealstic collisions $0 \\\\le e \\\\lt 1$.\n\nSince relative velocities are being compared, the \"trick\" also works in the frame of reference of the rod. It can be applied in other reference frames also, but in such frames it is more difficult to distinguish between normal and tangential components of motion/forces.\n\nThe \"trick\" can be deduced from both conservation of kinetic energy and linear momentum (see Wikipedia article on [Elastic Collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision#One-dimensional_Newtonian)). Therefore using it is equivalent to using one of the two conservation equations. You can combine it with either, whichever is the more convenient \\- usually (IMO) conservation of momentum is the easier to apply.\n\n---\n\nI think the key which answers your doubt over *why* the above works for extended bodies when it is derived for linear collisions between point particles, is your own observation that the collision occurs between **rigid bodies**. Because of this there is a clear point or plane of contact, and the collision is instantaneous compared with the time required for any other motion, such as rotation. Under these conditions, the collision can be modelled as a linear collision between a point particle and a plane \\- the spike being the point particle and the rod the plane.\n\nIf there were significant deformation of either body, contact would be along a non\\-planar surface, and would take a finite time, during which one or both bodies rotate, with the result that the collision would be considerably more difficult to model."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A thin rod of mass M and length L is moving with velocity v0 when it collides elastically with a stationary spike fixed to the ground at a distance d from the rod's center of mass. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the analysis of this collision?\n\nA) Angular momentum conservation about the collision point can always be replaced by the condition that the velocity of the rod's contact point with the spike is reversed in the spike's frame, regardless of whether the collision is elastic or inelastic.\n\nB) The \"trick\" of reversing the velocity of the contact point in the spike's frame is equivalent to using conservation of energy, and can be combined with conservation of angular momentum to solve the problem.\n\nC) The collision can be modeled as a linear collision between a point particle (the spike) and a plane (the rod) because the rod is a rigid body and the collision is instantaneous compared to any rotational motion.\n\nD) If there were significant deformation of the rod during the collision, the \"trick\" of reversing the contact point velocity would still be valid, but would require a more complex mathematical model to account for the non-planar contact surface.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately describes why the \"trick\" works for rigid bodies in elastic collisions. The instantaneous nature of the collision and the rigidity of the bodies allow us to model it as a simple linear collision at a single point, despite the rod being an extended object. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the \"trick\" only works for elastic collisions, not inelastic ones. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the \"trick\" is actually equivalent to using conservation of momentum, not energy. \n\nOption D is incorrect because significant deformation would invalidate the assumptions that make the \"trick\" work, as it would no longer be an instantaneous collision at a single point."}, "29": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/12/31", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/91690", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/6082/"], "docs_id": 91690, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm weirded out. \nI have an Acer Aspire 5515 series laptop which has a webcam built in.\nWhen I open Cheese, it says: \"no device found\".\nCamorama says: \"Could not connect to video device.

I do understand the proof, and the intuitive explanation about parametrised curves in a plane, but I still think the statement of the theorem looks relatively obscure. Why are we considering a ratio and not something else? This led me to try and generalise, and this is where we get to my question.\n\nI first tried finding a function $h: \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}$ such that for any functions $f,g: D \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying Cauchy's mean value theorem's hypotheses, for any interval $\\[a,b] \\\\subset D$, there exists $x \\\\in \\[a,b]$ such that $h(f'(x), g'(x))\\=h(f(b\\-a), g(b\\-a))$. Beyond making a few tries and finding a few counterexamples, I realised this wasn't really in the spirit of a mean value theorem: we are trying to make an analogy, if we may use this term, between $f'(x)$ and $f(b)\\-f(a)$, while in both Lagrange and Cauchy's mean value theorems the analogy is made between $f'(x)$ and $\\\\frac{f(b)\\-f(a)}{b\\-a}$.

For example and without restriction to generality, let\n$$\n\\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial X}\\\\right\\|\\_{(X\\_0,Y\\_0\\)}\\\\neq 0\\.\n$$\nSince $\\\\Phi(x\\_0,Y\\_0\\)\\=c$, equation \\\\eqref{3} defines a function $X\\=\\\\psi(Y)$ with $X\\_0\\=\\\\psi(Y\\_0\\)$ and\n$$\n\\\\Phi(\\\\psi(Y),Y)\\-c \\=0\n$$\nat least in a neighborhood of $Y\\_0$, thus can find a $\\\\delta \\>0$ such that if $\\|Y\\-y\\_0\\| \\<\\\\delta$ then also $\\|X\\_0\\-\\\\psi(Y)\\|\\<\\\\delta$. Moreover, since $\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial X}\\\\neq 0$, the function $X\\\\mapsto\\\\Phi(X,Y\\_0\\)$, considered in a neighborhood of $X\\=X\\_0$, takes the value $c$ only in $X\\=X\\_0$. From here on it is possible to proceed as in the proof of the lemma in \u00a75: assume that $\\\\psi^\\\\prime(Y\\_0\\)\\>0$ and put\n$$\n\\\\overline X \\= \\\\frac{f(b)\\-f(a)}{b\\-a},\\\\; \\\\overline Y\\= \\\\frac{g(b)\\-g(a)}{b\\-a}.\n$$\nWe have that\n$$\n\\\\frac{g(b)\\-g(a)}{b\\-a} \\= Y\\_0\n$$\nand moreover\n$$\n\\\\frac{f(b)\\-f(a)}{b\\-a} \\= \\\\frac{1}{b\\-a}\\\\int\\\\limits\\_a^b \\\\psi(g^\\\\prime(x))\\\\Dm x.\n$$\nwith $\\|X\\_0\\-\\\\psi(g^\\\\prime(x))\\|\\<\\\\delta$, and thus\n$$\n\\\\Bigg\\|\\\\frac{f(b)\\-f(a)}{b\\-a} \\- X\\_0\\\\Bigg\\|\\=\\\\Bigg\\| \\\\frac{1}{b\\-a}\\\\int\\\\limits\\_a^b \\[\\\\psi(g^\\\\prime(x))\\-X\\_0]\\\\Dm x\\\\Bigg\\|\\<\\\\delta.\n$$\nThis implies $\\|\\\\overline{X}\\-X\\_0\\|\\<\\\\delta$ and $\\|\\\\overline{Y}\\-Y\\_0\\|\\<\\\\delta$ and due to the arbitrariness of $\\\\delta$ we have\n$$\n\\\\Phi(\\\\overline{X},\\\\overline{Y}) \\\\neq \\\\Phi(X\\_0,Y\\_0\\) \\= c.\n$$\nEquation \\\\eqref{2} of \u00a75 thus proves that\n$$\n\\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\frac{f(b)\\-f(a)}{b\\-a}, \\\\frac{g(b)\\-g(a)}{b\\-a}\\\\right) \\\\neq \\\\Phi(f^\\\\prime (x), g^\\\\prime(x))\\=c\\\\quad\\\\forall x\\\\in\\[a,b], \n$$\nthus it must be $\\\\psi^{\"}(Y\\_0\\)$ for otherwise $\\\\Phi(X,Y)$ is not a Cauchy function.

This suggests that graphics driver issues can sometimes manifest as plugin-related problems in Chrome.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the user explicitly states that the plugin is not visible on the Extensions page.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the user mentions that the plugin is also not visible on the chrome://plugins/ page.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while Chrome may eventually phase out support for certain plugins, this does not address the immediate issue the user is facing.\n\nThe correct approach, based on the provided solution, is to reinstall the graphics driver (option C), which unexpectedly resolved the plugin-related issue."}, "38": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/06/02", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/547590", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/217355/"], "docs_id": 547590, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am creating the following table:\n\n```\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n        \\hline\n        \\text{sign of} c & f & i & \\text{Resulting Matrix}\\\\\n        \\hline\n        $\\geq 0$ & $\\geq 0$ & $\\geq 0$ & \n        $\n        \\begin{bmatrix}\n            -2c^2+1 & -2cf & 2ci\\\\\n            -2cf & -2f^2+1 & 2fi\\\\\n            -2ci & -2fi & 2i^2-1\n        \\end{bmatrix}$\\\\\n        \\hline\n        $\\geq 0$ & $\\geq 0$ & $\\leq 0$ & $ \n        \\begin{bmatrix}\n            -2c^2+1 & -2cf & -2ci\\\\\n            -2cf & -2f^2+1 & -2fi\\\\\n            2ci & 2fi & 2i^2-1\n        \\end{bmatrix}$\n        \\\\\n        \\hline\n        $\\geq 0$ & $\\leq 0$ & $\\geq 0$ &\n        $\\begin{bmatrix}\n            -2c^2+1 & 2cf & 2ci\\\\\n            2cf & -2f^2+1 & -2fi\\\\\n            -2ci & 2fi & 2i^2-1\n        \\end{bmatrix}$\\\\\n        \\hline\n        $\\geq 0$ & $\\leq 0$ & $\\leq 0$ & $\n        \\begin{bmatrix}\n            -2c^2+1 & 2cf & -2ci\\\\\n            2cf & -2f^2+1 & 2fi\\\\\n            2ci & -2fi & 2i^2-1\n        \\end{bmatrix}$\n        \\\\\n        \\hline\n        $\\leq 0$ & $\\geq 0$ & $\\geq 0$ & \n        $\\begin{bmatrix}\n            -2c^2+1 & 2cf & -2ci\\\\\n            2cf & -2f^2+1 & 2fi\\\\\n            2ci & -2fi & 2i^2-1\n        \\end{bmatrix}$\\\\\n        \\hline\n        $\\leq 0$ & $\\geq 0$ & $\\leq 0$ & \n        $\\begin{bmatrix}\n            -2c^2+1 & 2cf & 2ci\\\\\n            2cf & -2f^2+1 & -2fi\\\\\n            -2ci & 2fi & 2i^2-1\n        \\end{bmatrix}$\n        \\\\\n        \\hline\n        $\\leq 0$ & $\\leq 0$ & $\\geq 0$ & \n        $\\begin{bmatrix}\n            -2c^2+1 & -2cf & -2ci\\\\\n            -2cf & -2f^2+1 & -2fi\\\\\n            2ci & 2fi & 2i^2-1\n        \\end{bmatrix}$\n        \\\\\n        \\hline\n        $\\leq 0$ & $\\leq 0$ & $\\leq 0$ & \n        $\\begin{bmatrix}\n            -2c^2+1 & -2cf & 2ci\\\\\n            -2cf & -2f^2+1 & 2fi\\\\\n            -2ci & -2fi & 2i^2-1\n        \\end{bmatrix}$\n        \\\\\n        \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{All the matrcies which yield from casework on $c,f,i = \\pm \\sqrt{c^2}, \\pm \\sqrt{f^2}, \\pm \\sqrt{i^2}$.}\n    \\label{fig:my_label}\n\\end{figure}\n\n```\n\nIt ends up looking like this:\n[![Matricies are Cramped together on the right, compiled with Overleaf](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DJvUh.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DJvUh.png)\n\nAs you can see, there is no vertical space between the top of the cell and the top of the matrix that is in it.

While it was once a common way of expressing this action, it has largely fallen out of use in contemporary English.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the phrase is grammatically correct, even if it's not commonly used today. \nOption B is wrong because \"let go of your hand\" is actually the more common and preferred form in modern English. \nOption D is incorrect because this archaic form is not a common colloquialism in present-day spoken English; it would sound quite formal or outdated to most speakers.\n\nThis question tests the student's understanding of language evolution, grammatical structures, and the difference between archaic and modern usage in English."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/08/27", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/294726", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/171596/"], "docs_id": 294726, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to determine when a web application should query a database for related data that may or may not be used in the current request.\n\nAs an example, consider a database that tracks assets for a company. There is an Assets table, an Owners table, and a Users table. Assets may be assigned to an OwnerID, and Asset records will track the UserIDs that created, updated, and deleted the Asset.\n\nWhen doing web requests for the data, I see two main options:\n\n1. Read all of the data in one request, with a join to Owners and multiple joins to Users (user created/updated/deleted). While this makes for a heavier query, it would reduce repeated calls to the database. It also simplifies the use of OOP within the application, as every entity will be fully populated and can be accessed easily, e.g.: Asset.Owner.Email, Asset.LastUpdatedBy.Name, etc.\n2. Only read the data from the Owners table up front, and create separate database requests when the application requires any Owner or User information other than the ID. In about half of the HTTP requests, no extra info will be required, and in the other half of the HTTP requests, the application will need to query the name, email, etc. of the Owner and each of the users who created, updated, or deleted the asset. I like the idea of the lean initial request, but I worry about performance when doing an additional handful of requests to get the related data. It also complicates the OOP design in the application somewhat; instead of being able to simply retrieve Asset.Owner.Email, I'll have to first check if the Asset.Owner object has been populated, call Asset.LoadOwnerByID(Asset.OwnerID), then finally access the value. (Ignore the fact that Asset shouldn't have a LoadOwnerByID method \\- that's just an example.)\n\nNow that I've written it out, I'm leaning towards Option 1 as being the most efficient and simple way to do things. But it gets a little less obvious when you add more recursive relations to the data, e.g.: Each user has a ReportsToUserID value pointing to another User, and each Owner has an AccountManagedByUserID field pointing to a User.\n\nIn these examples, what is your preferred way to do things, and what have you found to be the most efficient, both in terms of performance and programming complexity?\n\nPS \\- I'm intentionally leaving out specifics on web framework and database type because I have had this question come up in all environments, from ASP.Net/MSSQL to Java/SQLite to PHP/MySQL, and I believe the principles will generally apply to all of those environments.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I'm trying to determine when a web application should query a database for related data that may or may not be used in the current request.\n\nFor such general questions it's hard to give a general answer.\n\nYou have to consider two points: *convenience* and *performance*.\n\nMany things, which seem at first sight convenient are at hindsight performancekillers. Whether it's one or the other \\- or maybe neither, depends on the amount of data in the DB, which is releated to the lifecycle of an application.\n\nIf you start out with an application, you oftentimes have near to no data. So to minimize the roundtrips to the DB you catch as much data as you could with one request. *You want to present rich data fast*. \n\nWith small datasets the resultset is small, the queries \\- though complex \\- are fast enough, Joins seem cheap.\n\nThat changes with time. Tables will contain lots and lots of data. Big queries will become costly and you have to break up your concepts. Sometimes even it would be best to avoid database joins and do it in main memory. \n\nFrom my perspective **the question** \\- **as asked** \\- is of a rather **philosophical nature**.\n\nBut nevertheless there are some rules of thumb one could give:\n\n**1\\)** Always retrieve as less data as possibly needed. This is some kind of YAGNI (you ain't gonna need it). Even if it sounds nice to have the data at hand: if you (the user) do not need it, it's pointless to query for it\n\n**2\\)** Measure your queries. Despite the previous point: if your application is *fast enough*, why worry? There are several measurepoints:\n\n* UX \\- sometimes only psychological: Does you user *think* or *perceives* the app as *fast*\n* How fast is the network between the user and the datacenter?\n* Is your database delivering data really fast? Are queries *best effort*?\n\nAs long as your users feel *snappyness*, the connection is pleasant and your queries are fast there is no problem in querying as much data as you could.\n\nDepending on this rudimentary metrics you could evaluate your two solutions:\n\nIf you have *small datasets*, a *fast DB*, a *good to medium connection*, you could query as much data as you can get, which would result in a super fast app. On the other hand. If that is the case, there would be no noticeable difference to the second option, to query data when needed.\n\nBut beware of changes:\n\n* if the *datasets* grow *big* and the connection stays *good*, option 2 becomes more attractive.\n* but suddenly your user is on mobile \\- which is today oftentimes a horrible experience \\- one big costly query could be more attractive, although all it's disadvantages: the user could perhaps not rely on a stable connection \\- and you are able to deliver a nice UX with all data received.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n> When to load related database data in web request?\n\nIt depends."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange discussion:\n\nQuestion: A web application developer is designing a system to retrieve asset data along with related owner and user information. Which approach is generally recommended for optimizing performance and maintainability as the application scales?\n\nA) Always retrieve all related data in a single query using JOINs to minimize database round trips.\n\nB) Only retrieve the minimum required data initially, and fetch additional related information on-demand as needed.\n\nC) Use a hybrid approach, retrieving commonly accessed related data upfront, but leaving rarely used information for separate queries.\n\nD) Implement a caching layer to store all related data, eliminating the need for database queries after initial load.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C, as it represents a balanced approach that considers both performance and convenience. This hybrid strategy aligns with the key points discussed in the StackExchange answer:\n\n1. It follows the principle of retrieving only necessary data initially, avoiding unnecessary overhead for information that may not be used.\n\n2. It allows for optimization based on usage patterns, fetching commonly accessed data upfront to reduce round trips for frequently needed information.\n\n3. It provides flexibility to adapt as the application grows and data volume increases, allowing for fine-tuning of query strategies.\n\n4. It balances the trade-offs between query complexity and number of database calls, which can be adjusted based on network conditions and database performance.\n\n5. It allows for a more nuanced approach that can be tailored to specific use cases within the application, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nThis approach acknowledges that the optimal strategy may change as the application evolves, and provides a framework for balancing performance and convenience based on actual usage patterns and scaling needs."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/11/04", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/111450", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/27801/"], "docs_id": 111450, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let $M$ be a complex manifold of dimension $N\\\\ge2$ such that\n\n$\\\\qquad$(1\\) $M$ is diffeomorphic to $R^{2N}$,\n\n$\\\\qquad$(2\\) There is a compact set $K\\\\subseteq M$ such that $M\\\\setminus K$ is biholomorphic to $C^N\\\\setminus \\\\bar B\\_1$.\n\nMust $M$ be biholomorphic to $C^N$?\n\nI don't know if the problem is open, or easy.

For $n\\=1$ the statement not true (as Pietro Majer says correctly says it). There is a reference now given in a comment by Margaret Friedland that justifies this answer. \n\nIn the case that you consider there is a holomorphic map from \n$M\\\\setminus K$ to $\\\\mathbb C^n\\\\setminus \\\\bar B\\_1$, i.e. you have $n$ holomorphic functions \non $M\\\\setminus K$. Each of these functions can be extended to $M$ provided $n\\>1$ since $K$ is pseudoconvex in $M$. So you get a proper holomorphic map from $M$ to $\\\\mathbb C^n$. Moreover this map is birational (or of degree one in other words), so $M$ is a contractible topological space only if the map is an isomorphism (otherwise there will be some exceptional divisors on $M$ that will be contracted to points by the map and so the topology of $M$ will be non\\-trivial).\n\nHere is the mathscient citation for the reference given by Margaret Friedland\n\n\"The authors prove the following: If $M$ is a \ufb01nite complex manifold with \nconnected boundary $bM$ such that the Levi form has one positive eigenvalue everywhere on $bM$, then every function on $bM$\nwhich satis\ufb01es the \u201ctangential Cauchy\\-Riemann equations\u201d on $bM$ has a holomorphic extension to the whole of $M$.\"\n\nNote that the boundary of a ball in $\\\\mathbb C^n$ has positive Levi form (for $n\\>1$) and the \"tangential Cauchy\\-Riemann\" equation is automatically satisfied provided the function is defined and holomorphic in a neighbourhood of $bM$. Clearly we can assume the later in our case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Given a complex manifold M of dimension N \u2265 2 that is diffeomorphic to R^(2N) and has a compact set K such that M\\K is biholomorphic to C^N\\B\u0304_1 (where B\u0304_1 is the closed unit ball), which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) M is always biholomorphic to C^N for all N \u2265 1.\nB) M is biholomorphic to C^N only for N > 1.\nC) M is never biholomorphic to C^N for any N \u2265 1.\nD) The biholomorphism between M and C^N depends on the specific properties of the compact set K.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. For N > 1 (i.e., dimension greater than 1), M is indeed biholomorphic to C^N. This is because:\n\n1. For N > 1, holomorphic functions defined on the complement of a pseudoconvex domain (like K in this case) can always be extended to the entire domain.\n2. The given conditions allow for the construction of a proper holomorphic map from M to C^N of degree one.\n3. Since M is diffeomorphic to R^(2N), it's contractible. The map being of degree one ensures it's an isomorphism, otherwise M's topology would be non-trivial.\n\nHowever, this result doesn't hold for N = 1 (the complex plane case). Therefore, the statement is true only for dimensions greater than 1, making option B the correct answer.

Some of these rules are given on [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartographic_relief_depiction#Contour_lines). The main recommendation when simplifying contours it to preserve the terrain main characteristics.\n\nSmoothing the contours independently do not prevent them to overlap: It is advised to smooth the DTM first. A traditional Gaussian smoothing with a suitable parameter depending on the target resolution allows to erase the small details. A drawback is that DTM smoothing fills the valleys and depressions, and flattens the ridges and peaks. Using the douglass\\-peucker filter algorithm like [in this paper](http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXVII/congress/1_pdf/129.pdf) may be a solution. There are also [number of methods](http://www.citeulike.org/user/jgaffuri/tag/contour) based on the use of contour smoothing algorithms constrained by the drainage network or a skeleton. Finally, to prevent the contours to overlap in sloppy parts, it is possible [to erase them locally](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/wam/MackSteven2006.pdf) or also [deform them](http://icaci.org/documents/ICC_proceedings/ICC2009/html/refer/19_2.pdf)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When generating contours from a high-resolution DEM (Digital Elevation Model), which of the following approaches is considered best practice according to cartographic principles?\n\nA) Smooth the contour lines after generating them from the original DEM to create a more aesthetically pleasing result.\n\nB) Apply a Gaussian smoothing filter to the DEM before generating contours, adjusting the filter parameter based on the target contour interval.\n\nC) Use the Douglas-Peucker algorithm directly on the contour lines to simplify them after generation.\n\nD) Generate contours at the highest possible resolution to capture all terrain details, then selectively remove overlapping lines in steep areas.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The best practice for generating contours from a high-resolution DEM involves smoothing the DTM (Digital Terrain Model) first, rather than smoothing the contours after generation. Specifically, applying a Gaussian smoothing filter to the DEM before contour generation is recommended, with the smoothing parameter adjusted based on the desired contour interval. This approach helps preserve the main terrain characteristics while removing small details that might lead to cluttered or unrealistic contours. \n\nOption A is incorrect because smoothing contours independently after generation can lead to overlapping issues and doesn't preserve terrain characteristics as effectively. Option C, while mentioning a valid algorithm, applies it incorrectly to the contours rather than the DEM. Option D goes against the principle of appropriate generalization and could result in information overload or inaccurate representation of the terrain.\n\nThe correct approach (B) aligns with Imhof's cartographic principles for relief representation and addresses the need to balance detail with clarity in contour generation."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2009/11/17", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/85688", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/81082/"], "docs_id": 85688, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have database servers, web servers, SVN servers, etc.\nOften times I ssh among them...or they auto\\-ssh.\n\n**How do I manage what server gets to log into which others?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I use Puppet, and have a class defined for every key, then classes that include those classes to define the \"groups\" of keys I have (for us it's people \\-\\- so L1 techs, L2 techs, managers, developers \\-\\- but you can do db servers, fileservers, svn servers, etc).

We can rewrite this as\n$$\\\\lim\\_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\cup\\_{i\\=1}^{\\\\infty}B\\_i\\-\\\\cup\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\-1}B\\_i\\\\right)\\=0,$$\nso by the algebra of limits\n$$\\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\cup\\_{i\\=1}^{\\\\infty}B\\_i\\\\right)\\=\\\\lim\\_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\mu(\\\\cup\\_{i\\=1}^{n\\-1}B\\_i)\\=\\\\lim\\_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\mu(\\\\cup\\_{i\\=1}^n B\\_i)\\=\\\\lim\\_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n\\\\mu(B\\_i)\\=\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\mu(B\\_i).$$\n\nQuestions:\n\n(1\\) Is this proof correct? (In particular I am not sure that $\\\\cup\\_{i\\=n}^{\\\\infty}B\\_i$ does decrease to $\\\\varnothing$.)\n\n(2\\) I do not appear to have used $\\\\mu(X)\\<\\\\infty$ anywhere. Why is this needed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You cannot write $\\\\mu (A\\\\setminus B)$ as $\\\\mu (A)\\-\\\\mu (B)$ for infinite measures (for $B \\\\subset A$). That is where the assumption $\\\\mu (X) \\<\\\\infty $ is required. Otherwise your proof is correct. It should be clear that $\\\\cup\\_{i\\=n}^{\\\\infty }B\\_i$ is decreasing. Suppose there is a point $x$ in the intersection. Then $x$ would belong to infinitely many of the sets $B\\_i$. But no point can belong to more than one of these sets, so the intersection is empty."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Let (X,\ud835\udcd0) be a measurable space and \u03bc a non-negative set function that is finitely additive with \u03bc(\u2205) = 0 and \u03bc(X) < \u221e. Suppose that whenever Ai is a sequence of sets in \ud835\udcd0 which decrease to \u2205, then lim(i\u2192\u221e)\u03bc(Ai) = 0. Which of the following statements is correct about proving that \u03bc is a measure?\n\nA) The condition \u03bc(X) < \u221e is unnecessary for the proof and can be omitted.\n\nB) For any countable collection of pairwise disjoint sets {Bi}, we must show that \u03bc(\u222aiBi) = \u03a3i\u03bc(Bi) using the given conditions.\n\nC) The proof relies on the fact that \u03bc(A\\B) = \u03bc(A) - \u03bc(B) for any A, B \u2208 \ud835\udcd0.\n\nD) It's impossible to prove \u03bc is a measure with the given conditions; additional assumptions are needed.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is correct. To prove \u03bc is a measure, we need to show countable additivity for disjoint sets, which is the key step not given in the initial conditions. The condition \u03bc(X) < \u221e is actually necessary (contrary to A) because it allows us to use properties of finite measures in the proof. Option C is incorrect because \u03bc(A\\B) = \u03bc(A) - \u03bc(B) doesn't hold for infinite measures, and we can't assume \u03bc is a measure yet. Option D is false because the given conditions are sufficient to prove \u03bc is a measure when properly applied."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/08/16", "source": ["https://meta.askubuntu.com/questions/204", "https://meta.askubuntu.com", "https://meta.askubuntu.com/users/236/"], "docs_id": 204, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Starting from today I noticed that I get logged out from time to time at SE.

This aligns with the top answer in the StackExchange documentation, which suggests that cookie invalidation or server-side session management issues are more probable than IP-based login systems or extensive whois checks. The answer also notes that simple IP changes (like those from dynamic IPs) don't typically cause logouts, indicating that the more frequent and drastic changes from Tor usage might be triggering server-side security measures or session management problems."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/04/22", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/134761", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/41194/"], "docs_id": 134761, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a server with WHM/cPanel server a website (Apache, PHP, MySQL) and a few days ago WHM performed some kind of update on itself (there are new icons and new appearance overall).

According to the documentation, when access logs grow very large due to high traffic, processing these logs for statistics (using tools like awstats or Webalizer) can take a significant amount of time, leading to periodic slowdowns. Increasing the frequency of log processing can help manage this issue by preventing logs from becoming too large between processing cycles.
