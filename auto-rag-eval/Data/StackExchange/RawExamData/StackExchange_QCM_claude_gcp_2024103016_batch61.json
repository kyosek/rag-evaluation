While most programmers are aware of the OO\\-features, and at least the decent ones also know about functional programming, there is one feature in particular in Scala for which I am not aware of its historical origins.\n\nGiven that a major mantra of our profession is to not reinvent the wheel, I am rather confident, that Scala does not have *any* actual unheard\\-of\\-before features, but I stand to be corrected on this one if necessary.\n\nTo get to the actual question, while I am aware of the origins of most of Scala's features I have never seen something like its `implicit` declarations before. Are there other (older!) languages out there which also provide this feature?\n\nDoes it make sense to distinguish the different cases of implicits (as they may originate from different sources), namely implict conversions and implicit parameters?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I disagree with Brian's answer on that other question.\n\nAs far as I know, there's no *implicit* concept on any other language. The change history for Scala implies that implicits were a generalization of view bounds, and a view bound is, itself, a generalization of automatic type conversion, which is very common indeed.\n\nImplicits then enabled type classes, but I'd be very surprised if that was the original intent.\n\n**Edit**\n\nThe release notes for Scala 2\\.0 (2006\\) say:\n\n> Views in Scala 1\\.0 have been replaced by the more general concept of\n>  implicit parameters\n\nThat doesn't mean, of course, that implicit parameters were introduced with the goal of replacing views.\n\nHowever, Odersky clearly likes it when once concept can replace multiple ones. In that sense, it may well be the case that Odersky wanted type classes, but did not want to introduce a mechanism to handle that exclusively, and, therefore, came up with something else that let him remove one concept (Views) and replace it with a more generic concept that handles both views and type classes.\n\nIn case anyone is interested, Poor Man's Type Classes, referred to by Brian back at Stack Overflow, is dated 2006 as well. Clearly, Odersky was aware of the link between implicits and type classes when he introduced them.\n\nYet, I stand by my claim. :\\-)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about Scala's `implicit` feature is most accurate?\n\nA) Implicit declarations were directly borrowed from an older programming language\nB) Implicits were introduced primarily to implement type classes in Scala\nC) The concept of implicits was a generalization of view bounds in Scala\nD) Implicit parameters were introduced in Scala 1.0 to replace views\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the documentation states that \"implicits were a generalization of view bounds.\" While implicits enabled the implementation of type classes, this was likely not the primary intent behind their introduction. The documentation also mentions that implicit parameters replaced views in Scala 2.0, not 1.0, ruling out option D. There's no evidence provided that implicits were directly borrowed from another language, eliminating option A. Option B is not correct because, although implicits did enable type classes, the documentation suggests this was more of a beneficial consequence rather than the primary goal of introducing implicits."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/11/07", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/435059", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/265033/"], "docs_id": 435059, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was recently given an interview, and given the following scenario:\n\nYou have one classification problem to solve.

The problem is explicitly stated as a classification task, which immediately rules out linear regression (Option 1) as it's designed for regression, not classification.\n\n2. While neural networks can be powerful for classification, using only linear activation functions (Option 2) essentially collapses the network into a single linear function, negating the benefits of multiple layers.\n\n3. Logistic regression (Option 3) is indeed designed for classification and can be effective for binary classification tasks. However, for complex classification problems, it may not capture intricate non-linear relationships in the data.\n\n4. Option 4 uses a neural network with non-linear activation functions (ReLU for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer). This allows the network to learn complex, non-linear decision boundaries, making it well-suited for difficult classification tasks. The use of ReLU in hidden layers helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, while the sigmoid function in the output layer is appropriate for binary classification.\n\nThis question tests understanding of different model architectures, the importance of non-linearity in neural networks, and the appropriateness of different models for classification tasks."}, "2": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/02/13", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/157469", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/93437/"], "docs_id": 157469, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I installed about 20 LED bulbs in my house when I moved in two years ago.

The save method first checks the object only if the object is of type `AEntity` and then saves the object.\n\nThe problem is the use of instanceof in the `save` method of `EntityRepository`. If we want to prevent using instanceof, one solution is to make `validate` a method of `ParentEntity` and do the validation inside `AEntity` by overriding it. However, according to the clean architecture we have separated the entities and repositories, so inside entities we do not have access to `get` method of the repository, which is required for being able to do the validation.\n\nThe workaround to this is to put a reference to IEntityRepository (or at least something like GetUseCase) inside the entity so it can do the validation itself. But, this doesn't seem a very good idea to me, especially if we assume that validation is a logic of the repository and is there only to check, e.g., what other layers give to it as parameters are valid.\n\nSo, using clean architecture biases us to using instanceof and using it is not bad in scenarios like the one I mentioned. Am I right or am I misunderstanding something?\n\n**Update:** I quote some sentences from [here](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/351662/343165), that I think are related to my point of view:\n\n> Some forms of validation are more efficient at the database layer, especially when referential integrity checks are needed (e.g. to ensure that a state code is in the list of 50 valid states).\n> \n> \n> Some forms of validation must occur in the context of a database transaction due to concurrency concerns, e.g. reserving a unique user name has to be atomic so some other user doesn't grab it while you are processing.\n> \n> \n> I have seen some developers try to codify all the validation rules in the business layer, and then have the other layers call it to extract the business rules and reconstruct the validation at a different layer. In theory this would be great because you end up with a single source of truth. But I have never, ever seen this approach do anything other than needlessly complicate the solution, and it often ends very badly.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you want to add a method to a class hierarchy without actually adding the method, consider the Visitor Pattern. You could create a validation visitor, and let each entity select the appropriate method of the visitor.\n\nFirst, your ParentEntity class hierarchy would need a bit of boilerplate to support visitors:\n\n```java\ninterface EntityVisitor<T> {\n  T visitA(AEntity a);\n  T visitB(BEntity b);\n}\n\nclass ParentEntity {\n  <T> T accept(EntityVisitor<T> v);\n}\n\nclass EntityA extends ParenEntity {\n  ...\n  @Override <T> T accept(EntityVisitor<T> v) {\n    return v.visitA(this);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nNext, we can implement and use a visitor that performs validation.\n\n```java\nclass Validation implements EntityVisitor<Void> {\n  EntityRepository repository;\n  ...\n  @Override Void visitA(AEntity a) { ... }\n  @Override Void visitB(BEntity b) { ... }\n}\n\nclass EntityRepository ... {\n  void save(List<ParentEntity> list) {\n    list.ForEach(e -> {\n      e.accept(new Validation(this));\n      ...\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe validation visitor can have access to both the entity and the repository (in order to make further queries), and will therefore be able to perform the full validation.\n\nUsing such a pattern has advantages and disadvantages compared to an instanceof check and compared to moving the validation logic into the entities.\n\n* An instanceof is a much simpler solution, especially if you only have very few entity types. However, this could silently fail if you add a new entity type. In contrast, the visitor pattern will fail to compile until the accept() method is implemented in the new entity. This safety can be valuable.\n* While this pattern ends up having the same *behaviour* as adding a validate() method to the entities, an important difference is *where* that behaviour is located and how our dependency graph looks. With a validate() method, we would have a dependency from the entities to the repository, and would have referential integrity checks intermixed with actual business logic. This defeats the point of an Onion Architecture. The visitor pattern lets us break this dependency and lets us keep the validation logic separate from other business logic. The cost of this clearer design structure is extra boilerplate in the form of the EntityVisitor interface and the accept() method that must be added to all entities in the relevant class hierarchy.\n\nWhether these trade\\-offs are worth it is your call. You know your codebase best, and you have the best idea how it might evolve.\n\n**However**, performing validation based on the result of multiple queries can lead to data integrity problems. The repository should either make sure to use database transactions (and offer an API that clearly communicates when modifications have been committed), or the relevant integrity checks should be done *within* the database, e.g. using constraints in an SQL database. In some cases, the validation checks can also be expressed as part of an insert or update query."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a clean architecture design, you need to implement entity-specific validation in a repository without using instanceof.

That is how it leads to unbiased estimates of the average treatment effect. But other assignment schemes can also systematically ensure independence of treatment from potential outcomes. So why do we need random assignment? Put another way, what is the advantage of random assignment over nonrandom assignment schemes that also lead to unbiased inference?\n\nLet $\\\\mathbf{Z}$ be a vector of treatment assignments in which each element is 0 (unit not assigned to treatment) or 1 (unit assigned to treatment). In a JASA article, [Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996, 446\\-47\\)](http://people.ucsc.edu/~cdobkin/Classes/Reza/Identification%20of%20Causal%20Effects%20Using%20Instrumental%20Variables%20%28Angrist%29.pdf) say that treatment assignment $Z\\_i$ is random if $\\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{Z} \\= \\\\mathbf{c}) \\= \\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{Z} \\= \\\\mathbf{c'})$ for all $\\\\mathbf{c}$ and $\\\\mathbf{c'}$ such that $\\\\iota^T\\\\mathbf{c} \\= \\\\iota^T\\\\mathbf{c'}$, where $\\\\iota$ is a column vector with all elements equal to 1\\.\n\nIn words, the claim is that assignment $Z\\_i$ is random if any vector of assignments that includes $m$ assignments to treatment is as likely as any other vector that includes $m$ assignments to treatment.\n\nBut, to ensure independence of potential outcomes from treatment assignment, it suffices to ensure that each unit in the study has equal probability of assignment to treatment. And that can easily occur even if most treatment assignment vectors have *zero* probability of being selected. That is, it can occur even under nonrandom assignment. \n\nHere is an example. We want to run an experiment with four units in which exactly two are treated. There are six possible assignment vectors:\n\n1. 1100\n2. 1010\n3. 1001\n4. 0110\n5. 0101\n6. 0011\n\nwhere the first digit in each number indicates whether the first unit was treated, the second digit indicates whether the second unit was treated, and so on.\n\nSuppose that we run an experiment in which we exclude the possibility of assignment vectors 3 and 4, but in which each of the other vectors has equal (25%) chance of being chosen. This scheme is not random assignment in the AIR sense. But in expectation, it leads to an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect. And that is no accident. Any assignment scheme that gives subjects equal probability of assignment to treatment will permit unbiased estimation of the ATE.\n\nSo: why do we need random assignment in the AIR sense? My argument is rooted in randomization inference; if one thinks instead in terms of model\\-based inference, does the AIR definition seem more defensible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This follows up on gung's comment. Overall average treatment effect is not the point.\n\nSuppose you have $1000$ new diabetes cases where the subject is between the ages of $5$ and $15$, and $1000$ new diabetes patients over $30$. You want to assign half to treatment. Why not flip a coin, and on heads, treat all of the young patients, and on tails, treat all of the older patients? Each would have a $50\\\\%$ chance to be selected fro treatment, so this would not bias the average result of the treatment, but it would throw away a lot of information. It would not be a surprise if juvenile diabetes or younger patients turned out to respond much better or worse than older patients with either type II or gestational diabetes. The observed treatment effect might be unbiased but, for example, it would have a much larger standard deviation than would occur through random assignment, and despite the large sample you would not be able to say much. If you use random assignment, then with high probability about $500$ cases in each age group would get the treatment, so you would be able to compare treatment with no treatment within each age group. \n\nYou may be able to do better than to use random assignment. If you notice a factor you think might affect the response to treatment, you might want to ensure that subjects with that attribute are split more evenly than would occur through random assignment. Random assignment lets you do reasonably well with all factors simultaneously, so that you can analyze many possible patterns afterwards."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a clinical trial for a new diabetes treatment, researchers have 2000 patients: 1000 between ages 5-15 and 1000 over age 30.

I suppose one could refer to information that is omitted because it is not deemed contextually relevant as being *\"contextually irrelevant\"*.\n\nThe owner of a broken car can be safely assumed to know the make and model. Same goes for someone who broke his or her phone. Maybe the person they're speaking with just can't do anything with the added information.

I suspect that 95% of applications do not require it.\n\nwhich is something I strongly disagree with. Maybe I've got the terminology wrong, but for me DI framework means just \"something wiring my objects together\". Am I missing something?\n\nI'm using [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice) even for really tiny projects (like 10 classes) in order to *simplify* them. Sure, it's a 400 kB JAR file, but this isn't what I'd care about. For a small project I hardly ever need any configuration and the only \"overhead\" is adding the `@Inject` annotation.\n\nSo I really wonder, what added complexity do DI frameworks cause?\n\n### Update addressing the answers\n\nIn a 82 class project, I have\n\n* 32 `@Inject` annotations\n* 15 `@Singleton` and 1 `@ProvidedBy` annotations\n* 4 Providers (all of which I'd need also without DI as they're my factories)\n* 1 Module containing a single line\n* 0 lines XML !!!\n\nThat's all. Sure, it's small project, but exactly this was my point. The additional work was a few *words* rather than *lines*.\n\nI'm using solely constructor injection in order to get immutable \"easygoing\" objects. Whenever a new dependency appears, I add a final field, let Lombok's [RequiredArgsConstructor](http://projectlombok.org/features/Constructor.html) take care of the declaration, and let Guice take care of calling it properly.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a couple of compromises that are to be made when using DI frameworks as far as I can see.\n\nThe most worrying for me is that your application code is usually spread between a main programming language (like Java) and XML/JSON configuration code (it **is** code). This means that in the case of problems with your application you need to look in two places. Often the configuration code is not easily related to the main application code.\n\nOf course the configuration is also outside the bounds of what the compiler (and often the IDE) can check for you, meaning that it is much easier to make mistakes in this configuration than if you were writing a main class that handled the wiring. In effect this means that wiring issues are pushed from being compile\\-time issues to being runtime issues.\n\nAs well as splitting the application, using DI Frameworks also often mean that you use `@Inject` or similar within your code, instead of traditional DI techniques (CTOR interface injection in Java/C\\+\\+, template injection in C\\+\\+). The downside of this is that you **must** then use a DI framework with the application. An alternative would be to design your application without expecting a DI framework and then allow the DI framework to re\\-use the traditional CTOR/setter injection of your classes.\n\nThe downside to the traditional injection mechanism comes when a complex and properly encapsulation classes demands a number of other relatively complex injections at CTOR time. This is usually solved by incorporating a `Builder`, but it can be a pain.\n\n**EDIT**:\n\nThe lads below have mentioned that `Guice` does not need a separate XML/JSON config.

While not all DI frameworks require XML configuration (as evidenced by the user's experience with Guice), many do use separate configuration files. This can indeed spread the application logic across multiple file types, potentially complicating debugging and maintenance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation shows that DI frameworks like Guice can be used without extensive XML configuration, even for small projects.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while @Inject annotations are used with DI frameworks, they don't necessarily eliminate the need for traditional constructor injection.

When we round $z$ to $d\\\\ge 0$ digits we are rounding the value $10^d z$ to the nearest integer and then multiplying the result by $10^{\\-d}.$ Thus we may focus on the process of rounding numbers $z$ to the nearest integer. *For this post alone,* let $\\[z]$ designate the result of rounding to an integer. (This is a conventional notation for discussions of rounding.)\n2. The nearest integers to $z$ are its floor $\\\\lfloor z \\\\rfloor$ and its ceiling $\\\\lceil z \\\\rceil,$ for which $\\\\lfloor z \\\\rfloor \\\\le z \\\\le \\\\lceil z \\\\rceil.$\n\n\t* When one of these integers is closest to $z,$ it is the rounded version of $z.$ In particular, the distance between $z$ and its rounded version cannot exceed $1/2:$ $\\|\\\\,z \\- \\[z]\\\\,\\| \\\\le 1/2\\.$\n\t* When $z$ lies equidistant from its floor and ceiling, it is an odd multiple of $1/2\\.$ Many systems \\-\\- `R` is one of them \\-\\- round to an *even* value (multiple of $2$) in those circumstances. Thus, $\\[1/2] \\= 0,$ $\\[3/2] \\= 2,$ $\\[5/2] \\= 2,$ $\\[7/2]\\=4,$ and so on. See, for instance, this `R` command and its output:\n\n\t```\n\t> round(seq(1/2, 7/2, by=1))\n\t[1] 0 2 2 4\n\n\t```\n\n**Our objective is to infer plausible values of the $a\\_i$ and $N$ from the data.** This requires us (somehow) to invert the rounding process. To that end, it is helpful to note (from the foregoing description of rounding) that\n\n* $\\|a\\_i/N \\- x\\_i\\|\\\\,10^d \\= \\|10^d (z\\_i \\- x\\_i)\\| \\\\le 1/2,$ whence $$x\\_iN \\- \\\\left(\\\\frac{10^{\\-d}}{2}\\\\right)N \\\\le a\\_i \\\\le x\\_iN \\+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{10^{\\-d}}{2}\\\\right)N.\\\\tag{\\*}$$\n* When $\\|10^d a\\_i/N \\- 10^d x\\_i\\| \\= 1/2,$ then $10^dx\\_i$ is a multiple of $2\\.$ This refines $(\\*)$ by indicating which of those inequalities are strict ones. One way to rephrase this is to consider whether $10^d x\\_i$ (which must be integral) is odd or even. When it is even, it is possible for the first inequality to be equality; when it is odd, it is possible for the second inequality to be equality.\n\n**The original question arises in circumstances where the $x\\_i$ do not sum to unity.**\n\nAs an example, consider $(a\\_1,a\\_2,a\\_3,a\\_4\\)\\=(1,1,5,9\\).$ Here $N\\=1\\+1\\+5\\+9\\=16$ and, using $d\\=3$ digits, the fractions round to $\\[1/16]\\=0\\.062,$ $\\[5/16]\\=0\\.312,$ and $\\[9/16]\\=0\\.562,$ which sum to $0\\.998 \\= 1 \\- 2\\\\times 10^{\\-d}.$ In particular, this example shows that the sum of the rounded values may differ from $1$ by as much as $n$ times the maximum rounding error of $10^{\\-d}/2\\.$\n\nIn such cases, **we would like to infer the integers $a\\_i$ so that we may recover more accurate versions of the $z\\_i$ from the data.** Note, though, that any solution $(a\\_i)$ automatically gives rise to a host of solutions of the form $(ma\\_i)$ for any multiple $m\\=1,2,3,\\\\ldots.$ There may be other solutions, too, which are not multiples of this one. How to choose among them? I propose the following, which arises from an application of Occam's Razor (viewing smaller denominators as \"simpler\"):\n\n> To solve this problem, first specify an allowable range of values for $N,$ say from $N\\_0$ to $N\\_1,$ inclusive. Among all possible solutions $(a\\_i),$ write $N\\=\\\\sum a\\_i$ and *select the solution for which $N\\_0 \\\\le N \\\\le N\\_1$ and $N$ is as small as possible.*\n\n### An Algorithm\n\nLet $N \\\\ge 1$ be any candidate for the sum of the $a\\_i.$ When it is the correct (original) value, $(\\*)$ must hold for every $x\\_i.$ This pair of inequalities defines a (possibly empty) set $\\\\mathcal{A}(x\\_i;N)$ of integers $a\\_i$ that satisfy them. Ordinarily (for $N$ sufficiently small) these sets are empty or contain just one element. It therefore is feasible and efficient to consider all tuples $(a\\_1,\\\\ldots,a\\_n)$ for which *both* $a\\_i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}(x\\_i;N)$ for all $i$ *and* $a\\_1\\+\\\\cdots\\+a\\_n\\=N.$ If rounding these $a\\_i/N$ to $d$ digits *exactly* reproduces the data $(x\\_i),$ we have a solution. Let the set of all such solutions (usually empty) be $\\\\mathcal{S}(N).$\n\nThe algorithm is now simple to describe. I will use pseudocode:\n\n```\nInput: Array x, integers N0, N1, and digit count d\nn = length(x)\nFor N from N0 to N1:\n    For each i from 1 to n:\n        Let A[i] = A(x[i],N)\n    If U (in the next step) will be too large then stop\n    Let U = A[1] X A[2] X ... X A[n] {the Cartesian product}\n    Let S = Empty collection\n    For each array a in U:\n         If sum(a) == N and round(a/N, d) == x then adjoin a to S\n Return S.\n\n```\n\nThe output is a set (usually empty or a singleton) of plausible solutions.\n\n### Comments\n\nNotice there is no test related to rounding to even values. Omitting this test will occasionally cause the search set `U` to be too large, at some cost in computation time. But since a solution is returned only when it checks out \\-\\- it must round *exactly* to the given data `x` \\-\\- the algorithm remains correct. This implies this algorithm will work regardless of what form of rounding the software platform supports, *provided it is the same form used to create the data in the first place.*\n\nWhen $N\\_0$ is not too large, most of the time the search set `U` will be very small, making the algorithm efficient. **But note the risk:** when many of the $x\\_i$ have more than one candidate for $a\\_i,$ the size of $U$ explodes. With $n\\=60$ data values and just two candidates per value, for instance, $U$ has $2^{60}$ elements. That's why we need to check the size of $U$ before going on. Limiting the upper search limit $N\\_1$ to a sufficiently small value avoids this problem. If you cannot find any solutions, then increase $N\\_1$ and try again.\n\nIf the number of digits used for the original rounding was crude \\-\\- that is, it loses a lot of precision \\-\\- then this method will usually return a solution with a smaller value of $N$ than the original. But when $d$ is reasonably large; say, when $10^{\\-d}N \\\\approx 1$ (or less), then it will almost always return the original value of $N.$ The notable exceptions are when the greatest common divisor of the $a\\_i$ is greater than $1,$ for then there is no way to distinguish the original $a\\_i$ from $a\\_i/\\\\operatorname{gcd}(a),$ no matter how precise the rounding might be.\n\n### Examples and Code\n\nThe question asks about datasets of $60$ or fewer numbers and intimates they are rounded to $\\\\pm0\\.05\\\\%,$ which is $d\\=3$ decimal digits. That rounding precision would be unsuitable for numbers of three or more digits. Let us, then, create a dataset of integers $z\\_i$ between $0$ and $999$ (perhaps favoring the smaller ones, since rounding them can create more relative imprecision), round them to form the $x\\_i,$ and see what solution(s) this algorithm produces.\n\nThe dataset processed in this example is $(a\\_i) \\= (1,2,4,5,6,\\\\ldots, 206,238\\),$ whose sum is $N\\=4490\\.$ I conducted the search starting at $N\\_0\\=1$ (and limiting it, if needed, to $2\\\\times 10^d,$ which should be more than enough).

I have 15 predictors, one of which is categorical(will that cause a problem?). After setting my $x$ and $y$ I use the following commands:\n\n```r\nmodel = lars(x, y)\ncoef(model)\n\n```\n\nMy problem is when I use `coef(model)`. This returns a matrix with 15 rows, with one extra predictor added each time. However there is no suggestion as to which model to choose. Have I missed something? Is there a way I can get the lars package to return just one \"*best*\" model?\n\nThere are other posts suggesting using `glmnet` instead but this seems more complicated. An attempt is as follows, using the same $x$ and $y$. Have I missed something here?: \n\n```r\ncv = cv.glmnet(x, y)\nmodel = glmnet(x, y, type.gaussian=\"covariance\", lambda=cv$lambda.min)\npredict(model, type=\"coefficients\")\n\n```\n\nThe final command returns a list of my variables, the majority with a coefficient although some are \\=0\\. Is this the correct choice of the \"*best*\" model selected by LASSO? If I then fit a linear model with all my variables which had coefficients `not=0` I get very similar, but slightly different, coefficient estimates. Is there a reason for this difference? Would it be acceptable to refit the linear model with these variables chosen by LASSO and take that as my final model? Otherwise I cannot see any p\\-values for significance. Have I missed anything? \n\nDoes \n\n```\ntype.gaussian=\"covariance\" \n\n```\n\nensure that that `glmnet` uses multiple linear regression?\n\nDoes the automatic normalisation of the variables affect the coefficients at all? Is there any way to include interaction terms in a LASSO procedure?\n\nI am looking to use this procedure more as a demonstration of how LASSO can be used than for any model that will actually be used for any important inference/prediction if that changes anything.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. Any general comments on LASSO/lars/glmnet would also be greatly appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Using `glmnet` is really easy once you get the grasp of it thanks to its excellent vignette in [http://web.stanford.edu/\\~hastie/glmnet/glmnet\\_alpha.html](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html) (you can also check the CRAN package page).\nAs for the best lambda for `glmnet`, the rule of thumb is to use \n\n```\ncvfit <- glmnet::cv.glmnet(x, y)\ncoef(cvfit, s = \"lambda.1se\")\n\n```\n\ninstead of `lambda.min`.\n\nTo do the same for `lars` you have to do it by hand. Here is my solution\n\n```\ncv <- lars::cv.lars(x, y, plot.it = FALSE, mode = \"step\")\nidx <- which.max(cv$cv - cv$cv.error <= min(cv$cv))\ncoef(lars::lars(x, y))[idx,]\n\n```\n\nBear in mind that this is not exactly the same, because this is stopping at a lasso knot (when a variable enters) instead of at any point.\n\nPlease note that `glmnet` is the preferred package now, it is actively maintained, more so than `lars`, and that there have been questions about `glmnet` vs `lars` answered before (algorithms used differ).\n\nAs for your question of using lasso to choose variables and then fit OLS, it is an ongoing debate. Google for OLS post Lasso and there are some papers discussing the topic. Even the authors of Elements of Statistical Learning admit it is possible. \n\n**Edit**: Here is the code to reproduce more accurately what `glmnet` does in `lars`\n\n```\n  cv <- lars::cv.lars(x, y, plot.it = FALSE)\n  ideal_l1_ratio <- cv$index[which.max(cv$cv - cv$cv.error <= min(cv$cv))]\n  obj <- lars::lars(x, y)\n  scaled_coefs <- scale(obj$beta, FALSE, 1 / obj$normx)\n  l1 <- apply(X = scaled_coefs, MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(x) sum(abs(x)))\n  coef(obj)[which.max(l1 / tail(l1, 1) > ideal_l1_ratio),]\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When using LASSO for variable selection in R, which of the following approaches is recommended for selecting the optimal lambda value in the glmnet package?\n\nA) Use lambda.min from cv.glmnet() \nB) Use lambda.1se from cv.glmnet()\nC) Manually calculate lambda using the lars package\nD) Always use a fixed lambda value of 0.01\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation suggests that using lambda.1se from cv.glmnet() is the recommended \"rule of thumb\" for selecting the optimal lambda value in glmnet.

This makes \u201cpreposition\u201d a misnomer for the category (since \u201chere\u201d is not proposed to anything), but the [*Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* uses *preposition* as the label for the set of location\\-describing words](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/547159/why-does-cgel-call-home-abroad-here-and-there-prepositions-instead-of) that encompasses traditional prepositions despite the mismatch with the term\u2019s etymology.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain why languages make the language\\-specific categorizations and generalizations that they do. You can say that it is because of analogies between words with similar meanings, but clearly the same analogies have not applied in all languages.\n\nThere are similarities in behavior between prepositional phrases (in the CGEL sense) and adjective phrases, but also differences. Both can be used as predicates or to modify nominal phrases. But prepositional phrases generally cannot be placed in the pre\\-nominal attributive position: we can say *the blue house* but not *\\*the here house*.

But were we able to reduce it to zero? Is there any residual friction?\n\nThis question is about only the friction between the wheel and the road. I understand that there will be friction in other places, e.g. between the wheel and axle or between the vehicle and the atmosphere.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As many others point out, there *is* friction present, otherwise the wheel wouldn't grap the surface and pull the car forward. But you are talking about a different kind of friction. There is a possibility of different kinds of friction:\n\n* [**Kinetic friction**](https://www.allthatmatters.academy/courses/forces-3/lessons/kinetic-friction/), if the wheel ever slides and skids over the asphalt. This is friction between objects that slide over one another.\n* [**Static friction**](https://www.allthatmatters.academy/courses/forces-3/lessons/static-friction/), which is what the other answers talk about. This is friction that holds something still. It always works in the direction that prevents two objects from sliding. The point on the wheel that touches the ground experiences static friction, because it is *standing still* in that very negligibly small moment.\n\nBut\n\n* **rolling friction** is what you are refering to. Ideally there is no kinetic friction, and static friction only grabs the asphalt and doesn't reduce the speed (on horizontal surface and without wheel torque). All other forces that *do* work against the wheel rotation (except friction around the axle, as you also point out) are collectively called *rolling friction*.\n\nRolling friction happens of several different reasons. For example,\n\n* the rubber tires contract and expand and thus dissipate energy. The energy is taken from the rotation, and this factor counts as rolling friction. Also\n* the ground underneath might deform. The deformation costs energy and will as well cause a surface with normal forces that do *not* act radially (towards the wheel's center) anymore. Such forces will cause torques that might counteract the rotation. See the following picture from [this source](http://www.phy.davidson.edu/fachome/dmb/PY430/Friction/rolling.html):\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/56VPt.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/56VPt.gif)\n\nWithout rolling friction (in an ideal world), the car will continue to roll and never stop. I believe this is the actual question that you have. Because you are right that in this sense, friction *counteracting the motion* **has** been eliminated as you describe."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between wheel invention and friction reduction?\n\nA) The invention of the wheel completely eliminated all forms of friction between the wheel and the road.\n\nB) The wheel reduced kinetic friction to zero but introduced rolling friction as a new form of resistance.\n\nC) The wheel eliminated sliding friction but static friction remains necessary for the wheel to function properly.\n\nD) The wheel reduced friction to zero between the wheel and the road, but friction still exists in other parts of the vehicle.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The invention of the wheel significantly reduced kinetic friction (sliding friction) between the moving object and the ground. However, it introduced a new form of friction called rolling friction. Rolling friction is much less than kinetic friction, which is why wheels are so effective, but it's not zero. \n\nStatic friction is still present and necessary at the point where the wheel contacts the ground, allowing the wheel to grip the surface and move the vehicle forward. Kinetic friction is ideally eliminated in normal wheel operation (occurring only during skidding). \n\nRolling friction arises from factors such as deformation of the tire and the road surface, and while much lower than sliding friction, it's not zero. This is why vehicles eventually come to a stop on a flat surface if no additional force is applied.\n\nOption A is incorrect because friction isn't completely eliminated. Option C is partially correct but doesn't address rolling friction. Option D is incorrect because it wrongly states that friction between the wheel and road is reduced to zero."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/08/25", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/1109112", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/981518/"], "docs_id": 1109112, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've set up an AWS Client VPN to remotely connect to a VPC within my AWS network.\n\nUsing this VPN, I am able to initiate remote TCP connections from my PC to an EC2 instance.\n\nI also have a scenario when I want to connect in the reverse direction....EC2 instance to PC.

This means that the masses involved in momentum exchanges are orders of magnitude larger than the mass of an electron, and because of this practically no energy is transferred to the lattice. ( similar to a ball bouncing off a wall). \n\nBecause of the large mass of the lattice, the center of mass \"photon \\+ lattice\" and the laboratory \"lattice at rest\" coincide within measurement errors. Thus the geometry of the lattice acts as a simple boundary condition to the quantum mechanical problem;it defines the effective potential well whose solutions give the wavefunctions.

There are many ways to generalize the notion of a topology, e.g. \n\n(i) preclosure spaces (with a closure operator that is not necessarily idempotent) or equivalently\n\n(i') neighborhood system spaces (a neighborhood of a point need not contain an \"open neighborhood\" of that point) and more generally\n\n(ii) filter convergence spaces or certain net convergence spaces (e.g. Fr\u00e9chet $L$\\-spaces) satisfying some convergence axioms. \n\nThe notion of convergence spaces is strong enough to be able to speak of continuity of maps (defined by preservation of convergence). If $X$ is a convergence space then one can form the set $C(X)$ of continuous real\\-valued functions $f : X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ (where $\\\\mathbb{R}$ is equipped with the convergence structure coming from its usual topology). In this way, one can at least relate such spaces to measure theory by creating the Baire $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra $Ba(X)$ on $X$ generated by $C(X)$.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Are there other known ways to connect such generalized topological structures to measure theory and probability theory on such spaces that are of interest in practice? I especially may think here of applications in functional analysis where [Beattie and Butzmann](https://books.google.de/books?id=OdwXRK-i9YgC&redir_esc=y) argue that convergence structures are more convenient than topologies (at least from a category theoretic point of view). As a standard example, the notion of almost everywhere convergence is not topological.\n2. Are there some practical applications in working with such Baire $\\\\sigma$\\-algebras in non\\-topological preclosure or convergence spaces? Even for topological spaces, the Baire $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra and the Borel $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra need not coincide. (I think they do coincide if $\\\\tau$ is perfectly normal).\n3. Is the following only a trivial idea or does it lead to interesting properties: To any convergence space one can assign a topological space (the reflection of the convergence space, see [ncatlab](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/convergence+space)) and thus speak of the \"associated Borel\" $\\\\sigma$\\-algebra for a convergence space.\n\nI also understand that measure theory on general topological spaces can be rather boring. Only for special topological spaces like Polish spaces or Radon spaces we may have interesting measure\\-theoretic results.

(I strongly recommend never to do this outside of debugging and to let the metatable work as close to a normal tableas possible, otherwise you get all kinds of weird behavior.)\n\nSo, in order to detect changes to the global `debug` through metamethods, you have to delete the `debug` table. You can virtually put it back though the `__index` metamethod. Then you can use `__newindex` to detect attempts create a new global `debug` in which case you can print a warning, using the original debug table to get information about the responsible Lua function. In isn't that helpful though if it was reset e.g. in `\\directlua`, but you can use LuaTeX's status table to additionally provide the current TeX file and line.\n\nOf yourse you have to do this before loading anything which might be responsble, do it's best to put it even before `\\documentclass`:\n\n```\n\\directlua{\n  local debug = debug\n  local traceback, getinfo = debug.traceback, debug.getinfo\n  _G.debug = nil\n  setmetatable(_G, {\n    __index = {debug = debug},\n    __newindex = function(t, k, v)\n      if k == \"debug\" then\n        local guilty = getinfo(2)\n        texio.write_nl(\"We found the naughty party: \" ..

But AFCI isn't a bad thing. Others here (with more knowledge than me) favor using GFCI breakers in panels rather than GFCI outlets, the reasoning is they are protected from the weather, by being installed in a panel and last a lot longer.\n\nOK, that aside said, moving on: At the box where the old water heater was, run 12/2 from there to your outdoor outlets. Use high quality outlets, not $.79 cheapies.\nYou'll install the white wire that is now the neutral to the GFCI breaker (assuming you go that route), and the white pig\\-tail from the breaker to the neutral bus bar. If you choose to use a GFCI outlet \"first in line\" for your outdoor outlets, you'll need to move the white wire that was formally connected to the water heater breaker to the neutral bus bar.

Then let's assume they follow the [\"Salpeter birth mass function\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_mass_function) so that $n(M) \\\\propto M^{\\-2\\.3}$ (where $M$ is in solar masses) for $M\\>0\\.1$ to much larger masses. There are more complicated mass function known now \\- Kroupa multiple power laws, Chabrier lognormal, which say there are fewer low mass stars than predicted by Salpeter, but they don't change the gist of the argument. \nUsing the total number of stars in the Galaxy, we equate to the integral of $N(M)$ to get the constant of proportionality: thus \n$$n(M) \\= 1\\.3\\\\times10^{10} M^{\\-2\\.3}.$$\n\nNow let's assume most stars are on the main sequence and that the luminosity scales roughly as $L \\= M^{3\\.5}$ ($L$ is also in solar units), thus $dL/dM \\= 3\\.5 M^{2\\.5}$.\n\nWe now say $n(L) \\= n(M)\\\\times dM/dL$ and obtain\n$$ n(L) \\= 3\\.7\\\\times10^{9} M^{\\-4\\.8} \\= 3\\.7\\\\times10^{9} L^{\\-1\\.37}.$$\n\nThe total luminosity of a collection of star between two luminosity intervals is\n$$ L\\_{\\\\rm galaxy} \\= \\\\int^{L\\_2}\\_{L\\_1} n(L) L \\\\ dL \\= 5\\.9\\\\times 10^{9} \\\\left\\[L^{0\\.63} \\\\right]^{L\\_{2}}\\_{L\\_1}$$\nThis equation shows that although there are far more low\\-mass stars than high mass stars in the Galaxy, it is the higher mass stars that dominate the luminosity.\n\nIf we take $L\\_1\\=0\\.1^{3\\.5}$ we can ask what is the upper limit $L\\_2$ that gives $L\\_{\\\\rm galaxy} \\= 1\\.3\\\\times 10^{10} L\\_{\\\\odot}$ ($\\=5\\\\times10^{36}$ W)?\n\nThe answer is only $3\\.5L\\_{\\\\odot}$. But we see *many* stars in the Galaxy that are way brighter than this, so surely the Galaxy ought to be *much* brighter?\n\nThe flaw in the above chain of reasoning is that the Salpeter mass function represents the *birth* mass function, and *not* the present\\-day mass function.\nMost of the stars present in the Galaxy were born about 10\\-12 billion years ago.\nThe lifetime of a star on the main sequence is roughly $10^{10} M/L \\= 10^{10} M^{\\-2\\.5}$ years. So most of the high mass stars in the calculation I did above have vanished long ago, so the mass function effectively begins to be truncated above about $0\\.9M\\_{\\\\odot}$. But that also then means that because the luminosity is dominated by the most luminous stars, the luminosity of the galaxy is effectively the number of $\\\\sim 1M\\_{\\\\odot}$ stars times a solar luminosity.\n\nMy Salpeter mass function above coincidentally does give that there are $\\\\sim 10^{10}$ star with $M\\>1M\\_{\\\\odot}$ in the Galaxy. However you should think of this as there *have been* $\\\\sim 10^{10}$ stars with $M\\>1 M\\_{\\\\odot}$ born in our Galaxy. A large fraction of these are not around today, and that is actually the lesson one learns from the integrated luminosity number you quote!\n\nEDIT: A postscript on some of the assumptions made. The Galaxy is much more complicated than this. \"Most of the stars present in the Galaxy were born 10\\-12 billion years go\". This is probably not quite correct, depending on where you look. The bulge of the Galaxy contains about 50 billion stars and was created in the first billion years or so. The halo also formed early and quickly, but probably only contains a few percent of the stellar mass. The moderately metal\\-poor thick disk contains perhaps another 10\\-20% and was formed in the first few billion years. The rest (50%) of the mass is in the disk and was formed quasi\\-continuously over abut 8\\-10 billion years. (Source \\- [Wyse (2009\\)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.0415v1.pdf)). None of this detail alters the main argument, but lowers the fraction of $\\>1M\\_{\\\\odot}$ stars that have been born but already died.\n\nA second point though is assuming that the luminosity of the Galaxy is dominated by main sequence stars. This is only true at ultraviolet and blue wavelengths. At red and infrared wavelengths evolved red giants are dominant. The way this alters the argument is that some fraction of the \"dead\" massive stars are actually red giants which typically survive for only a few percent of their main sequence lifetime, but are orders of magnitude more luminous during this period. This means the contribution of of the typical low\\-mass main sequence stars that dominate the stellar numbers is even *less significant* than the calculation above suggests."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A galaxy is observed to have a total luminosity of 5 \u00d7 10^36 Watts.

While the Salpeter initial mass function predicts a large number of high-mass stars at the galaxy's formation, these stars have short lifespans and have mostly disappeared over the galaxy's lifetime. The luminosity is now dominated by stars with masses close to 1 solar mass, as these are the most massive stars that can still exist on the main sequence after billions of years. This results in a total galactic luminosity that is effectively the number of solar-mass stars times the solar luminosity, explaining the observed value.

You can similarly do the same thing for the other stData2, stData3, stData4 fields. So please try the code below:\n\n```\nString uid = FirebaseAuth.getInstance().getCurrentUser().getUid();\nDatabaseReference rootRef = FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().getReference();\nDatabaseReference entryIncomeRef = rootRef.child(\"Data\").child(uid).child(\"Entry_Income\");\n    entryIncomeRef.get().addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<DataSnapshot>() {\n    @Override\n    public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<DataSnapshot> task) {\n        if (task.isSuccessful()) {\n            for (DataSnapshot titleSnapshot : task.getResult().getChildren()) {\n                for (DataSnapshot categorySnapshot : titleSnapshot.getChildren()) {\n                    category cat = categorySnapshot.getValue(category.class);\n                    Log.d(TAG, cat.getStData1());\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            Log.d(TAG, task.getException().getMessage()); //Don't ignore potential errors!\n        }\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\nThe key for solving this issue is to loop through the \"DataSnapshot\" object twice, using a call to \".getChildren()\" method. However, this solution will **only** work if you create your own adapter. It won't work with the \"FirebaseRecyclerAdapter\". If you need to use the Firebase\\-UI library, then I recommend you duplicate the data by adding all \"bbbb\" children into a single node. This practice is called \"denormalization\" and it's a common practice when it comes to Firebase. For a better understanding, I recommend you see this video, [Denormalization is normal with the Firebase Database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKqXSZLLnHA).\n\nThat being said, create a new reference to the newly created node, and pass that object to the FirebaseRecyclerOptions.Builder's \"setQuery()\" method.

Denormalizing the data (duplicating it in a flattened structure) allows for easier querying and better performance with Firebase-UI tools like FirebaseRecyclerAdapter. This method is often used in Firebase applications to optimize data retrieval and display.\n\nD) Applying multiple separate listeners would be overly complicated and could lead to synchronization issues between different levels of data.\n\nThe correct answer (C) combines best practices for Firebase data structuring (denormalization) with the efficient use of Firebase-UI tools, making it the most suitable approach for the given scenario."}, "49": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/11/19", "source": ["https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/401282", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com", "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/351263/"], "docs_id": 401282, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When you are done with programming, you may have used many libraries that you maybe had to buy, different software and tools and then when your run your programm, your programm compiles and calls constructs from different libraries and everything works fine, but when we are done and want to sell our software we are selling our Machinecode right? will we also have to provide the machine code of the libraries that we have bought etc. in other words how is Programm made executable on other peoples machines how do we know what they need besides OS to run our programm?\n\nLets take a game for example many tools and software are used and all we have to do as user is to install it and run it what kind of magic happens behind installation ?\n\nI am always writing and running small Programms in an IDE and to run it I always need this IDE but how is it that customers only need the OS and none of the tools that develepors are using?\n\nCan someone please paint the picture using simple words?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Will we also have to provide the machine code of the libraries that we have bought etc.?\n\nYes, but we usually obtain a permissive license that allows us to redistribute that code with our own programs.\n\n> How do we know what they need besides OS to run our program?\n\nNowadays, we use Package Managers like Nuget, which allow us track our software dependencies and keep them up to date with the latest versions of each library.\n\n> I am always writing and running small Programms in an IDE and to run it I always need this IDE\n\nYou don't.

As far as I see, \"tax returns\" are actually *tax declarations*, i.e. a set of documents filed by e.g. an individual and sent to the government's financial authorities to declare his/her income, so that the government can decide on this individual's income tax. If this is correct, why is this called a \"return\"? Nothing gets returned here. A document gets handed out. There is even not money to be returned, rather there will be money to be paid. (Exception: German employees, on filing their tax declaration often get back parts of taxes paid on their behalf by the employer because employers are obliged to send part of the monthly salary directly to the financial authorities, and depending on circumstances, employees can get back overpaid taxes by the end of the year. This, I would say, is indeed literally a *tax return*.)\n\n2\\) Usage\n\nClearly \"tax return\" is in use in the USA.

This usage dates back to at least 1618, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. While it may seem counterintuitive, especially when compared to terms like \"tax declaration,\" it accurately reflects the nature of the document as a response to government requirements.
