I wanted to add blown in insulation.\n\nMy attic space is a bit unique. I'm used to a moderate sized attic that you can access. This attic has no access. There might be 1 \\- 2 feet of space between the ceiling and roof decking.\n\nThe one space I have to access any part of the attic is around the chimney. It isn't boarded up and I can shimmy straight up the side of the chimney to the attic. That's how I know it's only about 1 \\- 2ft of attic space.\n\nI've read about standard insulation installation techniques such as: Not to push the insulation up against the decking or moisture will develop. Proper roof ventilation to avoid moisture build up.\n\nThere are no attic vents on the side. No soffit, no soffit vents. The decking just comes straight off the house. The only ventilation is a ridge vent.\n\nI was going to cut into the ceiling and blow insulation in until the entire space was filled.\n\nI'm afraid of trapping moisture, rotting the decking and creating a breeding ground for mold.\n\nWith a roof/attic system like mine, is it OK to just fill the attic with insulation or am I stuck at certain level of insulation? How much space must be between the decking and insulation?\n\n[![roof](https://i.stack.imgur.com/byaiG.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/byaiG.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Based on your picture and your description, you have what is known as a *cathedral ceiling.* The \"1\\-2 feet of space\" you mention leads me to believe that it's built with parallel chord trusses rather than solid rafters. Can you post a picture? Regardless, like most cathedral ceilings, yours seems to be insulated insufficiently and built incorrectly (ridge vents but no soffits vents? WTF?).\n\nRight now your cathedral ceiling is semi\\-ventilated. If there is a way to add soffit vents, they should be added so that the ridge vent can actually do its job. This will increase the durability of the assembly substantially if you live in a non\\-desert climate. If you take this approach and build a fully\\-vented cathedral ceiling, you cannot fill up the extra space that you see with more insulation; the ventilation gap is critically important. How high the gap must be depends on the steepness of the roof. A very steep roof might be able to get away with a gap of only a few inches under the roof sheathing. It sounds like your roof has a shallower pitch, so 1\\-2 feet may be necessary.\n\nThe only safe and practical way to increase the insulation of your ceiling is to transform it into an un\\-ventilated ceiling. **Step one** is to remove the ridge vent. **Step two** is to either apply spray foam (open or closed cell; minimum 3\" for closed cell or 6\" for open cell) under the roof sheathing, or else remove the roofing material and then apply rigid foam insulation boards over the sheathing, usually 4\"\\+ of polyiso. **Step three** is to fill the entire cavity under the foam or sheathing with as much as you want of whatever you want. Go wild stuffing as much insulation in there as you want. **Step four** is to make your ceiling as airtight as possible. Remove all can lights or replace them with LED models that have an airtight fixture, and caulk everything. You don't want inside air getting into your now\\-unvented roof.\n\nThe spray foam approach is likely to be more expensive, especially considering the access problems you mentioned, but does not require a re\\-roof; the rigid foam approach is better for the environment, will give you an ultimately higher level of insulation, and may be cheaper, but doesn't make sense if your roofing material is in perfect shape."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner has a cathedral ceiling with 1-2 feet of space between the ceiling and roof decking, insulated with pink fiberglass batts. The roof has only a ridge vent for ventilation. The homeowner wants to improve insulation but is concerned about moisture issues. What is the best approach to safely increase insulation while addressing moisture concerns?\n\nA) Fill the entire space with blown-in insulation\nB) Add soffit vents and maintain a ventilation gap below the roof sheathing\nC) Remove the ridge vent and apply spray foam insulation under the roof sheathing\nD) Install additional fiberglass batts on top of the existing insulation\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because filling the entire space without addressing ventilation would likely lead to moisture problems.\nB) is not feasible in this situation as there are no soffit vents and adding them wasn't mentioned as an option.\nC) is the correct answer as it transforms the ceiling into an unvented assembly, allowing for increased insulation without risking moisture issues. Removing the ridge vent and applying spray foam (at least 3\" for closed cell or 6\" for open cell) creates a moisture barrier and allows the cavity to be filled with additional insulation safely.\nD) is incorrect as it doesn't address the ventilation issues and could exacerbate moisture problems."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/04/30", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/272871", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/76058/"], "docs_id": 272871, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Magento 2 Form Builder\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI am looking for a powerful and easy\\-to\\-use Magento 2 Form Builder extension, could anyone here recommend me some extensions?\n\nThank you and I'm looking forward to hearing from you!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You need to pass something like below in your email.html file.\n\n```\n<td>\n   {{layout handle=\"product_stock_alert_items\"}}\n</td>\n\n```\n\nCreate layout file as product\\_stock\\_alert\\_items.xml in layout folder.

But let's imagine a hypothetical skydiver falling through empty space. In this case, there is no difference at all between the person in the free\\-falling shuttle and the skydiver in free fall outside the shuttle.\n\nAt first, I wasn't entirely clear about what you meant by\n\n> but you can't 'push' yourself up like you can while in a free\\-falling reference frame (like the shuttle)\n\nbut based on what has come up in the comments, I think this explanation would help: when you throw a ball downwards as you're falling, you move up *relative to how you would have been moving otherwise*. This holds true whether you're in an enclosed environment or not.\n\nThe reason it may *seem* different is that, if you're in a shuttle, when you throw the ball, your motion changes, but the shuttle's doesn't. The shuttle gives you a convenient reference for how your motion would continue if you hadn't thrown the ball. So you now observe a relative motion between yourself and the shuttle, whereas before the throw there was none, and it's obvious that your motion has changed.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's not necessary for the environment to be enclosed in order for this to work. If, instead of a shuttle, you had a friend skydiving next to you, and you threw a ball down, you would notice yourself moving up relative to your friend.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't have a shuttle or a friend or anything else falling along with you, there's no other object to serve as a reference for how your motion would have continued. So when you throw the ball down, as a human, it's difficult to notice that your motion has changed. There's no switch from \"not moving with respect to X\" to \"moving with respect to X.\" Instead, the only convenient object which you have to measure your motion against is the Earth, and you merely change from \"falling toward Earth\" to \"falling slightly slower toward Earth.\"\n\nBear in mind that the actual change in your motion is the same as in the other cases, where you had a friend or a shuttle or something falling with you. If you had measured your motion relative to the Earth, instead of relative to the shuttle or friend, then you would see the same effect: you would change from \"falling toward Earth\" to \"falling slightly slower toward Earth.\" It's just that the limitations of human senses make it hard to detect the difference between those two motions; it's much easier to detect when you start moving relative to something you were previously at rest with respect to."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A skydiver jumps from a plane in empty space (no air resistance) and throws a ball downward.

When the skydiver throws the ball downward, they will move upward relative to how they would have been moving otherwise. This is true whether in an enclosed environment or open space.\n\nC is incorrect. The skydiver's motion will change regardless of whether there's another object falling with them. The presence of another object just makes it easier to perceive the change in motion.\n\nD is incorrect. There's no actual force pushing the skydiver upward. The change in motion is due to the transfer of momentum, not an applied force.\n\nThe key concept here is that the change in motion occurs regardless of the environment, but it may be harder to perceive without a reference point like a shuttle or companion skydiver.

Do we need a position control system for the Dyson Sphere to keep its origin always aligned with the center of the star? Will it stay aligned itself and automatically neutralize small perturbational forces? Or will a small perturbation remove it out of the orbit of the star, so that it will be eventually destroyed and swallowed by the star?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Do we need a position control system for the Dyson Sphere to keep its origin always aligned with the center of the star?\n\nThe important principle for this question is spherical symmetry with the application of Gauss's law. For a electrically charged sphere the charges are accumulated on the surface, leading to the situation where the field is effectively zero everywhere within that sphere. Mathematically a Dyson sphere is equivalent to that. Of course, the field within the Dyson sphere wouldn't be zero because of the sun, but the contribution from the Dyson sphere sphere structure itself *could* be zero. I say \"could\" because this assumes the matter is perfectly distributed.\n\nSuch a system is neither stable or unstable. It's just balanced.\n\n> its origin\n\nIf the perfect symmetry is satisfied (and the neighborhood is clear, more on that later), the location of the star within the sphere is irrelevant to its stability actually. The system would be just as stable with the star close to the edge as it would be exactly at the Dyson sphere's center.\n\nIf the matter was anything less than perfectly spherical it would be categorically unstable, not just balanced. I believe this is the same sort of consequence as Earnshaw's theorem. Any arrangement of matter won't create an inherently stable point in empty space where the field's divergence is zero.\n\nFor purposes of science fiction, I would say the answer is \"yes\", active stabilization of some form would be needed. Even if you assume perfect symmetry, there are ways other objects in the solar system would cause the sphere and the star to crash into each other in the absence of active controls. I will have to break this down into two cases:\n\nFactors apply even if the sun is at the origin:\n\n* the radiation in our part of the galaxy isn't isotropic, so it would push the sphere to hit the star eventually\n* gravitational waves can act non\\-uniformly, and this can lead to other modes of instability (next list) to drive them to hit eventually\n\nFactors that apply if the sun it slightly displaced from the origin:\n\n* if the sun wasn't dead center, tidal forces from other astronomical bodies would accelerate it toward the side\n* if the Dyson Sphere was non\\-uniform and the sun was not at the CM, it would be accelerating, and that would be unstable acceleration\n\nHowever, if we are assuming an advanced civilization built the Dyson sphere, it shouldn't be a difficult task to use controlled reflected radiation from the sun itself to keep it in the center.

However, external factors would likely necessitate an active control system for long-term stability.\n\nD) The star's position within the Dyson sphere is irrelevant to the system's stability, as long as it remains inside the sphere.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While perfect spherical symmetry would create a balanced system (neither inherently stable nor unstable), real-world factors such as non-uniform radiation, gravitational waves, and influences from other astronomical bodies would likely cause instabilities over time. These factors would necessitate an active control system to maintain the Dyson sphere's position relative to the star for long-term stability.

(The question mentions Rules, but I believe those only act on incoming mail.)\n\n### A. Enter an address into the Bcc text box at the top of the mail message\n\nIf necessary, use the context menu (shown below) to make the Bcc text box visible, and type an address into it.\n\nDisadvantage here: the text box is empty every time you start a new message.\n\n![Mail.app Bcc text box](https://i.stack.imgur.com/173lt.png)\n\n### B. Turn on the \"Automatically Bcc: myself\" setting\n\nThis setting is at Mail \\> Preferences \\> Composing \\> \"Automatically Bcc myself\".\n\n![Mail.app Composing preferences](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yk5hs.png)\n\nDisadvantage here: you can only Bcc your own address this way.\n\nThere is a workaround to this, though. Turn on \"Automatically Bcc myself\", and set up a Rule (in Mail \\> Preferences \\> Rules) to forward all incoming messages from yourself (here, mark@example.com) to the other person (sam@example.com). This will clog up your inbox with these copies of your sent mail, but you could also set the rule to delete them after performing the forwarding.\n\nHowever! This workaround seems a little flakey to me: eg, if I understand correctly, if you happen to email yourself (say, send yourself a reminder from your iPhone), then that message will be sent to the other person and then deleted. So I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n### C. Set a Bcc value in Mail.app's defaults (hidden preference settings)\n\nThere is a hidden preference setting which causes Mail.app to automatically add a Bcc address to all outgoing mail. This can be any address, not just your own. But! This setting can be quite confusing, for two reasons (at least: there may also be other subtleties here that I'm not aware of):\n\n* The automatically added address isn't visible in the Bcc text box.\n* The automatically added address overwrites anything you put into the Bcc text box (apparently: I haven't tested this detail).\n\nIf you want to try this, follow these instructions:\n\n1. Quit Mail.app\n2. Open Terminal.app (this is in /Applications/Utilities)\n3. Type the following. This creates a backup copy of Mail's preferences file (before we start meddling with it) on your Desktop.\n\n```\n cp ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist ~/Desktop/\n\n```\n\nThe location of this file changed in 10\\.7, I think \\- if you are using an older OS, you'll need to use `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist` (I believe) instead.\n4. Now add the preference setting by typing the following. Substitute the address you actually want to use, but be sure to type the rest exactly as shown.\n\n```\n defaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{\"Bcc\" = \"sam@example.com\";}'\n\n```\n\n(Note: I found this defaults setting in a hint [here](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20020904062730654)).\n5. Start Mail.app and test.\n\nHere are some other commands that might be useful:\n\n* View the current setting:\n\n```\n  defaults read com.apple.mail UserHeaders\n\n```\n* Remove the setting (be very careful to type this one exactly as shown):\n\n```\n  defaults delete com.apple.mail UserHeaders\n\n```\n* Put the backup file you created earlier back into place, undoing any changes:\n\n```\n  cp ~/Desktop/com.apple.mail.plist ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to automatically add a Bcc (Blind carbon copy) recipient to all outgoing emails in Mail.app on macOS, but you don't want the recipient to be visible in the Bcc field when composing messages.

When a device with a private IP address (like 192.168.1.10) attempts to communicate with a server on the public internet, NAT translates the private IP to a public IP address assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). This process, often called Port Address Translation (PAT) in home router scenarios, allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address. When the remote server responds, the NAT device translates the incoming packets back to the appropriate private IP address. This mechanism enables devices with private IP addresses to communicate with the public internet while conserving public IP addresses and providing a level of security by hiding the internal network structure."}, "18": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/04/14", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12063", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/2636/"], "docs_id": 12063, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Okay, there's a lot of smart Mac guys here, so lets see if any of you can figure out this stumper.\n\nOur Xserve G4 (RackMac1,1\\) went incommunicado a few years ago was left in this state until I pulled it out yesterday.

After creating an ISO image and trying to boot the VM, they receive the error \"Reboot and Select proper device or Insert Boot Media in Selected Boot device\". What is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) The ISO image was created incorrectly using Folder2Iso software\nB) WinZip is set as the default program for ISO files on the host machine\nC) The VM is not configured to boot from the virtual CD/DVD drive\nD) The ISO image is not bootable or does not contain the necessary boot files\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The error message indicates that the VM cannot find a bootable device. While options A, B, and C could potentially cause issues, the most likely cause is that the ISO image created from the folder is not bootable or doesn't contain the necessary boot files. Creating an ISO from a folder of installation files doesn't automatically make it bootable. The administrator needs to ensure they create a proper bootable ISO image that includes all the required boot files for Windows 2003 installation.

[Running Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Guide:Running_Mono_Applications)\n\nFrom the Mono Project on using binfmt:\n\n**Registering .exe as non\\-native binaries (Linux only)**\n\nBecause this is a Linux\\-specific feature, we do not recommend that developers deploy this solution, as it would limit the portability of their scripts.\n\nIn addition, this mechanism does not work as intended by the [Application Deployment Guidelines](http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Deployment).\n\nYou can also make a systemwide change, and use binfmt to register the exe files as non\\-native binaries. Then, when trying to launch an exe file, the kernel will run the mono interpreter to handle the command. Binfmt can also be used to launch Windows executables using WINE, or Java .class files using a JVM. To register exe with the kernel:\n\nBecome root and turn on the binfmt module in your kernel with this command: \n\n```\nsudo apt-get install binfmt-support\nmodprobe binfmt_misc\n\n```\n\nIn addition, you may want to add the `modprobe` command to your `/etc/rc.local` boot script, so that it will be executed on boot.\n\nAdd the line below to your `/etc/fstab` file: \n\n```\nbinfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc none\n\n```\n\nThen, have your system run the following command on boot: \n\n```\necho ':CLR:M::MZ::/usr/bin/mono:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register\n\n```\n\nBe sure to mark your .exe files as executable in the filesystem as well: \n\n```\nchmod +x myprogram.exe\n\n```\n\nNote that this doesn't change your kernel, just the modules that it loads when you boot your system. In other words, you can still upgrade your kernel without worrying about losing these changes. Similarly, you can upgrade your Mono runtime without affecting any of the invocation methods listed in this section."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A developer wants to enable Linux to automatically run .exe files using Mono without explicitly calling the mono command.

It does not tell the maximum entropy of a closed system with a fixed energy density. The distinction is very important here. For a system with a relatively low energy density, the maximum entropy state is not a black hole. It is, instead, diffuse radiation. This is why Hawking Radiation exists. When a black hole radiates into empty space, total entropy is increased [(1\\)](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.1683).\n\nSo, that's part of the answer to your question\\- low energy thermodynamic systems don't settle into black holes because that's not their highest entropy state in the first place. Your followup question might be: okay, so why is the limit for entropy *density* only satisfied on astronomical scales?\n\nI think the best answer I can give you is this: gravity is unique among the forces in that it is always attractive, and as a result it has much more capability to put matter, and thus entropy, in a compact area. But gravity is also, famously, much much weaker than any of the other forces, so it is only relevant on large scales where all the other forces are cancelled out due to screening effects. There is almost certainly a good reason that gravity has these two distinctive properties, but as far as I know we will need an understanding of quantum gravity to really address those questions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: The Bekenstein bound describes the maximum entropy a thermodynamic system can have.

The Bekenstein bound is related to the maximum entropy that can be contained within a given volume, which is closely tied to gravitational effects. Gravity is unique in being always attractive, allowing it to concentrate matter and entropy in compact areas. However, gravity is also much weaker than other forces, so its effects only become dominant at very large scales where other forces are effectively cancelled out due to screening effects. This is why we typically only see the Bekenstein bound approached or achieved in astronomical-scale objects like black holes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Bekenstein bound is a valid physical concept, not just a theoretical construct. Option B is incorrect because for systems with low energy density, the maximum entropy state is actually diffuse radiation, not a black hole.

There are problems with estimating the likelihood of faster runners than Mr. Bolt from record\\-setting dash times that are both obvious and subtle. Humor me by imagining this not to be the case.\n\n---\n\nUsain Bolt is the fastest human measured for the 100m dash. However, given the small number of athletes, it seems likely that the \"true\" fastest human alive is sitting on a couch somewhere and has never attempted a competitive running career.\n\nI am trying to use the fact that the difference between samples at the tails of the normal distribution become smaller and smaller. I'm using this to compute the likelihood there exists someone faster than Usain Bolt by comparing Usain to the 2nd fastest, 3rd fastest and so on.\n\nTo do this, I'm trying to compute the largest value that exists beyond \"Usain Bolt\" by taking the derivative of the normal distribution's CDF with respect to $y$, raising that to the $n$th (where $n$ is about 7,000,000,000 or the number of samples less than the \"maximum\" \\- the logic behind this is described in the [German Tank Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem) Wikipedia page which generalizes among different distributions), e.g:\n\n$\\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\infty}y f\\_{Y\\_N} (y)dy \\= \\\\lambda n \\\\int\\_{0}^{\\\\infty} y \\\\left \\[ \\\\tfrac12\\\\left\\[1 \\+ \\\\operatorname{erf}\\\\left( \\\\frac{y\\-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\right ]^{n\\-1} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2}}\\\\, e^{\\-\\\\frac{(y \\- \\\\mu)^2}{2 \\\\sigma^2}}dy$\n\n1.

Finding information about the fastest 100m dashes of all time is easy, finding averages \\& variance is hard)\n\nThank you for your patience in dealing with a programmer without a background in the topic.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Contrary to other answers, I'd argue that you can say something about Bolts abilities given the available data. First of all, let's narrow your question. You are asking about fastest human, but since there is a difference in the distributions of running speeds for men and woman, where the best woman runners woman seem to be slightly slower then the best man runners, we should focus on men runners. To get some data, we can look at the [best year performances on 100 run from the last 45 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres#Men). There are several things to notice about this data:\n\n* Those are the best running times, so they do not tell us about abilities of all humans, but about the *minimal* achieved speeds.\n* We assume that this data reflects sample of the best runners in the world. While it might have happened that there were even better runners that did not participate in the championships, this assumption seems to be fairly reasonable.\n\nFirst, let's discuss how **not** to analyze this data. You could notice that if we plot the running times against time, we would observe a strong linear relationship.\n\n[![Best running times vs time](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Ximi.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Ximi.png)\n\nThis could lead you to using linear regression to forecast how much better runners we could observe in the next years. This however would be a **very bad** idea, that would inevitable lead you to conclusion that in approximately two thousand years humans would be able to run 100 meters in zero seconds, and after that they would start achieving the negative running times! This is obviously absurd, as we can imagine that there is some kind of biological and physical limit of our capacities, that is unknown to us.\n\nHow could you analyze this data? First, notice that we are dealing with data about minimal values, so we should use appropriate model for such data. This leads us to considering [extreme value theory](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/158767/why-use-extreme-value-theory) models (see e.g. *An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values* book by Stuart Coles). You can assume for this data [generalized extreme value distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_extreme_value_distribution) (GEV). If $Y \\= \\\\max(X\\_1,X\\_2,\\\\dots,X\\_n)$ where $X\\_1,X\\_2,\\\\dots,X\\_n$ are independent and identically distributed random variables, then $Y\\_i$'s follow a GEV distribution. If you are interested in modeling minimas, then if $Z\\_1,Z\\_2,\\\\dots,Z\\_k$ are samples of minimas, then $\\-Z\\_i$'s follow a GEV distribution for minimas. So we can fit GEV distribution to the running speeds data, what leads to pretty nice fit (see below).\n\n[![GEV distribution for running speeds](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tN1px.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tN1px.png)\n\nIf you look at at the cumulative distribution suggested by the model, you'll notice that the best running time by Usain Bolt is in the lowest $1\\\\%$ tail of the distribution. So if we stick to this data, and this toy\\-example analysis, we would conclude that the much smaller running times are unlikely (but obviously, possible). The obvious problem with this analysis is that ignores the fact that we saw year\\-to\\-year improvements of the best running times. This gets us back to the problem described in the first part of the answer, i.e. that assuming a regression model in here is risky. Another thing that could be improved is that we could use Bayesian approach and assume informative prior that would account for some out\\-of\\-data knowledge about the physiologically possible running times, that might not yet been observed (but, as far as I know, this is unknown at present moment). Finally, similar extreme value theory was already used in sports research, e.g. by Einmahl and Magnus (2008\\) in the [Records in Athletics Through Extreme\\-Value Theory](http://cdata4.uvt.nl/websitefiles/magnus/JRM082.pdf) paper.\n\nYou could protest that you didn't ask about probability of the faster running time, but about probability of observing faster runner. Unfortunately, here we can't do much since we don't know what is the probability that a runner will become a professional athlete and the recorded running times will be available for him. This doesn't happen at random and there is lots of factors contributing to the fact that some runners become professional athletes and some don't (or even that someone likes running and runs at all). For this, we would have to have a detailed population\\-wide data on runners, moreover since you are asking about the extremes of the distribution, the data would have to be very large. So on this, I agree with the other answers."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An analyst is studying the fastest 100m dash times in men's athletics over the past 45 years.

While the limit will correspond to a finite-rank operator, it may not be expressible as a finite sum of simple tensors in the original space.\n\nOption D correctly captures the essence of the documentation, generalizing the idea that the limit corresponds to a finite-rank operator under the appropriate identification."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/04/08", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/356931", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/61536/"], "docs_id": 356931, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Looking at the von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del (NBG) axioms of Set Theory in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory) I noticed that it has two axioms of permutation: one for circular permutations and another for transpositions. \n\nOn the other hand, it is well\\-known that the group of finitary permutations of $\\\\omega$ is generated by transpositions only. \n\nSo my question: *Can those two permutation axioms in NBG be replaced by a single axiom?* (In order to minimize the number of axioms).\n\nOr at least, can the axiom of transposition:\n\n$\\\\forall A\\\\;\\\\exists B\\\\;\\\\forall x\\\\;\\\\forall y\\\\;\\\\forall z\\\\;((x,y,z)\\\\in B\\\\;\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\;(x,z,y)\\\\in A)$\n\nbe replaced by the simpler one:\n\n$\\\\forall A\\\\;\\\\exists B\\\\;\\\\forall x\\\\;\\\\forall y\\\\;((x,y)\\\\in B\\\\;\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\;(y,x)\\\\in A)$?\n\n---\n\n**Added in Edit.** It seems that two permutation axioms of NBG can be replaced by the following their versions:\n\nThe classes $\\\\{((x\\_1,x\\_2,x\\_3\\),(x\\_3,x\\_2,x\\_1\\)):x\\_1,x\\_2,x\\_3\\\\in\\\\mathbf V\\\\}$ and \n$\\\\{((x\\_1,x\\_2,x\\_3\\),(x\\_1,x\\_3,x\\_2\\)):x\\_1,x\\_2,x\\_3\\\\in \\\\mathbf V\\\\}$ exist.

The Bernays axioms modified by Godel were later reproduced in the book of Mendelson who coined the name NBG and popularized this system in his classical textbook on Mathematical Logic. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe that your intended question was something along the lines of whether or not the standard axioms can be simplified or reduced. This is in the spirit of Exercise 13\\.4 in Jech's \"[Set Theory](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-662-22400-7)\", where one shows that some of the usual G\u00f6del operations are definable in terms of the others.\n\nSo I interpret your questions as asking: Can we replace the two permutation axioms of NBG with a single axiom of the form\n$$\n\\\\forall A\\\\ \\\\exists B\\\\ \\\\forall x\\_1\\\\ \\\\forall x\\_2\\\\ \\\\dotsc\\\\ \\\\forall x\\_n\\\\ ((x\\_1,x\\_2,\\\\dotsc, x\\_n)\\\\in B \\\\leftrightarrow (x\\_{\\\\sigma(1\\)},x\\_{\\\\sigma(2\\)},\\\\dotsc, x\\_{\\\\sigma(n)})\\\\in A)\n$$\nwhere $\\\\sigma\\\\in S\\_n$ is some fixed permutation on $n$ letters, and $n$ is some fixed (meta) natural number. Or, perhaps more naturally, you would want to assert the existence of the class\n$$\n\\\\{((x\\_1,x\\_2,\\\\dotsc, x\\_n),(x\\_{\\\\sigma(1\\)},x\\_{\\\\sigma(2\\)},\\\\dotsc, x\\_{\\\\sigma(n)}))\\\\ :\\\\ x\\_1,x\\_2,\\\\dotsc,x\\_n\\\\in V\\\\}.\n$$\nI'm also assuming that you still want to interpret ordered $n$\\-tuples in the usual way, (meta\\-)recursively using Kuratowski's trick.\n\nI would guess that the answer to this question is no, but this is clearly not a trivial problem. The paper Gutan and Kisielewicz \\- \"[Rings and semigroups with permutable zero products](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022404905001921)\" ([MSN](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2235365)) approaches a very similar question; in the context of that paper permutations in $S\\_n$ can be considered as permutations in $S\\_{n\\+1}$ in a very concrete way similar to how the permutation axioms of NBG can be lifted from 3\\-tuples to $n$\\-tuples. I imagine that the permutation $\\\\sigma$ in the context of NBG induces the same \"eventual behavior\" as observed in that paper.\n\n(Note: Your parenthetical statement, which reads \"to minimize the number of axioms,\" is nonsense. By taking the conjunction of the finitely many axioms of NBG you now have minimized the number the axioms.)\n\n---\n\nIn a sense, one can modify Taras's answer to his own question to get the permutation axiom down to only inversion, with another axiom handling the moving of parentheses.\n\nThroughout, assume the **axiom of inversion**: For each class $X$, the class $X^{\\-1}\\=\\\\{(y,x)\\\\, :\\\\, (x,y)\\\\in X\\\\}$ exists. The axiom of inversion will act as our sole permutation axiom.\n\nConsider the new axiom of **associativity of parentheses**: For each class $X$, the class\n$$\nX^{p}\\=\\\\{((x,y),z)\\\\, :\\\\, (x,(y,z))\\\\in X\\\\}\n$$\nexists. In a sense, this axiom will allow us to move parentheses around however we like.\n\nNow, circular permutation $\\\\pi\\_3$ follows, since $\\\\pi\\_3\\[X]\\=(X^{\\-1})^{p}$. Conversely, associativity of parentheses follows from circular permutation since $X^{p}\\=\\\\pi\\_3\\[X^{\\-1}]$. Also notice that the class $(\\\\pi\\_3^2\\[X])^{\\-1}$ has the parentheses moved to the right instead of the left, so we can shift either direction.\n\nThe identity class function $I$ can now be defined, as done by Taras, additionally using axioms of domain, membership (the class $E$ exists), complement, and the existence of $V$.\n\nNow, let me show that $S\\_1\\=\\\\{(((a,b),c),((a,x),y))\\\\,:\\\\, a,b,c,x,y\\\\in V\\\\}$ exists. Taking\n$$\nS\\_1'\\=\\\\{(((a,b),c),(a,x))\\\\, :\\\\, a,b,c,x\\\\in V\\\\}\n$$\nwe see that $S\\_1^p\\=S\\_1'\\\\times V$. So (assuming closure under products from $V$) it suffices to show that $S\\_1'$ exists. But $(S\\_1')^{p}\\=S\\_1''\\\\times V$ where\n$$\nS\\_1''\\=\\\\{(((a,b),c),a)\\\\, :\\\\, a,b,c\\\\in V\\\\}\n$$\nso it suffices to show that this class exists. Now $((S\\_{1}'')^{\\-1})^{p}\\=S\\_1'''\\\\times V$ where\n$$\nS\\_1'''\\=\\\\{(a,(a,b))\\\\, :\\\\, a,b\\\\in V\\\\}.\n$$\nApplying associativity, this new class becomes $E\\\\times V$, which exists.\n\nSimilar computations, of rearranging coordinates, and peeling off a free coordinate, show that $S\\_2$ and $S\\_3$ exist, where\n$$\nS\\_2\\=\\\\{(((a,b),c),((x,y),b))\\\\, :\\\\, a,b,c,x,y\\\\in V\\\\}\n$$ \nand\n$$\nS\\_3\\=\\\\{(((a,b),c),((x,c),y))\\\\, :\\\\, a,b,c,x,y\\\\in V\\\\}.\n$$\nNow $S\\_1\\\\cap S\\_2\\\\cap S\\_3$ is the class function\n$$\n\\\\{(((a,b),c),((a,c),b))\\\\, :\\\\, a,b,c\\\\in V\\\\}.\n$$\nThe axiom of transposition (of the last two entries in triples) now follows as in Taras's answer."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In the context of von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del (NBG) set theory, which of the following statements is correct regarding the simplification of permutation axioms?\n\nA) The two permutation axioms in NBG (circular permutation and transposition) can be replaced by a single axiom using any fixed permutation on n letters, where n is a fixed meta natural number.\n\nB) The axiom of inversion alone is sufficient to replace both permutation axioms in NBG.\n\nC) The axiom of inversion, combined with the axiom of associativity of parentheses, can replace both permutation axioms in NBG.\n\nD) The axiom of transposition can be simplified to work only with ordered pairs instead of ordered triples, without losing any expressiveness in the system.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

These limitations vary between kernel versions and tend to get smaller. Please read information about particular filesystems.\n\nit does not actually say what might be supported (or in which kernel version, since that's mostly down to the inotify support in the filesystem itself rather than the library/utilities).\n\nA simple explanation is that is doesn't really make sense to support inotify for *everything* in in `/sys` (or `/proc`) since they don't get modified in the conventional sense. Most of these files/directories represent a snapshot of kernel state *at the time you view them*. \n\nThink of `/proc/uptime` as a simple example, it contains the uptime accurate to the centisecond. Should inotify notify you 100 times a second that it was \"written\" to? Apart from not being very useful, it would be both a performance issue and a tricky problem to solve since nothing is generating inotify events on behalf of these fictional \"writes\". Within the kernel inotify [works at the filesystem API level](https://lwn.net/Articles/605128/).\n\nThe situation then is that *some* things in sysfs and procfs do generate inotify events, `/proc/uptime` for example will tell you when it has been accessed (access, open, close), but on my kernel `/proc/mounts` shows no events at all when file systems are mounted and unmounted.\n\nHere's Greg Kroah\\-Hartman's take on it:\n\n[http://linux\\-fsdevel.vger.kernel.narkive.com/u0qmXPFK/inotify\\-sysfs](http://linux-fsdevel.vger.kernel.narkive.com/u0qmXPFK/inotify-sysfs)\nand Linus:\n\n[http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux\\-fsdevel/msg73955\\.html](http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-fsdevel/msg73955.html)\n\n(both threads from 2014 however)\n\nTo solve your immediate problem you may be able to use dbus, e.g. `dbus-monitor --monitor --system` (no need to be root) will show trigger on tun devices being created and removed (though mine doesn't show the tun device name, only the HAL string with the PtP IP); `udevadm monitor` (no need to be root); or fall back to polling the directory (try: [script to monitor for new files in a shared folder (windows host, linux guest)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/305394/script-to-monitor-for-new-files-in-a-shared-folder-windows-host-linux-guest)).\n(With `udev` you could also use `inotifywait -m -r /dev/.udev` and watch out for files starting with \"n\", but that's quite an ungly hack.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is trying to monitor the creation of new network interfaces using inotifywait.

The documentation indicates that inotifywait has partial support for the /sys filesystem, but with limitations. These limitations exist because /sys represents kernel state rather than conventional file modifications. Not everything in /sys generates inotify events, and support can vary between kernel versions.

The literature I am referring to is Dunkel \\& Hilbert, *Nature Physics* **10**, 67 (2014\\) [arXiv:1304\\.2066](http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2066), where as I understand it, it is shown that negative temperatures are an artefact of choosing an incorrect definition of entropy. The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_temperature) on the matter has also been amended to reflect this. \n\nThis was later challenged by similarly well\\-known scientists, in [arXiv:1403\\.4299](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4299) where it was, among other things, pointed out that this argument is actually decades old (citing Berdichevsky *et al.*, *Phys. Rev. A*\n**43**, 2050 (1991\\)). The original authors quickly countered the arguments made in the comment, by what seems to be a rigorous treatment of the matter, [arXiv:1403\\.6058](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6058). The first arXiv comment (arXiv:1403\\.4299\\) has been updated since and it still reads that \"Obviously severe points of disagreement remain\".\n\nWhat I am asking, then, is whether someone on StackExchange might be able to shed some light on the matter as to how there can be a disagreement about something that seems should be a mathematical fact. I would also be interested in hearing whether changing the definition of entropy from that of Boltzmann to that due to Gibbs might potentially change any other results. Might for example the [Wang\\-Landau algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_and_Landau_algorithm) be affected seeing that it does use the density of states and that you can never simulate infinite systems (although as I understand it, even in the present context with finite scaling you should be able to get consistent results)? \n\nEDIT: An update on the matter for those who might care. [arXiv:1407\\.4127](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4127) challenged the original paper and argued that negative temperatures ought to exist. They based their claims on their earlier experiments in *Science* **339**, 52 (2013\\). A reply was offered in [arXiv:1408\\.5392](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5392). More physicists keep joining in, arguing for [arXiv:1410\\.4619](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4619) and against [arXiv:1411\\.2425](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2425) negative temperatures.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What I am asking, then, is whether someone on StackExchange might be able to shed some light on the matter as to how there can be a disagreement about something that seems should be a mathematical fact.\n\nThe main disagreement seems to be about which *definition* of the word \"entropy\" in the context of statistical physics is \"correct\". Definition is an agreement on choice that seems preferable but is not necessitated by facts. Different people regard different things more useful, so there should be no surprise that they are lead to use different definitions in their work. There should be no objection as long as this leads to some new knowledge that is in a sense independent of the choice made.\n\nThe surprising thing is the authors of the paper claim that their definition is *the definition of entropy* and proclaim its superiority.\n\nI did not find any convincing argument in their paper to convince me that there is any problem with the standard formula $S \\= k\\_B\\\\log \\\\omega(U)$ for entropy and that their formula $S' \\= k\\_B\\\\log \\\\Omega(U)$ should replace it.\n\nThe two formulae lead to almost the same value of entropy for macroscopic systems, for which the concept of entropy was originally devised. This is because their difference is negligible due to high magnitude of the relevant number of states. Consequently, the standard rules that use entropy lead to the same conclusions for such systems whether one uses $S$ or $S'$.\n\nFor \"strange\" systems with constant or decreasing density of states $\\\\omega(U)$ like particle in a 1D box or 1D harmonic oscillator, their definition leads to very different value of entropy for given energy $U$ and also to a different value of temperature, since $\\\\partial U/\\\\partial S'\\|\\_{V\\=\\\\text{const}} \\\\neq \\\\partial U/\\\\partial S\\|\\_{V\\=\\\\text{const}}$. The authors say that positiveness of so calculated temperature is a virtue of their entropy $S'$. \n\nBut such strange systems cannot be in thermodynamic equilibrium with ordinary systems when they have the same $\\\\partial U/\\\\partial S'\\|\\_{V\\=\\\\text{const}}$. Why? When ordinary system is connected to such strange system, the most probable result is that the strange system will give as much energy to the normal system until its energy decreases to a value at which its density of states equals density of states of the normal system (or there is no transferable energy left). According to the principle of maximum probability, the average energy $U\\_1$ of the first system in equilibrium is such that the number of accessible states for the combined system is maximum. Let us denote total energy of the first system $U\\_1$, of the second system $U\\_2$ and of the combined isolated system $U$ (constant). If density of states is differentiable, we are lead to the condition\n$$\n\\\\frac{d}{dU\\_1}\\\\left(\\\\omega\\_1(U\\_1\\)\\\\omega\\_2(U\\-U\\_1\\) \\\\Delta U^2\\\\right) \\= 0\n$$\n$$\n\\\\omega\\_{1}'(U\\_1\\)\\\\omega\\_2(U\\_2\\) \\= \\\\omega\\_{2}'(U\\_2\\)\\\\omega\\_1(U\\_1\\)\n$$\n$$\n\\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_{1}'(U\\_1\\)}{\\\\omega\\_1(U\\_1\\)} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\omega\\_{2}'(U\\_2\\)}{\\\\omega\\_2(U\\_2\\)}\n$$\n\nand this implies the condition\n\n$$\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial U\\_1}{\\\\partial S\\_1} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\partial U\\_2}{\\\\partial S\\_2}\\~\\~\\~(1\\)\n$$\nwhere $S\\_1 \\= k\\_B\\\\log \\\\omega\\_1(U\\_1\\)$ and $S\\_2\\=k\\_B\\\\log \\\\omega\\_2(U\\_2\\)$. The principle of maximum probability *does not* lead to the condition\n\n$$\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial U\\_1}{\\\\partial S'\\_1} \\= \\\\frac{\\\\partial U\\_2}{\\\\partial S'\\_2}.\\~\\~\\~(2\\)\n$$\nwhere $S\\_1' \\= k\\_B\\\\log \\\\Omega\\_1(U\\_1\\)$ and $S\\_2' \\= k\\_B\\\\log \\\\Omega\\_2(U\\_2\\)$.\nIf (1\\) holds, in most cases (2\\) won't. Since in equilibrium thermodynamic temperatures are the same, the statistical definition of temperature is better given by $\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial S}$ rather than by $\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial S'}$.\n\nWhen the strange system is isolated and has energy such that density of states decreases with energy, the temperature thus obtained is negative. This is well, since ascribing it any positive value of temperature would be wrong: the system won't be in equilibrium with ordinary systems (those with density of states increasing with energy) of positive temperature."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the discussion on negative temperatures in statistical physics, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The debate over negative temperatures has been definitively resolved in favor of the Dunkel & Hilbert interpretation.\n\nB) The standard Boltzmann entropy formula S = kB log \u03c9(U) is fundamentally flawed and should always be replaced by S' = kB log \u03a9(U).\n\nC) Negative temperatures are possible in certain systems with decreasing density of states, and this concept is consistent with the standard Boltzmann entropy definition.\n\nD) The Gibbs entropy formula S' = kB log \u03a9(U) always leads to positive temperatures and is therefore superior in all cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The discussion highlights that negative temperatures are possible and meaningful in certain \"strange\" systems with decreasing density of states, such as a particle in a 1D box or 1D harmonic oscillator.

What is the extra current spent on if not speed? Torque?

'Slip' is defined as the % reduction in speed below synchronous. The current drawn by the motor is more or less proportional to the slip. As the motor load increases, the speed will drop, the slip increases, the current and so torque increases, until it reaches the rated speed of 1440 rpm at the rated power, either 1 or 2 hp depending on the motor."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Two induction motors, rated at 1 HP and 2 HP respectively, are designed to run from the same voltage and have the same nominal speed of 1440 rpm.

The key difference is in their ability to produce torque. The 2 HP motor, while having the same nominal speed, can produce more torque at a given slip percentage. This is likely achieved through differences in stator winding design, possibly using more turns or thicker wire. The rotor diameter may be similar if they use the same frame size. Current draw is not simply doubled, but is proportional to the load and resulting slip. The 2 HP motor's ability to produce more power manifests as greater torque capacity, not higher speed."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/01/10", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/504334", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/307843/"], "docs_id": 504334, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to assess how to compute the errors associated with a numbers of likely voter polls of the Warnock Georgia Senate race.\nI have estimates of the margin of victory from 9 surveys of varying sample sizes.

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery#Performance), we could say 250 to 620 W\u00b7h/L. Since your battery is roughly one milliliter, we can estimate from 0\\.25 to 0\\.62W.h, or 67mAh to 167mAh.\n\nNow, we can double check that by looking for small Li\\-ion batteries on the web:\n\n[This](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/731) one is a little bigger, offering 110mAh, while [this](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11316) other seems to be a bit smaller offering 40mAh.\n\nFrom that I'd say the wikipedia numbers are a bit optimistic, because probably it takes into consideration the whole range of batteries (from the cheap ones we are looking at to others with super high density, etc..).\n\nNext step is a guess, if you think this battery is new, good quality, from a good manufacturer, you can be optimistic. If its old, cheap and not taken much care for, then be a bit more pessimistic.\n\nAnyway, its not a safe method at all, but should give a ball park.

The StackExchange answer emphasizes that such calculations can only provide a rough estimate or \"ball park\" figure. The answer explicitly states that \"Ideally you would charge it and measure with different loads to be safe,\" which corresponds to option D.

The filenames are long, so I'd like to generate a vector of filenames that can then be accessed by my own custom downstream function for reading them into a dataframe, plotting, etc. \n\nFor example, the files look like:\n\n```\n 5_simulationA.k  5_simulationA.b\n10_simulationA.k 10_simulationA.b\n 5_simulationB.k  5_simulationB.b\n10_simulationB.k 10_simualtionB.b\n\n```\n\nThe \".k\" and \".b\" files are mates of a pair and must stay together for downstream processing. \n\nI could read in these files by writing a nested loop that would look something like, \n\n```\nK_files = c()\nB_files = c()\n\nfor (i in c(A,B,C)){ # iterate over letter variable\n    for (n in c(5,10,15)){ #iterate over numbers of the files\n        k_filename = paste(n, \"_simulation\", i, \".k\")\n        b_filename = paste(n, \"_simulation\", i, \".b\")\n        K_files = c(K_files, k_filename)\n        B_files = c(B_files, b_filename)\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is of course very ugly and un\\-R\\-like.

Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From OP's example output filenames, it looks like we want all combinations of `n` and `i`. `expand.grid` returns a dataframe of all combinations of `n`s and `i`s. We could then use `apply` to loop through its row to generate the filenames:\n\n```\ni <- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\")\nn <- c(5, 10, 15)\ncombi <- expand.grid(n = n, i = i)\n\ninvisible(apply(combi, 1, function(x){\n  k_filename = paste0(x[1], \"_simulation\", x[2], \".k\")\n  b_filename = paste0(x[1], \"_simulation\", x[2], \".b\")\n  print(k_filename)\n  print(b_filename)\n}))\n\n```\n\nNoticed that I used `invisible` to suppress the output of `apply` since we are only interested in the side\\-effects (read/write files). Alternatively, we can use `pwalk` from `purrr`, which takes each column of the same `expand.grid` dataframe as input and creates the filenames silently:\n\n```\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\ncombi %>%\n  pwalk(~ {\n    k_filename = paste0(.x, \"_simulation\", .y, \".k\")\n    b_filename = paste0(.x, \"_simulation\", .y, \".b\")\n    print(k_filename)\n    print(b_filename)\n  })\n\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n[1] \"5_simulationA.k\"\n[1] \"5_simulationA.b\"\n[1] \"10_simulationA.k\"\n[1] \"10_simulationA.b\"\n[1] \"15_simulationA.k\"\n[1] \"15_simulationA.b\"\n[1] \"5_simulationB.k\"\n[1] \"5_simulationB.b\"\n[1] \"10_simulationB.k\"\n[1] \"10_simulationB.b\"\n[1] \"15_simulationB.k\"\n[1] \"15_simulationB.b\"\n[1] \"5_simulationC.k\"\n[1] \"5_simulationC.b\"\n[1] \"10_simulationC.k\"\n[1] \"10_simulationC.b\"\n[1] \"15_simulationC.k\"\n[1] \"15_simulationC.b\"\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In R, you need to generate filenames for paired \".k\" and \".b\" files based on combinations of numbers (5, 10, 15) and letters (A, B, C).
