There have been and are various models of the Inflaton field, with important parameters such as the decay time and others. The current one that best matches the data observed is slow roll inflation. It also imparted energy to the universe as it came down its high potential energy state, kicked off that unstable equilibrium state due to quantum fluctuations.\n\nA simple article on it is at [Wikipedia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflaton), maybe a way to start with other references.\n\nSee also a more detailed treatment of the theory of the Inflaton field.

For example to compute a mean we can either add the numbers together then divide the sum by $n$, or we can divide each number by $n$ then sum those values. This is because division (multiplication) distributes over addition. With paired data we have the fact that the mean of the differences is the difference of the means. But these are the rarer cases, not the rule.\n\nSo in general you should not expect to get the same result when you do things in a different order, it is also not true that the mean of the ratios is the ratio of the means, so why should it be true for the median?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher is studying two datasets, A and B, each containing 100 numeric values.

In general, median(A)/median(B) is not equal to median(A/B) due to the properties of mathematics and the order of operations. This is similar to how the mean of ratios is not equal to the ratio of means. However, when the ranges of values in datasets A and B are small, these two calculations may produce results that are close to each other. This is because with a smaller range of values, there's less opportunity for extreme ratios to skew the result of median(A/B). Answer A is incorrect because equality is not guaranteed.

With these switches the metal contacts can be pretty small, so it is not like you can attach a big heat sink in there. When I go to solder wires onto the switch, if I get the whole system (connector and wire) hot enough to melt solder, then the switch melts. In one case I was soldering and the contact just came right out of the switch because the plastic that was holding it in melted.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PFrMS.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PFrMS.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Apply a small amount of solder to the clean soldering iron tip. This aids thermal transfer. You will see this mentioned in all guides on \"how to solder\" (if you don't see it mentioned, find another guide).\n2. Tin the wire you are going to connect. Go \"ouch! ouch!\" and remember to use something to hold the wire (a small vice is handy) so that you don't burn your fingers next time.\n3. Apply a small amount of solder to the clean (yes, you may need to clean it again: get used to doing that frequently) soldering iron tip.\n4. Place the wire on the connector on the switch.\n5. Apply the soldering iron so that it touches both at the same time.\n6. Wait one (1\\) second *at most* and then feed the solder into the gap between the soldering iron and the parts to be connected. If the solder does not melt straight away, remove the iron and peer at where you tried to apply it \\- maybe the angle wasn't quite right.\n7. Remove the solder. Remove the soldering iron.\n8. Inspect the joint when it has cooled down (say, 20 seconds for larger items). It should be shiny and with not\\-too\\-much, not\\-too\\-little solder. There must be no pointy bits hanging off it or shorts to other parts.\n\n**Cleaning** For cleaning the soldering iron tip, I have found that the curly brass sponge stuff is better than a wet sponge: the latter cools the tip down too much all of a sudden and tends to leave dross on the tip.\n\n**Temperature** If the solder on the tip of the iron looks \"off\" (becomes coloured or matte) really soon after applying it, then your soldering iron is too hot. If solder does melt as soon as you apply it to the tip, the soldering iron is not hot enough.\n\n**Solder** Solder with lead\\-containing solder with flux in it (e.g. multicore 60/40\\) is easier to use than lead\\-free solder. Do not use solder or flux intended for plumbing \\- they will destroy things.\n\n**Cleanliness** A good solder joint needs the surfaces to be soldered to be clean. You can get flux pens which dispense a small amount of flux when you apply them to the surfaces to be soldered. This is in addition the the flux which is in the solder. Flux chemically cleans the surfaces. It is generally a nuisance to remove afterwards, but you really should.\n\n**Fumes** The flux will give off fumes. You don't want to breathe them in or get them in your eyes as you will get a sore throat and eyes. Arrange for some sort of ventilation that keeps the fumes away from you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sequences best describes the correct order of steps for soldering a wire to a small plastic rocker switch?\n\nA) Tin the wire, clean the soldering iron tip, apply solder to the tip, place wire on connector, apply iron to both, wait 5 seconds, feed solder, remove iron\n\nB) Apply solder to iron tip, tin the wire, clean the tip again, place wire on connector, apply iron to both, wait 1 second maximum, feed solder, remove iron and solder\n\nC) Clean the soldering iron tip, apply solder to connector, place wire on connector, apply iron to both, wait 3 seconds, feed solder, remove iron, inspect joint\n\nD) Tin the wire, apply flux to connector, place wire on connector, apply iron to both, wait until solder melts, remove iron, clean joint with flux remover\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B correctly outlines the steps described in the documentation. It emphasizes important details such as applying solder to the clean tip before starting (to aid thermal transfer), tinning the wire, cleaning the tip again, and most importantly, waiting only 1 second maximum before feeding solder.

This creates an illusion of decreasing stress when using engineering stress calculations (force divided by original area).

Although it amplifies half the AC signal, in common emitter configuration, it does not have the nice quality of low quiescent power found in \"real\" class B amplifiers.\n\nTo amplify only a half\\-cycle of an input wave, you may set the Q\\-point of your amplifier on the saturation line of your transistor. \"A\" is an example of point on the saturation line.

The answer must include the basic assumptions so we can see where the major unknowns lie, and the best answer is one which requires no specific knowledge\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'll take a go at it \\- as with the piano tuners in Chicago, I take the approach as if I have \"no facts to go on\". Your head has a surface area of $4\\\\pi r^2$, the fraction of it which is covered with hair is $\\\\gamma$. The density of hairs per unit area is $\\\\sigma$, and the number of hairs is then\n\n$N\\=4\\\\pi r^2 \\\\gamma \\\\sigma$\n\nHairs per unit area is obviously the main guesswork involved here. Most heads look like hair, which I will interpret as \"when projected to your skin, over 50% of what is seen is hair.\" If your average hair length is $l$, average diameter $d$, the density of your hair is then \n\n$\\\\sigma\\=\\\\frac{1}{2ld}$\n\n(obviously, this breaks when the hair is so long it leaves your scalp, but our hair length is usually 1/10\\-2 times the size of our head, so we are still within an order of magnitude. Also hairs from other parts of your head cover your skin as well, so this might be an underestimate). My final answer\n\n$N\\=2\\\\pi \\\\frac{r^2\\\\gamma}{ld}$\n\nFor $r\\=10$ cm, $\\\\gamma\\=0\\.4$, $l\\=6$ cm (size of my head), and $d\\=0\\.1$ mm I get\n\n$N\\=4190$\n\nSeems kinda low, but 419 is certainly too small, and 41900 seems maybe too large, so I am comfortable with this as an estimation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the hair estimation problem:\n\nQuestion: Using the estimation method described, calculate the number of hairs on a human head with the following parameters:\n- Head radius (r) = 8 cm\n- Fraction of head covered with hair (\u03b3) = 0.5\n- Average hair length (l) = 5 cm\n- Average hair diameter (d) = 0.08 mm\n\nThen select the closest estimate from the options below.\n\nA) 6,000 hairs\nB) 12,000 hairs\nC) 24,000 hairs\nD) 48,000 hairs\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nUsing the formula N = 2\u03c0(r\u00b2\u03b3)/(ld), we can plug in the given values:\n\nN = 2\u03c0((8 cm)\u00b2 * 0.5) / (5 cm * 0.08 mm)\n  = 2\u03c0(64 cm\u00b2 * 0.5) / (5 cm * 0.08 mm)\n  = 2\u03c0(32 cm\u00b2) / (0.4 cm\u00b7mm)\n  = 201.06 cm\u00b2/mm\n  = 20,106 mm\n\nConverting mm to standard units gives us approximately 20,106 hairs.\n\nThe closest option to this result is B) 12,000 hairs.

For x86 systems, they are located in [arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c)\n\nHalt will stop the machine, and leave it in power\\-on state. So it just stops the kernel, but usually does not power it off.\n\n```\nstatic void native_machine_halt(void)\n{\n  /* Stop other cpus and apics */\n  machine_shutdown();\n\n  tboot_shutdown(TB_SHUTDOWN_HALT);\n\n  stop_this_cpu(NULL);\n}\n\n```\n\nWhile power\\_off will also cut off the electric source from APM / ACPI **pm\\_power\\_off()**\n\n```\nstatic void native_machine_power_off(void)\n{\n  if (pm_power_off) {\n    if (!reboot_force)\n      machine_shutdown();\n    pm_power_off();\n  }\n  /* A fallback in case there is no PM info available */\n  tboot_shutdown(TB_SHUTDOWN_HALT);\n}\n\n```\n\n**machine\\_shutdown()** is an infinite loop\n\n**tboot\\_shutdown()** ([arch/x86/kernel/tboot.c](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/x86/kernel/tboot.c))\n\n**stop\\_this\\_cpu(NULL)** ([arch/x86/kernel/process.c](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/x86/kernel/process.c))\ndisables the IRQs of the CPU, set the CPU offline, \n\n**pm\\_power\\_off()** ([arch/x86/kernel/apm\\_32\\.c](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/x86/kernel/apm_32.c)) is a function pointer to **apm\\_power\\_off()**\n\nAs you can see, all the job depends on the arch. In all cases, it's done with ASM calls.\n\nFor **apm\\_power\\_off()**, the Bios is called with code APT\\_STATE\\_OFF (0x0003\\). \n\n```\napm_bios_call_simple(APM_FUNC_SET_STATE, APM_DEVICE_ALL, APM_STATE_OFF, eax, err);\n\n```\n\nFor **native\\_halt()** (arch/x86/include/asm/irqflags.h) this calls is used : \n\n```\nasm volatile(\"hlt\": : :\"memory\");\n\n```\n\nChoose your poison :)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the Linux kernel, which function is responsible for cutting off the power on x86 systems, and what is its primary mechanism for doing so?\n\nA) native_machine_halt() - It uses the 'hlt' assembly instruction to stop the CPU\nB) native_machine_power_off() - It calls pm_power_off() which interfaces with APM/ACPI\nC) machine_shutdown() - It enters an infinite loop to stop all processes\nD) stop_this_cpu() - It disables IRQs and sets the CPU offline\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The native_machine_power_off() function is responsible for cutting off power on x86 systems. It primarily works by calling pm_power_off(), which is a function pointer typically set to apm_power_off(). This function interfaces with the Advanced Power Management (APM) or Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) to actually cut off the power to the system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because native_machine_halt() only stops the CPU but doesn't cut off power. Option C is incorrect because machine_shutdown() is a preparatory step that doesn't actually cut off power. Option D is incorrect because stop_this_cpu() is part of the process of stopping the system but doesn't directly cut off power."}, "19": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/03/16", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/134654", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/2917/"], "docs_id": 134654, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to drill a 0\\.75\" hole in a metal pole. I got a 0\\.75\" drill bit from Home Depot (DEWALT 3/4 in. Black Oxide Reduced Shank Drill Bit) that I was told is appropriate for metal. I used a punch to create a pilot dent. I then tried to use the 0\\.75\" bit but it kept on slipping. I did some research and it said that you could drill a pilot hole but that it shouldn't be more than 25% of the target size. As such I drilled a pilot hole and that seemed to help and I then made some progress with the 0\\.75\" bit.\n\nI've now got to the point where there's a lot of vibration in the bit and the hole that it's creating is larger than 0\\.75\" on the outside. The extra size is not a problem \\- just stating a fact.\n\nThe problem is that after progressing through the metal I seem to be \"stuck\" at this point inasmuch as it's extremely difficult to get it to go further.\n\nMy question: Do I just continue to apply force and push on the drill to keep going or is there a technique that will make this easier.\n\n(I'm wearing safety goggles, gloves etc.)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvfcX.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvfcX.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For a hole of that size or larger a hole saw might be an easier method as it removes less material and may be more likely to stay centered due to its pilot bit.\n\nHowever using the more standard bit you have is working and you should be able to get all the way through. The type of vibration and unevenness of the hole from that type of bit is not uncommon in my experience, and may not really matter in the end if the exact hole size does not need to be very precise.\n\nWhile the bit might be dull, more likely it is harder to cut as you go deeper because initially more and more material has to be removed on each revolution, and also friction of the bit against the hole increases.\n\nTips:\n\n* Some lubrication (cutting oil \\- but in a pinch any oil may help) may stress the tools less\n* You can push hard but if you seem to stress the motor of your drill (you'll hear this) back off somewhat. Also pay attention to how hot the motor / casing is getting. Warm is OK but very hot or a burning smell is obviously going too far.\n* Be cautious as the bit starts to pass through the far side. Unique to drilling metal (as opposed to wood) *the flutes of the bit may tend to \"bite in\"* and you could get a sudden and significant wrenching action on your arm, hand, thumb, etc. Hold the drill very securely, use an extension handle if you have it, and maybe brace it with your body. For the last bit of depth I would push more lightly but spin the bit quite fast.\n* The hole may turn out to be a little smaller than 3/4\" (or whatever exact size the bit really is, such as 47/64ths). That may seem impossible but if you think about what the cross\\-sectional shape of a slice of the bit looks like it may make more sense (its not a circle).\n* If the hole is rough you may need to file it down by hand before using it. Whatever goes through it is likely to get damaged."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When drilling a large hole (0.75\" or larger) in metal, which of the following techniques is NOT recommended?\n\nA) Using a hole saw instead of a standard drill bit\nB) Applying constant, heavy pressure throughout the entire drilling process\nC) Using lubricant or cutting oil to reduce friction\nD) Creating a small pilot hole before using the full-size bit\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) Using a hole saw is actually recommended for larger holes as it removes less material and stays centered better.\nB) This is incorrect and potentially dangerous. While some pressure is needed, constant heavy pressure can stress the drill motor and cause the bit to suddenly \"bite in\" when breaking through, leading to potential injury.\nC) Using lubricant or cutting oil is recommended to reduce friction and stress on the tools.\nD) Creating a pilot hole (up to 25% of the target size) is a recommended technique to help the larger bit start more easily.\n\nThe correct answer is B because applying constant, heavy pressure throughout the drilling process can lead to motor stress, overheating, and potential injury when the bit breaks through the metal.

To the best of my knowledge, you can't animate a view's layer using a UIView animateWithDuration: call.\n\nYou'll need to create a CABasicAnimation and add it to your view's layer yourself.\n\nIt's been a while since I've done CAAnimations, but let's see what I can dig up:\n\nAs atxe says, you should move the layer's anchor point to 1,.5 before doing this animation, so it rotates around the right edge. \n\nHere is some code from our \"Kevin \\& Kell\" cartoon app, that does an animation of a door swinging open on it's hinge:\n\n```\n//Open the door.\nrotateAnimation = [CABasicAnimation animation];\nrotateAnimation.keyPath = @\"transform\";\nrotateAnimation.fromValue = [NSValue valueWithCATransform3D:CATransform3DIdentity];\n\n//Pivot on the right edge (y axis rotation)\ntheTransform = CATransform3DIdentity;\n  theTransform.m34 = -1/100.0;\n  theTransform = CATransform3DRotate(theTransform, degreesToRadians(70), 0, 1, 0);\n\nrotateAnimation.toValue = [NSValue valueWithCATransform3D:theTransform];\n\nrotateAnimation.duration = 0.5;\n\n// leaves presentation layer in final state; preventing snap-back to original state\nrotateAnimation.removedOnCompletion = NO;\nrotateAnimation.fillMode = kCAFillModeBoth; \n\nrotateAnimation.repeatCount = 0;\nrotateAnimation.timingFunction = [CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut];\nrotateAnimation.delegate = self;\n[treeDoorImageView.layer addAnimation:rotateAnimation forKey:@\"transform\"];\n\n```\n\nThe transform logic is all but identical to yours (I use an m34 value of \\-1/100 for a more exaggerated 3D effect. Your \\-1/500 setting is more normal.)\n\nNote that instead of trying to do the animation from a UIView animation block, I create a CABasicAnimation, and set it's fromValue and toValue properties to the starting and ending transform values.\n\nYou should be able to use this code as a starting\\-point for your animation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When animating a view to rotate around its right edge like a door opening, which of the following approaches is correct?\n\nA) Use UIView's animateWithDuration: method to directly animate the view's layer transform property.\n\nB) Create a CABasicAnimation, set its keyPath to \"transform\", and add it to the view's layer.\n\nC) Modify the view's frame property using UIView animations to achieve the rotation effect.\n\nD) Use UIView's transition(with:duration:options:animations:completion:) method to rotate the view.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect. UIView animations are for animating view properties, not layer properties. They can't directly animate a view's layer transform.\n\nB) Correct. To animate layer properties like transforms, you need to create a CABasicAnimation, set its keyPath to \"transform\", and add it to the view's layer. This allows for more complex animations and 3D transforms.\n\nC) Incorrect. Modifying the frame property would only change the view's position and size, not create a 3D rotation effect.\n\nD) Incorrect. While UIView's transition method can be used for some view changes, it's not suitable for complex 3D transforms like rotating around an edge.\n\nThe correct approach involves creating a CABasicAnimation, setting its fromValue and toValue to the initial and final CATransform3D values, and adding this animation to the layer.

According to the information provided, the village radius is the greater of 32 blocks or the distance to the furthest door. If the carrot farm is partially within this radius, it can cause villagers to behave abnormally, becoming \"stuck\" facing the village. \n\nThe correct solution is to ensure the farm is either entirely inside or entirely outside the village boundaries.

But when we are reading about one dimensional wave, it moves up and down if it's going along x axis. How its possible?\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hDbyn.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If this is a wave on a piece of string then yes it does require (at least) two dimensions. That's because the amplitude of the wave is its displacement in the direction normal to the string. But there are lots of waves where the amplitude is not a physical displacement in a dimension, so these waves do not need a second direction.\n\nFor example consider a light wave. The amplitude of a light wave at a point is the value of the electromagnetic field at that point. For example for a one dimensional light wave travelling along the x axis the electric field of the light would be given by:\n\n$$ E(t,x) \\= E\\_0 \\\\sin(\\\\omega t \\- kx) $$\n\nThis wave doesn't need a second dimension because unlike the wave on a string it isn't oscillating in a physical dimension.\n\nFor completeness we should mention that even for mechanical waves, like a wave on a string, the motion in the second dimension is small compared to the distance travelled. In that case the wave is approximately one dimensional. Also note that as my2cts mentions there are waves like sound waves that are longitudinal i.e. the oscillation is along the direction of travel. So these waves need no second dimension. And finally, of course, the real world is three dimensional so one dimensional waves are a mathematical abstraction and we shouldn't be too worried that they don't really exist."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A one-dimensional wave is propagating along the x-axis.

While mechanical waves like those on a string do oscillate perpendicular to the direction of travel, this is not true for all types of waves.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while longitudinal waves can indeed exist in one dimension, they are not the only type of wave that can be represented in one dimension. Transverse waves can also be represented one-dimensionally under certain conditions.\n\nOption C is correct. As explained in the documentation, waves where the amplitude represents a non-spatial quantity (like electromagnetic field strength in light waves) can be truly one-dimensional. The example given of a light wave traveling along the x-axis, where the electric field is represented by E(t,x) = E_0 sin(\u03c9t - kx), demonstrates this concept.\n\nOption D is too extreme.

What is the most likely cause of this issue and its solution?\n\nA) The bridge interface br0 was not properly configured. The solution is to reconfigure the network interfaces file on the host.\n\nB) The guest VM's network configuration was incorrect.

This prevented traffic from flowing between the bridge interface and the internet. The solution is to add a rule to iptables that allows traffic on the bridge interface. This can be done with the command:\n\nsudo iptables -I FORWARD -i br0 -o br0 -j ACCEPT\n\nThis rule allows forwarding of traffic both incoming and outgoing on the br0 interface, which restores connectivity for the guest VMs. The other options, while potentially valid network configuration steps, do not address the specific issue caused by Docker's modification of the iptables rules."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/04/29", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/24374", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/6831/"], "docs_id": 24374, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I looked on similar questions but in vain.

This method takes two parameters: the center coordinates (in the map object's longitude/latitude format) and the zoom level. Using this method is the most direct and appropriate way to adjust the map's center to the desired coordinates (-8, 32).\n\nOption A is incorrect because adding another projection transformation is unlikely to solve the centering issue if the map is already rendering correctly.\n\nOption C is incorrect because CSS modifications cannot change the geographical center of a map; they can only affect its visual presentation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because changing the default coordinate system would be an overly complex solution and could potentially cause other issues with the map's functionality.\n\nThe setMapObjectCenter method provides a straightforward solution to the problem described in the question, making it the best choice among the given options."}, "34": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/09/15", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/113837", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/10596/"], "docs_id": 113837, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I used [FeatureServer](http://www.featureserver.org) before and I liked it.

It's available since version 9\\.3 and it works like charm with [Leaflet library](http://leafletjs.com).\n\nYou'd also probably need to do some routing if you want to build a RESTful app and you might find any of [these PHP framework](http://www.sitepoint.com/php-dependency-injection-container-performance-benchmarks/) handy."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is looking to create a web application that serves GeoJSON data from a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database and displays it on a map. Which of the following approaches would be most efficient and align with modern best practices?\n\nA) Use PHP to query the PostgreSQL database, then manually construct GeoJSON objects in PHP before sending them to the client.\n\nB) Utilize PostgreSQL's built-in GeoJSON functions to generate the data directly in the database, then serve it through a PHP API.\n\nC) Implement FeatureServer with its dependencies to handle GeoJSON generation and serving.\n\nD) Use MapServer to generate GeoJSON from the PostGIS data, then serve it through PHP.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most efficient and aligns with modern best practices. Using PostgreSQL's built-in GeoJSON functions (available since version 9.3) allows for direct generation of GeoJSON in the database, which is typically faster and more efficient than constructing it in PHP. This approach leverages the database's strengths and reduces the load on the application server. It also simplifies the PHP code, as it only needs to handle API routing and sending the pre-generated GeoJSON to the client. This method works well with modern mapping libraries like Leaflet, as mentioned in the documentation. The other options either involve more complex setups (FeatureServer, MapServer) or less efficient data processing (manually constructing GeoJSON in PHP)."}, "35": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/01/27", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/707560", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/293624/"], "docs_id": 707560, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So I have a url: `http://www.example.com/mp3?page=1`.

Bitorrent is a file transfer protocol, and utp was a lower level protocol that was developed by the writers of utorrent for more efficient transfers. They were bought over by Bittorrent Inc who maintain and the \"Mainline\" reference torrent client (aka the bittorrent client) and the torrent specifications. They also use the protocol for things like bitorrent sync.\n\nTorrents are decentralised by nature \\- no one 'provides' it. A torrent file or magnet link basically tells you \"This file consists of these chunks. If you ask at tracker X Y and Z, it will point you at people who have these chunks\". A magnet link is basically a link that provides this information without the need to download a file, but essentially there's no difference.\n\nA tracker is a directory of 'peers' who are downloading a file, and seeds who have downloaded and are sharing the file. If you have no tracker, peers and seeds can communicate directly over DHT to find each other. \n\nAs for clients, there are many, and anyone can create a torrent, add it to a tracker and share a file. If Bittorrent Inc disappeared tomorrow, the torrents will still flow."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the nature of BitTorrent and its ecosystem?\n\nA) BitTorrent is a centralized file-sharing service provided by BitTorrent Inc., with all torrents hosted on their servers.\n\nB) BitTorrent is solely a file transfer protocol, with no relation to tracking or peer discovery mechanisms.\n\nC) BitTorrent is a decentralized system that combines a file transfer protocol, tracker functionality, and peer discovery methods, allowing files to be shared without relying on a single provider.\n\nD) BitTorrent is a proprietary software application developed by BitTorrent Inc., and only their official client can be used to share files.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because BitTorrent is indeed a decentralized system that incorporates multiple components.

There is really only one last question that I can't resist asking, just to make sure I haven't misunderstood something.\n\nHow do the photons come into thermal equilibrium with the walls of the blackbody cavity if the walls are made of perfect conductors (an assumption being made in many articles on the subject)?\n\nThe reason we assume that the walls are made of conductors is to make sure that the electric and magnetic fields vanish at the boundary, which implies that the wavelengths need to perfectly fit within the walls of the container, such that the fields are zero there. But if the walls are made of perfect conductors, then won't the photons just reflect off of the surface (since conductors are good reflectors) without ever interchanging thermal energy with the walls? In that case, they would never come into equilibrium, and all of the calculations involving Boltzmann's distribution that is used in the derivation wouldn't work, since Boltzmann's distribution applies to small systems that are in thermal contact with a heat reservoir, and in this case I guess the photons are the small systems and the walls are meant to be the reservoirs.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The walls of the cavity are not made of conductor, since in this case they would be reflecting, instead of absorbing all the radiation.\n\nIn statistical physics one usually neglects the interactions leading to the establishment of the equilibrium. For example, the Maxwell\\-Boltzmann distribution does not depend on the collisions between the atoms, which are responsible for establishment of the equilibrium. Using developer's language, *this is not a bug, but a feature* \\- the statistical mechanics is based on logical reasoning, which allows to obtain very general results without sinking in gory details.\n\nIf course, in reality there are processes that lead to the establishment of the thermal equilibrium. E.g., if we start with a gas of two\\-level atoms, with transition frequency $\\\\omega$, and no radiation \\- we would expect, in the first approximation, that only the radiation modes of this frequency will come into equilibrium with atoms. For full equilibrium we need to account for higher order processes, such as, e.g., the Raman scattering. Thus, this may take longer for the Planck's distribution to establish, but it will eventually be achieved \\- we believe in this, as we believe in energy conservation.\n\n**Remark**  \n\nAs one can see from the answers here (and from a discussion around [a concurrent question](https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/645671/247642)), some confusion results from different ways one can define the black body radiation (BBR):\n\n* *BBR is a photon gas in thermal equilibrium* If the number of photons in mode $\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\lambda$ is described by canonical distribution,\n$$\np(n\\_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\lambda})\\\\propto e^{\\-\\\\beta \\\\hbar\\\\omega\\_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\lambda}n\\_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\lambda}},\n$$\nPlanck's formula readily follows. In this case the radiation does not necessarily have to be in a contact with a black body \\- the role of the body/material is to mediate the energy exchange between the photon modes, for the thermal equilibrium to establish. This is the point of view adopted above. A *perfect metal* reflects all the radiation, and cannot lead to thermodynamic equilibrium. On the other hand, a metal with finite conductivity can do so (although not very efficiently) \\- the filament of an incadescent lamp could be discussed in this context. Black body is defined here as a body that emits radiation that is already black.\n* *BBR is the radiation emitted by a black body* Here one postulates the properties of a black body \\- an object in thermal equilibrium that absorbs all the radiation incident at it. One can then calculate the radiation emitted by this object, which will be described by Planck's formula. This approach was taken historically, and presented in most introductory QM books, which is why many people stick to it. It's advantage is that one does not really need a cavity \\- the radiation is already black, which is how one applies Planck's formula to the radiation emitted by stars and other thermal sources, which are clearly non\\-equilibrium situations. (The cavity does appear in this approach, as a way to model a black body.) As I pointed out above, a metal (even a metal with a finite conductivity) cannot serve as a black body, because it does not absorb all the radiation incident on it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of black body radiation, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the walls of a blackbody cavity and the establishment of thermal equilibrium?\n\nA) The walls must be perfect conductors to ensure that electric and magnetic fields vanish at the boundary.\n\nB) The walls should be made of a material that absorbs all incident radiation to function as a true black body.\n\nC) Perfect conductors are ideal for the cavity walls as they reflect all photons, allowing for faster equilibrium.\n\nD) The material of the walls is irrelevant as long as the cavity is closed and maintained at a constant temperature.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The walls of a blackbody cavity should be made of a material that absorbs all incident radiation to function as a true black body. Perfect conductors would reflect all radiation, preventing the establishment of thermal equilibrium. The key to achieving black body radiation is the ability of the cavity walls to absorb and emit radiation efficiently, allowing for energy exchange between the radiation and the walls. This process leads to the thermal equilibrium described by Planck's radiation law. Options A and C are incorrect because perfect conductors would hinder the equilibrium process. Option D is incorrect because the material of the walls is crucial for the absorption and emission properties necessary for black body radiation."}, "37": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/04/06", "source": ["https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2588823", "https://Stackoverflow.com", "https://Stackoverflow.com/users/10728/"], "docs_id": 2588823, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a set of `N` items, which are sets of integers, let's assume it's ordered and call it `I[1..N]`.

I know there is a problem with dynamic storage allocation if we do away with the Heap, but isn't there a way around this, or perhaps, a way to improve on the Stack so that it can handle dynamic memory allocation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem with stacks is that you can't \"free\" memory unless it is on top of the stack. For instance, say you allocated 3 things of varying sizes:\n\n```\na = allocate(2000000); // 2000000 bytes\nb = allocate(1);\nc = allocate(5000000);\n\n```\n\nThe stack would have `a` on the bottom, `b` in the middle, and `c` on top. This becomes problematic if we want to free `b`:\n\n```\nfree(b); // b is not on top! We have to wait until c is freed!\n\n```\n\nThe workaround is to move all the data after `b` and shift if so that it comes after `a`. This works, but will require **5000000** copies in this case \\- something that will be much slower than a heap.\n\nThis is why we have a heap. While allocation may be slower than a stack (`O(log n)` vs `O(1)`), heaps allow freeing memory at an arbitrary location to be fast \\- `O(log n)`, compared to a stack's `O(n)`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software engineer is considering replacing the traditional stack and heap memory model with a single stack-based approach for all memory allocations.

The main challenge with using only a stack for all memory allocations is the inefficiency of freeing memory that's not at the top of the stack. As explained in the documentation, if you need to free memory in the middle of the stack (like freeing 'b' in the example), you would need to move all the data above it to fill the gap. This operation would have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the amount of data that needs to be moved. In contrast, heap allocation allows for efficient freeing of memory at arbitrary locations (typically O(log n)).\n\nOption A is incorrect because stack size is generally not related to the size of individual allocations.\nOption B is incorrect because stack allocation is typically faster than heap allocation for simple operations.\nOption D is incorrect because stacks do support recursive function calls; in fact, this is one of the primary uses of the call stack."}, "40": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/11/25", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/147518", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/47463/"], "docs_id": 147518, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have create new module, controller and config file. but the route is not working, showing 404\\.\n\n**Controller:**\n\n```\n<?php\nclass Magentotutorial_Helloworld_IndexController extends Mage_Core_Controller_Front_Action {        \n    public function indexAction() {\n        echo 'Hello World';\n    }\n\n    public function goodbyeAction() {\n    echo 'Goodbye World!';\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n**Config file.**\n\n```\n<config>    \n    <modules>\n        <Magentotutorial_Helloworld>\n            <version>0.1.0</version>\n        </Magentotutorial_Helloworld>\n    </modules>\n</config>\n\n<config>    \n    ...\n    <frontend>\n        <routers>\n            <helloworld>\n                <use>standard</use>\n                <args>\n                    <module>Magentotutorial_Helloworld</module>\n                    <frontName>helloworld</frontName>\n                </args>\n            </helloworld>\n        </routers>  \n    </frontend>\n</config>\n\n```\n\n**Module:**\n\n```\n<config>\n    <modules>\n        <Magentotutorial_Helloworld>\n            <active>true</active>\n            <codePool>local</codePool>\n        </Magentotutorial_Helloworld>\n    </modules>\n</config>\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If above syntax is not working for you then you can try below syntax to \n\n```\n<?php\n$installer = $this;\n\n$installer->startSetup();\n\ntry {\n        $tableName = $installer->getTable('newsletter_subscriber');\n        $installer->run(\" ALTER TABLE {$tableName} ADD `subscriber_email` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL  ; \");\n        $installer->endSetup();\n\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n        // to do\n}\n\n```\n\nand also check your `core_resource` table if entry is already there for your new version then revert and try again"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given Magento documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Magento module, you've created a new controller, config file, and module declaration, but the route is not working and showing a 404 error.

Why does this matter? In older PICs there are no instructions for reading data from ROM, so a method was developed called Table Read, in which data arrays are stored as a sequence of RETLW instructions (return from subroutine with literal in working register). \n\nThe 12F1501 is one of the new generation of enhanced mid range PICs which can use their index register to read the ROM directly, so it has no restrictions on placement of data in the ROM. However the XC8 compiler still insists on trying to align `stringtext` on page boundaries, and refuses to put it in page zero even when only a few bytes of initialization code are 'in the way'! This may result in running out of space even though you have a significant amount of 'free' ROM.\n\nThe easiest way around this problem is to simply force your arrays into a code section \\- then the compiler should align them on word boundaries with no gaps (like normal code). Just add a section specifier to each array definition, like this:\\- \n\n```\nconst __section(\"mystringtext\") unsigned char patterns[12] = {\n    0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0, 0,\n};    \n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When working with constant memory allocation in XC8 for a PIC microcontroller, which of the following statements is true regarding the placement of constant arrays in ROM?\n\nA) Constant arrays must always be placed in the first half of each program memory page for all PIC microcontrollers.\n\nB) The stringtext psect restriction applies only to newer generation enhanced mid-range PICs.\n\nC) For PICs like 12F1501, constant arrays can be placed anywhere in ROM without restrictions.\n\nD) The XC8 compiler always optimizes constant array placement without any need for developer intervention.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe question tests understanding of constant memory allocation in XC8 for different PIC microcontrollers. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the stringtext psect restriction (placing in the first half of each program memory page) only applies to 'baseline' PICs, not all PICs.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it reverses the truth - this restriction applies to older baseline PICs, not newer ones.\n\nOption C is correct.

This is for framing the walls in particular. I have the platform handled already with some TABs / GLs and other specialty hardware \\- lots of watching videos from Treehouses.com, Nelson Treehouse, and others.\n\nI'm thinking of going with screw shank nails for increased withdrawal strength of everything being held together, but didn't know if there is a reason that I should not do so and that smooth shank is actually preferred (such as because allowing some withdrawal is beneficial if that's even a thing).

Another option is the Simpson Strong\\-Tie framing screws which appear to be rated as superior to nails in shear (e.g. model SDWS16300\\) and plus have the withdrawal strength benefits. Nothing is going to be loaded from a withdrawal standpoint (other than indirectly from shear), but just thinking of stuff not getting creaky or loose over time.\n\nAny overall recommendations in terms of what is proper to use here would be appreciated \\- I've done quite a bit of reading on this but have never framed a structure before.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It doesn't matter. Here's why.\n\n* The movement in the walls (the stud\\-to\\-plate connections) should be miniscule. If your structure is swaying that much you have other issues, mostly involving a lack of diagonal bracing.\n* The wood at those locations will give (deform) enough to accommodate such movement, assuming SPF lumber.\n* Nearly all force at those connections is in shear. You will not see good quality screws shear off in this use case. For some peace of mind, use *three* for each stud.\n* The sheathing fasteners provide the connective force on the vertical axis, and they're also acting almost entirely in shear.\n\nI would use screws for everything (3\" for the framing, 2\" for the sheathing). If you'd rather not, ring\\-shank nails give a bit of extra hold, but they're not going to save you from a catastrophic failure if you have so much movement that you're relying on them. Your overall structure needs to be sound.\n\nI suggest screws because there is *some* movement in a tree\\-\\-more than with a ground\\-based structure\\-\\-and because they're nice to work with. They allow you to assemble components in awkward locations without smacking things around. They also allow easy error correction and on\\-the\\-fly design changes.\n\nI consider any deck\\-type screw from reputable manufacturers to be adequate. There's no need for \"rated\" screws here. If we were discussing the tree connections I'd say different.\n\nScrew shank nails don't offer much, in my experience. They'd work free in a similar manner to smooth nails, only they'd do a little twirl on the way out. Most wood pallets are built with hardwood (red oak), which explains the apparent hold of screw\\-shank nails."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In constructing a treehouse, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the choice of fasteners for framing the walls?\n\nA) Screw shank nails are essential for increased withdrawal strength and should always be used over smooth shank nails or screws.\n\nB) Simpson Strong-Tie framing screws are the only appropriate choice due to their superior shear ratings and withdrawal strength.\n\nC) Regular deck screws from reputable manufacturers are adequate for framing, with 3\" screws for framing and 2\" for sheathing being sufficient.\n\nD) Ring-shank nails are crucial for preventing catastrophic failure in case of excessive movement in the treehouse structure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation suggests that for a treehouse wall framing, regular deck screws from reputable manufacturers are adequate. It recommends using 3\" screws for framing and 2\" for sheathing. The answer emphasizes that the choice between nails and screws is not critical for this application, as most forces will be in shear rather than withdrawal. The document also notes that while ring-shank nails or specialty screws might offer slightly better hold, they aren't necessary for preventing structural failure, which is more dependent on proper overall design and bracing.

I asked a question on this topic earlier so this is an expansion of it.\n3\\. English isn't perfect yet, so if anyone can give either Russian, Arabic, or Mandarin translations of complex terms, this would also help very much.\n\nMany of the responses mentioned the big bang, and I thought that maybe it's continuous expansion, if the expansion is throughout and not new mass added on the edge of expansion, is this what balances out gravity? And if so, can its rate of movement (due to the loss of energy over time) decrease to a point that gravity overpowers it, and all mass would collapse in on itself?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The mere fact that the universe is expanding doesn't mean that it can't collapse, any more than a stone moving upward means it can't turn around and come back down. The universe eventually *would* stop expanding and collapse back to a Big Crunch if it had enough matter and no dark energy.\n\nBut there apparently *is* dark energy, and it is making the universe expand faster and faster, not slower and slower! The *anti*\\-gravity of dark energy has been the dominant force in the universe for the last five or six billion years. Matter is no longer particularly important. According to the standard [Lambda\\-CDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model) model of cosmology, dark energy now constitutes 69\\.11% percent of the energy density of the universe, and matter (both visible and dark) only 30\\.89%.\n\nAccording to the model, the universe will continue to expand forever, faster and faster, with the Friedmann scale factor $a(t)$ that determines its size eventually doubling every 11\\.6 billion years. The fraction of the energy density due to matter will approach 0%, while the fraction of the energy density due to dark energy will approach 100%. There is no Big Crunch in our future, according to the model.\n\nNote: There is no \"edge\" to the expanding universe. Galaxies are not expanding into empty space \"beyond the edge\". Instead, space is expanding everywhere between galaxies, and there is no distance far from us at which you stop finding galaxies. Also, there is no new mass being added.\n\nIf there were no dark energy, the universe would be expanding slower and slower rather than faster and faster. If there was enough matter, it would turn around and collapse. If there was not enough matter, it would keep expanding. It would be like a rocket launched from Earth. If a rocket isn't launched with escape velocity, it falls back to Earth. If it has exactly escape velocity, it can reach infinity with zero velocity. If it has more than escape velocity, it can reach infinity with positive velocity. This is similar to how the universe would work if there were no dark energy.\n\nCORRECTION\n\n11\\.6 billion years is actually the eventual $e$\\-folding time of the scale factor $a(t)$.

Our layout XML would like like following\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<layout version=\"0.1.0\">\n    <catalog_product_view>\n        <reference name=\"product.info\">\n            <block type=\"cms/block\" name=\"adsense_code\">\n                <action method=\"setBlockId\"><block_id>adsense_code</block_id></action>\n            </block>\n        </reference>\n        <reference name=\"product.info.options.wrapper.bottom\">\n           <action method=\"append\"><block>adsense_code</block></action>\n        </reference>\n    </catalog_product_view>\n</layout>\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to add Google AdSense to your Magento product pages. Which combination of steps would correctly implement this?\n\nA) Create a static block called 'adsense_code', add the AdSense snippet to it, modify the local.xml file to reference the block, and use <?php echo $this->getChildHtml('adsense_code');?> in the catalog/product/view.phtml template.\n\nB) Create a static block called 'adsense_code', add the AdSense snippet to it, modify the local.xml file to reference the block, and append it to the 'product.info.options.wrapper.bottom' reference in the layout XML.\n\nC) Add the AdSense snippet directly to the catalog/product/view.phtml template file without creating a static block or modifying the local.xml file.\n\nD) Create a widget with the AdSense code and use the Magento admin panel to place it on product pages without modifying any XML or template files.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the correct approach because it follows the best practices for Magento development. It involves creating a static block for the AdSense code, which allows for easy management of the content. The local.xml file is then modified to reference this block within the catalog_product_view layout handle. Finally, appending the block to the 'product.info.options.wrapper.bottom' reference ensures that the AdSense code will be displayed in the appropriate location on product pages without directly modifying template files. This method is more maintainable and allows for easier updates in the future.\n\nOption A is close but not optimal, as it requires modifying the template file directly. Option C is not recommended as it doesn't use Magento's layout system and makes future maintenance difficult. Option D, while user-friendly, doesn't provide the same level of control and may not work for all themes or layouts."}, "50": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/03/25", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/333552", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/84488/"], "docs_id": 333552, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I created an plugin for `afterGetProductPriceHtml()` and it works so far.

Search the Dash for *Startup Disk Creator* and click the Startup Disk Creator icon to open the **Make Startup Disk** window.\n\nThe USB flash drive that you use with Startup Disk Creator should be 2GB or larger, and for Ubuntu 18\\.04 and later it should be 4GB or larger. Startup Disk Creator will automatically format your USB flash drive to FAT32 and make it bootable. If you have only one USB flash drive plugged in to your computer, Startup Disk Creator will select it automatically. Be **very careful** to select the USB flash drive in the Make Startup Disk window in order to avoid overwriting the partition which Ubuntu is installed on, which may make Ubuntu unbootable. In the screenshot below you can see how the USB flash drive Device is identified by its model name, the same model name that appears under the **Drive** heading after *Model:* in the Disks (disk utility) application.\n\n[![Startup Disk Creator](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uuFmd.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uuFmd.png)  \n\n**Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu 16\\.04**\n\nYou can also move the *Stored in reserved extra space* slider back and forth to create some reserved extra space for persistent file storage across reboots. In Ubuntu 16\\.04 and later Startup Disk Creator no longer has the persistent file storage option.\n\n### How to make an Ubuntu Minimal USB using dd\n\nWhile the minimal iso image is handy, it isn't useful for installing on UEFI\\-based systems that you want to run in UEFI mode. The mini iso lacks the proper files for booting the computer in UEFI mode. Thus the computer will boot in BIOS compatibility mode, and the installation will be in BIOS mode.\n\n1. Download the Ubuntu Mini CD iso file for Ubuntu 18\\.04 or Ubuntu 20\\.04 from these links:\n\n\t* Ubuntu 20\\.04: [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer\\-amd64/current/legacy\\-images/netboot/mini.iso](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer-amd64/current/legacy-images/netboot/mini.iso)\n\t* Ubuntu 18\\.04: [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/bionic/main/installer\\-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/bionic/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso)Download the Ubuntu Mini CD iso file for Ubuntu 20\\.04 from [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer\\-amd64/current/legacy\\-images/netboot/mini.iso](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer-amd64/current/legacy-images/netboot/mini.iso). Download the file called mini.iso to your Downloads folder. You can download the mini.iso file to wherever on your computer that you want, but download it to your Downloads folder so that you can easily run the commands in the following steps without changing anything.\n2. Verify the md5 checksum of the Ubuntu mini CD iso file that you downloaded by running these commands:\n\n```\ncd ~/Downloads/\nmd5sum 'mini.iso'\n\n```\n\nIf you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux download the Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier tool from the official Microsoft Download Center. The Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier tool is a command line utility that computes MD5 or SHA1 cryptographic hashes for files.\n3. Check that the results of the command match the MD5 checksum of the mini.iso file on the [Ubuntu Documentation Installation Minimal CD](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD) webpage.\n4. Get a USB flash drive, 1GB or larger. Delete all the files from the USB flash drive. Mount the flash drive using the *Disks* disk utility.\n5. Check in the *Disks* disk utility to find out the device name of your USB flash drive. This is **very important** because if you use the wrong device name in step 6, you will overwrite your whole operating system instead of writing to the USB flash drive. So check the USB flash drive device name twice. It should be something like `/dev/sd*` where instead of the \\* character there is a lower case letter like a, b, c, etc. In the following step I am assuming that the device name is `/dev/sdc`, but the device name of your USB drive could be something else like `/dev/sda` or `/dev/sdb` so check the device name of your USB drive twice and make sure that you get it right in step 6!\n6. Open the terminal or Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2 and run the following commands:\n\n```\ncd ~/Downloads/  \nsudo -i  \ndd if='mini.iso' of=/dev/sdc bs=4096  ## make sure that the device name of your USB drive is correct!\n\n```\n\nThe `dd if='mini.iso' of=/dev/sdc bs=4096` command should take only a few seconds to complete on most computers because the mini.iso is a small file, less than 60MB. The result of running this command will be a bootable Ubuntu mini USB.\n7. Boot the computer from the Ubuntu mini live USB. The Ubuntu mini live USB should boot successfully and show a menu screen.\n8. If you select the Install option (the complete install, not the cli install) from the menu screen in Step 7, then you can select other options during the Ubuntu installation process to download all the packages that you need to perform a complete Ubuntu installation. Select the *Ubuntu desktop* package collection from the list of predefined collections of software in the Software selection screen in the Ubuntu mini CD installer. When you restart the system at the end of the installation, you will have a working Ubuntu desktop with the default desktop environment.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDcz0.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDcz0.png)\n\n### How to create a bootable USB stick on OS X/macOS\n\n* [How do I get my Mac to boot from an Ubuntu USB key?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/28495/how-do-i-get-my-mac-to-boot-from-an-ubuntu-usb-key/655232#655232)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to create a bootable Ubuntu USB drive on different operating systems.

It is a behavioural study of the impact of traffic on certain mammals and i have approximately 500 rows (one for each type of vehicle) across 3 years. However, there is variable stating if there was a 'behavioural response' or not (Y/N). This I had planned to use in a 'binary logistic regression' as the response variable. However, many of the rows indicate no response and therefore the continuous variables in the dataset (distance to vehicle etc..) have not been filled in, leaving many blanks!\n\nShould I be performing the regression based on a small subset of the data e.g. fewer rows? and if so does this have to only be the complete rows. Any help on how to proceed with this problem would be appreciated\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe what you want to do is perform [data imputation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)) Here is a good quick (16 pages) pdf on imputation from [Columbia](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/missing.pdf).\n\nGenerally if you have a large enough set of data and your NAs/NANs account for \\~10% of your data, you can simply remove the affected rows. If removing data will not work for you then you should look into imputation. Simple approaches include taking the average of the column and use that value, or if there is a heavy skew the median might be better. A better approach, you can perform regression or nearest neighbor imputation on the column to predict the missing values. Then continue on with your analysis/model.\n\nAnother approach would be to build a [RandomForest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) classifier. RandomForest models can neutrally deal with missing data by ignoring them when deciding splits. Berkeley has a good write up on [RandomForests](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm). If you choose to go down this road there is also a good paper discussing NAs in tree based models: [*An Investigation of Missing Data Methods for Classification Trees Applied to Binary Response Data*](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jsimonof/jmlr10.pdf) by Ding and Simonoff.\n\nIf you are using python, the Scipy library has an [interpolation](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.interp.html) function which produces data points from within a range of known discrete data points. This is another way to fill in missing data.\n\nHope this helps!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a behavioral study of the impact of traffic on mammals, you have a dataset with 500 rows (one for each type of vehicle) across 3 years.

This often happens because the relevant line in the sources list file is commented out. The solution, as demonstrated in the top answer, is to uncomment the appropriate line in the sources list file (e.g., /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda-X-X-local.list, where X-X is the CUDA version).

While the following is not a complete answer, here is what I would try.\n\n---\n\nConsider the operator $$L u(x) \\= \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (a(x) \\\\nabla u(x)),$$ where $$a(x) \\= (\\\\operatorname{dist}(x, \\\\partial \\\\Omega))^{\\-p}$$ for some $p \\> 0$. By general arguments there is a \\`solution' to the Dirichlet problem $$\\\\begin{cases} Lu \\= 0 \\& \\\\text{in $\\\\Omega$,} \\\\\\\\ u \\= f \\& \\\\text{on $\\\\partial \\\\Omega$,} \\\\end{cases} $$ in an appropriate sense. On the stochastic processes side the argument might be the following: there is a diffusion process $X\\_t$ with values in $\\\\Omega$ corresponding to $L$, and $u(x)$ is simply the expected value of $f(X\\_{\\\\tau\\-})$, where $\\\\tau$ is the life\\-time of $X$.\n\nClearly $u$ satisfies the (strong) maximum principle, so it has no local extrema in $\\\\Omega$, unless constant. The question is whether $u$ is continuous at the boundary.\n\nA standard approach in potential theory is to find *barriers*: superharmonic functions which vanish continuously at the boundary. In our case $$h(x) \\= \\\\operatorname{dist}(x, \\\\partial \\\\Omega)$$ appears to be a barrier at every boundary point. It clearly vanishes continuously at the boundary, so let us see if it is superharmonic.\n\nFix $x \\\\in \\\\Omega$ and choose $z \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega$ so that $\\|x \\- z\\| \\= \\\\operatorname{dist}(x, \\\\partial \\\\Omega)$. Define $v(y) \\= \\|y \\- z\\|$. Then $h(y) \\\\le v(y)$ for all $y$ and $h(x) \\= v(x)$, so $L h(x) \\\\le L v(x)$.
