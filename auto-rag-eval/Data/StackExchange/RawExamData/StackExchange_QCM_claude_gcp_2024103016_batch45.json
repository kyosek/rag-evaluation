The information provided suggests that direct charging of smartphones with small solar panels is often ineffective due to the phone's battery charging control mechanisms. The top answer indicates that even a 5V/500mA panel was insufficient for direct charging, and recommends using a power bank as a buffer. This method is described as more reliable and helps protect the phone's battery. Options A and D are incorrect because the 0.36W panel is too weak to charge the iPhone effectively.

Sometimes the cursor will jump back on the input line, and sometimes it will show old text that should not be there. Sometimes it splits into two lines such that I continue typing on the line above.

Which of the following is the most likely cause and solution to this problem?\n\nA) The PS1 string is missing color reset codes, causing text to overlap. Add \\e[0m at the end of the PS1 string.\n\nB) The PS1 string is not properly wrapped with \\[ and \\], causing the shell to miscalculate the prompt length. Wrap non-printing characters with these escape sequences.\n\nC) The terminal emulator is incompatible with custom prompts. Switch to a different terminal application.\n\nD) The PS1 string is too long, causing line wrapping issues. Shorten the prompt by removing some elements.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of the display issues is that the PS1 string is not properly wrapped with \\[ and \\] for non-printing characters. These escape sequences tell the shell which parts of the prompt don't take up space on the screen, allowing it to correctly calculate the prompt length. Without them, the shell may miscalculate, leading to the described issues with cursor positioning and line wrapping.\n\nThe correct solution, as implied in the top answer, is to use proper wrapping.

I've just started leading a small team of software developers.\n\nI would like to know what are the main things a programmer expects from the senior programmer or what are the things we should avoid while managing a team. \n\nAlso, I would like to know how to keep the programmers satisfied and create a productive \\& completeness environment for my team.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Things that seem to work well for me:\n\n* **Give meaningful work and encourage ownership** \\- even when a problem arises, don't solve it, talk through it and give the person insights so they can solve it themselves.\n\t+ edit \\- addition \\- this was also meant to include \\- stay the heck out of details. Assume your people know enough to do the assignment without micromanagement or the requirement to constantly check in. Build a set of guidelines for when they *should* check in \\- which should only be when the work is either done or so truly messed up that serious intervention is needed. If possible, stay away from even needing to be in the loop on interteam support issues.\n* **Be honest** \\- that has several corollaries:\n\t+ Be honest about yourself \\- \"I won't have time until Tuesday\", \"I've never done that, here's my best guess\", etc.\n\t+ Be honest about the team and where they fit in the company \\- if you know something about the business stuff, tell them if you can, and tell them what you know as the straight facts.\n\t+ Be honest in giving feedback \\- don't mince words or soft pedal if you have give negative feedback. That's different from \"brutally honest\" \\- you can still have compassion, but if something's wrong, say so.\n\t+ Be honest when you know the work is more about redtape than getting something meaningful done. Into everyone's life, some meaningless work will fall. Don't pretend it's meaningful. Call it like is, so you can all focus on getting past it and getting on to something useful.\n* **Listen**. At least 50% of your job is listening, maybe more. You have suddently become responsible not just for the technical work, but the people doing it. You have to listen to learn not just about the problems the team is having, but also how your people approach the problem and what the team's shortcomings as a group are.\n\t+ Important corollary \\- listening can directly lead to point \\#1 \\- giving meaningful work \\- engineers are great at coming up with ways to make development easier. You can't approve everything, but where the idea is good, give the engineer the assignment, and they have essentially done you work for you \\- they created the meaningful work and told you just what it is.\n* **Say \"thank you\"**. I know, it seems obvious. While we all love money, better tools, a nicer work environment and promotions \\- the way to get to these things is by a series of good efforts, each of which deserves a \"thank you\". \"Thank you\" is totally free, you'll never run out of them, and knowing that your manager has seen and appreciated your hard work is definitely motivating.\n* **Spend time on the big picture**, even if it means sacrificing some portion of the day to day work that got you the position. It's probably true that you can code better than some of your people, but if you don't spend a decent set of time on the big picture \\- the team, the overall project direction, the state of your codebase, the efficiency of your processes, your team's environment \\- then you won't be doing the job they need you to do.\n* **Learn to be a buffer for your team**. Engineering teams work best when they have the time to do ... engineering. Corporate bureaucracy is not engineering. Anything you can do to take the annoying 1 per year/month/week meetings with external people is better. NOTE: That doesn't mean agile meetings with stake holders \\- that's engineering, your team needs to be there for that. I mean the meeting with facilities who wants to put a loud shrieking piece of machinery near your team, or the process group that wants your team to fill out papers in triplicate before any code gets checked in. You are the flak absorption system.\n* **Assume problem people are not evil**, they are people who want to do good but haven't figured out how yet. You're not going to be able to fix everyone, but often the first few complete screw ups are as much a factor of failed communication as they are incompetence or deliberate malice. If you start with the assumption that people are not evil, you have a decent hope of avoiding a number of the evil boss archetypes of the list above.\n\nAnd probably most important... **respect**. If you honestly can't respect the members of you team, you have to work on changing that (whether that's teaching people or changing your headcount). Give respect day one and you will get it back, treat people with a lack of respect and you will never get respect in return.\n\nTaken together, if you do most of these things, most of the time then your team will give you the benefit of the doubt when you show you are human and totally screw something up yourself. :) Every boss has their own drawbacks, and it's as much about working out a relationship with your team where they can help you compensate for your weaknesses as you help them with theirs."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a newly appointed team leader for a group of software developers, which combination of actions would be most effective in creating a productive and satisfying work environment?\n\nA) Solve all technical problems for the team, conduct daily check-ins, and focus primarily on coding tasks\nB) Give meaningful work, be honest, listen actively, and spend time on the big picture\nC) Micromanage team members, keep business information confidential, and prioritize bureaucratic tasks\nD) Assume problem employees are malicious, focus on day-to-day coding, and minimize team interactions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the correct answer as it aligns with the key points mentioned in the documentation for effective team leadership. \n\nGiving meaningful work encourages ownership and allows team members to grow.

The pattern `**/*(.DN)` expands to the pathnames of all regular files (not directories etc.; this is what the glob qualifier `(.)` does) in or beneath the current directory. These will, by default, be orderer in lexicographical order. The `(DN)` glob qualifier has the same effect as setting `dotglob` and `nullglob`, respectively, in the `bash` shell (i.e. it makes the pattern match hidden names and also makes it expand to nothing at all if it doesn't match anything).\n\nInstead of `(.)` to only list regular files, one could instead use `(^/)` to list non\\-directories.\n\nIn `bash`, you can do something similar with\n\n```bash\nshopt -s globstar dotglob nullglob\nfor pathname in **/*; do\n    [[ ! -d $pathname ]] && printf '%s\\n' \"$pathname\"\ndone\n\n```\n\nwhich prints the lexicographically sorted pathnames of all non\\-directories (including hidden files) recursively."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following commands would correctly list all non-directory files recursively in alphabetical order, including hidden files, without showing directory names?\n\nA) ls -R | grep -v '/$'\nB) find . -type f | sort\nC) print -C1 **/*(.DN)\nD) tree -L 2 -P '*'\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) This command lists files recursively but doesn't handle hidden files and may include some directory names.\nB) This command comes close but doesn't handle hidden files by default.\nC) This is the correct zsh command that meets all the requirements: it lists files recursively, includes hidden files, excludes directories, and sorts alphabetically.\nD) This command shows a tree structure and includes directory names, which doesn't meet the requirements.\n\nThe correct answer (C) uses zsh-specific globbing features:\n- `**/*` for recursive matching\n- `(.DN)` glob qualifier where:\n  - `.` matches only regular files\n  - `D` includes hidden (dot) files\n  - `N` allows the pattern to expand to nothing if no matches are found\n- `print -C1` outputs the results in a single column\n\nThis command provides the most precise match to the stated requirements."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/10/06", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/108535", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/157550/"], "docs_id": 108535, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: On Stack Overflow, a question can be \"open,\" \"closed,\" or \"deleted\" (there are probably many other status but we will ignore them). \"Closed\" and \"deleted\" are quite terminal (a \"closed\" questions could be reversed, but it would require the questioner to rewrite the question, and other persons to notice the question is good enough.)\n\nI suggest to add a new status: hidden until re\\-edited.

With the current system, close and reopen is the preferred method. 99% of the time, this results in a closed question and no further action. This system would just delay the closing by a few days.\n\nAdditionally, automatically re\\-opening the question on an edit is not the proper metric \\- An actual human needs to look at the question and determine whether or not the problems have been fixed. How many times have you seen edits like: \n\n> **Edit:** Please don't close this question. I can't find a site where it is more on\\-topic, and I am very much in need of some expert advice.\n\nwhich only serve to bump the question to the top and accelerate the closing process.\n\nAn automatic reopen is easy if the poster is willing to put forth some effort and fix the question.

Sometimes, I get a comment or flag for attention requesting a reopen without making any change to the question, after an edit reverting to the original, or a non\\-constructive edit. \n\nI've closed 156 questions in my stint as a community mod thus far.

This approach ensures proper safety and structural integrity of the roof."}, "6": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/02/16", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/56349", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/7825/"], "docs_id": 56349, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When an order is placed, I would like to modify some of the products options.\n\nI then made an observer on \"sales\\_order\\_place\\_after\" calling a function :\n\n```\n       public function sitreatmth($observer)\n   {\n        $_order = $observer->getEvent()->getOrder();\n        $_order_id = $_order->getId();\n\n        $_items = $_order->getAllItems();\n\n            $shipmentItems = array();\n            $shipmentItemsMth = array();\n\n            foreach($_items as $_item) \n            {\n                $_options = $_item->getProductOptions();            \n\n                foreach($_options[\"options\"] as $option) \n                {\n                    if($option['label'] == 'FabTime') \n                    {\n                        if ($option['value']==2)\n                        {\n                            $shipmentItems [$_item->getId()] = $_item->getQtyOrdered();\n\n                            foreach($_options[\"options\"] as $option) \n                            {\n                                if($option['label'] == 'ShipMth') \n                                {\n                                    $shipmentItemsMth [$_item->getId()] = $option['value'];\n                                }\n                            }\n\n                        }\n                    }       \n                }\n\n            $CptTNT=0;\n            $CptSTD=0;\n\n            foreach ($shipmentItemsMth as $Mth)\n            {\n                if ($Mth=='TNT') {$CptTNT++;}\n                else if ($Mth=='STD') {$CptSTD++;}\n            }\n\n            if (($CptTNT!=0)&&($CptSTD!=0))     // CONFLIT tout TNT\n            {\n                foreach ($shipmentItems as $itemshp)\n                {\n                    $_item=$_order->getItemById($itemshp);\n\n                    $_options = $_item->getProductOptions();  \n                    $row_id_cnt = 0;\n                    $row_id = 0;        \n                    $Flag = 0;\n\n                    foreach($_options[\"options\"] as $option) \n                    {\n                        if($option['label'] == 'ShipMth') \n                        {\n\n                            $row_id = $row_id_cnt;\n                            $Flag = 1;\n                        }\n                        $row_id_cnt++;\n                    }       \n                    if ($Flag == 1)\n                    {   \n                        $_options[\"options\"][$row_id]['value'] = \"TNT\";\n                        $_options[\"options\"][$row_id]['print_value'] = \"TNT\";\n                        $_options[\"options\"][$row_id]['option_value'] = \"TNT\";\n                    }\n                    $_item->setProductOptions($_options);\n                    $_order->setSomeNonExistentProperty(true); \n                    $_order->save();    \n\n                    ///DEBUG\n                    $_order = $observer->getEvent()->getOrder();\n                    $_item=$_order->getItemById($itemshp);\n\n                    $_options = $_item->getProductOptions();  \n\n                    foreach($_options[\"options\"] as $option) \n                    {\n                        if($option['label'] == 'ShipMth') \n                        {\n                            Mage::log($option['value']);\n                        }\n                    }           \n\n                }   \n            }\n\n            if ($_order->getId() && !empty($shipmentItems) && $_order->canShip()) \n            {\n                $shipment = Mage::getModel('sales/service_order', $_order)->prepareShipment($shipmentItems);\n                $shipment->save();\n            }\n        }\n   }\n\n```\n\nThe Debug section returns the good values, but, in backend, when i access my order details, the product options are not changed\u2026.\n\nThank you for your help,\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: try to set up as a admin store when you are saving the product.\nSo from the beginning of the code save the current store id in a $current variable.

When an electron and proton are bound say within a hydrogen atom, are there any measurable effects upon the proton when its electron goes through the process of absorbing, obtaining a higher energy state, releasing an identical photon, and returning to its ground state?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Mode expansion of the EM field usually uses modes that are delocalized in space. Photons are basically\\* *quanta of amplitude* of corresponding modes. This means that they indeed correspond to delocalized excitations of the EM field.\n\nJust as with electrons in quantum mechanics, we can localize a single photon to a wave packet by superposing several single\\-photon states with *different* excited modes. This will no longer be the \"pure\" photon with a definite frequency that we discussed above. But it's the cost of localization. We see the same result when forming a wave packet from electron's definite\\-momentum states.\n\nBut, just as electrons, in interactions the photons, however delocalized their wavefunction is, act as *point\\-like* objects. Whenever something absorbs or scatters a photon, this happens (from a classical observer's point of view) at a particular spot, and only a single spot for a single absorption event. Examples of such interaction are registration of a photon by a pixel on a photographic sensor, or polymerization of a patch of [photoresist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresist) in a lithographic process.\n\n---\n\n\\*I discuss this in a bit more detail in the last section of [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/630627/21441), that, although talking about phonons, is also relevant to photons."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In quantum electrodynamics, when considering the interaction between a photon and an atom, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Photons always interact with atoms as perfectly localized particles at a specific point in space.\n\nB) The absorption of a photon by an atom occurs over a large, delocalized area due to the wave-like nature of photons.\n\nC) Photons behave as both delocalized excitations of the electromagnetic field and as point-like particles in interactions, depending on the context.\n\nD) The localization of a photon wave packet has no effect on its frequency or energy.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. This question tests understanding of the dual nature of photons in quantum electrodynamics. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while photons do interact at specific points during absorption or scattering, their states are not always perfectly localized.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it contradicts the point-like nature of photon interactions observed in phenomena like photoelectric effect or discrete atomic transitions.\n\nOption C is correct because it accurately describes the dual behavior of photons. In free space, photons can be described as delocalized excitations of the electromagnetic field. However, in interactions with matter (like atoms), they behave as point-like particles, with the interaction occurring at a specific location.\n\nOption D is incorrect because localizing a photon into a wave packet does affect its frequency characteristics.

It works much like *only* does in this regard, which is another focusing modi\ufb01er.\n\nBut *just* is still considered an adverb here, not an adjective. The same thing happens with *nearly everybody* and *nearly finished*: in both cases, *nearly* is still held to be an adverb even when modifying nouns and pronouns. If this idea seems strange, and I know it may, then this is because \u201cadverb\u201d is a junk\\-yard category that we throw just about everything into when we run out of names for word classes.

This can include nouns and pronouns as well as larger constituents like phrases and clauses.\n\nThe particular use mentioned by BillJ as a focusing modi\ufb01er of arbitrary constituents falls under [OED *just* (adverb), sense 6](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/102192#eid40268469):\n\n> 6.

If you simply tick through all those reasons to determine whether a question is a good question, it's going to be extremely hard to find *any* questions on Stack Overflow that should remain open. There is always *more* code that you could show, *more* evidence of effort, *more* details you could add, ways you could be *more* specific, *some* degree of subjectivity involved, etc. etc.\n\nI think it works better to read the question, evaluate it on its own merits, and decide whether or not it's a good question. If you decide that the question is poor and needs to be closed, *then* you open the close box and decide which one of the given reasons is the most appropriate. If none of them fit, you choose the \"other\" option and write a custom reason.\n\nWe don't want to be closing questions in spite of themselves.

The low\\-energy betas are absorbed in the intermediate layer of air and the further you get from the source the more betas are absorbed by the air until you reach the maximum range in air (for the maximum beta energy 2\\.28 MeV of 90Y this range is 8\\.8 meter, for the maximum beta energy 0\\.546 MeV of 90Sr this range is 2 meter) and all betas are absorbed. The inverse square law for a beta emitter is valid up to approx. 30 cm in air, at greater distances the inverse square law deviates further and further.\n\nNote: because the half\\-life of the daughter 90Y (64 hours) is very much shorter than that of the mother 90Sr (29 years), there is absolute equilibrium between mother and daughter, i.e. the activity of the daughter 90Y is equal to that of the mother 90Sr."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A student is conducting an experiment with a strontium-90 (90Sr) beta source and a Geiger counter.

The inverse square law doesn't hold perfectly for beta radiation over larger distances due to the energy spectrum of beta particles emitted. Lower energy beta particles are more easily absorbed by air, and this effect becomes more pronounced at greater distances. As the distance increases, a larger proportion of the lower energy beta particles are absorbed before reaching the detector, causing the observed count rate to decrease more rapidly than predicted by the inverse square law alone.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Earth's magnetic field would not significantly affect beta particles over such short distances.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the inverse square law applies to all types of radiation that spread out spherically from a point source, including beta radiation. However, other factors (like air absorption) can cause deviations from this law.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while detector geometry can affect measurements, it wouldn't cause the specific deviation described in the question.

When people hear \"abstraction\", their mind usually jumps to \"abstract class\", but here it's used in this more fundamental sense. Basically, think of it like this: if you're determined to avoid any mention of GUI framework\u2013specific names, what data structures and functions you need to come up with to be able to express the essential features of the presentation logic when writing the presenter? Or perhaps: if you expect a lot of fiddling with the details of the view (color\\-coding, kinds of controls for certain actions, layout, ...), how can you express what these things are about in a way that's relatively resilient to these changes? E.g. a simple example of that is, instead of having an enum `{ Green, Yellow, Red }`, you use `{ OK, Warning, Error }`. The end product of this process is what constitutes your abstraction: the functions, data structures and interfaces at the view\\-facing boundary.\n\nSo, for the situation you're describing, a way to do it would be:\n\n1. The view receives the \"open context menu\" event for a list item\n2. The view (directly or through some mechanism) invokes a \"get actions for \\[item]\" method on the presenter. In this case, it's probably best if the view can obtain the return value of this method, rather than wait for the presenter to subsequently push the result into the view by some other mechanism (that's possible too, but likely more convoluted; e.g., you could pass a lambda as the second parameter and have the presenter call it).\n3. The presenter calls something that knows how to produce a list of actions (or something describing the actions) given the current item, then passes the result along (perhaps after embellishing it with some additional presentation\\-related data).\n4. The view converts these actions into controls (context menu items), or calls something that can do the conversion for it, or relies on some framework mechanism that can, say, instantiate a template, or whatever.\n5. The context menu is shown.\n\nE.g., you could do this within a slot that's connected to the customContextMenuRequested signal.\n\nBut don't stop there. I said that this is \"*a* way to do it\" on purpose. Explore a couple of other options, perhaps even some that are a bit out there, all the while keeping [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) in mind. The goal now is not to predict some future change, but to attempt to get a fresh perspective on the problem.\n\nFor example, suppose that, since there are only a couple of possible actions (bear with me if that's not actually the case), your users ask you to replace the context menu with a set of small buttons (some enabled, some disabled), shown inline with the list item, so that they can save a click. Assuming that it's cheap to determine the available actions, in this case it makes sense to get them together with the items, when first populating the list box. Maybe that's a better abstraction. Perhaps that will let you do things like live update of available actions, in case the state of the selected item can be changed in a different view that's simultaneously visible.\n\nOK, now come back to your current implementation that is based around a context menu. Perhaps it makes sense to do this *anyway*. Perhaps you can calculate all that you need up front, eliminating the need to call the presenter in this case. Nobody can tell you what's the best option here \\- you get to decide based on your understanding of the domain. You get to decide if this is something worth pursuing or if you should apply YAGNI. Another thing to take into account is which of the approaches you've considered offers least friction with the language and the framework, while retaining a good amount of design benefits that you're after \\- because, while you can, in principle, ignore the framework in code, there are practical concerns that mean that you can't really ignore all aspects of it (to various degrees).\n\nNow, the problem is, the views tend to be very fiddly (they tend to be tweaked a lot, especially in the beginning), so it's hard to come up with these abstractions and have them be reasonably stable. Also, people tend to make presenters (and classes in general) too big, responsible for too many things, and thus they hardcode a lot of wrong assumptions into them; this leads to a lot of accidental internal coupling. But then parts of these presenters need to change in different ways, at different rates, for different reasons, and this accidental coupling makes changing things tedious. So one thing that helps is: think smaller, and distribute responsibilities. There doesn't have to be a single presenter \\- you can have a number of collaborating classes; adjust the pattern to suit your specific problem better.\n\nAlso, GUI frameworks and control libraries help in some ways (e.g., they might provide a databinding mechanism, eliminating some boilerplate), but they can also bring in some constraints (e.g., they might be geared more towards getting things up and running quickly for a certain set of scenarios, but can get in your way if you try to do something outside of that, or they might impose a certain style of programming). So you have to find a balance between designing for your needs and not working against the framework too much.\n\n> \"Lets say I have a GUI application which tries to adhere to\n> Model\\-View\\-Presenter (MVP) as best as possible.\"\n\nI know that when you don't yet have a deep understanding of a concepts, it's helpful to follow a set of rules, but this is bit of a double\\-edged sword. There are several variations of the MVP pattern; I'm mentioning this to show you that people have been adjusting the pattern to better suit their specific needs or to work better with the language and the framework they use. So don't be afraid to introduce your own tweaks if you need to."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In an MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture for a GUI application, you need to implement a context menu for items in a list box.

Which of the following approaches best adheres to MVP principles while allowing for flexible, state-dependent menu creation?\n\nA) Have the View directly access the Model to determine item states and create the appropriate menu items.\n\nB) Pass GUI framework objects to the Presenter so it can directly manipulate the context menu.\n\nC) Implement a method in the Presenter that returns available actions for an item as data, which the View then converts into menu items.\n\nD) Create a separate Controller component to handle all context menu logic independently of the MVP structure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C best adheres to MVP principles while solving the given problem. This approach keeps the separation of concerns intact:\n\n1. The Presenter remains independent of GUI framework specifics but can still provide necessary presentation logic.\n2. The View doesn't directly access the Model, maintaining the MVP structure.\n3. It allows for flexibility in how the View ultimately represents the actions (e.g., as context menu items, inline buttons, etc.).\n4. This method can be easily adapted if requirements change, such as needing to pre-fetch action data for performance reasons.\n\nOption A violates MVP by having the View directly access the Model.

This is achieved by including a term \u03c3X in c(n) that correlates strongly with r(n), where \u03c3 can be chosen to be arbitrarily large. This contradicts the notion that the ratio cov[c(n),r(n)]/var[r(n)] should always be close to zero, making option B the correct answer.

This matrix has all zero\\-average vectors in its null space. If I use (MATLAB's) QR factorization (`[Q,R,E] = qr(A');`) the resulting $Q$ matrix is a dense $n \\\\times n$ matrix.

Trying to trace through the code it seems to work by recursively applying an LU\\-decomposition with pivoting. However, I can't completely understand what it's doing and certainly don't understand why it's working. The comments and function names say it is computing an \"LUQ\" decomposition:\n\n```\nfunction [L,U,Q] = luq(A,do_pivot,tol)\n%  PURPOSE: calculates the following decomposition\n%             \n%       A = L |Ubar  0 | Q\n%             |0     0 |\n%\n%       where Ubar is a square invertible matrix\n%       and matrices L, Q are invertible.\n%\n\n```\n\nIs this decomposition well known? Does it go by another name?\n\nThis algorithm seems to work very well. In the example above, this decomposition produces the \"ideal\" sparse basis for the null space $N$.\n\nSo my current question, 2\\) is there a corresponding academic paper describing this method for computing a sparse basis for the null space of a matrix via recursive LU decomposition?\n\n\\*I've had no luck trying to contact Pawel Kowal for more information.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *On the LUQ decomposition*\n--------------------------\n\nThe algorithm implemented in `luq` (see reference given below) computes bases for the left/right null spaces of a sparse matrix $A$. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, there seems to be no thorough discussion of this particular algorithm in the literature. In place of a reference, let us clarify how/why it works and test it a bit.\n\nThe `luq` routine inputs an $m$\\-by\\-$n$ matrix $A$ and outputs an $m$\\-by\\-$m$ invertible matrix $L$, an $n$\\-by\\-$n$ invertible matrix $Q$ , and an $m$\\-by\\-$n$ upper trapezoidal matrix $U$ such that: (i) $A\\=LUQ$ and (ii) the pivot\\-less columns/rows of $U$ are zero vectors. For example, \n$$\n\\\\underbrace{\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\\n1 \\& 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}}\\_A \\= \\\\underbrace{\\\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n1 \\& 1\n\\\\end{pmatrix}}\\_L \\\\underbrace{\\\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0\n\\\\end{pmatrix}}\\_U \\\\underbrace{\\\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 1\n\\\\end{pmatrix}}\\_Q\n$$\n\nPoint (ii) allows one to construct bases for the left/right null spaces of $A$.\n\n*Bases for Left/Right Null Spaces of $A$*\n\nLet $r \\= \\\\operatorname{Rank}(A)$. Suppose we can compute the exact $LUQ$ decomposition of $A$ as described above. Then,\n\n* The $n\\-r$ columns of $Q^{\\-1}$ corresponding to the pivotless columns of $U$ are a basis for the null space of $A$. This follows from the fact that $\\\\operatorname{null}(A) \\= \\\\operatorname{null}(A Q^{\\-1}) \\= \\\\operatorname{null}(L U)$ and that the pivotless columns of $U$ are zero vectors by construction.\n* The $m\\-r$ rows of $L^{\\-1}$ corresponding to the pivotless rows of $U$ are a basis for the left null space of $A$. This follows from the fact that $\\\\operatorname{null}(A^T) \\= \\\\operatorname{null}((L^{\\-1} A)^T) \\= \\\\operatorname{null}( (U Q)^T)$ and that the pivotless rows of $U$ are zero vectors by construction.\n\n*LUQ Algorithm*\n\nAssume that $m \\\\ge n$. (If $m \\< n$, then the `lu` command mentioned below outputs a slightly different $PA\\=LU$ factorization. Otherwise the LUQ decomposition is almost the same, and so, we omit this case.)\n\nGiven an $m$\\-by\\-$n$ matrix $A$, the LUQ decomposition calls MATLAB command `lu` with partial (i.e., just row) pivoting. `lu` implements a variant of the LU decomposition that inputs $A$ and outputs: \n\n1. $m$\\-by\\-$m$ permutation matrix $P$;\n2. $m$\\-by\\-$n$ lower trapezoidal matrix $\\\\tilde L$ with ones on the diagonal; and,\n3. $n$\\-by\\-$n$ upper triangular matrix $\\\\tilde U$\n\nsuch that $PA \\= \\\\tilde L \\\\tilde U$. Write:\n$$\n\\\\tilde U \\= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\tilde U\\_{11} \\& \\\\tilde U\\_{12} \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& \\\\tilde U\\_{22} \\\\end{bmatrix}\n$$ where $\\\\tilde U\\_{11}$ has nonzero diagonal entries, and hence, is invertible. \nAlso, let $e\\_i$ denote unit $m$\\-vectors equal to $1$ in the $i$th component and zero otherwise. The algorithm then builds:\n$$\nL \\= P^T \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\tilde L \\& e\\_{n\\+1} \\& \\\\cdots \\& e\\_m \\\\end{bmatrix} \n$$\nwhich is an $m \\\\times m$ invertible matrix, and\n$$\nU \\= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\tilde U\\_{11} \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& \\\\tilde U\\_{22} \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}\n$$ which is upper trapezoidal, and\n$$\nQ \\= \\\\begin{bmatrix} I \\& \\\\tilde U\\_{11}^{\\-1} \\\\tilde U\\_{12} \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& I \\\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwhich is an $n$\\-by\\-$n$ invertible matrix. To summarize, we obtain:\n$$\nA \\= L \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\tilde U\\_{11} \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& \\\\tilde U\\_{22} \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} Q \n$$ For the most part, that is all the algorithm does. However, if there are any nonzero entries in $\\\\tilde U\\_{22}$, then the algorithm will call `luq` again with input matrix containing all of the nonzero entries of $\\\\tilde U\\_{22}$. This last step introduces more zeros into $U$ and modifies the invertible matrices $L$ and $Q$. \n\nTo understand this last step, it helps to consider a simple input to `luq` like\n$$\nA \\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first call to `luq` with this input trivially gives $U\\=A$ with $L$ and $Q$ being the $3$\\-by\\-$3$ identity matrices. Since $U$ has nonzero entries, a second call is made to `luq` with input $1$, which outputs $L\\=U\\=Q\\=1$. This second decomposition is incorporated into the first one by making the second column of $L$ the first one and moving all the other columns to the right of it, and similarly, moving the third row of $Q$ to the first row and moving all the other rows below it. This yields,\n$$\nA \\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\ 1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ \n\nTo be sure, consider another simple example\n$$\nA \\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ \n 0 \\& 0 \\& a \\& 0 \\& b \\\\\\\\ \n 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& c \\\\\\\\ \n 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \n\\\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ where $a,b,c$ are nonzero reals. In the first pass through `luq` the algorithm again sets $U\\=A$ and $L$, $Q$ equal to the $5$\\-by\\-$5$ identity matrices. Since $U\\=\\\\tilde U\\_{22}$ has nonzero elements, `luq` is called again with input matrix\n$$\nB \\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \na \\& b \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& c \n\\\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ This is incorporated into the first decomposition by permuting $L$ and $Q$ as shown:\n$$\nA \\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \n0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \n\\\\end{pmatrix} \n\\\\begin{pmatrix} a \\& b \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ \n 0 \\& c \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ \n 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\ \n 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \n\\\\end{pmatrix}\n \\\\begin{pmatrix} \n0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\\n1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& 0 \\& 0 \\& 1 \\& 0 \n\\\\end{pmatrix} \n$$\n In general, the columns of $L$ and the rows of $Q$ are permuted so that the the zero columns/rows of $\\\\tilde U\\_{22}$ are moved to the end of the matrix. An LUQ decomposition is then performed on this nonzero sub\\-block.\n\nA full explanation would be notation heavy (requiring index sets for the zero/nonzero elements) and not much easier to understand than the code itself.\n\n*Simple Test*\n\nIn reality, the algorithm computes an approximate LUQ decomposition and approximate bases, i.e., with rounding errors. These rounding errors might be significant if some of the nonzero singular values of $A$ are too small for the algorithm to detect.\n\n[Here](http://www.crab.rutgers.edu/~nb361/mysoftware/demo2.m) is a MATLAB script file that tests the `luq` code. The script is a slight modification of the demo file that the software comes with. I modified the original file so that it inputs a sparse, random, rectangular, rank deficient matrix and outputs bases for the left/right null spaces of this input matrix. \n\nHere is a sample output from this demo file.\n\n```\n elapsed time = 0.011993 seconds\nInput matrix:\n size = 10000x500\n true right null space dimension = 23\n true left null space dimension = 9523\nOutput:\n estimated right null space dimension = 23\n estimated left null space dimension = 9523\n error in basis for right null space = 0\n error in basis for left null space = 2.2737e-13\n\n```\n\n*\"Extreme\" Test*\n\nThis example is adapted from Gotsman and Toledo \\[2008]. Consider the $(n\\+1\\)$\\-by\\-$n$ matrix:\n$$\nA\\_1 \\= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\& \\& \\& \\& \\\\\\\\\n\\-1 \\& 1 \\& \\& \\& \\\\\\\\\n\\\\vdots \\& \\-1 \\& \\\\ddots \\& \\& \\\\\\\\\n\\\\vdots \\& \\& \\\\ddots \\& 1 \\& \\\\\\\\\n\\-1 \\& \\-1 \\& \\\\cdots \\& \\-1 \\& 1 \\\\\\\\\n0\\.5 \\& 0\\.5 \\& \\\\cdots \\& 0\\.5 \\& 0\\.5 \n\\\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand in terms of this matrix, define the block diagonal matrix:\n$$\nA \\= \\\\begin{bmatrix} A\\_1 \\& 0 \\\\\\\\\n0 \\& A\\_2 \\\\end{bmatrix}\n$$ where $A\\_2$ is an $n$\\-by\\-$n$ random symmetric positive definite matrix whose eigenvalues are all equal to one except $3$ are zero and one is $10^{\\-8}$. With this input matrix and $n\\=1000$, we obtain the following sample output.\n\n```\n elapsed time = 1.1092\nthe matrix:\n size of A = 2001x2000\n true rank of A = 1997\n true right null space dimension = 3\n true left null space dimension = 4\nresults:\n estimated right null space dimension = 3\n estimated left null space dimension = 4\n error in basis for right null space = 9.2526e-13\n error in basis for left null space = 5.9577e-14\n\n```\n\n*Remark*\n\nThere is an option in the `luq` code to use LU factorization with complete (i.e., row and column) pivoting $PAQ\\=LU$. The resulting $U$ matrix in the $LUQ$ factorization may better reflect the rank of $A$ in more ill\\-conditioned problems, but there is an added cost to doing column pivoting. \n\n**Reference**\n\nKowal, P. \\[2006]. \"Null space of a sparse matrix.\"  \n\n[https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11120\\-null\\-space\\-of\\-a\\-sparse\\-matrix](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11120-null-space-of-a-sparse-matrix)\n\nGotsman, C., and S.

So I want to ask which statistical model is behind the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can often write a model that corresponds to a loss function (here I'm going to talk about SVM regression rather than SVM\\-classification; it's particularly simple)\n\nFor example, in a linear model, if your loss function is $\\\\sum\\_i g(\\\\varepsilon\\_i) \\= \\\\sum\\_i g(y\\_i\\-x\\_i'\\\\beta)$ then minimizing that will correspond to maximum likelihood for $f\\\\propto \\\\exp(\\-a\\\\,g(\\\\varepsilon))$ $\\= \\\\exp(\\-a\\\\,g(y\\-x'\\\\beta))$. (Here I have a linear kernel)\n\nIf I recall correctly SVM\\-regression has a loss function like this:\n\n[![plot of epsilon-insensitive loss](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Gxao.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Gxao.png)\n\nThat corresponds to a density that is uniform in the middle with exponential tails (as we see by exponentiating its negative, or some multiple of its negative).\n\n[![plot of corresponding density](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HBl57.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HBl57.png)\n\nThere's a 3 parameter family of these: corner\\-location (relative insensitivity threshold) plus location and scale.\n\nIt's an interesting density; if I recall rightly from looking at that particular distribution a few decades ago, a good estimator for location for it is the average of two symmetrically\\-placed quantiles corresponding to where the corners are (e.g. [midhinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midhinge) would give a good approximation to MLE for one particular choice of the constant in the SVM loss); a similar estimator for the scale parameter would be based on their difference, while the third parameter corresponds basically to working out which percentile the corners are at (this might be chosen rather than estimated as it often is for SVM).\n\nSo at least for SVM regression it seems pretty straightforward, at least if we're choosing to get our estimators by maximum likelihood.\n\n(In case you're about to ask ... I have no reference for this particular connection to SVM: I just worked that out now.

It all started with me installing Ubuntu 16\\.04\\. It worked just fine, but I wasn't able to adjust my keyboard backlight's brightness. It glowed to its full extent, draining my battery in an hour and a half. All the solutions offered on the internet did not work, including updating to a new kernel version, leaving me frustrated and disappointed.

Shut my PC down, plugged in the USB, changed UEFI Boot order, and I got the \"Try Ubuntu, Install Ubuntu ... \" screen. When I select either of those (Try or Install) the splash screen for Ubuntu appears, I see the red dots popping in and out and the system crashes. One fix I found was to change `quiet splash` to `nomodeset` in the GRUB options. Then *Try Ubuntu* worked, and I installed Ubuntu 18\\.04\\. \n\nThe problem now was that I wasn't able to change my brightness. I didn't see any brightness adjustment slider on the top, and neither the function key for brightness (Fn\\+F5, F6\\) worked. After I restarted upon installation, I tried to switch to nVidia proprietary drivers, hoping it would fix the brightness problem ( In *Software \\& Updates* \\-\\> *Additional Drivers*). That made it even worse. The log that is shown during Ubuntu's boot crashes and my laptop's fan begins to run at crazy speeds. There was no hard disk access when that happens (the hard\\-disk access light stops glowing). I had to hard press power button to force shutdown. I tried Bumblebee, same problem.

Sudden changes like these can cause momentary spikes or dips in the voltage provided by the supply, which propagate around the circuit.\n\nThe long wires usually used to distribute voltage (and carry current) to the various modules of the circuit, have inductance. The effect of inductance is to make it hard for electric current to change quickly. Think of it as like momentum/inertia of a moving object, which prevents the object's velocity from changing quickly. In a circuit which has things switching on and off quickly and frequently, causing sudden increases or decreases in current demand, that long wiring makes it difficult for the power supply and its distribution system to \"keep up\". If the power supply is suddenly asked to provide an extra 10mA for an LED for example, inductance makes it impossible for the supply to *instantly* comply. The consequence is a momentary drop in supply voltage, while the power supply and its wiring \"catches up\".\n\nThere are usually several elements connected to that same supply, and they will all \"see\" these fluctuations, and can suffer to some degree. For example, such a supply voltage disturbance might cause an audible \"pop\" in an audio system. In your circuit here, you have a very complex microcontroller and display system, in which a moderate supply disturbance could flip a memory bit or even cause a reset, or any number of glitches.\n\nThe presence of capacitance between power supply rails acts as a short\\-term reservoir of energy, able to supply extra current when demand spikes suddenly (and temporarily), or absorb excess energy when demand drops suddenly. This has the effect of \"smoothing out\" the potential difference between the two supply rails, keeping that voltage much steadier than it would be without the capacitors.\n\nCapacitor C10, to the left of the 7805 regulator in your circuit, performs this function. That regulator is very good at preventing voltage disturbances at its input from reaching its output, but not *that* good. C10 lends a helping hand to the regulator, so that severe fluctuations in voltage (from an essentially untrusted 12V source) are quenched to some degree prior to regulation by the 7805\\.\n\nOn the output side of the regulator, you also have capacitor C9, which performs a similar function, on behalf of the the circuitry *following* the regulator. But C9 also has a second purpose. The 7805 (especially older models) actually *requires* some capacitance across its output in order to be stable. Without at least a few microfarads there, it's possible for the regulator output to oscillate, which can be devastating to any sensitive circuitry connected to it. All regulator datasheets tell you the minimum (and sometimes maximum) capacitance that can/should be present across its output.\n\nFat electrolytic capacitors, like those 470\u03bcF devices C9 and C10, are good at accommodating moderately fast changes in current demand, but often you will also find much smaller (1nF to 100nF) capacitors across the supply too. These would be present to mitigate really fast spikes and dips.\n\nThe actual values and construction of these capacitors would be chosen according to the conditions they are expected to operate under. 470\u03bcF seems excessive to me, for such a small system, but it could be that the designers are anticipating that you will be adding additional loads, perhaps badly behaved ones like relays or motors, later on. Typical values to find immediately either side of a regulator such as the 7805 would range from 10\u03bcF to 220\u03bcF, depending on the expected current through the regulator, and the nature of the loads it is supplying. Again, the datasheet usually provides recommendations for choosing capacitor values.\n\nIf we don't know what the source of 12V is (at the regulator's input), a large capacitance there (well above 220\u03bc) is not uncommon, since we have no idea of how clean that supply is. However, if you knew that the 12V supply was very clean, and very stable, you could probably reduce C10 to 10\u03bcF. Lower value capacitors are physically smaller and less expensive, which might be important to you.\n\nIt's difficult to say how big these capacitors should be, because every application and regulator has its quirks and idiosyncrasies, but values you choose for C9 and C10 here would range from tens to hundreds of microfarads, for current demands ranging from tens to hundreds of milliamps. That's a really \"ballpark\" guideline though."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In an electronic circuit with a voltage regulator like the 7805, why are capacitors typically placed on both the input and output sides of the regulator?\n\nA) To increase the overall voltage of the circuit\nB) To store energy for powering the circuit when the main power is off\nC) To smooth out voltage fluctuations and ensure regulator stability\nD) To amplify the current flowing through the regulator\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Capacitors are placed on both sides of a voltage regulator like the 7805 for two main reasons:\n\n1. On the input side (e.g., C10 in the documentation), the capacitor helps to smooth out voltage fluctuations from the power source. This is especially important when the input voltage may be unstable or \"noisy\".\n\n2. On the output side (e.g., C9 in the documentation), the capacitor serves two purposes:\n   a) It further smooths the output voltage, helping to maintain a steady supply for sensitive components.\n   b) It ensures the stability of the regulator itself.

I am writing this because I feel that @Ezikiel Elin answer is, in some parts, misleading.\n\n**Physical cores and hyper\\-threading**\n\nYour CPU has 4 cores, but also has [Hyper\\-threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading) which presents 8 virtual cores to the operating system. This has the benefit of allowing the cores to more rapidly change from running one process thread to another thread (quite likely from a different process). There are circumstances where this can slow throughput, but it is usually beneficial.\n\nActivity monitor presents all 8 virtual cores. The first physical core is shown as the first two virtual cores in the graphs. The second physical is in graphs 3 and 4, and so on. In your example, the cores are only lightly loaded and not sufficient to make significant use of hyper\\-threading.\n\n**Swap and Compressed**\n\nThere are time when macOS and your running applications need more memory can than comfortably fit in physical RAM. In that case, the memory management of macOS frees up RAM in two ways:\n\n1. Take some memory and compress it. In your example, 906 MB of physical RAM is being used to store some unspecified (but probably about twice that) of macOS and application memory. Of course, the memory will need to be decompressed before it is next used.\n2. Move some portions of memory out of physical RAM and store them on the boot disk. In your case, 6\\.64 GB of disk space in being used in this way. When an application requires to use that memory, it will have to be brought back into physical RAM. This moving portions of memory out and in to RAM is called swapping and the disk space used is in one or more swap files.\n\nCompressing and decompressing is a relatively fast action using a highly efficient algorithm. Swapping is slower. When boot disks were hard disks, this was a key cause of slow system response. With SSDs, this is quicker and leads to a more responsive feel to the system.\n\nmacOS's memory tuning has a preference for compression rather than swapping, though in your example, it has decided that rather a lot of memory must be taken out of physical RAM and placed in the swap files. Ideally, the memory tuning will have chosen application memory that is unlikely to be wanted for some time.\n\n**Memory calculations**\n\nMemory allocations can be counted in more than one way, but as presented by Activity Monitor:\n\nApp Memory \\+ Wired memory \\+ Compressed \\= Memory Used\n\nWired memory is memory which can't be compressed or swapped. I don't like the use of \"memory used\" in this context because, in reality, nearly all the physical RAM is usefully occupied. But that is what Activity Monitor calls it.\n\nMemory Used \\+ Cached Files \\+ Free memory \\= Physical Memory\n\nSo it is true that Memory Used \\+ Cached Files is always less than or equal to Physical RAM.\n\nWith a simple calculation, you can work out that your Free Memory is only 0\\.10 GB.\n\nYour \"memory pressure\" graph is green, which indicates that macOS is able to manage memory with few bottlenecks.\n\n**Disk IO and Data**\n\nTo the left of the graph, Activity Monitor shows that number of read and write operations (called IO in the graphs) both as totals since boot and current rates.\n\nEach disk operation can read or write variable amounts of data. The values for amount of data and current rates are on the right hand side. The graph calls this DATA (which seems reasonable to me).\n\nFrom your graphs and current counters, the Mac looks fairly busy from the disk point of view. But the graphs have no units which does limit their usefulness."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A MacBook Pro user is analyzing their system performance using Activity Monitor.

I have a feeling this is a case addressed by the [Law of Demeter](http://wiki.c2.com/?LawOfDemeter), but I'm not sure what it dictates.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It should only hold a reference to its owner (the window) and call a function of its owner which in turn calls the notebook's function to switch pages. The owner owns the reference to the notebook and can validate whether the pointer is still good vs. has been released."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a GTK+ application, a GtkToolbar subclass needs to interact with a GtkNotebook to switch pages. Which of the following approaches best adheres to good software design principles, including the Law of Demeter?\n\nA) The toolbar should hold a direct reference to the notebook and call its functions to switch pages.\n\nB) The toolbar should hold a reference to its owner (the window) and call a function of the window, which then calls the notebook's function to switch pages.\n\nC) The toolbar should keep a reference to the window and directly access the window's reference to the notebook each time it needs to switch pages.\n\nD) The toolbar should maintain its own separate copy of the notebook to ensure independence from the window.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the best approach because:\n1. It follows the Law of Demeter by limiting the toolbar's knowledge to its immediate collaborator (the window).\n2. It maintains proper encapsulation and reduces coupling between components.\n3. It allows the window to manage and validate the notebook reference, ensuring it's still valid before use.\n4. It provides a clear and maintainable separation of responsibilities.\n\nOption A violates the Law of Demeter and increases coupling. Option C, while better than A, still violates encapsulation by directly accessing the window's internals. Option D introduces unnecessary duplication and potential synchronization issues."}, "57": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/06/22", "source": ["https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/316169", "https://tex.stackexchange.com", "https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/379/"], "docs_id": 316169, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a multirow environment, but it does not center aligned in center environment.

As stated in the StackExchange response, using solely 301 redirects in a .htaccess file is not sufficient in this case because the new URL structure includes a variable category name that cannot be determined from the old URL alone.
