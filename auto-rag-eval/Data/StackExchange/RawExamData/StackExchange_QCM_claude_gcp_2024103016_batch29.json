The answer is: Boxing. And now that seemingly **male spectacle** is attracting women.\n\nDoes ***male spectacle*** mean dominated by men?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary sense of **male** denotes the sex of an animal, as an adjective: men, boys, rams, bulls, and peacocks are all **male**; women, girls, ewes, cows, and peahens are all **female**.\\*\n\nThe sentence that you are asking about uses **male** in an extended sense. Since boxing is not an animal, you can safely infer that the author wants you to understand **male** not in its primary sense, but in some way *related to* its primary sense. You must infer the exact meaning from context.\n\nIn this case, **male spectacle** means an activity that men, but not women, perform, which creates a visually conspicuous show that attracts other people's attention (a \"spectacle\"). This usage of **male** is similar to its meaning in **[male display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship_display#Male_display)**, referring to things like the spreading of a peacock's [tail feathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl#/media/File:Paonroue.JPG). The display is not itself literally male. The display is an action distinctive to males of that species; the females don't do it.\n\nI don't understand the word **male** in this context to mean **male\\-dominated**, though the meanings are somewhat ambiguous. The primary (though rare) sense of **dominate** is to hold power over someone; a common secondary sense is to exist in the greatest number or proportion in some area. If thousands of women took up boxing, they would still be outnumbered by male boxers, and so the sport would still be male\\-dominated in that secondary sense. Men might still control the sport, too, so it would still be male\\-dominated in the primary sense. I understand **male spectacle** in the quoted sentence to regard boxing as something like the peacock's tail display: an activity performed exclusively by men. However, the phrase and context are not fully clear about this, and I doubt that the author thought about it carefully.\n\nNote that, in this context, there is a slight difference in meaning between **male spectacle** and **masculine spectacle**. **Masculine** denotes the qualities distinctively associated with maleness, but not maleness itself. It's not a self\\-contradiction to say that a certain woman has some masculine qualities\u2014for example, a deep voice, or an urge to get into fistfights. Through the choice of the word **male** or **masculine**, the author guides the reader to understand the phrase by extending one primary sense or the other: the male sex, or the qualities associated with it. The choice of **male** rather than **masculine** agrees with the author's meaning of \"Boxing was formerly performed only by men, but now women are starting to box, too.\"\n\n---\n\n\\*\u00a0By the way, English has a peculiar ambiguity regarding the words **animal**, **man**, **cow**, and **peacock**. One sense of **animal** is any organism that moves itself from place to place and has consciousness, human or otherwise; another sense of **animal** means only non\\-human animals. One sense of **man** includes humans of both sexes; another sense, much more common, means only male humans. One sense of **cow** includes all animals of the genus *[Bos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bos);* another sense means only females of the genus *Bos.* Even the word **peacock** commonly refers to both sexes of the [peafowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl), despite the fact that **\\-cock** specifically designates a male bird. The word **peacock** is well\\-known, **peahen** is not well\\-known, and **peafowl** is almost unheard\\-of in everyday English."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the sentence \"And now that seemingly male spectacle is attracting women,\" what is the most accurate interpretation of the phrase \"male spectacle\" as it relates to boxing?\n\nA) A sport dominated by male participants and spectators\nB) An activity exclusively performed by men for visual display\nC) A masculine form of entertainment\nD) A sport controlled by male organizers and promoters\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"male spectacle\" in this context refers to an activity that has traditionally been performed exclusively by men, similar to how certain animal behaviors (like a peacock's tail display) are distinctively male. The use of \"male\" rather than \"masculine\" suggests the author is emphasizing the historical exclusivity of male participation in boxing, rather than just its masculine qualities. The sentence implies that this exclusive male performance is now changing as women begin to participate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while boxing may be male-dominated, the phrase doesn't primarily emphasize this aspect. Option C is close but misses the nuance of \"male\" vs. \"masculine\" in this context.

Consider the situation where someone had their code on Google Code, or Source Forge with the license in the issue tracker over there and then migrated the project to github... and there's no hint of a license file any more.\n\nSpecifically with GitHub and its culture of forking, one should also look at what one sees when downloading or cloning from a *fork*. There isn't even a hint of an issue containing the license in the forked code. For that matter, the fork might have enabled its *own* issues on there and claiming a WTFPL license on it (anyone downloading from the fork and going to `https://github.com/sjane/acme/issues/97` hinted at by someone as containing the license in it could see something completely different than the MIT).\n\nThe license needs to be distributed with the library and source files.

This is attributed to industrial consumers being charged for reactive power draw, unlike private households. As a result, factories tend to invest in equipment that meets their requirements, including power factor correction, to manage energy costs.

Most PSUs don't like this very much.\n\nIf you connect things wrong, a large current may flow into the PSU and fry it.\n\nAlso, the PSU will generate a voltage of 12 V, and will only be able to charge a (nominally) 12 V battery that has been discharged to below 12 V. When charging, the battery's voltage will (try to) rise very quickly to more than 12 V, and the charging will stop. At this point, very little charge will have gone into the battery and it will only be charged partially.\n\nSo, a 12 V PSU is not suited for charging (nominally) 12 V lead\\-acid batteries.

A 12V PSU is not suitable for fully charging a 12V lead-acid battery because:\n\n1. Lead-acid batteries require a charging voltage higher than their nominal voltage (typically 13-14V for a 12V battery) to achieve full charge.\n2. The PSU will only charge the battery until its voltage matches the PSU's output (12V), resulting in partial charging.\n3.

A search for \"this is a velociraptor\" returns twice as many results as \"this is velocipaptor\", and of the latter many results are actually:\n\n1. \"This is a velociraptor\" or other results that don't match the phrase perfectly.\n2. Where \"this is a velociraptor\" is part of a phrase where velociraptor is modifying another noun (\"this is velociraptor country\").\n3. Where it's the middle of a phrase that likewise uses it differently (\"The proper reaction to this is velociraptor noises\").\n4. This question.\n5.

Here, using it as if it is the name of a given individual dinosaur adds an immediacy and sense of closeness as they go on to describe its qualities; generally focusing on the damage it could do to prey (which says as much about the Discovery channel as it does about velociraptors). It also highlights the idea that the technology used to reproduce what a velociraptor looked and moved like is \"introducing\" you to one.\n\nAnd it does work, in my opinion and is hence a bit of poetic license worth taking. It doesn't work as well with things you are familiar with, with shorter names, or with multi\\-part names (\"This is great white shark\" doesn't work as well as \"This is shark\"). But it can still be used with them, or indeed with anything, and it sometimes is.\n\n(With more familiar things, rather than add a sense of immediacy, it can give a sense of distance and seeing afresh. I can recall a British nature show that used \"this is cat\" in examining the anatomy of a cat, and it did give an impression of \"seeing for the first time\" a very familiar animal).\n\nNormally though, we use *a/an* and *the* with prehistoric animals.\n\nThe only species name that is more often found without an article than with is *man*, where the lack of article highlights that we are considering people as a species rather than as individuals.

According to the documentation, while it's not standard grammar, the phrase \"This is velociraptor\" without an article is sometimes used in nature documentaries for effect. It's employed to create a sense of immediacy and closeness when introducing the animal, particularly when describing its qualities or potential danger. This technique adds drama and helps viewers feel as if they're being directly introduced to the creature.

It's not that the tension the man pulls with is tripled as such, but because of what's termed, [mechanical advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulley_system) of a pulley system, **meaning that $\\\\frac{W}{3}$ of the load is shared with each one of the rope segments**. That is,\n\n> **Free body diagrams:**   \n> \n>   \n> \n> The mechanical advantage of a pulley system can be analyzed using free body diagrams which balance the tension force in the rope with the force of gravity on the load. In an ideal system, the massless and frictionless pulleys do not dissipate energy and allow for a change of direction of a rope that does not stretch or wear. A force balance on a free body that includes the load, $W$, and $n$ supporting sections of a rope with tension $T$ yields $$nT\\-W\\=0$$\n\nmeaning that each segment of rope will handle $$T\\=\\\\frac{W}{n}\\=\\\\frac{W}{3}$$ of the load.\n\nThis is consistent with the result above where the load is given by the wieght of the plank and worker $$W\\=(M\\+m)g$$\n\nNote that the horizontal part of the rope will also have the same tension, but because it is in the horizontal direction, it does not contribute to the equation of motion (1\\)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A man of mass m is standing on a plank of mass M, suspended by a pulley system as shown in the image.

In this pulley system, there are three segments of rope that contribute to supporting the weight of the man and plank: two vertical segments and one angled segment. Each segment has a tension T. The total upward force is the sum of these three tensions, which is 3T. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the mechanical advantage of the pulley system. \nOption B is incorrect as it only considers the two vertical segments and ignores the angled segment. \nOption D is incorrect because while there is tension in the horizontal segment, it doesn't contribute to the upward force countering gravity.\n\nThe equation balancing the forces is 3T - (M+m)g = 0, where (M+m)g is the total weight of the system.

It is also continuous and differentiable everywhere.\nC) is incorrect because f(x) is continuous for all real x, not just rational values.\nD) is incorrect because while f(x) is monotonic (which could be increasing or decreasing), it must be linear (f(x) = ax).\n\nThe key to solving this is understanding that the functional property f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y), combined with monotonicity, leads to the conclusion that f(x) must be of the form ax for some constant a.

I think there could be a problem with my approach, therefore my question is raised: When working with MOD09GA product, is supposed QC bitmask for high aerosol quantity to return 4 values?\n\nAccording to the description of the quality assessment flags, there can be 4 combinations: `'00'`, `'01'`, `'10'` and `'11'`. Thus, it should and it does return 4 values as long as they exist in the QA layer.\n\n### Details\n\nThe quality assessment (binary) flags for MOD09GA Science Data Sets are indeed detailed in [MODIS Surface Reflectance User\u2019s Guide (Collection 6\\)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/306/MOD09_User_Guide_V6.pdf). Specifically, the Data product state QA flags are described in Table 13 (the one you copy\\-pasted in your question).\n\nBreaking down the instruction\n\n```\nqcAerosol = (qc >> 6) & 3\n\n```\n\nafter the `=` sign in two parts:\n\n1. `qc >> 6` which performs a bitwise right shift of all pixel values in `qc` by 6 positions. To exemplify, let us use the unsigned 16\\-bit integer 174272\\. Its binary form is (all code below in Python):\n\n```\nbin(174272)[2:]\n'101010100011000000'\n\n```\n\nShifting this bit\\-pattern to the right by 6 positions, will result in \n\n```\nbin(174272 >> 6)[2:]\n'101010100011'\n\n```\n\nwhich is the integer\n\n```\nint(bin(174272 >> 6)[2:], 2)\n2723\n\n```\n\nwhich, by the way, is the same as\n\n```\n174272 / 2**6\n2723\n\n```\n\nTheory says we *multiply* if we shift to the left!)\n2. `& 3` performs a bitwise AND of all shifted `qc` values with `3` which is the integer form for the binary string `'11'`. The 'AND' operation will *compare* the first two bits of each (now shifted) `qc` pixel values with `'11'`. \n\nContinuing the example with the integer `174272`, the second step is:\n\n```\nint(bin(174272 >> 6)[2:], 2) & 3\n3\n\n```\n\nThis is expected as we *compare* the first two bits (reading from right to left) `'1010101000`**`11`**`'` with `'11'` which in turn will result to `'11'` which is the binary form of the integer `3`.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the possible *comparisons* are:\n\n\t* `'00'` AND `'11'` results in `'00'` or `0`\n\t* `'01'` AND `'11'` results in `'01'` or `1`\n\t* `'10'` AND `'11'` results in `'10'` or `2`\n\t* `'11'` AND `'11'` results in `'11'` or `3`Thus, `np.unique(qcAerosol)` can return **at most** 4 different integer values (`0` or `1` or `2` or `3`). It may, however, return less or only one according to the recorded state of the pixels for bits 7 and 6\\.\n\nAs for the other data quality states,\n\n* \"cloud state\" is a double bit, thus `2^2 = 4` states can be encoded\n* \"cloud shadow\" is a single bit, thus only `2^1 = 2` states can be encoded (`0` or `1`)\n* \"land/water\" is a triple bit, thus the possible combinations are `2^3 = 8`: `'000'` or `0`, `'001'` or `1`, `'010'` or `2`, `'011'` or `3`, `'100'` or `4`, `'101'` or 5, `'110'` or `6`, `'111'` or `7`."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the MODIS data documentation:\n\nQuestion: When working with MODIS MOD09GA product quality assessment flags, which of the following statements is correct regarding the aerosol quantity bitmask?\n\nA) The aerosol quantity bitmask always returns only 2 values (0 and 1)\nB) The aerosol quantity bitmask can return up to 4 different integer values (0, 1, 2, 3)\nC) The aerosol quantity bitmask uses 3 bits to encode 8 possible states\nD) The aerosol quantity bitmask cannot differentiate between low, average, and high aerosol quantities\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The aerosol quantity bitmask in the MOD09GA product uses 2 bits (bits 6-7) to encode 4 possible states.

Some of these were covered in the comments.\n\n* Reduce the TTL of the DNS record, several days before the move. Perform the move and then you can restore the TTL to its previous value. This does not guarantee all DNS servers in the world will have updated. You may still have some users operating off a stale DNS record. But that's what you get with DNS. It's generally good. But no guarantee. You can't even really verify as you would have to check all DNS servers of the world, many will be doing caching, some won't respect TTLs. But in generally, this is a pretty safe way to do it. Unless you have 10 million users or more, I think the potential risk is relatively low, that one of your users will be using a broken DNS server.\n* Update both servers with the latest version, then it does not matter. Say A is currently the server pointed to by DNS, update B, change DNS, update A. There is a small possible problem window during the update of A where a user will get a broken site.\n* Put a load balancer in front, which takes over the IP address DNS currently points to. This is a more complex change to your existing setup but is more how things should be generally.\n* Quickly swap the IP addresses. Give Server B the IP address of Server A and change Server A. Very short downtime \\- a couple seconds if you are ready with a script. No risks of having stale DNS since you don't change DNS.\n* Use Keepalived or similar tool. The DNS then points to a floating IP address. The server which currently has that IP would need to be given a different IP address. This is a higher complexity level than most other solutions, but it is a great improvement to your set up. Right now, you are at risk. DNS has a \"long\" TTL for the A record pointing to Server A. If Server A fails, you have to change the DNS to point to Server B which will take a long time to propagate. With a floating IP, then you never have to change the DNS. If Server A fails, Server B automatically takes over after a few milliseconds the floating IP and everything keeps on working.\n* Update Server B with new code. Switch the configuration on Server A so that instead of serving the web site, the web server proxy the requests to Server B. (Easy if its Apache httpd, NGINX, IIS. Many others should be able to do that, if not, you could put HAProxy, quickly stop the web server and start HAProxy.) At this point, all the requests are handled by Server B on the new code.

Much of it involves ugly math (summations involving exponential functions). I'm going to try to distill the theory to basics, then apply it to your question.\n\nFirst off we need some definitions:\n\n* Service \\- A general class of resource that provides work\n* Instance \\- An individual worker for a service\n* Pool \\- The number of available workers\n* Request \\- A work unit that needs servicing\n* Queue \\- The ordered list of requests awaiting servicing\n* Job \\- A request being actively serviced by a service instance\n* Runtime \\- The time is takes for an instance to service a job\n* Limit \\- A resource constraint on an instance that can place a ceiling on runtime\n* Exception \\- A failure in the processing of the request\n\nNow to put them into common context:\n\nYou're due to fly out on an international flight. You have baggage and an economy ticket. You locate your airline, and join the group of folks waiting to check in. There are three slightly harried airline representatives beyond the eight people ahead of you, and two of the three have customers they're already checking in. As you wait, you notice that customers leave the front at an average of one minute per person, plus 45 seconds for each checked bag.\n\nUnder this content, when you first arrived you have a service (airline check\\-in) with three server instances (pool size three), eleven requests, with queue length nine, two active jobs, and a runtime proportional to the number of seats *plus* bags.\n\nThere are ways to speed you on your way:\n\n* The airline could hire a dozen more check\\-in specialists. This would provide more instances, and therefore more completed jobs per unit time. But the extra salary would increase costs to the point that fares tripled, and your holiday might fall victim.\n* The airline could limit two persons and three bags per job (which would also yield also more jobs/time) but you probably want to keep both your spouse and infant daughter on the flight with you (getting kicked out of the line would be a service exception, as would still being in the queue when your flight announced final boarding).\n\nLet's say that there just happens to be an additional check\\-in specialist, who was on break. This individual walks up to an open podium, logs in with two\\-factor authentication, flips some switches to make the light turn on, and calls to the next person in line. Now you've experienced service pooling \\-\\- the worker was available, but it took a bit to spin up to become an instance.\n\nIn the GIS realm, the same principles can be applied, but let's describe the system based on the load you've described (assuming a one\\-min, two\\-max service list defaults):\n\nYou are running an airport with 100 airlines and 100 two\\-position check\\-in terminals, with 100 representatives at lit check\\-in stations, and 100 extra staffers in the back room to take on additional work (one per airline). We don't know how often a flyer comes in, or to which airline, or whether any representatives are busy, or how profitable the airport is that it can afford to have so many workers sitting around waiting for not enough customers. We do know that planes are leaving without passengers on occasion.\n\nWould increasing the number of back\\-room staffers for one airline help prevent unhappy flyers? Well, maybe for that one airline, but in the context of the airport, probably not.\n\nWhat you need to do is:\n\n* Identify which services are consistently busy, and which are usually idle\n* Reduce minimum pool from those that are often idle\n* Add maximum pool size to the busiest services, highest queue length first (but add slowly, no more than half the backlog at a time; workers are expensive)\n* If requests to certain servers are of short duration, and extremely bursty, it might make sense to increase the minimum number of instances, to reduce the latency of spinning up pooled instances\n* Review and repeat as necessary\n\nIn the end, you only have so many resources, and it's not clear what the error might be. An expensive way to find out if your error is due to resource exhaustion is to double the capacity of the server (2x CPU and/or 2x RAM), or double the number of servers (the latter increases overhead cost, due to additional communication, but also provides a means to continue servicing during maintenance windows). The less expensive options all involve more work, since you'd need to do some research into queuing theory and review the practical aspects of your deployment in light of this theory. In between might be a short\\-term consult from a expert to review your configuration and make recommendations."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A GIS service is experiencing performance issues due to a high volume of requests. The current configuration includes 100 service instances with a minimum pool size of 100 and a maximum pool size of 200. What would be the most effective initial step to improve performance without significantly increasing costs?\n\nA) Increase the maximum pool size to 400\nB) Reduce the minimum pool size for services that are often idle\nC) Double the server's CPU and RAM capacity\nD) Add 100 more service instances to handle the backlog\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) Increasing the maximum pool size to 400 would potentially allow for more concurrent jobs, but it would also significantly increase costs without addressing the root cause of the performance issues.\n\nB) This is the correct answer. By reducing the minimum pool size for services that are often idle, resources can be reallocated to busier services. This approach follows the recommendation to \"Reduce minimum pool from those that are often idle\" and helps optimize resource utilization without increasing costs.\n\nC) Doubling the server's capacity is described in the text as \"an expensive way to find out if your error is due to resource exhaustion.\" While it might solve the problem, it's not the most cost-effective initial step.\n\nD) Adding 100 more service instances would increase costs and overhead without necessarily addressing the underlying issue. The text suggests adding instances \"slowly, no more than half the backlog at a time,\" so this approach is too aggressive.\n\nThe correct approach (B) aligns with the advice to identify which services are consistently busy or idle and adjust the resource allocation accordingly, which is a more targeted and cost-effective solution."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/10/29", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/691707", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/450285/"], "docs_id": 691707, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've tried to install a new system with the help of a [mini.iso](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD) and ran into wireless configuration issues. \nI found it pretty weird that the mini.iso mostly seems to be working fine although despite pretty basic commands like the following:\n\n```\nlshw\nlspci\nlsusb\nifconfig\n\n```\n\nwere missing when I tried them from the command line.\n\nThis is the extended version of my question: \n\n* Which commands are available on the mini.iso?\n* Where can I find documentation about the available console commands?\n* Where can I find what software packages are present on the mini.iso?\n\n---\n\n**Update:** (clarification about the question)\n\nTo be clear about the question: with \"command line\" I mean the console that becomes available when you \n\n* perform \"manual\" configuration steps during setup (like wireless, disk, serial device setup) or\n* when you access the menu point \"Execute a shell\"\n\nThe question is specific about the `mini.iso` or `netinstall.iso` as these are provided seemingly without further documentation.

See pages 260\\-266 of Pinheiro/Bates.\n\nA good first step is to make a variogram to see how the correlation depends on distance.\n\n```\nlibrary(nlme)\nm0 <- gls(response ~ level, data = layout)  \nplot(Variogram(m0, form=~x+y))\n\n```\n\nHere the sample semivariogram increases with distance indicating that the observations are indeed spatially correlated.\n\nOne option for the correlation structure is a spherical structure; that could be modeled in the following way.\n\n```\nm1 <- update(m0, corr=corSpher(c(15, 0.25), form=~x+y, nugget=TRUE))\n\n```\n\nThis model does seem to fit better than the model with no correlation structure, though it's entirely possible it too could be improved on with one of the other possible correlation structures.\n\n```\n> anova(m0, m1)\n   Model df     AIC      BIC    logLik   Test  L.Ratio p-value\nm0     1  3 46.5297 49.80283 -20.26485                        \nm1     2  5 43.3244 48.77961 -16.66220 1 vs 2 7.205301  0.0273\n\n```\n\n2\\) You could also try including `x` and `y` directly in the model; this could be appropriate if the pattern of correlation depends on more than just distance. In your case (looking at sesqu's pictures) it seems that for this block anyway, you may have a diagonal pattern.\n\nHere I'm updating the original model instead of m0 because I'm only changing the fixed effects, so the models should both be fit using maximum likelihood.\n\n```\n> model2 <- update(model, .~.+x*y)\n> anova(model, model2)\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: response ~ level\nModel 2: response ~ level + x + y + x:y\n  Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq      F   Pr(>F)   \n1     22 5.3809                                \n2     19 2.7268  3    2.6541 6.1646 0.004168 **\n\n```\n\nTo compare all three models, you'd need to fit them all with `gls` and the maximum likelihood method instead of the default method of REML.\n\n```\n> m0b <- update(m0, method=\"ML\")\n> m1b <- update(m1, method=\"ML\")\n> m2b <- update(m0b, .~x*y)\n> anova(m0b, m1b, m2b, test=FALSE)\n    Model df      AIC      BIC     logLik\nm0b     1  3 38.22422 41.75838 -16.112112\nm1b     2  5 35.88922 41.77949 -12.944610\nm2b     3  5 29.09821 34.98847  -9.549103\n\n```\n\nRemember that especially with your knowledge of the study, you might be able to come up with a model that is better than any of these.

Maybe show how that integral was derived in a step\\-by\\-step way?\n\nEDIT:\n\nI was able to gain a better understanding by relating the expectation to an area. I will explain it here in case it helps anyone. First start with relating Pi to the area of the top\\-right quadrant of the unit circle\n\n$\\\\pi\\=4\\\\times A\\_{tr}$\n\nThen we place the top\\-right quadrant into the unit square. And under a uniform distribution over the unit square, the area of the circle quadrant is proportional to the probability of obtaining a sample from it. It follows that the following equality holds\n\n$P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)\\=\\\\frac{A\\_{tr}}{A\\_{square}}$\n\nand $A\\_{square}\\=1$ so\n\n$P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)\\=A\\_{tr}$\n\nAnd substituting into the original equation\n\n$\\\\pi\\=4\\\\times P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)$\n\nand it is also true that $P(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)\\=E\\[I(x^2\\+y^2\\<1\\)]$ which is equal to the original double integral.\n\nSo I understood it by relating the area to a probability then relating that probability to an expectation that is equivalent to the integral.

Please do suggest. Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let me suggest a different point of view. It is crucial that symmetry operators acting on a Hilbert space be unitary by the very definition of what a symmetry is. Thus, we expect that the Hilbert space is infinite dimensional. This is already the case in the Klein Gordon field, whose corresponding Hilbert space is a Fock space built from a $1$\\-particle Hilbert space spanned by states of definite momentum $\\|p\\\\rangle$.\n\nThe fields on the other hand, are built so that they transform as $\\\\tilde{\\\\phi}(x)\\=D(\\\\Lambda)(\\\\phi(\\\\Lambda^{\\-1}x))$, with $D$ a finite dimensional representation of the Lorentz group. For example, in the case of Klein\\-Gordon, the field takes values in $\\\\mathbb{R}$ and the representation is given by $D(\\\\Lambda)\\=1\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$. As you mentioned, this representation cannot be unitary. However, what does unitarity mean hear? For this concept to make sense we need to equip the vector space where our field takes values with an inner product. Thus, the fact is that there is no inner product on this vector space which makes $D$ a unitary representation. That is ok though! In quantum field theory our fields describe operators, not states. There is no meaning to an inner product structure to the operators in a quantum system (well, there is but it is more subtle, see GNS representation). \n\nWhat is the relationship then between $D$ and the unitary representation $U$ on our Hilbert space? Well, precisely that they are compatible\n$$U(\\\\Lambda)^\\\\dagger\\\\phi(x)U(\\\\Lambda)\\=\\\\tilde{\\\\phi}(x)\\=D(\\\\Lambda)(\\\\phi(\\\\Lambda^{\\-1}x)).$$\n\nI hope this was useful :)"}, "answer": "Question: In quantum field theory, which of the following statements is correct regarding the relationship between field transformations and Hilbert space representations of symmetries?\n\nA) Both the field transformation D(\u039b) and the Hilbert space representation U(\u039b) must be unitary.\n\nB) The field transformation D(\u039b) is always unitary, while the Hilbert space representation U(\u039b) may be non-unitary.\n\nC) The field transformation D(\u039b) can be non-unitary, while the Hilbert space representation U(\u039b) must be unitary.\n\nD) Both the field transformation D(\u039b) and the Hilbert space representation U(\u039b) are always non-unitary.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In quantum field theory, the field transformation D(\u039b) and the Hilbert space representation U(\u039b) have different requirements for unitarity. The field transformation D(\u039b) acts on the space where the field takes values, which is typically finite-dimensional and does not require an inner product structure. Therefore, D(\u039b) can be non-unitary. \n\nOn the other hand, the Hilbert space representation U(\u039b) acts on the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of states. Symmetry operators in quantum mechanics must preserve the inner product structure of the Hilbert space, which is a fundamental requirement for maintaining probability interpretations. Thus, U(\u039b) must be unitary.\n\nThe relationship between these transformations is given by the compatibility condition:\nU(\u039b)\u2020\u03c6(x)U(\u039b) = D(\u039b)(\u03c6(\u039b^(-1)x))\n\nThis allows for a non-unitary field transformation D(\u039b) to be consistent with a unitary Hilbert space representation U(\u039b), preserving the physical principles of quantum mechanics while accommodating the mathematical structure of quantum field theory."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/29", "source": ["https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/75796", "https://gis.stackexchange.com", "https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/19498/"], "docs_id": 75796, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a postgres 9\\.1 database with postgis 2\\.1, and I recently needed to add sfcgal to it, so i rebuilt postgis 2\\.1, but I can't find out how to update the postgis extension in postgres without dropping all data. \nIs there a way to do that ?\n\n```\nALTER EXTENSION postgis UPDATE;\n\n```\n\nreturns a notice saying i'm already at version 2\\.1\\.0\n\nThanks for any tips\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: just run the sfcgal.sql file into your existing database.

I was facing the same problem on an Acer laptop where both the keyboard and the touchpad were not working at the same point your keyboard doesn't. This is how I was able to overcome this problem. I'm just hoping it's going to work on your system too.\n\nRight after you press `Enter` on the *Install Ubuntu server* option, start pressing random keys on your keyboard at a rate of approximately two per second till you see the next screen appear. This hack makes the keyboard send the keys you press and eventually it gets detected correctly and it works.\n\nAs I said, this worked in my case.

The key insight comes from the proof outlined in the documentation. If v\u0304 is injective for all N, then v must be surjective. This is proven by contradiction:\n\n1) Assume v is not surjective.\n2) Choose N = M''/im(v), where im(v) is the image of v.\n3) The canonical homomorphism \u03c6: M'' \u2192 N would not be zero.\n4) However, v\u0304(\u03c6) = \u03c6 \u2218 v = 0, contradicting the injectivity of v\u0304.\n\nTherefore, v must be surjective if v\u0304 is injective for all N.\n\nHowever, the converse is not necessarily true. A surjective v doesn't guarantee that v\u0304 will be injective for all N. This makes option B the correct choice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it concludes injectivity instead of surjectivity.\nOption C is incorrect because it claims equivalence, which is not established.\nOption D is incorrect because it only requires injectivity for some N, which is not sufficient."}}
