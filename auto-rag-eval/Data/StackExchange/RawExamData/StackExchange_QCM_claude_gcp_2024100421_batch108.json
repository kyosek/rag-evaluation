Please do suggest. Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let me suggest a different point of view. It is crucial that symmetry operators acting on a Hilbert space be unitary by the very definition of what a symmetry is. Thus, we expect that the Hilbert space is infinite dimensional. This is already the case in the Klein Gordon field, whose corresponding Hilbert space is a Fock space built from a $1$\\-particle Hilbert space spanned by states of definite momentum $\\|p\\\\rangle$.\n\nThe fields on the other hand, are built so that they transform as $\\\\tilde{\\\\phi}(x)\\=D(\\\\Lambda)(\\\\phi(\\\\Lambda^{\\-1}x))$, with $D$ a finite dimensional representation of the Lorentz group. For example, in the case of Klein\\-Gordon, the field takes values in $\\\\mathbb{R}$ and the representation is given by $D(\\\\Lambda)\\=1\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$. As you mentioned, this representation cannot be unitary. However, what does unitarity mean hear? For this concept to make sense we need to equip the vector space where our field takes values with an inner product. Thus, the fact is that there is no inner product on this vector space which makes $D$ a unitary representation. That is ok though! In quantum field theory our fields describe operators, not states. There is no meaning to an inner product structure to the operators in a quantum system (well, there is but it is more subtle, see GNS representation). \n\nWhat is the relationship then between $D$ and the unitary representation $U$ on our Hilbert space? Well, precisely that they are compatible\n$$U(\\\\Lambda)^\\\\dagger\\\\phi(x)U(\\\\Lambda)\\=\\\\tilde{\\\\phi}(x)\\=D(\\\\Lambda)(\\\\phi(\\\\Lambda^{\\-1}x)).$$\n\nI hope this was useful :)"}, "answer": "Question: In quantum field theory, why is it acceptable for the field transformation representation D(\u039b) to be non-unitary, while the symmetry operators U(\u039b) acting on the Hilbert space must be unitary?\n\nA) Because fields are classical objects and don't need to preserve probability\nB) Because the field representation acts on a finite-dimensional space, while the Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional\nC) Because fields represent operators rather than states, and there's no inherent inner product structure for operators\nD) Because non-unitary transformations allow for a wider range of field behaviors\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key point is that in quantum field theory, fields represent operators acting on states, not the states themselves. While symmetry operators U(\u039b) must be unitary to preserve probabilities and the inner product structure of the Hilbert space containing quantum states, the field transformation representation D(\u039b) acts on a different mathematical object. \n\nFields don't have an inherent inner product structure like the state space does, so the concept of unitarity doesn't directly apply to them. What matters is the compatibility relation between U(\u039b) and D(\u039b), ensuring that the field transformations are consistent with the symmetry transformations of the underlying quantum states.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fields in QFT are quantum, not classical objects. Option B, while true, doesn't fully explain why non-unitarity is acceptable for D(\u039b). Option D is not the fundamental reason and could be misleading. Option C correctly identifies the crucial distinction between fields as operators and states in the Hilbert space."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/06/29", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/1348834", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/1353082/"], "docs_id": 1348834, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: UPDATE: I tried copying everything from the old user partition to the new but ran out of space.

It doesn't really answer the user's problem. The original question is specifically about getting Borland C to access OpenGL. The tool he's suggesting is for using JavaScript to access OpenGL. He's basically telling him to switch programming languages.\n3. The user's name is `b2c`, the same name as his website.

These F\\-test are provided by the **lmerTest** package.\n* In general it is not good to *only* look at measures like AIC or p\\-values to decide which terms to include in the model, especially the fixed effects in this case. You should also see how substantive is the difference between the additive model `chickm3` and the interaction model `chickm4`. You could more easily assess this using an effects plots \\- see, e.g., the **effects** or **ggeffects** packages.\n* Indeed the effect that the intercept of the model does not correspond to the average value you have for `Time` equal to zero and `Diet` equal to the reference level is because you fit a line, and the estimate of the slope also affects the estimate of the intercept. You could mitigate this affect but fitting a nonlinear model for the `Time` variable using, e.g., splines.\n* Finally, regarding the convergence warning message, you could ignore it in this case because it is very close to the tolerance value."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: When analyzing multilevel models for the ChickWeight data in R, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding model selection and interpretation?\n\nA) The model with the lowest AIC should always be chosen as the final model, regardless of other considerations.\n\nB) Formal hypothesis testing using F-tests is not applicable for comparing nested models in this context.\n\nC) The discrepancy between the model's intercept and the actual initial chick weight indicates a fundamentally flawed model that should be discarded.\n\nD) It's important to consider multiple factors when selecting a model, including AIC, substantive differences between models, and the research question at hand, while recognizing the limitations of linear models for non-linear data.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because while AIC is useful, it shouldn't be the sole criterion for model selection. \nOption B is false; F-tests can be used to compare nested models, as mentioned in the documentation. \nOption C is too extreme; the intercept discrepancy is a limitation of linear models with non-linear data, not necessarily a fatal flaw. \nOption D is correct as it emphasizes a holistic approach to model selection, considering statistical measures, substantive differences, research goals, and understanding model limitations.

trying to access the \"Manage Categories\" section under the catalog menu.

What is the most likely cause of this issue?\n\nA) The Magento core files are corrupted and need to be reinstalled\nB) There is a mismatch between the SQL setup version and the core_resource table entries\nC) The server's MySQL database is offline or inaccessible\nD) The admin user doesn't have sufficient permissions to access the category management section\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely cause of this issue is a mismatch between the SQL setup version and the core_resource table entries. This can occur when an extension is installed, creates entries in the core_resource table, and is then uninstalled without properly cleaning up those entries. When the extension is reinstalled later, it may skip the installation of necessary database tables because the core_resource entries suggest they already exist. This results in the code trying to use tables that are not actually present in the database, leading to the \"table doesn't exist\" error.\n\nOption A is incorrect because corrupted core files would likely cause more widespread issues.\nOption C is unlikely as other admin panels are functioning correctly.\nOption D is not the cause, as the error is specifically about a missing database table, not a permissions issue."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/04/12", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/530548", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/380971/"], "docs_id": 530548, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have read two examples about \"Billion\" word and I got confused with why are existences \"a\" and \" the\" in these context.

But, a lot of code in public projects such as git and internal projects of companies is poorly documented and not very newcomer friendly. \n\nIn all my software development stints, I have had to deal with poorly documented code. I noticed the following things \\- \n\n1. Little or no comments in code.\n2. Method and variable names are not self describing.\n3. There is little or no documentation for how the code fits into the system or business processes.\n4. Hiring bad developers or not mentoring the good ones . They can't write simple and clean code. Hence its difficult or impossible for anyone, including the developer to document the code.\n\nAs a result, I have had to go through a lot of code and talk to many people to learn things. I feel this wastes everyone's time. It also creates the need for KT/Knowledge transfer sessions for newcomers to a project. \n\nI learned that documentation is not given the attention it deserves because of the following reasons: \n\n1. Laziness.\n2. Developers don't like to do anything but code.\n3. Job security. (If no one can understand your code easily, then you might not be easily replaceable.)\n4. Difficult deadlines leave little time to document.\n\nSo, I am wondering if there is a way to encourage and enforce good documentation practices in a company or project. What are the strategies to be used for creating decent documentation for the systems and code of any project, regardless of its complexity ? Are there any good examples of when minimal or no documentation is needed ? \n\nIMHO, I feel that we should have a documentation review after a project is delivered. If it is not simple, concise, illustrative and user friendly, the developer or technical documentation engineer own the responsibility for it and be made to fix it. I neither expect people to make reams of documentation, not hope that it will be user friendly like the head first books, but I expect it to eliminate the need for hours of analysis and wasteful KT sessions. \n\nIs there a way to end or alleviate this madness ? \"Document driven development\" perhaps ? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How to document code?\n---------------------\n\nYou already have a hint: look at how Java API is documented.\n\nMore generally, there is no unique set of rules which apply to every project. When I work on business\\-critical large\\-scale projects, the documentation has nothing to do with the one I would write for a small open source library, which, in turn, has nothing to do with the documentation of my medium\\-scale personal project.\n\nWhy many open source projects are not documented well?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nBecause most open source projects are made by people who contribute to those projects because it's fun. Most programmers and developers consider that **writing documentation is not fun enough** to be done for free.\n\nWhy many closed\\-source projects are not documented well?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nBecause it costs a huge amount of money to (1\\) write good documentation and to (2\\) maintain it.\n\n1. The immediate cost (cost of writing the documentation) is clearly visible to the stakeholders: if your team asks to spend the next two months documenting the project, it's two additional months of salary to pay.\n2. The long term cost (cost of maintaining the documentation) becomes noticeable pretty easy too to the managers, and is often the first target when they must lower the cost or shorten the delays. This causes an additional problem of outdated documentation which quickly becomes useless, and is extremely expensive to update.\n3. The long term savings (savings from not having to waste a few days exploring the legacy code just to understand a basic thing which should have been documented years ago) are, on the other hand, difficult to measure, which confirms the feeling of some managers that writing and maintaining documentation is a waste of time.\n\nWhat I often observe is that:\n\n1. At the beginning, the team is willing to document a lot.\n2. Over time, pressure of deadlines and lack of interest make it more and more difficult to maintain the documentation.\n3. A few months later, a new person who joins the project practically can't use the documentation, because it doesn't correspond at all to the actual system.\n4. Noticing that, management blames developers for not maintaining the documentation; developers ask to spend a few weeks updating it.\n\n\t* If management grants a few weeks for that, the cycle repeats.\n\t* If management refuses, based on previous experience, it only increases the bad experience, since the product lacks documentation, but a few months were spent writing and maintaining it.\n\n**Documentation should be a continuous process, just like testing. Spend a week simply coding a few thousands of LOC, and getting back to tests and documentation is very, very painful.**\n\nHow to encourage the team to write documentation?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSimilarly to the ways to encourage people to write clean code, to do regular refactoring, to use design patterns or to add enough unit tests.\n\n* Lead by example. If you write good documentation, your pairs might start doing it too.\n* Do systematic code reviews, including formal code reviews targeted at inspecting the documentation.\n* If some members of the team are particularly antipathetic to good documentation (or documentation at all), discuss the subject with them privately, to understand what are the impediments which prevent them from writing better documentation. If they blame the lack of time, you see the source of the problems.\n* Make the presence or the lack of documentation measurable for a few weeks or months, but don't focus on that. For example, you may measure the number of lines of comments per LOC, but don't make it a permanent measure, otherwise, developers will start writing long but meaningless comments just to get rid of low scores.\n* Use gamification. This comes together with the previous point.\n* Use positive/negative [reinforcement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement).\n* (See [the comment by SJuan76](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/246917/how-to-do-documentation-for-code-and-why-is-software-often-poorly-documented/246920?noredirect=1#comment495953_246920)) Treat the lack of comments as errors. For example, in Visual Studio, you can check an option to generate XML documentation. If you also check that all warnings are treated as errors, the lack of a comment at the top of a class or a method will halt the compilation.\n\nAs for the three previous points, this one should be used with caution. I used it for a while with a particularly tough team of beginner programmers, and it ended up with StyleCop\\-compliant comments like that:\n\n```cs\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Gets or sets the PrimaryHandling.\n    /// </summary>\n    public Workflow PrimaryHandling { get; set; }\n\n```\n\nwhich were, hm..., not particularly helpful.\n\n**Remember: [nothing automated can help you pinpoint bad comments when programmers wants to screw with you](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/242656/6605).** Only code reviews and other *human* tasks will help.\n\nAre there any good examples of when minimal or no documentation is needed?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Documentation explaining the architecture and the design** is not needed:\n\n* For a prototype,\n* For a personal project written in a few hours to accomplish a task, while being pretty sure this project won't be maintained any longer,\n* For any project where it is obvious, given the small size of it, coupled with the particularly clean code, that you will spend more time writing documentation than all the future maintainers exploring the code.\n\n**In\\-code documentation** (code comments) is not needed according to some developers when the code is self\\-documenting. For them, the presence of comments is, except in the rare cases, not a good sign, but a sign that the code wasn't refactored enough to be clear without the need for comments.\n\n> I feel that we should have a documentation review after a project is delivered.\n\nIf your project is delivered at least once per week, it's the way to go. If your project is not agile and is delivered at the intervals of six months, then do more regular reviews."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software development team is struggling with poor documentation practices.

It delays addressing documentation issues until the end of the project, which can lead to accumulated technical debt and make it much harder to retroactively document complex systems.\n\n2.

The fetching of new messages occurs continuously, allowing users to see new message headers appear in real-time. This is separate from the synchronization process, which downloads full message content for local search and offline access. The synchronization interval can be set by the user, with a minimum of 1 minute, while the continuous checking for new messages (fetching) happens independently of this setting.

Are there also any (presumably hacked / mined / extracted) images of these backgrounds to have a look at?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since the [Generation II](http://pokemongo.nianticlabs.com/en/post/ver-update-021617) release, the \"Dark\" and \"Steel\" type backgrounds were added to the mix, and \"Flying\" was added with the release of [Tornadus](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tornadus_(Pok%C3%A9mon))\n\n**Steel**\n\n[![Screenshot of Skamory](https://i.stack.imgur.com/K7YIFm.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/K7YIFm.png)\n\n**Dark**\n\n[![Screenshot of Murkrow](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xcHO1m.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xcHO1m.png)\n\n**Flying** \n\n[![Screenshot of Tornadus](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ngS5Om.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ngS5Om.png)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Pok\u00e9mon GO, which of the following statements is true regarding type-specific backgrounds for Pok\u00e9mon?\n\nA) The Flying-type background was available from the game's launch but was only visible for dual-type Flying Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nB) Dark and Steel-type backgrounds were added with the Generation II update, while the Flying-type background was introduced later with Tornadus.\n\nC) Fairy-type background was not available until the introduction of Generation VI Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nD) The Electric-type background was used for all Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon before the Steel-type background was introduced.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the evolution of type-specific backgrounds in Pok\u00e9mon GO. Option A is incorrect because the Flying-type background was not available at launch.

Then why do the charges distribute themselves in a particular manner? Why can't they be distributed over a small place on the conductor? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statement \"electric field inside a conductor is zero\" is true only after charges have distributed themselves in the most optimal way on the surface \\- it is an **electrostatic** result. Starting with an arbitrary charge distribution, there will be forces that cause a redistribution of the charge until, for a sphere, they are distributed uniformly. At that time, there is no electric field inside the conductor, and so no force on the charges that impels them to move to another, energetically more favorable, location.\n\nA simple proof for spherical conductor is this: if the sphere is symmetrical, then the solution must also be symmetrical (there is nothing about a sphere that would drive an asymmetrical solution, and the uniqueness theorem says that if you have \"a\" solution that meets the boundary conditions, it must be \"the\" solution. Since uniform distribution meets the boundary conditions, it must be the solution.). But if that is so, then the electric field inside the sphere must also be spherically symmetrical. And we know from Gauss's theorem that the integral $\\\\int E\\\\cdot dS$ must equal the $\\\\frac{Q}{\\\\epsilon\\_0}$.

Initially, the charges on the conductor will be induced near the locations where the external charges +q and -q are brought close. However, this is not the final equilibrium state. The charges on the conductor will experience forces due to their own electric field and will redistribute themselves. \n\nOver time, they will reach an electrostatic equilibrium where the charges are uniformly distributed over the surface of the spherical conductor. This uniform distribution is the most energetically favorable configuration and results in zero electric field inside the conductor, which is a key characteristic of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the charge distribution is not immediate; it takes time to reach equilibrium. Option B is incorrect because the final state has uniform charge distribution and zero internal electric field. Option D is incorrect because the charges don't remain fixed at their initial induced positions, and the internal electric field doesn't oscillate but rather becomes zero in the final state."}, "28": {"documentation": {"date": "2018/11/24", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/474298", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/325544/"], "docs_id": 474298, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The above words are taken from Thomas Browne's *Urn Burial* (1658\\), in this context:\n\"...

Their questions are the same to me.\n\n**If the *answers* are time sensitive**, such as (in your example) plug\\-ins or frameworks that have been updated, it is best to add information to the original question.\n\nThis is actually *critically* important, because users who are desperately checking every link in their search results will come across the *old* question first. If the information in it is out of date, that is bad for the *entire StackOverflow community* because it means that the app is stale. We should *update* old entries, not create new ones. \n\n> 2 when the question's main purpose is to generate relevant discussion, and the old thread is stale\n\nThis has been mentioned many times before as well. StackOverflow is simply **not** for discussion questions. The format is not built for it, the application is not meant for it. It was designed from the outset with discussion specifically discouraged. \n\nWhen you say \"the old thread is stale\" you are free to add your input onto that thread, although if it is truly a discussion question, added attention may just get it closed."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the StackOverflow policy described, which of the following scenarios would be most appropriate for creating a new question rather than marking it as a duplicate?\n\nA) A user wants to start a discussion about the best programming practices for a specific language, even though a similar discussion exists from two years ago.\n\nB) A developer needs urgent help with a coding problem and believes their question requires immediate attention.\n\nC) A question about a software library has been asked before, but the accepted answer is now outdated due to major changes in the library's latest version.\n\nD) A user has a question that is similar to an existing one, but with slight differences in the specific requirements of their project.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because StackOverflow is not designed for discussion-based questions, regardless of how old the previous thread is. \n\nOption B is incorrect because StackOverflow treats all questions with equal urgency and does not prioritize based on a user's personal time constraints.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the policy suggests updating the existing question with new information rather than creating a new one, especially for time-sensitive answers like updated libraries or plugins.\n\nOption D is the most appropriate scenario for a new question. While similar questions may exist, if there are specific differences in the requirements or context, it may warrant a new question.

It is fed from a 100A breaker using 3\\-3\\-3\\-5 CU Service wire. I removed the ground screw to isolate the Neutral and I installed the ground bus that came with it on the left side. It is attached with 2 screws directly to the panel. I connected the \\#5 ground wire to this ground bus.\n\nThe question:\nThe ground bus is SHORT with only 8\\-10 usable positions so I have added an additional ground bus on the right side of the panel. It is made specifically for the panel, Square D and attaches with 1 screw, centered over 2 nubs that lock it in place. Is the screw enough to ground this additional bar or do I need to interconnect it to the first ground bus with wire. If so, what size?\n\nThanks VERY much in advance for your assistance!\n\n**Follow up:**\n\nINSTRUCTIONS!! Those would VERY handy indeed. The problem is that they SUCK. Number 4 gives all the info about how to wire it, but I found it less than useful. Here is the entire text of the instructions:\n\n1\\) Turn off all power to the enclosure\n\n2\\) Mount grounding bar to the back of enclosure:\n\n* if one mounting hole and two nubs are provided, mount with outer holes over nubs and mounting screw through center hole.\n* if two mounting holes are provided, mount with two mounting screws.\n\nNOTE: If no mounting holes are provided, use \\#26 drill bit to drill two 0\\.147 in diameter mounting holes using grounding bar as a template.\n\n3\\) Apply equipment grounding label to enclosure beside grounding bar.\n\n4\\) **Install wiring to grounding bar.** See equipment grounding label for binding screw torque.\n\nSo are they assuming this is the ONLY grounding bar and therefore the \\#5 ground feed from the main panel will get attached to it? Or is the lack of instruction to jumper it to an existing main ground bar an indication that the screws are enough and that it grounds through the body of the enclosure to the original ground bar? I sure can't tell from what little info they provided.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Follow the instructions.** You are obliged (NEC 110\\.3\\) to follow the extra grounding bar's instructions. That's because those instructions are the basis for UL granting it a *listing* as safe. \n\nAs long as you met the instructions, **feel free to exceed**. So you can add a ground wire even if it's not required. Generally you don't downsize a service wire (i.e. you wouldn't run 14AWG to the last single 5\\-15 receptacle of a 20A circuit), so you'd stay with 5AWG Cu ground wire. \n\nAny type is fine, as long as it meets the original current rating.

According to the NEC 110.3, you are obligated to follow the manufacturer's instructions for installing additional components like a ground bus. These instructions are the basis for the product's UL listing as safe. However, as stated in the answer, \"As long as you met the instructions, feel free to exceed.\" This means you can add additional grounding measures, such as interconnecting the new ground bus to the original one with a wire, even if it's not explicitly required by the instructions.

Are these concepts well defined in sample?; in population?\n\n**Motivation**  \n\nTake a simple regression\n\n$$y \\= \\\\beta\\_0 \\+ \\\\beta\\_1 x \\+ \\\\varepsilon.$$ \n\nSuppose the regressor $x$ is stochastic.

It's just a bunch of values $X\\=x\\_1, x\\_2, \\\\ldots, x\\_n$, with no probability model. By *definition* its variance is\n\n$$\\\\text{Var}(X) \\= \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n \\\\left(x\\_i \\- \\\\bar X\\\\right)^2$$\n\nwhere $$\\\\bar X \\= \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n x\\_i$$ is its *mean.* There is no justification whatsoever to use $n\\-1$ instead of $n$ in any of these fractions\\-\\-and this is never legitimately done\\-\\-because no estimates are being made.\n\nWe may always think of $X$ as defining a \"population.\" This is the definition of a population variance.\n2. **\"Covariance between a deterministic variable and a stochastic variable.\"**\n\nOne way to understand this is to assume it refers to a sequence of the form $(x\\_1, Y\\_1\\), (x\\_2,Y\\_2\\), \\\\ldots, (x\\_n,Y\\_n)$ where the $x\\_i$ are numbers and the $Y\\_i$ are random variables. Then we may define the random variable $$\\\\bar Y \\= \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n Y\\_i,$$ *via* which the covariance of $x$ and $Y$ is defined as\n\n$$\\\\text{Cov}(x,Y) \\= \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n (x\\_i \\- \\\\bar x)(Y\\_i \\- \\\\bar Y).$$\n\nIt is a linear combination of the $Y\\_i$ and consequently is itself a random variable. This notation is frequently used as a shorthand in linear regression calculations.\n3. **\"Covariance between two deterministic variables.\"**\n\n\"Two deterministic variables\" can be considered a dataset of ordered pairs $(x\\_1, y\\_1\\), (x\\_2,y\\_2\\), \\\\ldots, (x\\_n,y\\_n)$. The covariance can be defined exactly as in (2\\) and interpreted similarly. In fact, this is a direct consequence of (1\\): after all, [covariances are variances](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/142472).\n4. **\"Are these concepts well defined in samples?\"**\n\nBecause they are well\\-defined for any dataset, they are well\\-defined for a sample. Note that similar expressions with $n\\-1$ in the (outer) denominator are *estimators*: they are *not* the sample variance or sample covariance.\n5. **\"Are these concepts well defined in populations?\"**\n\nBecause they are well\\-defined for any dataset, and a population can be considered a dataset (when fully enumerated), they are well\\-defined for a population."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a simple linear regression model y = \u03b2\u2080 + \u03b2\u2081x + \u03b5, where x is a deterministic variable, which of the following statements is correct regarding the calculation of the OLS estimate of \u03b2\u2081?\n\nA) The formula \u03b2\u0302\u2081 = Cov(x,y) / Var(x) cannot be used because variance and covariance are not defined for deterministic variables.\n\nB) The formula \u03b2\u0302\u2081 = Cov(x,y) / Var(x) can be used, but n-1 must be replaced with n in the denominator of both variance and covariance calculations.\n\nC) The formula \u03b2\u0302\u2081 = Cov(x,y) / Var(x) can be used as is, with no modifications needed for deterministic variables.\n\nD) The formula \u03b2\u0302\u2081 = Cov(x,y) / Var(x) must be replaced with the expanded form:\n\u03b2\u0302\u2081 = [\u03a3(x\u1d62 - x\u0304)(y\u1d62 - \u0233)] / [\u03a3(x\u1d62 - x\u0304)\u00b2], where x\u0304 and \u0233 are the respective means.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The concepts of variance and covariance are well-defined for deterministic variables, both in samples and populations. For a deterministic variable, these are calculated using the same formulas as for stochastic variables, but they are interpreted as descriptive statistics of the dataset rather than estimates of population parameters. Therefore, the standard formula \u03b2\u0302\u2081 = Cov(x,y) / Var(x) can be used without modification, even when x is deterministic. The use of n or n-1 in the denominator depends on whether you're calculating a population (n) or sample (n-1) statistic, not on whether the variable is deterministic or stochastic."}, "44": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/09/05", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/821164", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/250300/"], "docs_id": 821164, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I can check why a package is (to be) installed using the command:\n\n```\naptitude why <package-name>\n\n```\n\nI like to manage packages using Aptitude [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) (aka ncurses), i.e. running:\n\n```\naptitude\n\n```\n\nIs there any way to show the information of `aptitude why` from within this interface?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Launch `aptitude` in interactive mode.\n\nWhen you are displaying the information of a package in `aptitude`'s interactive mode, you can press the `I` key to switch between `Description`, `Related Dependencies` and `Why Installed` in the information panel.\n\n---\n\nYou can make this more obvious if you enable displaying tabs in the information panel:\n\nHit `Ctrl`\\+`T` to activate the menu, navigate to the `Options` menu and select `Preferences`.\n\nSearch for this option:\n\n```\n[ ] Display tabs for the information area\n\n```\n\nActivate it by pressing `Enter` or `Space` when it is selected.

Alas, as the feature only was released on the stable branch in January, I haven't found any documentation on it.

While straight binary might seem simpler at first glance, two's complement offers significant benefits in hardware implementation:\n\n1. Negation is simple: To negate a number, just invert all bits and add 1.\n2. Addition and subtraction use the same hardware for both positive and negative numbers.\n3.

I can\u00b4t change the AppleJuice \\& OrangeJuice implementations since they come from two unrelated SOAP services. My aim is merge these 3 lists in a Juice lists and then remove the duplicates using a concrete match pattern.\n\nWhich pattern would best to merge these different objects?\n\nI was thinking of using the Facade pattern for the different objects and then Strategy for the match pattern. If it helps, I\u00b4ll be using C\\# to implement the code.\n\nHere what I did.\n\nFirst, I've extended the Juice class and I've created 3 extensions methods for the classes: AppleJuice, OrangeJuice and Juice.\n\n```\npublic class JuiceExtended : Juice\n{\n    public JuiceSourceType JuiceSource { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic enum JuiceSourceType \n{\n    Apple,\n    Orange,\n    Juice,\n    JuiceWithoutSugar\n}\n\n```\n\nI need to know the source, because if there is a duplicate I have to keep the objects from the Juice\n\n```\n    public static IEnumerable<JuiceExtended> ConvertToExtended(this IEnumerable<AppleJuice> juices)\n    {\n        var list = juices.Select((x) => {\n            var item = new JuiceExtended()\n            {\n                JuiceSource = JuiceSourceType.Apple,\n                //More properties                  \n            };\n            return item;\n        });\n\n        return list;\n    }\n\n    public static IEnumerable<JuiceExtended> ConvertToExtended(this IEnumerable<OrangeJuice> juices)\n    {\n        var list = juices.Select((x) => {\n            var item = new JuiceExtended()\n            {\n                JuiceSource = JuiceSourceType.Orange,\n                //More properties\n            };\n            return item;\n        });\n\n        return list;\n    }\n\n    public static IEnumerable<JuiceExtended> ConvertToExtended(this IEnumerable<Juice> juices, JuiceSourceType type)\n    {\n        var list = juices.Select((x) => {\n            var item = (JuiceExtended) x;\n            item.JuiceSource = type;     \n            return item;\n        });\n\n        return list;\n    }\n\n```\n\nAfter this, I've created a JuiceHandler and I've implemented the strategy pattern inside for the dedup algorithm\n\n```\npublic class JuiceHandler : IJuiceHandler\n{\n    private static IEnumerable<JuiceExtended> _juices;\n    private JuiceStrategy _strategy;\n\n    public JuiceHandler()\n    {\n        _juices = new List<JuiceExtended>();\n    }\n\n    public JuiceHandler(JuiceStrategy strategy)\n    {\n        _juices = new List<JuiceExtended>();\n        _strategy = strategy;\n    }\n\n    public void Load(IEnumerable<JuiceExtended> juices)\n    {\n        _juices = _juices.Concat(juices);\n    }\n\n    public void SetJuiceStrategy(JuiceStrategy strategy)\n    {\n        _strategy = strategy;\n    }\n\n    public IEnumerable<Juice> Transform()\n    {\n        if (_strategy == null)\n            throw new NullReferenceException(\"The strategy has not been selected.\");\n\n        else if (_juices.Count() == 0)\n            return _juices;\n\n        return _strategy.Dedup(_juices);\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nLooking about below responses, @MainMa, I think I'll move the extension methods in the WCF partial classes, because I already have partial classes for WCF so, there is no point to put them into another location.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can use the Facade pattern like you thought to treat your AppleJuice and OrangeJuice objects like Juice objects. It's pretty simple. Here's your Juice class:\n\n```\nclass Juice\n{\n    Juice(AppleJuice aj)\n    {\n        this.Color = aj.Color;\n        this.VitaminC = aj.VitaminC;\n    }\n\n    Juice(OrangeJuice oj)\n    {\n        this.Color = oj.Color;\n        this.VitaminC = oj.VitaminC;\n    }\n\n    public ColorType { get; set; }\n    public VitaminCType VitaminC { get; set; }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis Juice class covers both juice types and extracts the information that you are interested in. To handle Juice equality, you need to implement IEqualityComparer\\<Juice\\>:\n\n```\nclass JuiceEq : IEqualityComparer<Juice>\n{\n    public bool Equals(Juice x, Juice y)\n    {\n        if (x == null) return y == null;\n        if (y == null) return false;\n        return x.Color == y.Color && x.VitaminC = y.VitaminC;\n    }\n\n    public int GetHashCode(Juice obj)\n    {\n        if(obj == null) return 0;\n        return new { obj.Color, obj.VitaminC }.GetHashCode();\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nNow, to use this when you make you SOAP requests and then remove duplicates:\n\n```\nIEnumerable<Juice> GetJuice()\n{\n    IEnumerable<AppleJuice> appleJuices = SoapAppleJuiceRequestRequest();\n    IEnumerable<OrangeJuice> orangeJuices = SoapOrangeJuiceRequestRequest();\n\n    IEnumerable<Juice> juices = appleJuices.Select(s => new Juice(s))\n      .Concat(orangeJuices.Select(s => new Juice(s));\n\n    IEnumerable<Juice> deDuped = juices.Distinct(new JuiceEq());\n    return deDuped;\n}\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer is working on a system that needs to merge and deduplicate data from three different sources: AppleJuice, OrangeJuice, and Juice.

It (0\\.3\\) can not be the unconditional probability of being paid in October, because this would imply the unconditional probability of being paid is at least $1\\.2 \\= 0\\.2 \\+ 0\\.7 \\+ 0\\.3$. Therefore, no further adjustment is in order to get the conditional probability of being paid in October given not being paid in September.\n\nOn the other hand, the $0\\.7$ probability of being paid in September was stated as being an unconditional probability; hence your calculation to get the conditional probability of being paid in September given not being paid in August.\n\nYour calculation to determine the probability of being paid in September, given not being paid in August, is correct. As a partial check of your calculation, note that if the unconditional probabilities of being paid in August and September were $0\\.2$ and $0\\.8$ respectively, rather than $0\\.2$ and $0\\.7$, the corresponding calculation to what you did would result in a probability of being paid in September, given not being paid in August, of 1, which of course is as it must be given the unconditional probability of being paid in August or September being equal to $1$ .\n\nAs a practical note, if this is just a hypothetical (theoretical) exercise, fine (\"in a variation of the problem\" doesn't sound like the way you'd describe a real\\-world situation).

Apologies if the answer to my questions is obvious but I couldn't find it by Google/Superuser search.\n\nSo I'm in\\-charge of manage about 200 windows computers where I work and I recently learned about this thing active directory to easily effect changes on all computers which is just great. So I set up the domain controller [and found a .vbs script](https://www.sole.dk/vbscript-to-join-computers-to-domain-with-specific-user-and-avoid-having-to-manually-place-them-in-ad/) to join computers to the domain. Perfect.\n\nExcept the GPOs I set are not being pushed down to the computers. I tried running \"gpupdate /force\" on a computer and it shows the following error\n\n> The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows attempted to retrieve new Group Policy settings for this user or computer. Look in the details tab for error code and description. Windows will automatically retry this operation at the next refresh cycle.

Now, it could be that pointing the DNS to DC is mandatory in AD. But I never saw this mentioned in any of the tutorials I found which is really weird. So is it really required? If it is, is there any way I can update the DNS of all the computers in the domain without physically going to each computer?\n\nThis also raises another issue. What if I, for some reason have to change the current IP of the DC. Do I then need to update the DNS again on every computer?\n\nThanks for your time and looking forward to your advice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> pointing the DNS to DC is mandatory in AD\n\nNo.\n\nThe only real DNS requirement1 is that your AD domain (with subdomains) must be *resolvable* by clients \u2013 but there is nothing specified about the exact path it takes. (\"Non\\-authoritative answer\" is completely normal.)\n\nFor example, if the following commands return successful results (SOA with zone information, SRV with service details) then the DNS configuration should be good.\n\n```\nnslookup -q=soa YOURDOMAIN\nnslookup -q=srv _ldap._tcp.YOURDOMAIN\nnslookup -q=srv _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.YOURDOMAIN\n\n```\n\n(SOA is not strictly required, but I included it for dynamic DNS updates. There are other required records, e.g. `_kerberos._tcp`, but there's probably no need to test every single one of them.)\n\n* So if the AD domain was chosen from the global namespace, e.g. `ad.example.com` or `corp.example.com`, and if it was properly delegated (i.e. the parent `example.com` domain has correct NS records), and if your *regular* DNS servers can forward the DNS queries to the AD DC (i.e. port 53 isn't firewalled off), that's enough.\n\n(~~The DNS port on DCs doesn't need to be accessible to the entire *world*, only to the joined PCs.~~ Correction: it needs to be accessible to the DNS *resolvers*; i.e. to the DNS servers that your PCs use.)\n* If the AD domain can't be delegated for some reason (e.g. if you chose a made\\-up TLD like `example.corp`), but the PCs still use some *other* internally\\-managed DNS servers, then it's still enough to just set up a \"forward zone\" or \"stub zone\" on those DNS servers.\n* If you can't do delegation *and* don't control the DNS servers being used... *then* you have a problem. You could still do tricks like NAT'ing all DNS requests so that they go to an internal DNS server; it works but it's rather ugly in principle.\n* (In all three cases above, there's really just *one* place to reconfigure in case you add or move DCs \u2013 be it NS/glue records or the \"stub zone\" configuration or whatever.)\n\nPointing the DNS directly to DCs is only useful in rare situations, e.g. when setting up a \"test\" domain with 2\\-3 PCs, or when the DCs *do* in fact double as the organization's main DNS resolvers (which, I believe, was against all recommendations before Server 2016\\).\n\n---\n\n1 Of course there are other *non\\-DNS\\-related* requirements as well. At minimum, the PCs must be able to reach Kerberos on the DC for authentication; LDAP (regular and Global Catalog) for looking up GPO information; and SMB (i.e. file sharing) for downloading the GPOs themselves.\n\nFor troubleshooting, I'd install Wireshark on a workstation, start the packet monitoring, and watch what happens when `gpupdate /force` is run. There also are various Windows knobs to activate verbose logging of GPO processing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is managing an Active Directory environment and experiencing issues with Group Policy updates not being applied to client computers.

The documentation states that the only real DNS requirement for Active Directory is that the AD domain (with subdomains) must be resolvable by clients. This can be achieved through various means, such as proper delegation in the global namespace, using forward zones or stub zones on internal DNS servers, or in some cases, pointing directly to domain controllers. However, pointing DNS directly to domain controllers is not mandatory and is only useful in specific situations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because pointing DNS directly to domain controllers is not mandatory for AD functionality.\n\nOption C is incorrect as non-authoritative answers are normal and do not necessarily indicate a problem.\n\nOption D is incorrect because changing a domain controller's IP address doesn't always require manual updates on all clients if the DNS infrastructure is properly configured."}, "58": {"documentation": {"date": "2022/02/16", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/353131", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/66769/"], "docs_id": 353131, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Problem:\n========\n\nI am using the extension **Fooman\\_PdfCustomiser**.\n\nI need to disable the plugin named `fooman_pdfcustomiser_paymentinfoblock`.\n\n**vendor/fooman/pdfcustomiser\\-implementation\\-m2/src/etc/di.xml**:\n\n```\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:ObjectManager/etc/config.xsd\">\n\n    ...\n\n    <type name=\"Magento\\Payment\\Block\\Info\">\n        <plugin name=\"fooman_pdfcustomiser_paymentinfoblock\"\n                type=\"\\Fooman\\PdfCustomiser\\Plugin\\PaymentInfoBlockPlugin\"/>\n    </type>\n\n    ...\n</config>\n\n```\n\nAttempt:\n========\n\nI try to disable the extension from my own module **Company\\_App**.\n\n**app/code/Company/App/etc/di.xml**:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:ObjectManager/etc/config.xsd\">\n\n    <type name=\"Magento\\Payment\\Block\\Info\">\n        <plugin name=\"fooman_pdfcustomiser_paymentinfoblock\"\n                disabled=\"true\"/>\n    </type>\n</config>\n\n```\n\n**app/code/Company/App/etc/module.xml**:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:Module/etc/module.xsd\">\n    <module name=\"Company_Base\" setup_version=\"1.0.0\">\n        <sequence>\n            <module name=\"Fooman_PdfCustomiser\"/>\n        </sequence>\n    </module>\n</config>\n\n```\n\nThen I executed\n\n```\nphp bin/magento setup:di:compile\n\n```\n\nResult:\n=======\n\nBut it does not work.

No, but for real, I don't even see a question :D\n\nIf the tab was defined in a module that you are sure that will always be available, like core Magento 2 code, reuse the tab. I don't see why you would use a tab that is created in a different module, which might, or might not exist/active. Create a tab for your Vendor folder, and go from there. Or, if you, for some reason, want to reuse a tab declared in another module, just copy the declaration, so you have it in your code. Just like the security tab is declared 3 times in core modules.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nh6x0.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nh6x0.png)\n\nI wonder how many tabs you have if it takes so much time to sort them? :)\n\nIf this still doesn't work for, maybe check if the module that declares the tab is enabled before checking config values? `\\Magento\\Framework\\Module\\Manager::isEnabled`"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: You are developing a Magento 2 module and need to disable a plugin from another extension.

These are more objective, in that they simply carry the meaning of a lack of understanding (clarity, certainty), and they thus lend themselves well to academic writing.

It uses more objective language, focusing on the effect (lack of clarity) rather than attributing an emotional state to the audience.\n2. The phrase \"lack of clarity\" is more formal and neutral than terms like \"perplexed\" or \"confused.\"\n3. It avoids being judgmental or assuming the audience's reaction, which is important in academic writing.\n4. The use of \"could\" maintains a tone of possibility rather than certainty, which is often preferred in academic discourse.\n\nOptions A and B use terms like \"perplexed\" and \"confuse,\" which, while not incorrect, are less formal and more emotionally charged than preferred in academic writing. Option D, while using academic language, still attributes a specific reaction (puzzlement) to the audience, which is less objective than discussing the clarity of the information presented."}}
