I even asked a [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7922019/please-explain-openjdks-rehashing-mechanism) about it on StackOverflow. \n\nAnother example that illustrates the point:\n\n```\n 1141       public static int bitCount(int i) {\n 1142           // HD, Figure 5-2\n 1143           i = i - ((i >>> 1) & 0x55555555);\n 1144           i = (i & 0x33333333) + ((i >>> 2) & 0x33333333);\n 1145           i = (i + (i >>> 4)) & 0x0f0f0f0f;\n 1146           i = i + (i >>> 8);\n 1147           i = i + (i >>> 16);\n 1148           return i & 0x3f;\n 1149       }\n\n```\n\nThis code can be found in the [Integer](http://www.docjar.com/html/api/java/lang/Integer.java.html) class. \n\n**I cannot help but feel stupid when I look at this.** Did I miss a class or two in college or is this not something I am supposed to just *get*? I can do simple bit\\-wise operations (like ANDing, ORing, XORing, shifting), but come on, how does someone come up with a code like that above?\n\n**How good does a well\\-rounded programmer need to be with bit\\-wise operations?**\n\n**On a side note...** *What worries me is that the person who answered my question on StackOverflow answered it in a matter of minutes. If he could do that, why did I just stare like deer in the headlights?*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would say that as a well\\-rounded developer, you need to *understand* the operators and bitwise operations.\n\nSo, at a minimum, you should be able to figure out the code above after a bit of thinking.\n\nBitwise operations tend to be rather low level, so if you work on websites and LOB software, you are unlikely to use them much.\n\nLike other things, if you don't use them much, you wouldn't be conversant in them.\n\nSo, you *shouldn't* worry about someone being able to figure it out very quickly, as they (probably) work with this kind of code a lot. Possibly writing OS code, driver code or other tricky bit manipulation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the importance of bitwise operations for a well-rounded programmer?\n\nA) A well-rounded programmer should be able to write complex bitwise algorithms like the one in OpenJDK's Integer class from memory.\n\nB) Bitwise operations are only relevant for operating system and driver developers, and are not important for most programmers.\n\nC) A well-rounded programmer should understand bitwise operators and be able to figure out complex bitwise code after some analysis, even if they don't use such operations frequently.\n\nD) Proficiency in bitwise operations is crucial for all types of programming, including web development and line-of-business software.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The StackExchange response emphasizes that a well-rounded developer should understand bitwise operators and be able to figure out complex bitwise code after some thought, even if they don't use such operations frequently in their day-to-day work. This aligns with the idea that understanding the concept is important, even if one doesn't need to write such code regularly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it sets an unrealistic expectation. The ability to write complex bitwise algorithms from memory is not necessary for most programmers and goes beyond what's described as essential in the answer.\n\nOption B is too limiting. While bitwise operations are indeed more common in low-level programming like OS and driver development, the answer suggests that understanding them is valuable for all well-rounded developers, not just those in specific fields.\n\nOption D goes too far in the opposite direction. The answer clearly states that bitwise operations are not frequently used in areas like web development and line-of-business software, so describing them as crucial for all types of programming is an overstatement."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2013/10/13", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/94826", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/49106/"], "docs_id": 94826, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a problem on installing fedora.\n\nI have already installed windows 8, and I have two different partitions (C (for windows), and D(for data)). \n\nI had also shrink the size of D by 50 GB, in order to create this free space to install fedora.\n\nHowever the fedora installer recognises only one disc, and not all the partitions I have made.

There is a first stage where you choose which disks to use *at all*. The installer doesn't look at the partitions until after you choose the disks, and **will not** write or destroy anything until it very clearly says that it's going to (and gives you a chance to cancel).\n\nSo, select your one disk, and then you'll get to the next section where you can work with the partitions. I promise: it'll be safe even though it is confusing and seems like it might be dangerous.\n\nThe installer team is aware of this issue and is working on a better user interface design for Fedora 20 and onward.

They have shrunk the D: partition by 50GB to create free space for Fedora. However, the Fedora installer only recognizes one disk. What is the most likely explanation and appropriate course of action?\n\nA) The Fedora installer is incompatible with the existing partition scheme. The user should abort the installation and seek an alternative Linux distribution.\n\nB) The Fedora installer has a bug that prevents it from recognizing multiple partitions. The user should report this as a critical issue to the Fedora development team and wait for a fix.\n\nC) The Fedora installer is working correctly, but it first requires the user to select which disk to use before showing individual partitions. The user should proceed with selecting the disk, after which they will be able to work with the partitions.\n\nD) The Fedora installer is likely to overwrite the entire disk. The user should back up all data and be prepared to reinstall Windows after Fedora installation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, the Fedora installer has a two-stage process. In the first stage, it asks the user to choose which disk to use, without showing individual partitions. This can be confusing and may seem dangerous, but it's actually working as designed. After selecting the disk, the user will then be able to see and work with individual partitions in the next stage. The installer will not write or destroy any data until it clearly indicates it's about to do so and gives the user a chance to cancel.

So I'm looking for ways to make this more efficient. It does appear, however, that calling `poll()` after a `write()` is the issue as this is consistently in the order of 100x slower than after a `read()` call.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The difference between the time between one syscall and another is simply the difference of time between the precedent and the next one. It is simply a measurement purpose timestamp so that users will know how much time a syscall takes after another and to find out whether the app is hanging on one particular syscall. \n\nHowever I am a bit befuddled to see that reads are quicker here. Simply because writes are often async but reads tend to be in straight line and if we are hopping across different filesystem blocks, disk seek can make it slow. But see the revents (requested events \\- third argument in poll() call) is saying POLLIN meaning data to be read. Perhaps that might explain the apparent slowness. Albeit, I will need the entire strace to be sure."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the `poll()` system call behavior described in the StackExchange post, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The `poll()` calls are consistently faster after `write()` operations compared to `read()` operations.\n\nB) The difference in `poll()` call times is likely due to the use of the ACE C++ communication library.\n\nC) The `poll()` calls are taking milliseconds after `write()` operations and microseconds after `read()` operations, which is unexpected given typical I/O behavior.\n\nD) The `poll()` call times are primarily influenced by the number of file descriptors being monitored, rather than the preceding I/O operation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Obtain or compile an ARM version of the native library.\n\nD) Java is not capable of running on ARM architecture. Switch to a different programming language for M1 Macs.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The issue stems from the application using a native library (likely OpenGL via jogamp) that only has an Intel version available. The error message indicates an \"incompatible architecture (have 'x86_64', need 'arm64e'),\" which clearly shows the mismatch between the Intel (x86_64) library and the ARM (arm64e) architecture of the M1 Mac.\n\nPure Java code is platform-independent and should run on any architecture. However, when Java applications use native libraries (which are compiled for specific architectures), they become dependent on the architecture of those libraries.\n\nTo resolve this, the developer needs to obtain or compile an ARM version of the native library. Alternatively, they could create a universal binary that includes both Intel and ARM versions of the library, allowing the application to work on both architectures.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they misidentify the core issue or propose solutions that don't address the actual problem of the incompatible native library."}, "4": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/11/17", "source": ["https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/201955", "https://magento.stackexchange.com", "https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/54069/"], "docs_id": 201955, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am referring to question \\-\n[Magento 2 : How to add custom data in order email](https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/163916/how-to-add-custom-data-in-order-email-in-magento-2)\n\nBelow is by observer execute method\n\n```\npublic function execute(\\Magento\\Framework\\Event\\Observer $observer)\n{\n    /** @var \\Magento\\Framework\\App\\Action\\Action $controller */\n    $transport = $observer->getTransport();\n    $transport['businessname'] = \"XYZ\";\n}\n\n```\n\nBelow is my event.xml\n\n```\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:Event/etc/events.xsd\">\n    <event name=\"email_invoice_set_template_vars_before\">\n        <observer name=\"custom_invoice_email_variable\" instance=\"VendorName\\ModuleName\\Observer\\SalesInvoiceTemplateVarsBefore\" />\n    </event>\n</config>\n\n```\n\nI am calling it in a template as \\- **{{var businessname\\|raw}}**.

But it would not be hard to adapt the subroutine to accept an arbitrary circle instead of the radius `k`.\n* Again for simplicity I have provided two different functions here for a `path` and for a `point` but you could easily write a single `invert` function and use `if path P` and `if pair P` to pick the right action according to what you passed to it.\n* The expression `unitvector p scaled (k/abs(p)) scaled k` might be more naturally written as `unitvector p scaled (k**2/abs(p))` but you will get an arithmetic overflow error if you set `k` to more than 181\\. This because `182**2` is greater than `2**15` which is the largest number plain MP allows. To avoid this either code it as I have shown or use `mpost -numbersytem=double` to process it.\n* Don't use this to invert a point at the origin; since you can't easily represent infinity on a finite diagram."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of geometric inversion, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The inversion of a circle always results in another circle of the same size.\n\nB) The product of the distances OP and OP' in an inversion is always equal to 1.\n\nC) The inversion of a point at the center of inversion O results in a point at infinity.\n\nD) Inversion can only be applied to circles and not to individual points.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) is incorrect because the inversion of a circle can result in a circle of a different size, as shown in the image.\nB) is incorrect because the product OP * OP' equals a constant k, not necessarily 1.\nC) is correct.

Is this an actual item of clothing, or is it some sort of future piece of fashion that we're supposed to imagine?

My question is: **is this an actual type of clothing, or was it made up for the book?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A Google Books search finds three books with one or more matches for \"terrorist jacket\" besides Connie Willis, [*The Doomsday Book*](https://books.google.com/books?id=2v22ikL95GQC&pg=PA70&dq=%22terrorist+jacket%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw5Pj9uOPQAhVI2WMKHYi4CH0Q6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&q=%22terrorist%20jacket%22&f=false) (1993\\). One book is older than Willis's and two are younger.\n\nThe early occurrence is from Meade Minnigerode, [*The Magnificent Comedy: Some Aspects of Public and Private Life in Paris, from the Fall of Robespierre to the Coming of Bonaparte, July, 1794\\-November, 1799*](https://books.google.com/books?id=OPpnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22terrorist+jacket%22&dq=%22terrorist+jacket%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw5Pj9uOPQAhVI2WMKHYi4CH0Q6AEIVDAI) (1931\\) \\[combined snippets]:\n\n> When the time came to strike down H\u00e9bert, and Chaumette\u2014when it was necessary to be clear of any indulgent taint, when policy required a display of terrorist zeal, lest it be said that the attack on H\u00e9bert was counter\\-revolutionary in character\u2014Robespierre made himself the patron of the blood drinkers; he slipped on his **terrorist jacket** and was as comfortable in it as he had ever been in his immaculate blue coat. Later, when policy required, he would perhaps slip it off again. He spilled blood, Thibaudeau was to record, \"solely as a deliberate necessity in order to ... surmount obstacles. ... The scaffold was the only weapon that he knew how to handle; he made use of it without pity and without remorse.\"\n\nIn this excerpt, the author might just as well have spoken of Robespierre's \"terrorist hat\": the sense is purely metaphorical and the word *jacket* (or *hat*) stands for *role*\u2014the particular role that the man is to play when appropriately garbed (metaphorically speaking).\n\nNext, from Joseph Black, [*Vladimir Putin and the New World Order: Looking East, Looking West?*](https://books.google.com/books?id=V6EidjCuDKIC&pg=PA343&dq=%22terrorist+jacket%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRhLqzu-PQAhVHHGMKHVBQCqsQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&q=%22terrorist%20jacket%22&f=false) (2004\\):\n\n> As we have seen, officials in Moscow looked forward to the upcoming APEC meetings in Shanghai, where they hoped to hear what they had gained by closing the \\[Lourdes surveillance] base in which there had been some 1,000 personnel housed. Confusion on this issue was common on Moscow, where misguided rumors circulated that it was not to be fully closed down. Certainly the Russian communist press kept pressure on the Kremlin and the public to maintain links with Cuba and, above all, to prevent the U.S. from fitting Cuban for a **terrorist jacket**, making it subject to attack by the coalition.\n\nIn this excerpt *Cuban* appears to be a typo for *Cuba*, and the sense of the sentence is that the U.S. government is eager to act (metaphorically) the role of tailor and impose the identity of \"terrorist\" on the Cuban government. The jacket in question may also carry a hint of being a straitjacket. The sense of the expression here is quite similar to its sense in the previous example.\n\nAnd from Susan Rosenberg, [*An American Radical*](https://books.google.com/books?id=ovUeQCkmoE8C&pg=PT126&dq=%22terrorist+jacket%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7w_y8xOPQAhXGxVQKHdsVBRoQ6AEITjAH#v=onepage&q=%22terrorist%20jacket%22&f=false) (2011\\):\n\n> They interviewed all of us. We had thirty minutes each. I went first,and when I was finished I hoped that everyone else had been more detailed in their descriptions, as I didn't think I had been clear enough. The ACLU \\[American Civil Liberties Union] team had been sympathetic, but the problem of my \u201c**terrorist jacket**\u201d seemed to be a big concern. They asked me question after question about my record. Dr. Korn said that it was clear to him that the unit had a specific intent.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The BOP \\[Bureau of Prisons] had admitted to the ACLU that while we had been housed in the HSU \\[High Security Unit], there had been no threats by outside forces to either retaliate against the BOP or to free us and that our placement there was simply a matter of the \"justice community's\" decision. We believed that if we relied in the BOP's answer, we would never get rid of the \"**terrorist jacket**.\" They would construct a larger version of what we were in, with all the necessary controls in it. We further believed that our psychological files needed to be released to prove that the HSU was an experiment in psychological torture.\n\nIn Rosenberg's book, *jacket* has a very specific meaning:\n\n> A \"**prison jacket**\" is security identification that determines your resulting placement in either a maximum\\- or minimum\\-security facility. It is based on the moment of the crime. Because the crime and its severity are frozen in time, this ensures that the prisoner is her crime. Because you cannot undo the events that have occurred, you are reduced to the greatest mistake of your life, or the most extreme behavior of your life.\n\nEssentially, Rosenberg had been assigned a prison jacket of \"terrorist\"\u2014that is, the federal prison system had labeled her, for administrative purposes, a terrorist; she compresses that idea into the expression \"terrorist jacket.\"\n\nIf we turn now to the examples from Willis's book, we immediately see that \"terrorist jacket\" as used there is neither a metaphor nor a specimen of bureaucratic jargon. It's simply descriptive: Montoya is wearing a jacket that the author thinks looks like the kind of jacket a terrorist might wear. The absence of any other instance of \"terrorist jacket\" in the Google Books database strongly suggests that this term is strictly Willis's invention, and that you could go to an Abercrombie \\& Fitch or Burberry or FCUK store anywhere and not find a rack of outer garments for sale beneath a placard with the alluring name \"terrorist jackets.\""}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Connie Willis' novel \"Doomsday Book,\" the term \"terrorist jacket\" is used to describe a piece of clothing worn by a character.

In Willis' novel, however, it's used to describe an actual piece of clothing worn by a character.

In cell A2 for example, add `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"rootProperty\";A1)+2;10)` (remember to change the separator characters (semicolons in my case) to match your locale in LibreOffice)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `MID()` will take a partial text from the full response\n* `SEARCH()` will look for the beginning index of the given text, eg. \"rootProperty\"\n* `+2` is the offset where to start reading the value (basically substring)\n* `10` is how many characters to read from the beginning of the text `SEARCH()` found (after the `+2` offset)\n\nSo if for example you get the following response in cell A1:\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": 12345678,\n  \"something\": \"Example\",\n  \"myThing\": \"Hello\",\n  \"another\": \"Not needed\"\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd your cell A2 has the formula: `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"myThing\";A1);13)`\n\nWhat the cell would have as value is: `myThing\": \"He`\nWhich is `13` characters starting from the first character in `myThing`, that you searched for in `SEARCH()`.\n\nSo obviously you wouldn't want to have the `myThing\": \"` part of it. To only get the value `Hello` from `myThing`, you would use this formula: `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"myThing\";A1)+11;5)`.\n\nThis will:\n\n1. Find where `myThing` begins (caveat: if there's two instances of the string, you'll get the first one)\n2. Return 5 characters from the offset. So: `myThi`\n3. Then offsets the beginning to be from index `11` (the `+11` in the formula)\n4. So it skips the first 11 characters (`myThing\": \"`) and returns 5 characters from there on, which is `Hello`\n\nOf course, it's still fairly manual, but at least one workable way for simple things.

For the Memory Address Register (MAR): It can be up to 64 bits, but not necessarily exactly 64 bits. This is because the MAR size depends on the number of memory locations, not directly on the addressability. The 64-bit addressability sets the maximum possible size for the MAR, allowing for up to 2^64 memory locations, but the actual implementation might use fewer bits if not all possible memory locations are utilized.\n\n2. For the Memory Data Register (MDR): It must be exactly 64 bits. The MDR needs to hold the data being transferred to or from a memory location, and since each memory location is 64 bits (as indicated by the 64-bit addressability), the MDR must match this size to accommodate the full data width.\n\nOption B correctly captures both of these aspects: the MAR's potential maximum size and the MDR's exact required size.

If the sentence was:\nHe was loved.\nIn that sentence would loved still be a past participle or would it be simple past?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It may help to straighten out some terminology. *Loved* is always a past participle. That's because the past participle of a regular verb adds the suffix *\\-ed* to the regular form (i.e., the form used in the infinitive), with the proviso that the suffix replaces a final *e*. This means that past participles are always verb forms.\n\nPast participles have a role in the predicate of indicating tense and voice:\n\n* With the auxiliary *have* for the present perfect tense (\"I *have* always **loved** you.\")\n* With the auxiliary *had* for the past perfect tense (\"I *had* **loved** you before I hated you.\")\n* With the auxiliary forms of *be* for the passive voice. (\"You *are* **loved** by me.\")\n\nPast participles have roles outside the predicate. They can modify nouns. Consider Evelyn Waugh's novel *The **Loved** One*.\n\nThey can head noun phrases. We don't use *loved* this way, relying on the now\\-defective verb *belove*, which appears only in the passive: \"My **beloved** is like a gazelle....\"\n\nAnd they can appear in absolutes, associated with main clauses: \"**Loved** by all, the general bowed to the cheering crowd.\"\n\nWith these uses comes a syntactic ambiguity. When the past participle (e.g, *loved*) follows the third person singular, present tense of *to be* (i.e, *is*), are we to interpret *is* as 1\\) an auxiliary forming the passive voice or 2\\) a copular verb followed by a nominative predicate? To rephrase, does\n\n> He is loved\n\nmean that he is 1\\) an object of love or 2\\) a recipient of loving? That's a matter of semantics. We can only tell for sure if an agent is identified in a prepositional phrase with *by*:\n\n> He is loved only by his mother.\n\nThat's case 1\\), the passive voice, because we can transpose to active voice:\n\n> Only his mother loves him."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the word \"loved\" in the sentence \"He is loved\" is most accurate?\n\nA) \"Loved\" is always a simple past tense verb in this context.\nB) \"Loved\" is functioning as an adjective and is no longer a verb.\nC) \"Loved\" is a past participle that can be interpreted as part of a passive voice construction or as a predicate adjective.\nD) \"Loved\" is exclusively a passive voice verb form and cannot have any other interpretation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because \"loved\" is not a simple past tense verb in this context.

This class of tests is meant to shake out problems associated with \"Infant Mortality\" \\- the types of problems that can be said to occur \"spontaneously\". These are tests you run on all your products before they ship.\n\nIf this sort of thing is happening with a high incidence (say higher than 1% of the time) you more than likely have an actual design flaw on your hands. The most common type of design flaw that results in this type of problem, with passive components, inadequate component derating for environmental / safety margins. Another, less common, possibility for passives failing \"spontaneously\" is ESD susceptibility."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small electronics manufacturer is experiencing a 2% failure rate of resistors in their products within the first month of customer use.

Specifically, for passive components like resistors, the most common design flaw is \"inadequate component derating for environmental / safety margins.\" \n\nTo address this, the manufacturer should implement Environmental Stress Screening (ESS) tests. These tests are designed to identify problems associated with \"Infant Mortality\" - early failures that appear to occur spontaneously. ESS can help simulate rigorous use conditions and identify potential failures before products are shipped to customers.\n\nWhile ESD susceptibility is mentioned as a possibility, it's described as less common for passive components.

I think that table is primarily looking at system calls, and the stdin/stdout interface to a console windows or terminal. System calls simply don't exist in Javascript, and there's no stdin/stdout\\-style console window either, so I assume that's why it's not listed (though you can make a case for node.js here).\n\nThe closest thing I know of to failsafe\\-ness in vanilla Javascript is that calling a function that doesn't exist or accessing a resource that hasn't been loaded will throw an exception. But everything that is available generally \"just works\" without any error codes or exceptions. Assigning text to innerHTML or using HTML5 canvas methods won't throw if the browser \"fails to render\" the result somehow (at least, if it does, that's not documented/standardized behavior). Also note that Javascript has no (cross\\-browser) filesystem API, which is the one thing I can think of where error codes/exceptions would effectively be mandatory. And, Javascript's closest equivalent to console I/O\\-\\-the console.log() function\\-\\-also isn't standard, meaning you're never supposed to use it in production code anyway.\n\nSo as far as I can tell, the sort of \"I/O\" where \"failsafe\" is a meaningful property to ask about doesn't really exist in Javascript. Simply leaving it out of the table probably was the best way to represent it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In C programming, when designing an API that works with structs, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding function parameters and pointers?\n\nA) Functions should always pass structs by value to ensure data integrity.\nB) Using double pointers (e.g., char**) is the preferred method for all struct manipulations.\nC) The choice between passing a pointer or the struct directly depends on the specific use case and performance considerations.\nD) Pointers should never be used when working with structs to avoid memory management issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The choice between passing a pointer to a struct or the struct itself directly depends on the specific use case and performance considerations. \n\nOption A is incorrect because passing large structs by value can be inefficient and unnecessarily copy data.\n\nOption B is overly prescriptive. While double pointers have uses (like in the getline() function example), they're not always necessary or preferred.\n\nOption C is correct because it acknowledges the nuanced approach needed in C programming.

For example:\n\n> Kate **has** a relationship with the guy.\n> \n> \n> Kate **is having** a ralationship with the guy.\n\nI thought that the use of *have* in the present continuous in this context is totally incorrect, but the teacher in this [video](https://youtu.be/YJZBcL-9gsA) uses it in the progressive. It is at 4 minutes and 3 seconds. Is that some kind of new American grammar?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whoever told you that *have* isn't used in the present continuous was wrong \\- or more likely, what you were told was incomplete.\n\nWhen we use *have* to mean *possess*, we don't use it in the present continuous. But in other uses, the present continuous is possible and even common:\n\nI am having (eating) lunch  \n\nI am having a good time  \n\nI am not having any luck with this  \n\nI am having second thoughts about this  \n\nI am having a baby  \n\nI am having people over for dinner  \n\n...\n\nWhen we say *I am having a relationship*, the word *have* does not mean *possess*; rather, the phrase means *I am in a relationship*.\n\nThis particular phrase is more complicated than some of the examples listed above, because you *can* possess a relationship \\- or something close. If I say, \"I have a relationship with my father,\" this is (more or less) the *possession* meaning of *have*. So I cannot say, \"I am having a relationship with my father.\" Or rather, I can, but it would sound strange, because it would imply that I am in a romantic relationship with my father.\n\nThis is just another of those annoying things about English. *Relationship* has multiple meanings \\- one being romantic, one being platonic or familial. Typically, we use a different verb for those two meanings: *be* in a relationship is romantic; *have* a relationship is not. \n\nAnd, if that weren't already confusing enough, *having* a relationship means *being in a romantic relationship*.\n\nSorry!"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the use of \"have\" in relation to relationships is most accurate?\n\nA) \"Have\" can never be used in the present continuous when talking about relationships.\n\nB) \"I am having a relationship\" always implies a romantic connection, while \"I have a relationship\" is always platonic.\n\nC) The phrase \"I am having a relationship\" is grammatically incorrect in all contexts.\n\nD) The use of \"have\" in the present continuous for relationships depends on the specific meaning and context intended.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because the use of \"have\" in the present continuous when talking about relationships is nuanced and context-dependent. While \"have\" in the sense of possession typically isn't used in the present continuous, it can be used this way in other contexts, including some relationship scenarios.\n\n\"I am having a relationship\" generally implies a romantic connection and is grammatically correct, contrary to options A and C. However, \"I have a relationship\" can be either romantic or platonic, depending on context, which makes option B incorrect.\n\nThe phrase \"I am having a relationship\" uses \"have\" not in the sense of possession, but more in the sense of \"being in\" a relationship. This usage is similar to other non-possessive uses of \"have\" in the present continuous, such as \"I am having lunch\" or \"I am having a good time.\"\n\nThe complexity arises from the multiple meanings of \"relationship\" and how they interact with different forms of \"have.\" This makes D the most accurate answer, as it acknowledges the importance of context and specific meaning in determining the correct usage."}, "41": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/08/13", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/78129", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/22523/"], "docs_id": 78129, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> **Possible Duplicate:**  \n> \n> [Difference between \u201ceach\u201d and \u201cevery\u201d](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/6656/difference-between-each-and-every)\n\nI'm not sure if I should use *for each* or *for every* in the quoted sentence.  \n\nOn one hand it sounds better to use *for each*, on the other hand, I think when talking about how often something happens we must use *for every*. \n\n> 1 .

The uniform density of locally Lipschitz functions for continuous functions f: M \u2192 \u211d on a metric space M is a consequence of two key facts:\n\n1. Stone's theorem, which states that all metric spaces are paracompact.\n2.

It has a language of it's own that a domain expert would feel comfortable reading and expressing even if they aren't a programmer.\n\nthose contrast with \n\n* **Anemic domains** concentrate on manipulating state. They actually are rich domains in a bizarre way. But the business rules are all about updating the DB and the the domain language is SQL. That's wonderful if your domain expert is a DBA.\n\nbut neither of those are the same as either of these:\n\n* **Behavior objects** are methods that are clustered around either some state that makes them change together or simply the fact that they need to be moved around together. Some have no state at all and that's just fine. A nice handy bag of functions. What they had always better be clustered around is that they are used together. That they abstract an idea together. They should cluster around a single responsibility. Some behavior objects cluster around business rules. Not all.\n\nthose contrast with\n\n* **Value objects** (like ints, strings, stacks, queues, lists, and pretty much anything with getters) are bags of data that generally do not care about their values. They provide methods that expose their data or measure it in some way but they carefully avoid making behavior decisions based on their data.\n\nWhere you've gone wrong is you've somehow got the idea that a rich domain can't have value objects and that an anemic one can't have behavior objects.

Sure, using nothing but value objects makes it hard to have business rules (heck it makes it hard to do anything) but lovers of anemic domains certainly don't need to swear off behavior objects to keep their domain anemic. \n\n> Is there a pattern name for domain models that contain behaviour and little or no state?\n\nFunctional programming?

Rich domains are indeed characterized by being full of business rules and having their own domain-specific language.

They aren't even improved from in the previous games, where through them out was completely free.\n\nGuard Impacts were a big part of my game, and now I am having trouble figuring out how to initiate an attack against an aggressive opponent. **Are there any generic strategy changes that would help me, being an old player of the Soul Calibur franchise, adapt to this new system?** Are there any new tricks that were added to the game to compensate for the decreased utility of Guard Impacts?\n\n**Edit**: After playing a bit more, I have noticed I seem to be blocking too much. My health bar is often flickering yellow or red, and it's because I don't know exactly how to deal with an aggressive offense without Guard Impacts.\n\n**Edit 2**: All the answers so far are focusing on how to use the new Guard Impact. While this is good information, it's not what I'm primarily asking for in the question. I want to know what my *other* options are that don't require any soul meter to employ, with a specific emphasis on strategy.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Maxx already gave a good answer for when to use Guard Impact so I'll focus on how to play without it.\n\nThis is coming from someone who played semi\\-seriously for months before starting to incorporate GI in SC4\\.\n\nThe first thing to know is **your character's fastest moves**. It's often just a straight horizontal hit. After that it's a matter of knowing your opponent's attacks and knowing when there's going to be an opening. There's always going to be some time interval either in between or at the end of a combo where you can get in a quick swing,by which I mean you can safely do attack, not necessarily that it will land unblocked. Even if your counter attack is blocked, at least now you're on the offensive.\n\nI've only played SC5 once so far, but it seems like Just Guard gives you a slight edge where you might be able to get in a quick attack before the opponent has a chance to block in some cases, but it comes down to **knowing your opponent's moves and how to react to them**.\n\nAlso some moves have a higher tendency to supersede the opponent's attack than others. I know in general a vertical hit usually cancels out a horizontal hit. Some moves are also faster than the initially appear. I know personally I've found moves that I previously disregarded as not useful turned out to quite useful as they are faster than their animation would make it appear. I think it's an issue of our mind typically watching the time between the start and end of a swing, rather than the time between the start and the time of impact, which may happen well before the end of a swing.\n\nFinally there's a rule of any pretty much any competitive game that has a meta\\-game component: **Set up expectations, then break them.** Repeat a pattern until the opponent figures it out, then break the pattern with something that counters what the opponent's going to do to counter you. For example, lots of characters usually have variations on combos, so there's mid\\-mid\\-low, repeat that a couple times, then occasionally throw in mid\\-mid\\-mid. They'll go to block the low and get slammed with the mid at the end (bonus points if it's a ring out!). It's like in Starcraft, making your opponent over\\-commit to anti\\-air, then coming in with a big ground army instead."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Soul Calibur 5, with the changes to Guard Impact mechanics, what is an effective strategy for an experienced player to adapt their gameplay when facing an aggressive opponent?\n\nA) Rely solely on Guard Impacts by constantly maintaining a full soul meter\nB) Focus on blocking more frequently to withstand aggressive attacks\nC) Learn and utilize the fastest moves for your character to counter attack during openings\nD) Exclusively use Just Guard to gain a slight edge in combat\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct strategy is to learn and utilize your character's fastest moves to counter attack during openings. The documentation emphasizes knowing your character's quickest attacks and understanding your opponent's move patterns to identify opportunities to strike back. This approach doesn't rely on the soul meter (unlike Guard Impacts) and avoids excessive blocking, which can lead to a flickering health bar. The answer also aligns with the strategy of setting up expectations and then breaking them to outsmart opponents.

What kind of cam product and/or network trick can I use to securely access a webcam from outside ?\n\n**Edit**: clarification. Unfortunately, I don't have any public IP address granted by my setup at home, so I cannot set up any port forwarding. From outside, I cannot access any machine that is connected to my ADSL router, simply because there's no internet IP to connect to.
