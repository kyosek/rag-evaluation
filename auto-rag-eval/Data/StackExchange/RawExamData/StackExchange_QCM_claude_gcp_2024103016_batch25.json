I am also familiar with, but still learning about, feature selection/extraction and construction. However, **I am wondering if there is a term or keyword for the way in which you deicde to encode your problem for an algorithm, and how someone can improve their ability to present this problem to an algorithm.** I believe this to be related to, but **distinct from feature selection and construction**. I am looking for a general answer, and a topic/keyword to continue learning afterwards, but I have provided a few examples below to illustrate where I have found difficulties:\n\nFor example, a common problem is how to solve a maze in under 100 steps by representing each step (forward, left, right, backwards) using binary values 00, 01, 10, 11\\. When presenting this to a genetic algorithm you would then use two bits for every step for 200 total bits. But I'm not sure I could easily present this same problem to a neural network.\n\nFor a neural network, days of the year could be represented by using 365 individual nodes, of which only one would be activated and the rest would have a value of 0\\. When combined with other features, perhaps one or two, they seem to be dwarfed by the number of other dimensions created using 365 input nodes to represent a year. We could reduce the dimensions by using th 52 weeks of the year, but at the cost of losing information about individual days of the week. Surely, there must be a better way to think of this problem.\n\n**\\*Also if there are other methods than binary encodings, please indulge.**\n\nADDEDUM:\n\nTruth be told, what I am asking is so basic it seems to be glossed over as trivial in many machine learning tutorials. They may give an example, such as the maze above, and quickly explain how to encode this to the algorithm at hand, but I have seen very little material which focuses solely on the many different ways a problem can be encoded and presented to an algorithm... or else I am not looking in the right places which is why I asked for some keywords. This lack of focus is surprising to me considering how important it is to ask the machine the proper question and in the correct form, which in my opinion, supercedes even the subject of feature selection which would come after the encoding patterns have been figured out; technically, the features are selected first and then they are encoded second. Surely there are more ways than one to think of a given problem.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I can tell from the comments on the original post, analyzing a 2 x 2 contingency table doesn't make sense for these data.

Perhaps it is the missing direct object that a respondent mentioned, but the present participle is the first thing that comes to my mind: \"allows stealing\", \"allows finding\", \"allows erecting\", and \"allows measuring\".\n\nThere is also \"requires to\" and \"helps to\".\n\n**Update 2:** Here are some specific examples \\- taken from the web pages linked above.

As explained in the passage, some languages (such as Spanish) use infinitives in constructions that are parallel to English sentences requiring gerunds.

While English grammar can be complex, the rules regarding infinitives and gerunds after specific verbs are generally consistent.\n\nThis question tests understanding of cross-linguistic influence on grammar errors and requires the ability to identify the most relevant explanation from the given information."}, "8": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/06/05", "source": ["https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2311116", "https://math.stackexchange.com", "https://math.stackexchange.com/users/220642/"], "docs_id": 2311116, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been trying without succes to proove the cut property using the least upper bound property of the real numbers.

(If every element of $X$ is $\\<$ every element of $Y$, then clearly every element of $X$ is $\\\\le$ every element of $Y$.)\n\nTo show the other direction, suppose the first version holds, and $X, Y$ are sets of real numbers such that every element of $X$ is $\\\\le$ every element of $Y$. There are two cases.\n\n* If there is no $a\\\\in X\\\\cap Y$, then every element of $X$ is in fact $\\<$ every element of $Y$; so the existence of the desired $c$ follows immediately from the first version of the cut principle.\n* If there is some $a\\\\in X\\\\cap Y$, let $c\\=a$; I claim this $c$ has the desired properties. Let $x\\\\in X$; then if $x\\>c$, since $c\\\\in Y$ we would have a contradiction with the assumption \"each element of $X$ is $\\\\le$ each element of $Y$.\" So in fact $c\\\\ge x$ for all $x\\\\in X$. Similarly, we can show that $c\\\\le y$ for all $y\\\\in Y$.\n\nSo if every element of $X$ is $\\\\le$ every element of $Y$, then \\- in either of the two cases \\- there is some $c$ which is $\\\\ge$ every element of $X$ and $\\\\le$ every element of $Y$.\n\nSo the two versions of the cut principle are in fact equivalent."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Consider the following statements about the cut property in real numbers:\n\nI.

I would like to know what makes VB.NET bad at programming embedded systems (if it is bad), and what kind of criteria there is for a language to be good at programming embedded systems.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I was waiting for you to give an example of an \"event driven language\" to see whether I understand what you're asking. But I decided that you probably have some misconceptions. This first sentence of your question makes sense, \"I'm meant to evaluate the suitability of event driven programming in non graphical applications.\" But then everything you wrote after \"All I know...\" is confusing and probably wrong.\n\nEvent driven programming is a design style. I don't know what you mean by event driven language and I'm skeptical whether that's a thing.\n\nEvent driven programming is very suitable for embedded systems because many embedded systems are event driven by nature. An event can be a button push, sensor detection, received network packet, timer expiration, etc. Think of an elevator, printer, or wireless router.\n\nMiro Samek explains this well in the first couple pages of the Introduction chapter of [Practical UML Statecharts in C/C\\+\\+](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0750687061), which is subtitled \"Event\\-Driven Programming for Embedded Systems\". (You can read the Introduction from the Amazon listing if you click on the \"Look Inside\" link.)\n\nEvent driven programming is commonly used for GUI applications because it's very easy to do so with tools such as Microsoft Visual Studio. Every beginning desktop application developer starts with event driven programming and has access to a multitude of examples.\n\nConversely, a beginning embedded systems developer typically writes a main super\\-loop to blink an LED. Embedded development tools don't provide the event driven framework like Visual Studio does. And examples of event driven programs are uncommon. That might explain why event driven programming is less common in embedded systems. But it would be wrong to say that event driven programming is not suitable for embedded systems.\n\nEdit: You've changed the question. I don't understand why you originally wrote \"event driven\" when you were asking about VB.NET.\n\nVB.NET is not suitable for typical embedded systems but I don't believe any of the reasons are related to the concept of \"event driven\". Here are a few ideas you can research further. Programs written in .NET languages run on computers where the .NET framework (CLR and FCL) has been installed. The .NET framework does not exist for smallish microcontrollers used for many embedded systems. Embedded systems often have limited resources in terms of memory and CPU power. The .NET framework and .NET programs are too resource hungry for these resource limited systems. Embedded systems often have real\\-time requirements. .NET features such as garbage collection make it non\\-deterministic or difficult to ensure that timeliness deadlines can always be met."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding event-driven programming in embedded systems?\n\nA) Event-driven programming is unsuitable for embedded systems due to its heavy resource requirements and slow execution speed.\n\nB) Event-driven programming is primarily used for GUI applications and has limited use in embedded systems.\n\nC) Event-driven programming is well-suited for many embedded systems due to their inherently event-driven nature.\n\nD) Event-driven programming requires specialized languages that are incompatible with most embedded system architectures.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Event-driven programming is actually well-suited for many embedded systems because they are often event-driven by nature. Events in embedded systems can include button presses, sensor detections, received network packets, or timer expirations. This programming paradigm aligns well with the operational characteristics of devices like elevators, printers, or wireless routers.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it mischaracterizes event-driven programming as inherently resource-heavy or slow, which is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while event-driven programming is common in GUI applications, it is not limited to them and can be very applicable to embedded systems.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because event-driven programming is a design style, not tied to specific languages.

Does it mean then this OS cannot be configured by sudoers forever? Is there any method to set new administrator?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What Would Happen\n=================\n\nIf you configure your system so that no users are administrators, then no one will be able to perform administrative tasks as `root` with [`sudo`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/sudo.8.html) (or its graphical frontends, such as [`gksu`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/gksu.1.html), [`gksudo`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/gksudo.1.html), and [`kdesudo`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/kdesudo.1.html)) or [PolicyKit](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/polkit.8.html). Assuming the `root` account remains disabled, you will not be able to log in as `root` (even from a virtual console) or [`su`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/su.1.html)\\-to\\-`root` either. Barring possible security vulnerabilities, **this would prevent anyone from performing administrative tasks in the running system.**\n\nFixing the Problem\n==================\n\nHowever, if you did this, **the problem would still be easily fixed**, assuming you have physical access to the machine. Fixing this problem is similar to resetting a forgotten password, except you add the user to the `sudo` and/or `admin` groups with [`usermod`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/usermod.8.html), rather than resetting their password with [`passwd`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man5/passwd.5.html).\n\nHere's one method:\n\n1. Boot into recovery mode by holding `Shift` while booting and selecting it. Select the option for a `root` shell. You'll get a shell with a `#` prompt (rather than the usual `$`). This means it's a `root` shell. Any command you run here is run as `root`.\n2. *If you know your username, skip this step.* To find out your username, run `ls /home`. This is a pretty reliable way to list the usernames of the human users of your system (while omitting user accounts like `www-data` and `nobody` which are used internally but don't represent real people).\n3. Run these commands to add **`username`** to the necessary group(s) to be an administrator. (Replace **`username`** with the actual username.)\n\n```\nusermod -a -G sudo username\nusermod -a -G admin username\n```\n\nThis separately attempts to add the user to the `sudo` and `admin` groups. In Ubuntu releases up to Ubuntu 11\\.10, administrators were in the `admin` group. In Ubuntu 12\\.04 (and in future releases), administrators are in the `sudo` group; if a 12\\.04 system was upgraded from a previous release, both groups will exist.\n\nSo you can put the user in just one, if you know which one, or you can just run those two commands and put them in whichever exists. I advise doing this with two commands so that if one group doesn't exist, the error doesn't stop `usermod` from attempting to add the user to the other group.\n\nRecovery mode is usually accessible. But occasionally it may be broken, disabled, or require a password, in which case you can boot from a live CD, `chroot` into the installed system, and run the `usermod` commands. Here's a procedure for doing that, adapted from [my considerably more general answer here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/121698/how-do-i-reset-a-lost-password-using-recovery-mode-requires-me-to-type-the-pass/147023#147023):\n\n1. If you don't already have one, burn an Ubuntu live CD/DVD (on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/burn-a-cd-on-ubuntu), [Windows](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/burn-a-cd-on-windows), or [Mac OS X](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/burn-a-cd-on-mac-osx)) or write an Ubuntu live USB flash drive (on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu), [Windows](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows), or [Mac OS X](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx)).\n2. In your Ubuntu system (not the live CD/DVD/USB system), run the following command in the Terminal (`Ctrl`\\+`Alt`\\+`T`). *You do not need to be an administrator to do this.*\n\n```\nmount | grep ' on / '\n\n```\n\nYou should include the spaces before `on` and after `/`.\n3. That command produces something like `/dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro,commit=0)` as the output. The text before `on` (not including the space) is the device name of the partition that contains your Ubuntu system's root filesystem. Remember it (or write it down).\n4. Boot the computer from the live CD/DVD/USB and select `Try Ubuntu without installing` (not `Install Ubuntu`).\n5. Run these commands, replacing **`/dev/sda1`** with the device name of the partition containing your Ubuntu system's root filesystem, if different (and **`username`** with the name of the user account you wish to give administrative abilities).\n\n```\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo chroot /mnt\nusermod -a -G sudo username\nusermod -a -G admin username\nexit\nsudo umount /mnt\n```\n\nAs with the other method, you can use `ls /home` (run this *after* the `chroot` command) to see a list of users on the machine, if you don't know the username.\n\nAlternatives to Eliminating Administrators\n==========================================\n\nOn Ubuntu, when you're an administrator, you still need to authenticate with `sudo` or PolicyKit to perform actions as `root`. This is considered to be at least as secure as using `su` to perform actions as root, since anyone who can compromise your account in such a way to read your own password (for `sudo`) can also read `root`'s password (for `su`). Furthermore, there are some substantial advantages ([explained here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo)) of `sudo` over `su`, and enabling the `root` account, while quite possible, is neither recommended nor officially supported in Ubuntu.\n\nIf you decide that even though `sudo` and PolicyKit require your password to perform actions as `root`, you still want yourself and all other human users on your machine to run as a standard user (and not as an administrator who can run commands as `root`), you have two easy options:\n\n1. You can **enable the `root` account**, but this is discouraged as explained above. Also, by default you will not be able to log in to a *graphical session* as `root`, and you *should not configure your system to allow this*, as it's particularly dangerous to run an entire graphical desktop environment as `root` (a security bug in any part of it could compromise your system). Also, most GUI programs are not tested as `root` so there may be substantial usability bugs. If you do enable `root`, you should only ever log on as root from a virtual console (or use `su`).\n2. The better option is to **just create another user account for administrative purposes.** Make this account an administrator. Having a non\\-`root` account that can perform administrative tasks with `sudo` and PolicyKit does not force you to use that account for day\\-to\\-day, non\\-administrative tasks.\n\nHowever, most users are best off with the default\\-\\-where at least one user account is an administrator and can perform administrative tasks, but must (re)enter their password to do so."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator accidentally removed all users from the sudo and admin groups on an Ubuntu system without setting a root password.

Logging in graphically as root is strongly discouraged due to security risks and potential usability issues with GUI programs not tested as root.\n\nOption B is the correct and recommended approach. Booting into recovery mode provides access to a root shell, allowing the use of usermod to add a user back to the sudo and/or admin groups, restoring administrative capabilities without compromising security.\n\nOption C is not recommended.

This introduces a time-dependent component to the electromagnetic field, even though the original laser source is continuous. The rapid opening and closing of the shutter (in 100 \u03bcs) creates a finite pulse duration, which, according to the time-frequency uncertainty principle, leads to a spread in frequencies.

This $\\\\theta$ could be population mean for example. Usually you can't get all the data from the population. So you draw a sample $X$ of size $N$ from the population. Let's assume you have i.i.d. sample for simplicity. Then you obtain your estimator $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}\\=g(X)$. You want to use $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$ to make inferences about $\\\\theta$, so you would like to know the variability of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$. \n\nFirst, there is a *true* sampling distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$. Conceptually, you could draw many samples (each of them has size $N$) from the population. Each time you will have a realization of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}\\=g(X)$ since each time you will have a different sample. Then in the end, you will be able to recover the *true* distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$. Ok, this at least is the conceptual benchmark for estimation of the distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$. Let me restate it: the ultimate goal is to use various method to estimate or approximate the *true* distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$.\n\nNow, here comes the question. Usually, you only have one sample $X$ that contains $N$ data points. Then you resample from this sample many times, and you will come up with a bootstrap distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$. My question is: how close is this bootstrap distribution to the *true* sampling distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}$? Is there a way to quantify it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Bootstrap is based on the convergence of the empirical cdf to the true cdf, that is,\n$$\\\\hat{F}\\_n(x) \\= \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum\\_{i\\=1}^n\\\\mathbb{I}\\_{X\\_i\\\\le x}\\\\qquad X\\_i\\\\stackrel{\\\\text{iid}}{\\\\sim}F(x)$$ converges ***(as $n$ goes to infinity)*** to $F(x)$ for every $x$. Hence convergence of the bootstrap distribution of $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}(X\\_1,\\\\ldots,X\\_n)\\=g(\\\\hat{F}\\_n)$ is driven by this convergence which occurs at a rate $\\\\sqrt{n}$ for *each* $x$, since $$\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\{\\\\hat{F}\\_n(x)\\-F(x)\\\\}\\\\stackrel{\\\\text{dist}}{\\\\longrightarrow}\\\\mathsf{N}(0,F(x)\\[1\\-F(x)])$$ even though this rate and limiting distribution does not automatically transfer to $g(\\\\hat{F}\\_n)$. In practice, to assess the variability of the approximation, you can produce a bootstrap evaluation of the distribution of $g(\\\\hat{F}\\_n)$ by double\\-bootstrap, i.e., by bootstrapping bootstrap evaluations.\n\n***As an update,*** here is an illustration I use in class:\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/D0V4Y.jpg)\nwhere the lhs compares the true cdf $F$ with the empirical cdf $\\\\hat{F}\\_n$ for $n\\=100$ observations and the rhs plots $250$ replicas of the lhs, for 250 different samples, in order to measure the variability of the cdf approximation. In the example I know the truth and hence I can simulate from the truth to evaluate the variability. In a realistic situation, I do not know $F$ and hence I have to start from $\\\\hat{F}\\_n$ instead to produce a similar graph.\n\n***Further update:*** Here is what the tube picture looks like when starting from the empirical cdf:\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5GOyN.jpg)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In bootstrap sampling, how does the bootstrap distribution of an estimator \u03b8\u0302 relate to its true sampling distribution as the sample size n increases?\n\nA) The bootstrap distribution always exactly matches the true sampling distribution, regardless of sample size.\n\nB) The bootstrap distribution converges to the true sampling distribution at a rate of n, where n is the sample size.\n\nC) The bootstrap distribution converges to the true sampling distribution at a rate of \u221an for each point x in the cumulative distribution function, but this rate may not automatically transfer to the estimator \u03b8\u0302.\n\nD) The bootstrap distribution and true sampling distribution are unrelated, no matter how large the sample size becomes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The bootstrap method relies on the convergence of the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) to the true CDF. This convergence occurs at a rate of \u221an for each point x in the CDF, as stated in the documentation: \"\u221an{F\u0302n(x)-F(x)} converges in distribution to N(0,F(x)[1-F(x)])\". However, it's important to note that this convergence rate doesn't automatically transfer to the estimator \u03b8\u0302=g(F\u0302n). The relationship between the bootstrap distribution and the true sampling distribution of \u03b8\u0302 becomes closer as n increases, but the exact rate of convergence for \u03b8\u0302 may differ from \u221an depending on the specific function g.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the bootstrap distribution doesn't always exactly match the true sampling distribution, especially for smaller sample sizes. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the convergence rate is \u221an, not n, for the CDF at each point x.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the bootstrap distribution and true sampling distribution are indeed related, with the former converging to the latter as sample size increases."}, "17": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/02/08", "source": ["https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/272219", "https://apple.stackexchange.com", "https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/76602/"], "docs_id": 272219, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A couple of years ago, I downloaded the movie Sita Sings the Blues, put it on iTunes on my Mac and on my iPad.

If we truly want to reduce incidence of infection, we offer the best treatment we have, to everyone we have the resources to treat. \n\nTo put it another way, I think it would be illogical to use two cutpoints to create three risk groups (high, medium, and low); to give the high group the most reliable treatment; and to give the medium group some alternative treatment.

However, you are now combining some impossible things.\n\nLandsat images are projected in a rectangular grid, so around the globe they have different projections. Therefore, the masking of pixels is only possible correctly on an relatively small area on the globe where the projection is similar.\nBesides, you are making a composite median image. Making a composite will get rid of masked pixels, because only unmasked pixels are taken into the composite image.\nFurthermore, a composite image will blend pixels in the collection together, and therefore a composite image does not have a region specific projection, which explains why in your second image the masked pixels are not well aligned.\n\nI will give you two options to perform this operation;\n\n**Option 1:** Randomly mask pixels on a per image basis, and do not make the composite \n\nNote that this solution work perfectly for every image you will show on the screen, and is the desired solution if you have a location of interest which falls completely inside a Landsat image tier.\n\n```js\n// Function to randomly mask pixels in an image on a per-image basis\nfunction randomMask(image) {\n  // add random mask on a per image basis with reprojection\n  var random = ee.Image.random().select('random').gt(0.2);\n  var randReprojected = random.reproject({crs: image.projection(), scale: 30});\n\n  // Return the randomly masked image\n  return image.updateMask(randReprojected);\n}\n\n// Map the function over the image collection and add a random mask per-image\nvar colRandMasked = collection.map(randomMask);\n\n// Show the result of one image and center the zoom on that image\nMap.addLayer(colRandMasked.first(), {bands: ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'], min: 0, max: 0.3}, 'Masked per-image');\nMap.centerObject(colRandMasked.first().geometry())\n\n```\n\n**Option 2:** Make a composite and randomly mask pixels correctly for a specified region of interest on earth\n\nNote that this solutions makes an image composite for the whole world, as in you example script. However, the mask aligns correctly in the region of interest, but will mismatch pixels more the further you will go away from this ROI.\n\n```js\n// set a location of interest\nvar ROI = ee.Geometry.Point([-90.43283, 20.76684]);\n// Get the projection of the location of interest from a random Landsat image at that location\nvar proj = collection.filterBounds(ROI).first().projection();\n\n// make a median composite image from the cloudmask images\nvar composite = collection.median();\n\n// randomly mask the composite on the projection of the location of interest\nvar random = ee.Image.random().select('random').gt(0.2);\nvar randReprojected = random.reproject({crs: proj, scale: 30});\n\n// Return the randomly masked image\nvar randMaskedComp = composite.updateMask(randReprojected);\n\n// Show the result of the random masked composite and center on ROI\nMap.addLayer(randMaskedComp, {bands: ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'], min: 0, max: 0.3}, 'Composite masked');\nMap.centerObject(ROI, 13);\n\n```\n\nI hope I have made clear the drawbacks and impossibilities of your desired operation, but still provide a workable solution for you.  \n\nHere is the link to the working full code: [Script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/febcb914a8d2e894d96e862fae20e9a3)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When attempting to randomly mask pixels in a Landsat image collection using Google Earth Engine, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) Random masking can be easily applied to a global composite image without any projection issues.\n\nB) Creating a median composite before random masking ensures perfect pixel alignment across the entire globe.\n\nC) Random masking should be applied on a per-image basis before compositing to maintain projection accuracy.\n\nD) Reprojecting a random mask to match the composite image's projection solves all alignment issues globally.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to apply random masking on a per-image basis before creating any composites.

How the op\\-amp circuit will be?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several undefined elements in your question. The first is the fact that you don't mention the kind of filter. From your \\\\$Q\\\\$ values, it can be worked out that you are talking about a Butterworth filter. But you didn't mention this fact. You should have. Second, you have mentioned nothing about the input signal range. Third, you've said nothing about the rail voltages you plan to have available for the design. Forth, you've said nothing about what you have available for implementation: for example, you may use opamps; but you could also use NPN BJTs for each stage, as well. (The opamp is obviously a better choice than a single BJT. But still this may be important.) Fifth, you've said nothing about what the filter must drive \\-\\- we know nothing about the load. Etc. In short, we really have a lot more that we don't know which is important than what we do know that is important. You should write a lot more about your situation, at hand.\n\nIf you use Sage/sympy, it's not at all difficult to write up a script to generate Butterworth constants:\n\n```\ndef Butterworth(n):\n    r = solve( 1+(-1)**n*x**(2*n), x )\n    t = []\n    for a in r:\n        if real( a ) < 0:\n            t.append( a )\n    t.sort( key = lambda tup: real( tup ) )\n    u = []\n    var( 's' )\n    if ( len( t ) - 2*int( len( t ) / 2 ) ) == 1:\n        u.append( s + 1 )\n        t.pop( 0 )\n    for i in range( len( t ) / 2 ):\n        u.append( expand( (s - t[2*i]) * (s - t[2*i+1]) ).n() )\n    return u\n\n```\n\nI am sure that experts might provide a better implementation. But that one does work okay. For example, writing:\n\n```\nfor a in Butterworth(4): print(a)\n\n```\n\nproduces:\n\n```\ns**2 + 1.84775906502257*s + 1.0\ns**2 + 0.765366864730179*s + 1.0\n\n```\n\nThose constants are each the same as \\\\$2\\\\,\\\\zeta\\\\$ or \\\\$\\\\frac1{Q}\\\\$. So, it follows that:\n\n$$\\\\begin{align\\*}Q\\_1\\&\\=\\\\frac1{1\\.84775906502257}\\&\\&\\=0\\.541196100146198\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Q\\_2\\&\\=\\\\frac1{0\\.765366864730179}\\&\\&\\=1\\.30656296487638\\\\end{align\\*}$$\n\nWhich is how I recognized your filter type.\n\nThe Sallen\\-Key topology is the next aspect of your question. Since Sallen \\& Key were focused on replacing inductors with capacitors in their paper, it's no surprise that the general form is:\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OVyPr.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fOVyPr.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nClearly, in the above, it is possible to set \\\\$R\\_3\\=0\\\\:\\\\Omega\\\\$ to get a voltage follower where \\\\$K\\=1\\\\$. However, the general transfer function is:\n\n$$\\\\frac{V\\_{\\_\\\\text{OUT}}}{V\\_{\\_\\\\text{IN}}}\\=\\\\frac{K\\\\,\\\\omega\\_{0}^2}{s^2\\+\\\\left(\\\\frac1{R\\_1\\\\,C\\_2}\\+\\\\frac1{R\\_2\\\\,C\\_2}\\+\\\\frac1{R\\_2\\\\,C\\_1}\\-\\\\frac{K}{R\\_2\\\\,C\\_1}\\\\right)s\\+1}$$\n\nHere, \\\\$K\\=1\\+\\\\frac{R\\_3}{R\\_4}\\\\$ and \\\\$\\\\omega\\_{\\_0}^2\\=\\\\frac1{R\\_1\\\\,R\\_2\\\\,C\\_1\\\\,C\\_2}\\\\$.\n\nYou've specified the corner frequency at \\\\$33\\\\:\\\\text{kHz}\\\\$ and the capacitor values all at \\\\$1\\\\:\\\\text{nF}\\\\$, I think. (But I'm not entirely sure, on that last point.) You only want the resistor values. The overall gain is to be \\\\$0\\\\:\\\\text{dB}\\\\$, but the gain of each Sallen\\-Key stage (if you use equal valued \\\\$R\\\\$ and \\\\$C\\\\$ in its design) is then determined by its damping factor. It looks right now as though you expect all capacitor values to be the same. So I'm going to make the same assumption for the values of \\\\$R\\\\$ in order to keep this simple and to avoid waiting for answers from you that may not be forth\\-coming.\n\nTaking the above assumptions, that all \\\\$C\\\\$ values are the same and that all \\\\$R\\\\$ values are the same, then the new transfer function is:\n\n$$\\\\frac{V\\_{\\_\\\\text{OUT}}}{V\\_{\\_\\\\text{IN}}}\\=\\\\frac{K\\\\,\\\\omega\\_{\\_0}^2}{s^2\\+\\\\left(3\\-K\\\\right)\\\\omega\\_{\\_0} s\\+1}$$\n\nHere, \\\\$3\\-K\\=2\\\\,\\\\zeta\\\\$, so it follows that \\\\$K\\=3\\-2\\\\,\\\\zeta\\\\$. From this, the damping factors determined by the Butterworth polynomials then also can be understood to determine the overall gain of each Sallen\\-Key 2nd order stages:\n\n$$\\\\begin{align\\*}A\\_{V\\_1}\\&\\=3\\-1\\.84775906502257\\&\\&\\=1\\.15224093497743\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\A\\_{V\\_2}\\&\\=3\\-0\\.765366864730179\\&\\&\\=2\\.23463313526982\\\\end{align\\*}$$\n\nThis results in an overall gain of \\\\$A\\_v\\=2\\.57483577311484\\\\$ for both stages. Since that isn't desired, you'll need to further reduce this with a prior input stage, a stage between the two, or a 3rd stage. How you handle this is up to you and your understanding of the circumstances. So the arrangement of each stage (their ordering) is left to you to work out.\n\n[This page](https://www.ece.uic.edu/%7Ejmorisak/blpf.html) provides an excellent overview and provides you with the tools you need to convert from the analytical \\\\$\\\\omega\\_{\\_0}\\=1\\\\$ form to specific resistor and capacitor values that relate to a given \\\\$\\\\omega\\_{\\_0}\\\\$ value other than 1\\. Please follow their instructions to reach your desired resistor values. (That web site also provides you with the justification for the Butterworth design approach \\-\\- so it includes a lot for you to study and learn about.)\n\nIt's really not that hard to achieve.\n\nSo here's a shot at it. In contrast to the discussion I had with Andy (see the discussion below his answer here), I'll select the higher\\-**Q** stage (and therefore also higher gain) to be the 1st stage. The reason for this is that you usually want the highest gain as the 1st stage for noise reasons. However, keep in mind that I've no idea what's driving this system and you may want either still more more gain, or less, in the first stage. So you may actually want a \"pre\\-amplifier.\" But since we know nothing, really, let me just choose a path and follow it. Meanwhile, it's important that ***you*** keep in mind that this is just a choice and not necessarily the better choice for any given circumstance.\n\nWith that choice for the 1st stage, I'll follow it by an attenuating stage which only has the single purpose of reducing the signal sufficiently so that the final 2nd Butterworth stage can pick up from there and complete the picture.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EExVy.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fEExVy.png)\n\nThe result looks like this:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bi0XX.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bi0XX.png)\n\nWhich is as would be expected.\n\nAs I said before, it's not all that complicated.\n\nI used standard resistor values from the [E12 series](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/381906/38098)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A 4th order Butterworth low-pass filter with a corner frequency of 33kHz and overall DC gain of 0dB is to be designed using Sallen-Key architecture.

The first stage should have the higher Q value (1.306) to minimize noise, as explained in the solution. The overall gain of both stages without attenuation would be approximately 2.57 (8.2 dB), which is higher than the desired 0dB gain. Therefore, an additional attenuating stage is required between the two filter stages to reduce the overall gain to 0dB. Option A is incorrect because the overall gain is not 0dB without attenuation. Option B is incorrect because it's preferable to have the higher Q (and thus higher gain) in the first stage for noise reasons.

It provides information\n    about, and allows the administration of, the partitioning schemes, layouts, and\n    formats of disks. This includes hard disks, solid state disks, optical discs,\n    CoreStorage volumes, and AppleRAID sets.  It generally manipulates whole vol-\n    umes instead of individual files and directories.\n\n```\n\nOn RAID:\n\n```\nappleRAID | ar raidVerb [...]\n    AppleRAID verbs can be used to create, manipulate and destroy\n    AppleRAID volumes (Software RAID).  AppleRAID supports three basic\n    types of RAID sets:\n\n          o   \"stripe\" - Striped Volume (RAID 0)\n          o   \"mirror\" - Mirrored Volume (RAID 1)\n          o   \"concat\" - Concatenated Volume (Spanning)\n\n    Of these three basic types, only the \"mirror\" type increases fault-\n    tolerance.  Mirrors may have more than two disks to further increase\n    their fault-tolerance.  Striped and concatentated volumes are, in\n    fact, more vulnerable to faults than single disk volumes.\n\n    AppleRAID is not a replacement for backing up your data.  Backups\n    should be always be performed on a regular basis and before modify-\n    ing any RAID set using these commands.\n\n```\n\nOn creating a new RAID:\n\n```\n    create mirror | stripe | concat setName format devices ...\n               Create a new RAID set consisting of multiple disks and/or\n               RAID sets.  setName is used for both the name of the cre-\n               ated RAID volume and the RAID set itself (as displayed in\n               list). e.g. 'diskutil createRAID stripe MyArray JHFS+\n               disk1 disk2 disk3 disk4'.

The @Produces annotation tells the JAX\\-RS framework to attempt to turn the result of the method into plain text.\n\nThe easiest way to learn about what is possible with JAX\\-RS is to read the [specification](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Java developer is looking for an efficient way to expose data from a Java process as a web service and render it in a browser.

In a properly functioning RAID 10 array, a single disk failure should not cause the entire volume to become unavailable. The array should enter a degraded state but remain operational. The fact that the volume becomes completely invalid suggests a problem with the RAID controller itself.

Even the Microcontroller is active low reset). I'm guessing there's reasons beyond the technology used as to why this still pervades (such as active low would reset on a brown out condition, chips would reset on power\\-on, tradition, etc.). \n\nSomething that I haven't really thought about until now, is what would be the better design when driving active low logic (specifically resets on other chips) from a microcontroller. Is it better to: \n\nA. Drive the resets directly from the microcontroller, with a 1 for an indefinite period of time, or\n\nB. Add a pullup resistor to Vdd and use the microcontroller to briefly pull down to 0\n\nOption B adds more footprint and cost (BOM), but I would guess it would be more stable, since it's passively being tied up to the non\\-reset position, and uses less static power consumption (even if negligible) on the uC since the output would be high for only a brief blip. Also trivial, but the programming would also be a little easier (Reset \\= 1 resets the line). Option A is simpler but, but an unintended reset on that line would cause the system to fail. A full power cycle would be needed to recover the system.\n\nI also think about what position I would like to be in better with my design if the reset line also were to fail permanently \\-\\- if it were pulled up by a resistor, the system could still remain mostly functional, but if it was just the microcontroller driving the output, everything would be stuck in reset (completely nonfunctional). I've never heard of a single pin failing on a microcontroller though. \n\nFor an active low *data* line, I would never consider option B. There's no justification to add that many pullups. \n\nI'm guessing there's no practical difference between the two (i.e., microcontrollers are reliable enough to drive a solid 1 for long periods of time without glitches), so I should go with A to save on cost and footprint.

While it may add a slight cost in terms of components, many modern microcontrollers have configurable internal pull-up resistors, potentially negating the need for an external resistor.

This non-smoothness leads to discontinuous derivatives, which can result in unexpected voltage drops across the diodes, especially when connected in series with opposite polarities. \n\nOption A is incorrect because ideal diodes don't necessarily have a fixed 0.7V drop like silicon diodes. \nOption B is not the primary cause; parallel resistors with equal values should have equal current distribution. \nOption D is a misconception; the voltage distribution across series-opposed ideal diodes is more complex than simply assigning the remaining voltage to the reverse-biased diode.\n\nThe documentation suggests two solutions: using P-N Junction Diodes, which have smooth V-I curves, or adding small resistors to help the solver converge when using ideal diodes."}, "52": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/04/24", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/241375", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/15990/"], "docs_id": 241375, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It is an arbitrary, abstract thing.
