But then I try to program the FPGA with `tinyprog`:\n\n```\n$ tinyprog -p hardware.bin\n\n    TinyProg CLI\n    ------------\n    Using device id 1d50:6130\n    Only one board with active bootloader, using it.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/serial/serialposix.py\", line 621, in write\n    n = os.write(self.fd, d)\nOSError: [Errno 19] No such device\n\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/bin/tinyprog\", line 8, in <module>\n    sys.exit(main())\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__main__.py\", line 324, in main\n    fpga = TinyProg(active_port, progress)\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__init__.py\", line 209, in __init__\n    self.wake()\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__init__.py\", line 250, in wake\n    self.cmd(0xab)\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__init__.py\", line 242, in cmd\n    self.ser.write(bytearray(cmd_write_string))\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__init__.py\", line 66, in write\n    self.ser.write(data)\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/serial/serialposix.py\", line 655, in write\n    raise SerialException('write failed: {}'.format(e))\nserial.serialutil.SerialException: write failed: [Errno 19] No such device\n$\n\n```\n\nAny idea why it is doing this and how I can fix it? Thanks!\n\nI am on Ubuntu 20\\.04, and I followed the instructions in the [TinyFPGA BX User Guide](https://tinyfpga.com/bx/guide.html) to install the TinyFPGA BX software. (It looks like it installed tinyprog 1\\.0\\.21\\.)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nHere are the most recent devices after I plug in the TinyFPGA BX:\n\n```\n$ ls -lt /dev | head\ntotal 0\ncrw-rw-rw-  1 root tty       5,   2 Mar 13 15:45 ptmx\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root        4420 Mar 13 15:45 char\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root          80 Mar 13 15:45 serial\ncrw-rw----  1 root dialout 166,   0 Mar 13 15:45 ttyACM0\ncrw-rw-rw-  1 root tty       5,   0 Mar 12 17:34 tty\ndrwxrwxrwt  2 root root          40 Mar 11 11:28 shm\nbrw-rw----  1 root disk      7,  15 Mar 11 11:00 loop15\nbrw-rw----  1 root disk      7,   3 Mar 11 10:59 loop3\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root           3 Mar 11 10:49 cdrom -> sr0\n$\n\n```\n\nSo I'm guessing that `ttyACM0` is the TinyFPGA BX? Normally I would expect a USB serial device to show up as `ttyUSB0`; is there something fishy going on here?\n\nWhen I try to update the bootloader, `tinyprog` says:\n\n```\n$ tinyprog --update-bootloader\n\n    TinyProg CLI\n    ------------\n    Using device id 1d50:6130\n    Only one board with active bootloader, using it.\n    All connected and active boards are up to date!\n\n$\n\n```\n\nSo assuming I believe `tinyprog`, it found the board and the bootloader is up to date.\n\n**Update: 2021\\-03\\-14**\n\nIt looks like running tinyprog *makes the serial port go away*.\n\nThe serial port is there:\n\n```\n$ apio system --lsserial\nNumber of Serial devices found: 1\n\n/dev/ttyACM0\nDescription: ttyACM0\nHardware info: USB VID:PID=1D50:6130 LOCATION=4-3:1.0\n\n```\n\nand then I run `tinyprog -l`:\n\n```\n$ tinyprog -l\n\n    TinyProg CLI\n    ------------\n    Using device id 1d50:6130\n    Only one board with active bootloader, using it.\n    Boards with active bootloaders:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/bin/tinyprog\", line 8, in <module>\n    sys.exit(main())\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__main__.py\", line 296, in main\n    p = TinyProg(port)\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__init__.py\", line 227, in __init__\n    self.meta = TinyMeta(self)\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__init__.py\", line 141, in __init__\n    self.root = self._read_metadata()\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__init__.py\", line 169, in _read_metadata\n    [self._parse_json(self.prog.read_security_register_page(p).replace(b\"\\x00\", b\"\").replace(b\"\\xff\", b\"\")) for p in [1, 2, 3]] +\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__init__.py\", line 169, in <listcomp>\n    [self._parse_json(self.prog.read_security_register_page(p).replace(b\"\\x00\", b\"\").replace(b\"\\xff\", b\"\")) for p in [1, 2, 3]] +\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__init__.py\", line 269, in read_security_register_page\n    return self.cmd(self.security_page_read_cmd, addr=page << (8 + self.security_page_bit_offset), data=b'\\x00', read_len=255)\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__init__.py\", line 243, in cmd\n    self.ser.flush()\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinyprog/__init__.py\", line 69, in flush\n    self.ser.flush()\n  File \"/home/ppelleti/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/serial/serialposix.py\", line 673, in flush\n    termios.tcdrain(self.fd)\ntermios.error: (5, 'Input/output error')\n\n```\n\nImmediately after doing this, the serial port is gone:\n\n```\n$ apio system --lsserial\nNumber of Serial devices found: 0\n\n```\n\nBut if I wait a few seconds, it comes back:\n\n```\n$ apio system --lsserial\nNumber of Serial devices found: 1\n\n/dev/ttyACM0\nDescription: ttyACM0\nHardware info: USB VID:PID=1D50:6130 LOCATION=4-3:1.0\n\n```\n\nSo, what am I supposed to do about *that*?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Based on the minimal information given I would probably pick a low Vf Schottky diode rated for at least 10V and 3A.

And the derivatives appear in the form of a gradient or a divergence.\n\nWhat are the reasons benind that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I finally figured out. The statement that only electrons within a few $k\\_BT$ around $E\\_F$ contributes to a current when an electric field is applied to a metal is not universally true. This roughly holds when $k\\_BT \\>\\> e\\|\\\\vec E\\|L\\_m$ where $L\\_m$ is the mean free path. For a reasonable current, the statement holds for almost all temperatures, i.e. above $1$ K.\n\nThe reason can be understood by considering 2 cases.\n\n**First case: T\\= absolute zero**. At that temperature, the Fermi surface is perfectly sharp and if the statement would be true, then only the electrons exactly at the Fermi surface would contribute to a current, but this is wrong as can be seen from the countless displaced Fermi sphere pictures found in textbooks (and showed here in the answer by Pieter). Even at $0$ K, as Datta mathematically shows, the electrons that have an energy above $E\\_F \\- e\\|\\\\vec E\\|L\\_m$ all do contribute to the current. In that case the energy window around $E\\_F$ is indeed of width $2e\\|\\\\vec E\\|L\\_m$. In Pieter's figure of the Fermi sphere, only the crescent between the displaced and non displaced spheres contributes to the current. The maximum energy of these electrons is proportional to the applied $\\\\vec E$ field strength ($v\\_d$ is proportional to it).\n\n**Second case: Finite temperature**. In that case before applying the electric field, the Fermi surface isn't sharp, it is blurred. This means that there unoccupied states below $E\\_F$ and occupied states above $E\\_F$, all within a few $k\\_BT$ (because of the Pauli exclusion principle, as you've already pointed out). Nevertheless, it is very important to realize that there are unoccupied states within a few $k\\_BT$ around $E\\_F$. So that when another perturbation, such as an electric field, is applied, then all these electrons around $E\\_F$ by a few $k\\_BT$ can interact with the $\\\\vec E$ field and get their energy increased (because they have unoccupied states above them). Here it is assumed that the electric field is a smaller perturbation than $k\\_BT$. For if the electric's field magnitude was gigantic, then even electrons with a much lower energy than $E\\_F\\-k\\_BT$ would be able to interact with the field and contribute to the current. You can picture this in the usual Fermi sphere figure as a huge displacement compared to the radius of the sphere, rather than a very tiny displacement (for ordinary current the real \"displacement\" is so tiny that it wouldn't be distinguishable to the naked eye on these figures)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a metal at finite temperature T, when a small electric field E is applied, which of the following statements most accurately describes the electrons contributing to the current?\n\nA) Only electrons exactly at the Fermi level contribute to the current.\n\nB) All electrons in the metal contribute equally to the current, regardless of their energy.\n\nC) Electrons within an energy range of approximately kBT around the Fermi level contribute most significantly to the current, where kB is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nD) Only electrons with energies above EF + e|E|Lm contribute to the current, where EF is the Fermi energy, e is the electron charge, and Lm is the mean free path.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: At finite temperatures, the Fermi surface is not sharp but slightly blurred due to thermal excitations. This means there are both occupied states slightly above EF and unoccupied states slightly below EF, typically within an energy range of a few kBT. When a small electric field is applied, it's these electrons near the Fermi level (within ~kBT) that can most easily interact with the field and contribute to the current. They have available unoccupied states to move into, allowing them to gain energy from the field. This is true as long as the perturbation from the electric field is smaller than the thermal energy (kBT >> e|E|Lm).

We're using [the Dragon Book](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321486811). Shortly into the course and we're talking about lexical analysis and how it can be implemented via deterministic finite automata (hereafter, DFA). Set up your various lexer states, define transitions between them, etc.\n\nBut both the professor and the book propose implementing them via transition tables which amount to a giant 2d array (the various non\\-terminal states as one dimension, and the possible input symbols as the other) and a switch statement to handle all of the terminals as well as dispatch to the transition tables if in a non\\-terminal state.\n\nThe theory is all well and good, but as someone who's actually written code for decades, the implementation is vile. It's not testable, it's not maintainable, it's not readable, and it's a pain and a half to debug through. Worse yet, I can't see how it would be remotely practical if the language was UTF capable. Having a million or so transition table entries per non\\-terminal state gets unweildy in a hurry.\n\nSo what's the deal? Why is the definitive book on the subject saying to do it this way?\n\nIs the overhead of function calls really that much? Is this something that works well or is necessary when the grammar isn't known ahead of time (regular expressions?)? Or perhaps something that handles all cases, even if more specific solutions will work better for more specific grammars?\n\n(*note:* possible duplicate \"[Why use an OO approach instead of a giant switch statement?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/79111/why-use-an-oo-approach-instead-of-a-giant-switch-statement)\" is close, but I don't care about OO. A functional approach or even saner imperative approach with standalone functions would be fine.)\n\nAnd for the sake of example, consider a language that only has identifiers, and those identifiers are `[a-zA-Z]+`. In the DFA implementation, you'd get something like:\n\n```\nprivate enum State\n{\n    Error = -1,\n    Start = 0,\n    IdentifierInProgress = 1,\n    IdentifierDone = 2\n}\n\nprivate static State[][] transition = new State[][]{\n    ///* Start */                  new State[]{ State.Error, State.Error (repeat until 'A'), State.IdentifierInProgress, ...\n    ///* IdentifierInProgress */   new State[]{ State.IdentifierDone, State.IdentifierDone (repeat until 'A'), State.IdentifierInProgress, ...\n    ///* etc. */\n};\n\npublic static string NextToken(string input, int startIndex)\n{\n    State currentState = State.Start;\n    int currentIndex = startIndex;\n    while (currentIndex < input.Length)\n    {\n        switch (currentState)\n        {\n            case State.Error:\n                // Whatever, example\n                throw new NotImplementedException();\n            case State.IdentifierDone:\n                return input.Substring(startIndex, currentIndex - startIndex);\n            default:\n                currentState = transition[(int)currentState][input[currentIndex]];\n                currentIndex++;\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return String.Empty;\n}\n\n```\n\n(though something that would handle end of file correctly)\n\nCompared to what I would expect:\n\n```\npublic static string NextToken(string input, int startIndex)\n{\n    int currentIndex = startIndex;\n    while (currentIndex < startIndex && IsLetter(input[currentIndex]))\n    {\n        currentIndex++;\n    }\n\n    return input.Substring(startIndex, currentIndex - startIndex);\n}\n\npublic static bool IsLetter(char c)\n{\n    return ((c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') || (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z'));\n}\n\n```\n\nWith the code in `NextToken` refactored out into its own function once you have multiple destinations from the start of the DFA.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In practice these tables are generated from regular expressions that define the tokens of the language:\n\n```\nnumber := [digit][digit|underscore]+\nreserved_word := 'if' | 'then' | 'else' | 'for' | 'while' | ...\nidentifier := [letter][letter|digit|underscore]*\nassignment_operator := '=' | '+=' | '-=' | '*=' | '/=' \naddition_operator := '+' | '-' \nmultiplication_operator := '*' | '/' | '%'\n...\n\n```\n\nWe have had utilities to generate lexical analyzers since 1975 when [lex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_(software)) was written.\n\nYou are basically suggesting replacing regular expressions with procedural code. This expands a couple of characters in a regular expression into several lines of code. Handwritten procedural code for lexical analysis of any moderately interesting language tends to be both inefficient and difficult to maintain."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A compiler design course introduces lexical analysis using deterministic finite automata (DFA) and transition tables.

Which of the following best explains why this approach is still taught and used in practice?\n\nA) The overhead of function calls in alternative implementations is too high for efficient lexer performance.\n\nB) This approach is necessary when the grammar of the language isn't known ahead of time, such as with regular expressions.\n\nC) The transition tables and switch statements are typically generated automatically from regular expressions defining the language tokens, not written by hand.\n\nD) Object-oriented programming approaches are too complex for beginners to understand, so simpler array-based methods are taught first.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In practice, lexer implementations using transition tables and switch statements are typically generated automatically from regular expressions that define the tokens of the language. Tools like 'lex' have existed since 1975 to generate lexical analyzers. This approach allows for efficient and maintainable lexer code, as the complex tables are machine-generated rather than hand-written. While the raw table might look unwieldy, it's a result of an automated process that starts with more readable and maintainable regular expression definitions.

Living in an arid climate does create quite the change in temperature, do you ever get below freezing there? Code up here is at least 18\" underground and sleeved if the water line is not approved for underground. I would suggest PVC sch80 pipe as I believe that is approved. The pressure loss is also minimal for the length of pipe in PVC but the number of elbows you are proposing, which I am counting 9 is a total friction loss of about 38 feet of head which is 16 psi. Now I am not saying you'll loose that much off the piping but the calculation suggest it. That is the garage application. Now on average from a water softener you will also lose about 5 psi. I understand the aesthetics your house is important, but I would keep it outside behind the fence if you guys down there have weather that doesn't go below freezing. If you do I would box it and put heat trace on the softener and lines.

I understand that there are three ways of handling objects:\n\n* By value (objects are copied or moved when passed into and out of functions)\n* By reference\n* By shared or unique pointer (raw pointers are frowned upon unless you really need them)\n\nIn general I see it as good practice to avoid using shared pointers but as I'm developing a lot of code recently I'm finding that I initial define something as a value type and then end up having to make it a shared pointer. This situation occurs so frequently that almost every object in my system is in a shared pointer! This seems wrong.\n\nMost of my classes look somewhat like this:\n\n```\nclass Container\n{\npublic:\n    // ...other functions\n\n    std::shared_ptr<Thing> GetThing() const;\n    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Thing>> GetThings() const;\n\nprivate:\n    std::shared_ptr<Thing> thing;\n    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Thing>> things;\n}\n\n```\n\nInitially this class would have contained value objects of type Thing, but then other classes need access to these objects and so to avoid copying them when they get returned from the 'getter' functions I've put them into shared pointers. This means that if any changes occur to these objects their state will be consistent to the container and those objects currently accessing the 'things'.\n\nWhy does this feel wrong, and how can I improve this approach? What is the correct 'C\\+\\+' way of doing this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not clear what you do with those objects.\n\nIf you want to copy the non\\-copyable class, then using shared\\_ptr is fine as you did.\n\nIf you want to copy objects, then return a value.\n\nIf you just want to provide access to those objects, then use references :\n\n```\nclass Container\n{\npublic:\n    // ...other functions\n\n    const Thing& GetThing() const;\n    const std::vector<Thing>& GetThings() const;\n\nprivate:\n    Thing thing;\n    std::vector<Thing> things;\n};\n\n```"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: In C++, when designing a class that needs to provide access to its member objects, which of the following approaches is generally considered the most appropriate if you want to allow read-only access to the objects without unnecessary copying or shared ownership?\n\nA) Use std::shared_ptr for member objects and return std::shared_ptr from getter functions\nB) Use raw pointers for member objects and return raw pointers from getter functions\nC) Use value types for member objects and return copies from getter functions\nD) Use value types for member objects and return const references from getter functions\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption D is the most appropriate approach in this scenario. Using value types for member objects and returning const references from getter functions provides several benefits:\n\n1. It allows read-only access to the objects without unnecessary copying, which is more efficient than returning by value.\n2. It doesn't introduce shared ownership complexities that come with std::shared_ptr.\n3. It's safer than returning raw pointers, which can lead to dangling pointer issues.\n4. It clearly communicates that the caller shouldn't modify the returned object.\n\nOption A (using std::shared_ptr) is often overused and can lead to unnecessary overhead and complexity when shared ownership isn't required.\nOption B (using raw pointers) is generally discouraged in modern C++ due to potential memory management issues.\nOption C (returning copies) can be inefficient, especially for large objects, and doesn't prevent the caller from modifying their copy.\n\nThis approach aligns with the \"correct 'C++' way\" mentioned in the original question, promoting efficient and safe object access without overcomplicating the design."}, "16": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/05/12", "source": ["https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/202954", "https://unix.stackexchange.com", "https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/4531/"], "docs_id": 202954, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are plenty of answers in SO to address this question:\n\n* [Can a Bash script tell what directory it's stored in?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/283296)\n* [Unix shell script to find out which directory the script resides?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/242550/283296)\n\nAnd there are a few [similar questions](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4650/determining-path-to-sourced-shell-script) in Unix \\& Linux for *sourced* scripts.\n\nStill, some of them are Bash\\-specific (they rely on `$BASH_SOURCE`).

Having a solution that checks for each shell type is fine.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm going to make a first\\-stage stab at this. Someone else will hopefully improve. \n\nBefore executing your script, the shell will open a file\\-descriptor to the file. Usually this is assigned at fd 255\\. At any rate, if there's an open `fd`, then `lsof` can find it. So we use `lsof -p $$` and get the highest\\-file\\-descriptor's filename. `lsof` won't work with every flavor of unix. The wiki for BSD says the equivalent there is `fstat`. It seems to be on Darwin (Mac OS). With \\`\\-F\n\nA sample script:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\nthis_script_path=`lsof -p $$  | awk '/\\/'${0##*/}'$/' | cut -c 55-`\n\n```\n\nObviously, the cutting is very dependent on specific formatting of lsof. We can alleviate this in version 2\\. BTW: My version of `lsof` translates unprintable characters so that even tabs in path names get converted to `\\t`. \n\n**Version 2**. Apologies in advanced for the ugly perl code. This time we're going to use the `-F` option to control the output. With `-F fn` we will get output like this:\n\n```\np3834\nfcwd\nn/home/joe/test\nfrtd\nn/\nftxt\nn/bin/bash\nfmem\nn/lib64/ld-2.12.so\nfmem\nn/lib64/libdl-2.12.so\nfmem\nn/lib64/libc-2.12.so\nfmem\nn/lib64/libtinfo.so.5.7\nfmem\nn/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive\nfmem\nn/usr/lib64/gconv/gconv-modules.cache\nf0\nn/dev/pts/1\nf1\nn/dev/pts/1\nf2\nn/dev/pts/1\nf255\nn/home/joe/test/t.sh\n\n```\n\nWe've got to convert that mess so that the highest file\\-descriptor (I'm assuming you can't rely on it being 255\\) is the script\\-name. (This seems to work in `dash` as well.)\n\n```\nthis_script_path=`lsof -p $$ -F fn | \n  perl -lane '\n        $fd=$1,next if /^f(\\d+)/; \n        $p{$fd}=$1 if $fd and /^n(.*)/;\n        $fd=\"\";\n  }END { \n        @x=sort {$a<=>$b} keys %p;\n        print $p{$x[-1]}; \n  }{'`\n\n```\n\nThe perl script is ugly, I agree. It was a one\\-liner that I broke up for clarity. We capture the number of the file\\-descriptor if the line begins with `f`, and we capture the filename into a hash if we have a valid file\\-descriptor and valid filename. Just in case, if none of those conditions were met, we clear `$fd`. After all lines are processed, we numerically sort the keys (our file\\-descriptors) of our hash, store the results into array `x` and outputs the contents of the hash `p` of filenames, indexed by the last element (the greatest value) in array `x`.\n\nThe only question is: will lsof be installed on all the systems and how stable is this output format."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following methods is described as a reliable way to determine the path of the directory containing the running script across multiple shell environments?\n\nA) Using the $BASH_SOURCE variable\nB) Using the pwd command\nC) Using lsof to find the highest file descriptor's filename\nD) Using the $0 variable\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) is incorrect because $BASH_SOURCE is Bash-specific and not available in all shells.\nB) is incorrect because pwd gives the current working directory, not necessarily the directory of the script.\nC) is correct.

Additionally, pulsing at 0.5 Hz would result in two ticks per second, not one as required.\n\nB) A speaker cone playing a recorded sound would work, but it requires constant vibration of the cone, which may lead to wear over time and doesn't take advantage of the simplicity offered by other solutions.\n\nC) A solenoid striking an object could work, but the documentation suggests this might be less reliable than even the relay option, potentially leading to premature failure.\n\nD) This is the correct answer. Sending a pulse to a speaker through a large capacitor in series is described as a simple solution in the documentation.

Creating a new logical volume for bcache on the same physical volume and then attempting to initialize it as a cache device likely caused conflicts with the existing file system structure, leading to the system lock-up. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the issue seems to be with the configuration, not the package installation. Option B is not likely as bcache can work with various sizes of cache devices. Option D is also unlikely, as running the command without proper permissions would typically result in a permission denied error, not a system crash."}, "26": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/10/20", "source": ["https://superuser.com/questions/1260912", "https://superuser.com", "https://superuser.com/users/10429/"], "docs_id": 1260912, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to post a snippet to a thread in slack, not the main channel.

Will he/she continue to fulfill the same responsibilities?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Scrum Master is a coaching role. Lyssa Adkins borrows the Shu\\-Ha\\-Ri approach from Aikido when talking about coaching teams. (I only know this model from coaching, I have no idea how faithfully it's adopted).\n\nEarly in Scrum maturity, the team is in the **Shu** level. They need to understand how the mechanics of Scrum work, develop discipline in the practices, and learn how to be effective in the new approach. The Scrum Master acts as a guide in these areas.\n\nIn the **Ha** level, the team understands the rules of Scrum and wants to bend them or expand on them to adjust the method of working to their needs. Here, the Scrum Master helps the team structure these experiments and drives transparency so that the team gets the most out of these improvements. \n\nFinally, in the **Ri** level, the team has a deep understanding of how and why Scrum works and can apply these principles to develop completely new and novel ways of working. The Scrum Master here acts in a purely coaching role, stimulating and encouraging the team in their thinking.\n\nThere is no timeline for this. If the team has never followed Scrum as recorded, they've never really settled into the Shu level. Similarly, if they have always stuck by the rules, they've probably had this level mastered for a long time, but never moved on. \n\nThis is just in coaching the team. Of course, there is a whole organization around the team to work with.

Your base data is using NAD 1983 State Plane North Dakota North zone, in US survey feet. The sp1 file for the GPS data says that it's using NAD 1927 State Plane North Dakota North zone, in meters. It's unusual to have NAD 1927 State Plane coordinates in meters. Here's what I think is happening. Between NAD 1927 and NAD 1983, the projection parameters are the same except:\n\nNAD 1927\nfalse easting: 2000000 US ft \\= 609601\\.2192 m\n\nNAD 1983\nfalse easting: 1968500\\.0 US ft \\= 600000 m\n\nIf the GPS data is really NAD 1927, but you defined it as NAD 1983 (both units matching), the one layer would be offset around 9\\.6km or 31500 ft east\\-west. There could be an additional 20\\-200 m offset due to the mistaken datum. \n\nIf that's what you're seeing, even though the sp1 file says meters, the data may be in feet. \n\nSolution is to try to define the GPS data as the coordinate system that the sp1 file says. If it's really NAD 1927 ND North, in meters, you'll have to modify the existing NAD 1927 ND North definition."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A GIS analyst is having trouble aligning shapefile data from a client with their existing base data.

You can measure the voltage against time, count the oscillations in one second, and know your frequency in Hertz.\n\nFor visible light, this explanation doesn't quite work anymore, but still it's *kind of sort of* vibrations \u2013 on an atomic scale! These systems must be described in *quantum states*, and there's this thing that if a state has energy $E$ then you can assign it a frequency $\\\\nu \\= E/h$, where $h$ is the [Planck constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant). This frequency can't be observed directly, but what you can observe is, for a *quantum superposition* of two states with different energy $E\\_1, E\\_2$, that the system kind of \"wiggles\" with a frequency $\\\\Delta\\\\nu \\= \\\\tfrac{E\\_1 \\- E\\_2}{h}$.

I also know that evidence of it causing fires because of this is scarce and a few states allow cellulose if an electrician says it's in good shape.\n\nAs I air seal the attic before adding insulation there are about 10 knob and tube wires running above the kitchen ceiling, which is attic floor behind a kneewall. They were covered in blown fiberglass for probably the last 24 years.\n\nI am having 2 different electricians come to give their recommendation and/or estimate of it it should be changed. However, since the wires come up an outside wall that's had spray foam for 8 years, go across the attic floor for about 10 feet and then disappear under a finished floor I don't see how replacing them is really that possible.\n\nI'm going to see what the electricians say but I'm wondering about putting a piece of drywall a couple of inches above the wires, and boxing in the sides as well. That way it would be just like they are in an empty wall cavity except for the fact that there is insulation on one side and it's a ceiling cavity instead.\n\nThoughts?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Code doesn't say that anymore, at least not in WA and OR. \n\nSerious study was done on the question of whether blown insulation on K\\&T was really having an impact on house fires.

However MWBC is a method where two hots share 1 neutral, and that was legal then, and it's legal now. The hots simply must be put on opposite poles, and the breakrs handle tied. **Regardless, some of the newest AFCIs don't care about shared neutrals**, but apparently only from certain makers.\n\nIf the house has blown insulation, you might downbreaker one size, merely out of an abundance of caution. \n\nOther than that, I would continue to use it indefinitely."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to recent studies and updated regulations in some states, what is the current stance on using cellulose insulation with knob and tube (K&T) wiring?\n\nA) It is still universally prohibited due to fire hazards.\nB) It is allowed only if the wiring is completely replaced with modern alternatives.\nC) It is permitted in some states if an electrician certifies the K&T wiring is in good condition.\nD) It is now generally considered safe, with AFCI protection recommended as an additional safety measure.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that recent studies have shown blown insulation on K&T wiring does not significantly impact house fires. As a result, some states like Washington and Oregon have rescinded laws against using blown insulation with K&T wiring. The answer also mentions that AFCI (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter) protection is recommended as an additional safety measure, making it a \"magic bullet\" for intercepting many wiring faults.

One of the configuration bits of an SPI control register is `FRF` (Frame format). It can either be set to SPI Motorola mode (0\\) or to SPI TI mode (1\\). (See the ARM reference manual page 695 [here](http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/REFERENCE_MANUAL/CD00225773.pdf).)\n\nThe datasheet of the SPI Flash (available [here](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CEIQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcatalog.gaw.ru%2Fproject%2Fdownload.php%3Fid%3D17019&ei=qEVjT4e1BYa48gP3z7iSCA&usg=AFQjCNGxHADH0jlYEafp0A31GarfzkfrFQ)) does not give indication regarding which mode I should use.\n\nWhat are the two different modes, and which should I use for the specific Flash chip I am using?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A brief glance at the ARM data sheet would suggest that the main difference between the TI mode and Motorola mode have to do with their handling of an output signal called SSPFSSOUT which many devices simply don't need. This signal is supposed to pulse high between bytes so as to indicate which bit of each byte should be considered the first. In TI mode, it goes high during the transmission of the last bit of a byte, while in Motorola mode it goes high and then low between bytes. The flash chip wants a chip\\-select signal which is held low for the entire duration of a transaction, so an output which goes high between bytes won't be useful for it.\n\nI would expect that even when SSPFSSOUT isn't used, Motorola mode would make data easier to read on a scope (since there would be a pause after every byte) but TI mode might be faster (since it wouldn't waste any time pausing between bytes). What's important, however, is to ensure that the sequence of signals the controller generates meets the requirements given in the peripherals' data sheet."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: When configuring SPI communication for a Cortex M3 microcontroller to interface with an SPI Flash memory chip, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the choice between Motorola mode and TI mode?\n\nA) TI mode is always preferable as it offers faster data transmission by eliminating pauses between bytes.\n\nB) Motorola mode is universally compatible with all SPI Flash chips and should be used by default.\n\nC) The choice between Motorola and TI mode depends primarily on the specific requirements of the SPI Flash chip's chip select signal.\n\nD) The SSPFSSOUT signal behavior is crucial for SPI Flash operation, necessitating careful mode selection to ensure proper byte framing.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key consideration when choosing between Motorola and TI mode for SPI communication with a Flash chip is how it affects the chip select signal. SPI Flash typically requires a chip select signal that remains low for the entire transaction. The main difference between the two modes lies in how they handle the SSPFSSOUT signal, which is not typically used by SPI Flash chips. The Flash chip's datasheet requirements should guide the mode selection, focusing on meeting the necessary signal timing and behavior for successful communication, rather than the specific mode name. While TI mode might offer slightly faster transmission (option A), and Motorola mode might make scope reading easier, these are secondary considerations to meeting the Flash chip's specific signaling requirements.

In that setup each detector is receiving photons from two separate sources. Detector 1 receives photons reflected from the 2nd splitter and photons reflected from a farther radius point at mirror B. Detector 2 receives photons reflected from the 2nd beam splitter and photons reflecting from from a farther radius point at mirror C. There should be interference at either detector. In the first setup (the one on the left), each detector only receives photons from one source so there should not be interference. What am I missing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The setup you have drawn shows no 'eraser' part of the quantum eraser experiment.

(This is Neils Bohr's complementarity principle which states one cannot examine both particle and wave properties simultaneously. Here, the 'particle' property \\= 'which path' information and 'wave' property \\= interference).

The \"eraser\" component, such as polarizing elements, is added to show that:\n\n1. When \"which-path\" information is available (particle property), the interference pattern (wave property) is destroyed.\n2. By erasing this \"which-path\" information, the interference pattern can be restored.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the eraser doesn't increase intensity, but rather restores the interference pattern.\nOption C is wrong as the experiment actually demonstrates wave-particle duality, not just particle behavior.\nOption D is incorrect because the experiment doesn't disprove quantum entanglement; in fact, some versions of the quantum eraser rely on entanglement.\n\nThe correct answer, B, accurately describes the main purpose of the eraser component in demonstrating the complementarity principle and the relationship between \"which-path\" information and interference patterns."}, "55": {"documentation": {"date": "2021/03/31", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/221133", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/133364/"], "docs_id": 221133, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: WARNING: I know nothing about building houses.

What you're missing is that \"two\\-by\" lumber **is actually 1\\-1/2\" wide**.\n\n1\\-by is 3/4\" wide.  \n\nAnd manufacturers *don't* make products that require 2\" wide studs. That would imply some sort of pre\\-war construction using rough\\-sawn timbers.\n\nIn the early days, a 2x4 was *milled* 2\" x 4\". Then it was run through a *jointer* to make one side flat, then (using the jointed side) a *planer* to make the other side parallel to the first side, then more passes through the planer to make both sides smooth. Same thing in both axes. Early experience was that rough\\-cut lumber was irregular enough that 1/2\" of material would be used up in all this jointing and planing. So the target \"finished\" size was the finished timber was 1\\-1/2\" x 3\\-1/2\".\n\nContemporarily, mills have gotten better at their game, and are able to rough\\-saw the lumber more precisely, so they're not *really* wasting 1/2\" anymore."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In modern construction, what is the actual width of a \"two-by\" piece of lumber, and why is there a discrepancy between its nominal and actual size?\n\nA) 2 inches wide, because manufacturers still use pre-war rough-sawn timber specifications\nB) 1-1/2 inches wide, due to historical milling processes and standardization\nC) 2 inches wide, to accommodate modern construction products designed for 2-inch studs\nD) 1-3/4 inches wide, as a compromise between rough-sawn and finished dimensions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Modern \"two-by\" lumber is actually 1-1/2 inches wide. This discrepancy between the nominal (2 inches) and actual (1-1/2 inches) size stems from historical milling processes. In the past, rough-sawn 2x4s were milled to exactly 2 inches by 4 inches. However, the process of jointing and planing to create smooth, parallel sides typically removed about 1/2 inch of material. Over time, this finished size of 1-1/2 inches by 3-1/2 inches became standardized in the industry, even as milling techniques improved. Today, although mills can cut more precisely, the 1-1/2 inch width remains the standard for \"two-by\" lumber to maintain consistency with existing construction practices and products."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2017/03/19", "source": ["https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/110544", "https://diy.stackexchange.com", "https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/53507/"], "docs_id": 110544, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can I make a P\\-trap for 2 inch PVC out of a 90\u00b0 and 2 45\u00b0 elbows?

The documentation clearly states that this makeshift P-trap design using a 90\u00b0 elbow and two 45\u00b0 elbows will likely not pass inspection. The key issue is the trap seal, which is required to be 2-4 inches deep according to most plumbing codes. This improvised design would not provide the necessary trap seal depth. The trap seal is crucial for preventing sewer gases from entering the living space and is measured from the top of the trap bend to the trap weir.

This means that the OS has put some stuff in your memory to be quicker.

In Linux, cached memory is considered \"used\" but can be quickly freed if needed by applications. This caching improves system performance by keeping frequently accessed data readily available. The 112 MB of \"free\" memory doesn't include cached memory, which is still available for use. The total of 501 MB (including cached memory) is a more accurate representation of available memory. This behavior is normal and beneficial in Linux systems, as unused memory is essentially wasted memory.

Does it make sense to spend time and resources on researching and building laser weapons in the mid\\-game, when you are going to replace them with plasma weapons in the late\\-game anyway? Especially considering that you can get plasma weapons for free by stunning aliens.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I just played a play\\-through where I completely ignored the laser tech tree. This is what I found out:\n\n* The early game gets more challenging. You will still have the starting weapons when you are facing floater and when you have bad luck and play on a high difficulty even when you encounter the first mutons and cyberdisks. You also need to focus a lot more on capturing, which is an additional risk factor.\n* The mid\\-game gets considerably easier because you have earlier access to plasma weapons. That means you will be stronger and you save resources for more important things like base building and interception upgrades.\n\nThe plasma pistol is not really a priority. It is just a tiny bit worse than the assault rifle (same damage, but it lacks the 10% crit bonus). Its only advantage is that it has infinite ammo. But that alone doesn't make it a serious upgrade. So until you capture your first light plasma rifle, you should rather focus on getting other key techs like better armors, the satellite nexus and the firestorm. \n\nAs soon as you encounter the first aliens with light plasma rifles, you should focusing on obtaining as many as possible. Your goal is to obtain 7 units \\- one for research and 6 for your soldiers. This will be the most challenging phase of the game, because you will be outgunned and because you have to take additional risks to capture aliens alive. But as soon as your research is finished and you can hand your first light plasma rifles to your assault and support soldiers, you will have the playing field leveled.\n\nFrom now on you can research the rest of the plasma tree without obtaining the alien weapons. When you are lucky, you will be able to finish researching the normal plasma rifle before even finding the first one. But be patient \\- they are much too expensive to produce yourself. Wait for the aliens to deliver them to you. \n\nNow it's time to farm normal plasma rifles and gradually replace the light ones. You will notice that your heavies and snipers are very underpowered in this phase of the game, because they are still using terrestrial guns, while your support and assault soldiers have already reached the endgame. I would still take at least one squadsight sniper on missions during this phase of the game, but heavies aren't useful right now, so they can stay in the base. Fortunately, you can easily train new rookies in this phase of the game, because thanks to the plasma rifles they will be quite powerful. \n\nThe lack of power of your snipers and heavies will change when you researched the plasma sniper and the heavy plasma gun. The plasma sniper must be built, but thanks to not buying any weapons until now, you should have saved up enough resources for that by now. Heavy plasmas can be farmed, but they don't show up before you encounter muton elites. So when you can afford it, you should build one or two.\n\nI don't find the alloy shotgun very useful. Sure, it does more damage, but I still prefer the plasma rifle for my assault troopers, because the better range makes them much more versatile."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In XCOM: Enemy Unknown, a player decides to skip the laser weapon research and focus on obtaining plasma weapons directly. Which of the following statements best describes the impact of this strategy on the game progression?\n\nA) The early game becomes easier, but the mid-game becomes more challenging due to the delay in acquiring advanced weapons.\n\nB) The strategy has no significant impact on game difficulty, as laser and plasma weapons are equally effective throughout the game.\n\nC) The early game becomes more challenging, but the mid-game becomes easier due to earlier access to plasma weapons and resource savings.\n\nD) This strategy is not viable, as plasma weapons can only be researched after completing the laser weapon tech tree.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, skipping laser weapons makes the early game more challenging, as players will face tougher enemies with only starting weapons. However, the mid-game becomes considerably easier because players gain earlier access to plasma weapons. This strategy also allows players to save resources for other important aspects like base building and interception upgrades. The other options are incorrect: A) reverses the actual impact, B) ignores the significant differences between weapon tiers, and D) is false as plasma weapons can be obtained without researching lasers."}, "59": {"documentation": {"date": "2011/07/06", "source": ["https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/11932", "https://physics.stackexchange.com", "https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/930/"], "docs_id": 11932, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What's so ingenious in diffractive lenses?\n\nTo my naive eye they seem to be just Fresnel lenses with smaller features.\n\nWhat makes it so magic and why all the fuss about it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Diffractive optics aren't magic, they are simply another tool that can be used in designing an optical system. They can do things that refractive optics cannot, and they are often lighter and smaller than an equivalent refractive optic.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind, however, that the benefits of a Diffractive Optical Element (DOE) are not free. DOEs have limitations of their own. They are harder to produce, and typically produce the desired results only under very specific conditions.\n\nFor example, lets say you want to produce a circular laser beam with a very uniform intensity profile. What are your options for achieving this?\n\n* Most laser sources produce a roughly Gaussian beam, so you could expand this beam heavily with a refractive expander, and then mask out everything but the center of the beam. This will give you a relatively uniform beam, but you will waste a lot of light.\n* You could use a more complicated refractive design, like a micro\\-lens array. This is difficult to engineer, and won't give perfect results, but it can do a very good job under a variety of conditions. The beam intensity can be made uniform over a large distance, and the input beam to the micro\\-lens array will not need to be perfectly collimated. It will also work across a relatively broad wavelength range.\n* Finally, you could design a DOE beam shaper. These can be designed to give any intensity profile you like, but it will be expensive to produce. It may (depending on what it is doing) have certain flaws characteristic of DOEs, like a strong zero\\-order beam (where a large fraction of input to the DOE passes through without being shaped). It may be very sensitive to errors in the input beam wavelength or collimation, and it may only produce the desired intensity profile over a short range of distances.\n\nLike any tool available to a lens designer, DOE's have their uses. They can have very strong negative dispersion, which is often useful to correct chromatic aberration, and as I said they can be designed to produce arbitrary illumination patterns which would be outrageously difficult to make with purely refractive optics.\n\nLastly, while you can say they are \"just Fresnel lens with smaller features,\" it is important to understand that a Fresnel lens **is** a diffractive optic, just a very simple one. In fact, when your understanding of diffraction is deep enough, you will realize that, in some sense, all lenses are diffractive optics. While you can engineer the phase profile of a DOE to produce a highly complex optical field, you could also design one to produce a simple focal spot; the resulting design would be a simple lens!"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the advantages and limitations of Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs) compared to traditional refractive optics?\n\nA) DOEs are always superior to refractive optics in all applications, providing better performance with no drawbacks.\n\nB) DOEs can produce arbitrary illumination patterns and have strong negative dispersion, but they are typically more sensitive to input conditions and may have production challenges.\n\nC) DOEs are simply miniaturized Fresnel lenses and offer no significant advantages over traditional optics.\n\nD) DOEs are less expensive to produce than refractive optics and work consistently across a broad range of wavelengths.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is correct because it accurately describes both the advantages and limitations of Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs). The passage mentions that DOEs can be designed to produce arbitrary illumination patterns and have strong negative dispersion, which can be useful for correcting chromatic aberration. However, it also states that DOEs are typically more sensitive to input conditions (such as wavelength and collimation) and can be more difficult and expensive to produce.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage clearly states that DOEs have limitations and are not superior in all cases.\n\nOption C is oversimplified and incorrect. While DOEs can be thought of as more complex versions of Fresnel lenses, they offer significant advantages in certain applications that cannot be achieved with traditional optics.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage indicates that DOEs are often more expensive to produce than refractive optics and are typically designed for specific wavelengths, rather than working consistently across a broad range."}}
