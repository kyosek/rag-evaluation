Put `appService.service` in `~/.config/systemd/system/` and remove the `User=` line. Then you can control it with:\n\n```\nsystemctl --user start appService.service\nsystemctl --user stop appService.service\n\n```\n\n2. Add a polkit rule. I think this question is very close to what you're looking for: [systemd start as unprivileged user in a group](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/504806/systemd-start-as-unprivileged-user-in-a-group/557634#557634). If you are on debian/ubuntu (polkit \\< 106\\), then this would work:\n\n```\n/etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/service-auth.pkla\n---\n[Allow yourname to start/stop/restart services]\nIdentity=unix-user:youname\nAction=org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units\nResultActive=yes\n\n```\n\nIf you are on Arch/Redhat (polkit \\>\\= 106\\), then this would work:\n\n```\n/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/service-auth.rules\n---\npolkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {\n    if (action.id == \"org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units\" &&\n        subject.user == \"yourname\") {\n        return polkit.Result.YES;\n    } });\n\n```\n\n3. `sudo`. I'm not a big fan of this because `sudo` shouldn't need to rely on a `NOPASSWD:` configuration and I don't feel that it's designed to be invoked indirectly. That's what polkit is designed for.\n\n```\n/etc/sudoers.d/sysctl\n---\nyouname ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl\n\n```\n\n---\n\nIf this is for software you plan to distribute, I'd definitely go with the polkit solution and do it per group (per the linked answer). It means you don't have to hard\\-code a username, instead add whichever users you like to that group to get the functionality."

It allows for fine-grained control over permissions, can be applied to groups (not just individual users), and is designed specifically for this kind of access control.

Let me assume that $E$ is modular. Then there will be some level 1 Hilbert modular form over $F$ corresponding to $E$. But my understanding is that the cohomology of $E$ will not show up in any of the \"usual suspect\" Shimura varieties associated to this situation (the level 1 Hilbert modular surface, or any Shimura curve \\[the reason it can't show up here is that a quaternion algebra ramified at precisely one infinite place must also ramify at one finite place]).\n\nIf you want a more concrete assertion, I am saying that the Tate module of $E$, or any twist of this, shouldn't show up as a subquotient of the etale cohomology of the Shimura varieties attached to $GL(2\\)$ or any of its inner forms over $F$ (my knowledge of the cohomology of Hilbert modular surfaces is poor though; I hope I have this right).\n\nBut here's the question. I have it in my head that someone once told me that $E$ (or perhaps more precisely the motive attached to $E$) should not show up in the cohomology of *any* Shimura variety. This is kind of interesting, because here is a programme for meromorphically continuing the L\\-function of an arbitrary smooth projective variety over a number field to the complex plane:\n\n1\\) Observe that automorphic forms for GL\\_n have very well\\-behaved L\\-functions; prove that they extend to the whole complex plane. \\[standard stuff].\n\n2\\) Prove the same for automorphic forms on any connected reductive algebraic group over a number field \\[i.e. prove Langlands functoriality]\n\n3\\) Prove that the L\\-functions attached to the cohomology of Shimura varieties can be interpreted in terms of automorphic forms \\[i.e. prove conjectures of Langlands, known in many cases]\n\n4\\) Prove that the cohomology of any algebraic variety at all (over a number field) shows up in the cohomology of a Shimura variety. \\[huge generalisation of Taniyama\\-Shimura\\-Weil modularity conjecture]\n\nMy understanding is that this programme, nice though it looks, is expected to fail because (4\\) is expected not to be true. And I believe I was once assured by an expert that the kind of variety for which problems might occur is the elliptic curve over $F$ mentioned above. At the time I did not understand the reasons given to me for why this should be the case, so of course now I can't reproduce them.\n\nHave I got this right or have I got my wires crossed?\n\nEDIT (more precisely, \"addition\"): Milne's comment below seems to indicate that I did misremember, and that in fact I was probably only told what Milne mentions below. So in fact I probably need to modify the question: the question I'd like to ask now is \"is (4\\) a reasonable statement?\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is an example of an elliptic curve $E$ over $Q(\\\\sqrt{997})$ of conductor 1: $\\[ 0, w, 1, \\-24w \\- 289, \\-144w \\- 2334 ]$, where $w\\=(1\\+\\\\sqrt{997})/2$ (thanks to Lassina Dembelle; this curve even has rank 2!). Shimura's paper \"Construction of class fields and zeta functions of algebraic curves\" suggests (according to MathSciNet) how to construct a Shimura variety of dimension 2 that isn't a curve but is associated to the relevant quaternion algebra. Shimura lets the quaternion algebra act on the product of two copies of the upper half plane instead of 1, and is able to show the relevant variety is defined over Q by using Siegel modular forms. Perhaps the cohomology of $E$ shows up there? I don't know."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Consider an elliptic curve E over a real quadratic field F with conductor 1 and no complex multiplication. Which of the following statements is most likely to be true regarding the cohomology of E and Shimura varieties?\n\nA) The cohomology of E will definitely appear in the \u00e9tale cohomology of the Hilbert modular surface associated with F.\n\nB) The cohomology of E will not appear in any Shimura variety associated with GL(2) or its inner forms over F, but may appear in other types of Shimura varieties.\n\nC) The cohomology of E will certainly appear in the cohomology of some Shimura curve associated with a quaternion algebra over F.\n\nD) The cohomology of E is guaranteed to appear in the cohomology of at least one Shimura variety, as this is true for all algebraic varieties over number fields.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most likely to be correct based on the information provided. The passage suggests that the cohomology of E (or its Tate module) should not appear as a subquotient of the \u00e9tale cohomology of Shimura varieties associated with GL(2) or its inner forms over F. This rules out options A and C. \n\nOption D is likely too strong a statement, as the passage indicates that there's doubt about whether the cohomology of all algebraic varieties over number fields appears in Shimura varieties (point 4 in the \"programme\" is questioned).\n\nOption B allows for the possibility that E's cohomology might appear in some other type of Shimura variety, while acknowledging the stated limitations regarding GL(2)-associated varieties. This aligns with the uncertainty expressed in the passage and the suggestion that there might be other Shimura varieties (like the one mentioned by Shimura involving the product of two upper half planes) where E's cohomology could potentially appear."

Tachometer\n\nCould I simply use a logic level MOSFET to do the following?  \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/T3muo.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/T3muo.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can just plug it in, the connectors are designed to be compatible.\nthe fan will only run at full speed, that may or may not be a problem.\n\nif you want variable speed that's obviously not a suitable solution.\n\nusing the PWM signal (which is is probably only 0\\-3\\.3V) to switch a mosfet probably won't work well, and if it does work the fan will tend to stick on some harmonic of the PWM frequency instead of following the PWM ratio.\n\na better approach is is to use the PWM signal to control the set\\-point of a voltage regulator and use the regulator output to power the fan, thus controlling it speed.\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0fNxd.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f0fNxd.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nhere I show the potentiometer on a typical adjustable ~~lm2958~~ LM2956 buck converter module and then the same module with the potentiometer replaced with a PWM control circuit. it works by the PWM controlling the discharge speed of C2 and thus the bias given to feedback signal.\n\nC1\\-R5 compensate for the low\\-pass formed by the presence of C2"

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A computer enthusiast wants to control the speed of a 3-pin fan using a 4-pin motherboard header. Which of the following solutions is most appropriate and why?\n\nA) Directly plug the 3-pin fan into the 4-pin header. This will work but the fan will only run at full speed.\n\nB) Use a MOSFET to directly switch the 12V supply to the fan based on the PWM signal from the motherboard.\n\nC) Use the PWM signal to control the set-point of a voltage regulator, which then powers the fan.\n\nD) Convert the 4-pin header to a 3-pin header by removing the PWM pin.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate solution for several reasons:\n\n1. Option A, while physically compatible, doesn't allow for speed control, which is the main goal.\n\n2. Option B (using a MOSFET directly) is problematic because:\n   - The PWM signal (likely 0-3.3V) may not be suitable for directly switching a MOSFET.\n   - Even if it works, the fan may stick to harmonics of the PWM frequency instead of following the desired speed curve.\n\n3. Option C solves these issues by using the PWM signal to control a voltage regulator. This approach:\n   - Properly handles the low-voltage PWM signal\n   - Provides smooth speed control without harmonic issues\n   - Can be implemented using common components like an adjustable buck converter (e.g., LM2956)\n\n4. Option D would remove the ability to control the fan speed entirely, defeating the purpose of the modification.\n\nThe correct solution (C) allows for proper speed control of the 3-pin fan using the 4-pin motherboard header, addressing the limitations of the other options and meeting the enthusiast's goal."

The **`nm`** utility is used to find symbols in an object file or executable. On most systems, **`ldd`** (`otool` on macOS) shows the shared libraries used by an executable. For the former, for example, I have a script ([*`listused.sh`*](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/master/test/listused.sh)) in ncurses which lists all of the symbols in its libraries and whether those are testable by a program using the libraries (see [report](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/ab10836a5884f5ca9a8c09110ce7486a9cbad9ec/test/README#L74) in [**`test/README`**](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/ncurses-snapshots/blob/master/test/README)).\n\nThe `-C` option is useful (if you're interested in C\\+\\+ libraries), but the libraries may be *stripped* (lacking debugging information). However, the **`-D`** option (available on \"recent\" systems, e.g., almost anything updated in the past 10\\-15 years) provides symbols for *dynamic* libraries:\n\n* [GNU binutils](https://github.com/gittup/binutils/blob/252b5132c753830d5fd56823373aed85f2a0db63/binutils/nm.1), since 1999\n\n> Display the dynamic symbols rather than the normal symbols.

This is the symbol table used by ld.so.1 and is present even in stripped dynamic executables. If **`\u2013D`** is not specified, the default behavior is to display the `SHT_SYMTAB` symbol information.\n\nThis is not a feature of less recent systems, at least according to their documentation:\n\n* [AIX](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_71/n_commands/nm.html)\n* [HP\\-UX](https://nixdoc.net/man-pages/HP-UX/man1/nm.1.html)\n\n(someone might know offhand the timeline for introducing the feature).\n\nI've used the feature in a few scripts such as [`analyze-curses-symbols`](https://invisible-island.net/scripts/readme.html#item:analyze-curses-symbols).\n\nFurther reading:\n\n* [Shared Library Symbol Conflicts (on Linux)](https://holtstrom.com/michael/blog/post/437/Shared-Library-Symbol-Conflicts-%28on-Linux%29.html)  provides examples showing how to use `nm` for this purpose.\n* [Chapter 3\\. Using Dynamic Shared Objects](http://csweb.cs.wfu.edu/%7Etorgerse/Kokua/More_SGI/007-2360-010/sgi_html/ch03.html) from an old SGI manual mentions that `elfdump` has a relevant option:\n\n> If you use the \\-quickstart\\_info option, ld tells you if conflicts arise. It also tells you to run elfdump with the \\-Dc option to find the conflicts.

Not hide them completely, but just make it a bit more obvious that their `__init__` functions aren't part of the public interface, even though their methods are.\n\nFrom the user perspective, it seems it would be logical for the classes to be in a separate module. So you call `myModule.make_object(10)` and get an object of type `myModule.objects.Foo`.\n\nHowever, from a readability / maintainability perspective this would cause me a headache, because module namespaces are tied to the files they're in. I'd have to keep cross\\-referencing between two files, one containing the classes and the other containing the functions that create them. This wouldn't be a logical structure for my project, and I want to avoid it.\n\n**Edit**: to be clear, I'm not talking about cyclic dependencies \\- the classes `Foo` and `Bar` don't call `create_object`. I just mean that if the factory functions are in one file and the classes are in another, then in order to understand how my code works, future\\-me will have to first look up `create_object` in one file, and then find the constructors it calls in a different file. There are many classes and many factory functions, so this would have to be done a lot. I find this sort of jumping back and forth taxes my short\\-term memory unnecessarily, and generally makes things harder to understand. I'd prefer to have a single file, containing square and rectangle classes, followed by functions that create squares and rectangles, followed by circle and ellipse classes, followed by functions that create those, etc.\n\nSo I guess my questions are: \n\n(1\\) Is there a way to create the `objects` module without having a separate file for it? I know I can create a module by instantiating `types.ModuleType`, but I can't work out how to declare the classes to be in the new module.\n\n(2\\) Assuming I can solve (1\\), would that actually be a sensible thing to do?\n\n(3\\) Or am I thinking about this the wrong way somehow? What would be the standard way to solve this issue in Python?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't think it's sensible to separate the classes from builder if this causes cross\\-references (and probably cyclic imports to solve). If your goal is simply to expose what is meant to be public or private there are better ways to explicit that.\n\nThe easiest I can think of is to have your module structured as follow :\n\n```\nmylib\n|-- __init__.py\n|-- objects.py\n\n```\n\nWhere `objects.py` is exactly what you already have and `__init__.py` simply does:\n\n```\nfrom .objects import create_object\n\n```\n\nSo if a user imports `mylib` the only available symbols in it will be the public API.\n\nIf there are many functions like `create_object` following naming convention, you can automate their import into `__init__.py` by including something like the following in `__init__.py`:\n\n```\nimport objects\nimport inspect\nimport sys\n\ncurrent_module = sys.modules[__name__]\ncreate_functions = [(name, func) for (name, func) in inspect.getmembers(objects, inspect.isfunction)\n                    if name.startswith('create_')]\n\nfor name, func in create_functions:\n    setattr(current_module, name, func)\n\n```"

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Python developer is creating a library with various object classes, but wants to prevent users from directly instantiating these classes. Instead, they want to provide factory functions to create objects. Which of the following approaches best addresses the developer's concerns about separating the interface from implementation while maintaining code readability and avoiding unnecessary file separation?\n\nA) Create separate files for classes and factory functions, using cyclic imports to resolve dependencies.\n\nB) Use a single file for both classes and factory functions, and rely on naming conventions (e.g., prefixing private methods with an underscore) to indicate which parts are not meant for direct use.\n\nC) Create a separate `objects` module using `types.ModuleType` and declare all classes within this new module.\n\nD) Use a single file for classes and factory functions, but create an `__init__.py` file that only exposes the factory functions, effectively hiding the classes from direct instantiation.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D provides the best solution to the developer's requirements. By using a single file (`objects.py`) for both classes and factory functions, it maintains code readability and avoids the need to cross-reference between multiple files. The `__init__.py` file can then be used to selectively expose only the factory functions, which becomes the public API for the module. This approach effectively hides the classes from direct instantiation by users while keeping the implementation details in a single, manageable file. It also allows for easy automation of importing multiple factory functions using the provided code snippet in the `__init__.py` file.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it introduces unnecessary complexity and potential cyclic import issues. Option B doesn't sufficiently hide the classes from direct instantiation. Option C, while creative, is more complex than necessary and doesn't align with standard Python practices for module organization."

Originally they were constructed by hand, but they also arise naturally in the real life, that is, theory of dynamical systems. (See, for example, this [http://www.math.cornell.edu/\\~hubbard/pendulum.pdf](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hubbard/pendulum.pdf) paper of John Hubbard.)\n\nFrom dynamical construction it is clear that one can have a homeomorphism that permutes the lakes. For example, this expository paper [http://www.ams.org/notices/200601/fea\\-coudene.pdf](http://www.ams.org/notices/200601/fea-coudene.pdf) gives such a homeomorphism (in fact, a diffeomorphism) for lakes on the sphere $S^2$. The dynamics on the boundary of the lakes is chaotic. \n\n\\=\\=\n\nQuestion 1: Let $U\\_1$, $U\\_2$ and $U\\_3$ be open subset of $\\\\mathbb R^d$ with common boundary $C$. Assume that each $U\\_i$ is an image of an injective continuous map $\\\\mathbb R^d\\\\to\\\\mathbb R^d$. Is there a homeomorphism of $\\\\mathbb R^d$ that permutes open sets $U\\_i$ and is identity on $C$?\n\nQuestion 2: Let $U\\_i\\\\subset \\\\mathbb R^d$, $i\\\\in \\\\mathbb Z$, be a disjoint collection of open sets each of which is homeomorphic to $\\\\mathbb R^d$. Is there a homeomorphism of $\\\\mathbb R^d$ that satisfies the following\n\n* $h$ maps $U\\_i$ onto $U\\_{i\\+1}$\n* every point in $\\\\partial U\\_i$ is periodic under $h$\n\n\\=\\=\n\n**Edit:** Below Andr\u00e9 Henriques has produced two examples when such a homeomorphism does not exist. Both examples make use of some local structure that cannot be permuted. It is still not clear what happens for \"abstact Wada Lakes\": are these examples exceptions or arbitrary Wada Lakes cannot be permuted as well? \n\n**Edit2** (Jan. 9th 2012\\) \n\n* In is clear now that there is no such homeomorphism if the dimension $d\\=2$. (See the comments below).\n* The answer to Q1 is also negative in higher dimension as explained in the reference given by Andres Koropecki.\n* For $d\\\\ge 3$ there are examples by Andr\u00e9 Henriques of open sets for which one cannot find such a homeomorphism. In general, Question 2 is still open.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In dimension 2, the answer is also \"no\".\n\nRecall the classical construction of the [Wada lakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lakes_of_Wada.jpg).\nIn the linked picture, one sees little \"straits\" connecting the red/blue/green regions at stage $n$ with the extra windy strip that is added at stage $n\\+3$. For example, one sees a blue strait roughly in the middle of the picture, and a red strait (barely visible) on the upper left part. The location of these straights are free parameters in the construction of the Wada lakes.\n\n---\n\nNow I proceed to construct the desired counterexample.\nLet $P$ be a point on the boundary of the yet\\-to\\-be\\-constructed Wada lakes. And let $U$ be a fixed ball around $P$.\nThe straights can be picked so that:\n\n* The blue straights forms a converging sequence with limit point $P$.\n* The red and green straights all lie outside $U$.\n\nIn that case, there is no homeomorphism of $\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ fixing $P$, and exchanging the blue lake with a lake of another color. The reason is the following:\n\n* There exist arbitrarily small neighborhoods $V$ of $P$ such that all connected components of Red\\-Lake $\\\\cap V$ and Green\\-Lake $\\\\cap V$ intersect $\\\\partial V$ in exactly two intervals (taking $V$ be a metric ball will do).\n* For every sufficiently small neighborhood $V$ of $P$, there exist connected components of\nBlue\\-Lake $\\\\cap V$ that intersect $\\\\partial V$ in at least three intervals (the components containing the straights)."

The provided counterexample demonstrates that for carefully constructed Wada lakes, there are topological differences in how the lakes intersect with small neighborhoods around certain boundary points. Specifically, for a chosen point P on the boundary:\n\n1) The blue lake can be constructed to have straits forming a converging sequence to P.\n2) The red and green lakes can be constructed to have no straits near P.\n\nThis creates a situation where:\n- Small neighborhoods of P intersect the blue lake in components with at least three intervals on the neighborhood's boundary.\n- Similar neighborhoods intersect the red and green lakes in components with exactly two intervals on the boundary.\n\nThese topological differences cannot be preserved under a homeomorphism that would exchange the lakes. Therefore, such a homeomorphism cannot exist in this case, proving that it's not always possible for Wada lakes in R^2."

The texts I am reading avoid this by proving Con(T \\+ CH) for all (suitable) finite fragments T of ZFC using the Reflection principle to prove the existence of a countable transitive model of T. But doesn't the Reflection principle operate outside of ZFC? From what I understand it just shows how, given a list of axioms of ZFC, one can write down a proof that constructs a model of these axioms.\nAm I confused here or is there an other way to achieve this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The reflection principle is a theorem scheme; each of its instances is provable in ZFC. \n\nThe following proof works entirely in ZFC:\n\n1. Assume Con(ZFC) together with not\\-Con(ZFC\\+non\\-CH) and aim for a contradiction.\n2. By assumption plus completeness theorem, there is a model (M,E) of ZFC. M may be nonstandard in the sense that its ordinals (even its natural numbers) are not well\\-founded.\n3. By compactness, there is some finite sub theory ZFC\\* of ZFC such that ZFC\\*\\+non\\-CH is inconsistent.\n4. Find a (slightly larger) finite sub theory ZFC\\*\\* of ZFC such that ZFC\\*\\* proves all theorems you need about forcing, including that ZFC\\* plus non\\-CH holds in the extension.\n5. (M,E) satisfies reflection for ZFC\\*\\* , so there is some x in M which M thinks is a ctm (countable transitive model) of ZFC\\*\\* . So M can find a Cohen extension y of x which satisfies ZFC\\* plus non\\-CH.\n6. By the easy direction of the completeness theorem, M therefore thinks that ZFC\\*\\+non\\-CH is consistent.\n7. But then this theory is really consistent. (Because any proof of an inconsistency would be coded by a natural number, which is represented in M.)\n\nBtw, I think the sketch I just gave is not ideal since it seems to rely on the existence of infinite sets. The implication from Con(ZFC) to Con(ZFC\\+non\\-CH) can really be shown in ZF minus infinity, or even in a weak version of Peano arithmetic."

The documentation explains that the Reflection Principle is a theorem scheme, with each of its instances being provable in ZFC. The proof outlined in the answer demonstrates that it's possible to prove Con(ZFC) \u2192 Con(ZFC + \u00acCH) entirely within ZFC, without needing to assume the existence of a countable transitive model or using any principles outside of ZFC. The proof uses the Reflection Principle as a theorem within ZFC, not as an external axiom. This approach avoids the need for an actual countable transitive model, instead working with what the model M \"thinks\" is a countable transitive model. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they either mischaracterize the role of the Reflection Principle, incorrectly state the need for constructions outside of ZFC, or wrongly claim that the implication doesn't hold."

C., \\& Steyvers, M. (2013\\). Choosing a strictly proper scoring rule. Decision Analysis, 10(4\\), 292\\-304](http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/papers/MerkleSteyvers.pdf)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is appropriate to use an improper scoring rule when the purpose is actually forecasting, but not inference. I don't really care whether another forecaster is cheating or not when I am the one who is going to be doing the forecast.\n\nProper scoring rules ensure that during estimation process the model approaches the true data generating process (DGP). This sounds promising because as we approach the true DGP we will be also doing good in terms of forecasting under any loss function. The catch is that most of the time (actually in reality almost always) our model search space doesn't contain the true DGP. We end up approximating the true DGP with some functional form that we propose.\n\nIn this more realistic setting, if our forecasting task is easier than to figure out the entire density of the true DGP we may actually do better. This is especially true for classification. For example the true DGP can be very complex but the classification task can be very easy. \n\nYaroslav Bulatov provided the following example in his blog:\n\n[http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.ro/2007/06/log\\-loss\\-or\\-hinge\\-loss.html](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.ro/2007/06/log-loss-or-hinge-loss.html)\n\nAs you can see below the true density is wiggly but it is very easy to build a classifier to separate data generated by this into two classes. Simply if $x \\\\ge 0$ output class 1, and if $x \\< 0$ output class 2\\.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2lQ2.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2lQ2.gif)\n\nInstead of matching the exact density above we propose the below crude model, which is quite far from the true DGP. However it does perfect classification. This is found by using hinge loss, which is not proper.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X72m.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X72m.gif)\n\nOn the other hand if you decide to find the true DGP with log\\-loss (which is proper) then you start fitting some functionals, as you don't know what the exact functional form you need a priori. But as you try harder and harder to match it, you start misclassifying things.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNXOV.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNXOV.gif)\n\nNote that in both cases we used the same functional forms. In the improper loss case it degenerated into a step function which in turn did perfect classification. In the proper case it went berserk trying to satisfy every region of the density. \n\nBasically we don't always need to achieve the true model to have accurate forecasts. Or sometimes we don't really need to do good on the entire domain of the density, but be very good only on certain parts of it."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is developing a classification model for a complex dataset. The true data generating process (DGP) is highly intricate, but the classification task itself is relatively straightforward. Which of the following approaches would likely yield the best classification performance?\n\nA) Use a proper scoring rule like log-loss to closely approximate the true DGP\nB) Employ an improper scoring rule such as hinge loss to focus on the classification boundary\nC) Always use a proper scoring rule to ensure honest forecasting\nD) Avoid both proper and improper scoring rules in classification tasks\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. In this scenario, an improper scoring rule like hinge loss would likely yield better classification performance. The key insights from the documentation are:\n\n1. Proper scoring rules aim to approximate the true data generating process (DGP), which is not always necessary for good classification.\n2. When the true DGP is complex but the classification task is simple, focusing on the decision boundary (as improper rules often do) can be more effective.\n3. The example provided shows that using hinge loss (an improper rule) resulted in perfect classification, while log-loss (a proper rule) led to misclassifications as it tried to match the entire density.\n4. For pure classification tasks, accurately modeling the entire probability distribution isn't always necessary or beneficial.\n\nOption A is incorrect because closely approximating a complex DGP may lead to overfitting and poorer classification performance.\nOption C is incorrect because, while proper scoring rules have advantages in some contexts, they are not always the best choice for classification tasks.\nOption D is incorrect as scoring rules, both proper and improper, have their place in machine learning and shouldn't be universally avoided."

Because English is not my first language (Spanish is), I'd like some help making sure I index these correctly. \n\nFor example, in my index, should I use:\n\n* ***Description of the project*** or ***Project Description***\n* ***Benefits of this proposal*** or ***Proposal benefits***\n* ***Preliminary schedule of the project*** or just ***Preliminary schedule***\n\nAre there any rules or guidelines that would help me know the best way to set up my index for entries that could be listed in more than one way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a general rule, for section headers, I would favor the briefer forms, such as: *Project Description, Project Justification, Project Scope, Benefits, Project Deliverables, Preliminary Schedule*, etc. \n\nIn an actual sentence, though, either form could be used; for example, either \"Here is the preliminary schedule for this project\" or \"Here is the project's preliminary schedule\" would be acceptable.\n\nIn an index, you need to take a best guess as to which word the readers will look for when they want to find the information. I would avoid starting any index entry with \"Project\", as your index would be flooded with entries under the letter P. Instead, I would use a form like this:\n\n> **D**  \n> \n>  Deliverables for the project  \n> \n>  :  \n> \n> **S**  \n> \n>  Schedule for the project, detailed  \n> \n>  Schedule for the project, preliminary\n\nIt's not uncommon for an index to list multiple forms for an entry, but usually the page number is only given in one place (this makes the index easier to maintain should new information be added). So, you might consider using something like this, if you feel it would enhance the usability of the index:\n\n> **P**  \n> \n>  Project Deliverables: see *Deliverables for the project*"

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When creating an index for a formal work proposal, which of the following approaches is most appropriate and efficient?\n\nA) List all entries starting with \"Project\" to maintain consistency throughout the index.\n\nB) Use longer, more descriptive phrases for each entry, such as \"Description of the project\" and \"Preliminary schedule of the project\".\n\nC) Organize entries by their most relevant keyword, avoiding overuse of general terms like \"Project\", and use cross-references when necessary.\n\nD) Always use the shortest possible form for each entry, such as \"Description\" instead of \"Project Description\".\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate and efficient approach for creating an index in a formal work proposal is to organize entries by their most relevant keyword, avoiding overuse of general terms like \"Project\", and use cross-references when necessary. This method helps readers quickly locate information and prevents the index from being overwhelmed with entries under a single letter (like \"P\" for \"Project\"). \n\nOption A is incorrect because it would lead to an overcrowded and less useful index under the letter \"P\". Option B, while descriptive, can make the index unnecessarily long and harder to navigate. Option D, while favoring brevity, might not provide enough context for readers to easily find the information they need.\n\nThe correct approach (C) aligns with the advice given in the documentation, which suggests entries like \"Deliverables for the project\" and \"Schedule for the project, preliminary\" instead of starting everything with \"Project\". It also recommends using cross-references (e.g., \"Project Deliverables: see Deliverables for the project\") to help users find information under multiple possible entry points."

This will draw 9 A from the 220 V, so 1980 W.\n\nThis will be great force electromagnetic but the problem is this: the 21 gauge can only withstand 1\\.2 A maximum; to avoid getting maximum current I need to make the resistance 183 \u03a9, which means about 3 km of wire!\n\nAnd this will cause less force because the current now is 1\\.2 A; calculating other gauges in the same manner will result in this too\\-long length.\n\nIs my calculation wrong, or is the reality not like the theory, or what?\n\nHow to make a solenoid coil that can connect to 220 V safely, and the gauge?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It\u2019s probably not a capacitor, but a transient voltage suppressor (TVS).

The documentation indicates that the component is likely a transient voltage suppressor (TVS), specifically a metallic oxide varistor (MOV). Its purpose is to protect the power supply from high-voltage spikes. Replacing it with an exact match is important to maintain this protection. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it misidentifies the component as a capacitor and wrongly suggests it can be safely removed. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the component is essential for protection against voltage spikes, and removing it would make the power supply more vulnerable to damage.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation suggests that if the MOV is damaged, other components downstream, such as input filter capacitors, may also be affected and should be checked for damage."

Out of these, one band (suffixed as \\_maxcorr) is actually not computed by the servers but still exists in the output as a GLCM band with all zero pixel values. \n\nThis \\_maxcorr band creates a problem when band\\-wise normalization of the image composite is attempted by the unitScale() function as this function requires min value to be less than the max value.\n\nHow to tackle this issue? \n\nI thought of two possibilities:\n\nPrevent glcmTexture() from generating the \"\\_maxcorr\" band\nOR\nRemove \"\\_maxcorr\" band before input to unitScale() function\n\nHow to remove a specific band from an image in GEE?\nTrying reverse by using .select() function is not feasible as there are hundreds of other bands in the composite that need to be selected.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In order to remove particular bands from an image, you can take the image's `bandNames`, `filter` that list to only the bands you want, and `select` those bands from the image:\n\n```js\nfunction removeMaxCorr(glcmImage) {\n  return glcmImage.select(\n    glcmImage.bandNames().filter(\n      ee.Filter.stringEndsWith('item', '_maxcorr').not()));\n}\n\nMap.addLayer(removeMaxCorr(myImage.glcmTexture()));\n\n```\n\n(The pseudo\\-property name 'item' is [the name used to refer to the value of a `List` item that isn't a feature with its own properties](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-list-filter) \u2014 here, a string.)."

This function uses the image's bandNames() method to get a list of all bands, then applies a filter to exclude any band names ending with '_maxcorr'. The resulting list of band names is then used to select only those bands from the original image, effectively removing the '_maxcorr' band.\n\nOption A incorrectly selects all bands, not removing any.\nOption C would actually select only the '_maxcorr' band instead of removing it.\nOption D attempts to remove the band name from the list of band names, but doesn't actually modify the image itself."

Could it be that the Brazilian phrase is a translation from American English or is there some earlier origin from Latin, Greek, mythology, etc? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For hundreds of years, in English and no doubt in other languages, flies have been cited metaphorically in connection with the idea of enjoying unseen intimacy or intelligence. Thus for example, in [*Romeo and Juliet*](http://books.google.com/books?id=c1MrAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA148&dq=%22In+carrion+flies%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=k4WPU7W-HI_6oAT484HADA&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22In%20carrion%20flies%22&f=false) (by 1595\\) we have this (in an 1821 edition):\n\n> *Romeo*.

Then I waits an hour, an' out she comes with the little kids, kissin' 'em, an' the biggest little kid arsks 'er 'er nime! If she didn't know 'im, why did she kiss 'im? An' before we'd got to the corner out comes the lean 'un, lookin' like a bloomin' corpse. Something must 'ave 'appened in that old 'ouse, an' I'll keep a lookout in the People and see wot it was. I'd like to 'ave been **a fly on the wall** during that there interview, I would. **A fly on the wall** with a tiste for short'and.\"\n\nSo we have five instances of \"a fly on the wall\" used in the modern idiomatic sense in the space of 52 years, all in novels by female writers\u2014the first English, the next American, the third probably American but with a special interest in Germany, the fourth Anglo\\-Indian (but living in England when she wrote her book), and the fifth American. This is not an especially random\\-looking group of sources.\n\nThereafter, Google Books finds matches from [1915](http://books.google.com/books?id=FUkgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA183&dq=%22a+fly+on+the+wall%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bXSPU5CiGYf1oASNo4F4&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22a%20fly%20on%20the%20wall%22&f=false), [1916](http://books.google.com/books?id=u-8WAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA366&dq=%22a+fly+on+the+wall%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bXSPU5CiGYf1oASNo4F4&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22a%20fly%20on%20the%20wall%22&f=false), and [1930](http://books.google.com/books?id=CgQU09UDVaIC&pg=PA10&dq=%22a+fly+on+the+wall%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bXSPU5CiGYf1oASNo4F4&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22a%20fly%20on%20the%20wall%22&f=false), and then seven unique instances during the period from 1945 through1947\\.\n\nWhether Julia Stretton is directly responsible for popularizing the notion of being \"a fly on the wall\" in order to gather information or witness a private scene is difficult to determine; but it seems fair to say that the six English and American women cited above whose relevant novels appeared between 1855 and 1907 almost certainly deserve credit for popularizing (in English) that wording for a very old idea."

How does it emerge from the Standard Model?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not accidental, at least in the sense that this term is used.\n\nThe accidental symmetry is the symmetry that is forced on you by the renormalizability \\- i.e. for a given field set you can't write the interaction that would violate such symmetry. On the other hand nonrenormalizable interactions or renormalizable interactions with extra fields (these two options are related) may violate symmetry. The example is the baryonic number conservation which is easily violated in many extensions of the standard model.\n\nOn the other hand the lepton universality is the property of the non\\-abelian gauge invariance. In qft the non\\-abelian gauge interaction is determined solely by the representation of the field and the coupling constant, common for all the fields. I.e. you can't have $SU(2\\)$ doublet interacting with $W$ boson 1% stronger than another doublet.\n\nOf course this constraint is weaker for $U(1\\)$ interaction, such as hypercharge field. But if you change somewhat $Y$ for some lepton, this may ruin the gauge invariance of the mass terms and the triangle anomaly cancellation."

The coupling strength for these interactions is determined solely by the representation of the field and a common coupling constant, making it impossible for different leptons to interact differently with gauge bosons like the W boson. This universality is a direct consequence of the gauge structure of the theory, not an accidental feature arising from renormalizability constraints. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they mischaracterize the nature and origin of Lepton Flavour Universality in the Standard Model."

I've contributed some fixes to the origin (such as working around canvas rendering limitations on low\\-memory devices), but I've also added in a bunch of functionality that I wanted in the software, such as:\n\n1. `viewMode: 4`: When the image is rotated, it scales so that the entire image is always visible inside the container. The cropBox is also always constrained within the *image*, rather than just the *canvas*.\n2. `getCroppedCanvas` tiling: The ability to tile (eg: duplicate matrix\\-style) the cropped image on a canvas.\n\nHowever, the original author does not want to merge in this new functionality because he wants to keep his original plugin as simple as possible.\n\nI've tried negotiating and bargaining, but am just getting ignored.\n\nSo, I've resigned myself to the fact that I'm going to continue to maintain this public fork. Not ideal, but I really want that other functionality.

Now that I'm updating/maintaining what is effectively a new version, how do I correctly give attribution to the original author? I know that I'm effectively working on a new version that is my own, but it's based on a foundation that was authored by someone else.\n2. Is it ok to masquerade as if this new fork is totally mine? eg: Replace links to the github.io page for the original project to my own in my forked README? It sort of feels wrong to not link back to the original, but the github.io has demos on it, and I'd like to demo the new functionality I'm putting in.\n3. Is there any part of a repo, be it the README.md, the site etc that I should totally replace with my own work to make it more...appropriately mine?\n4. Should I change the licence wording to remove the original Author's name, and replace it with mine?\n\nBasically, it doesn't feel like the fork is mine, even though all the new work is my own.\nI don't want to pi$$ anyone off, and the original work was really good.\n\nI'd appreciate any guidance that people can offer so that I do the right thing, which is all I want to do, really.\n\n**Update**  \n\nHere's what I did in the end <https://github.com/OddPrints/cropper> :\n\n1. Added the Credit and Why the Fork? sections plus the mention under the main blockquote.\n2. Follow the Website link \\- linked back to the original author as much as possible including in the jumbotron and header/footer menus, but still re\\-themed the site.\n3.

He was discussing the very peculiar phenomena of dropping an oversized slinky and watching as the bottom of the slinky remains suspended in mid air. Tyson goes onto explain that the bottom of the slinky simply does not know to fall until the arrival of the top which carries information of the gravitational force \\- it is essentially oblivious to the gravity exerted on it (I may be butchering his more eloquent explanation a bit).\n\nI have more recently heard a somewhat simpler (and for easier to accept) explanation regarding the fact that the spring is constantly applying an elastic force on the bottom of the spring to keep it suspended. I suppose this would even delay the decent of rigid objects to a very subtle degree since there is always some elasticity?\n\nSeeing as the former explanation is some what more grand and makes for a better story, I would like to confirm which of these holds more weight.\n\nI have already done a bit of searching on this site and understand that gravity is limited by the speed of light, but I do not believe that this is necessarily applicable here, so as far as I know this question has not been tackled here as of yet.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You probably confused what he was saying a bit. The information that the bottom of the slinky is waiting for is the information that the top of the slinky is no longer supported. This travels down the slinky as the higher bits fall down and no longer exert a force (tension) supporting the lower bits.\n\nIncidentally in other circumstances the speed of gravity (which travels at the same speed as light) is significant. The standard example is if someone stole the sun it would take 8 minutes for that information to get to us. The light from the sun and the sudden lack of it's gravity would both take about 8 minutes to get here. In the intervening 8 minutes we would continue to orbit the place the sun used to be as normal."

What best explains why the bottom of the slinky appears to hover momentarily before falling?\n\nA) The bottom of the slinky is waiting for information about gravity to reach it from the top of the slinky.\n\nB) The elastic force of the spring is exactly counteracting gravity on the bottom of the slinky until the top section collapses.\n\nC) The speed of gravity is limited, causing a delay in the gravitational effect reaching the bottom of the slinky.\n\nD) The bottom of the slinky is waiting for information that the top is no longer supported, which travels down the slinky as tension changes.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The bottom of the slinky appears to hover because it's waiting for the information that the top is no longer supported. This information travels down the slinky as the tension changes, not as gravity itself propagates. Answer A is incorrect because gravity is already acting on all parts of the slinky; it's not waiting for gravitational information. B is partially true but oversimplified; it doesn't explain the propagation effect. C is incorrect because while the speed of gravity is indeed limited (to the speed of light), this isn't relevant to the slinky phenomenon on Earth's surface. The effect is due to the propagation of force through the slinky material, not the speed of gravity itself."

Whitney's condition (b) is usually defined using local coordinates and specifically the notion of convergence in the usual Euclidean topology.\n\nIt turns out that if $M$ is a nonsingular complex algebraic variety and $S$ is a subvariety, then there is a canonical Whitney stratification of $S$ whose strata are nonsingular algebraic sets.\n\nMy question is: in the complex algebraic category, can one define the notion of Whitney stratifications using only commutative algebra?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a purely algebraic characterisation of Condition (B) due to Le and Teissier, see Proposition 1\\.3\\.8 of the paper\n\n*L\u00ea D\u0169ng Tr\u00e1ng; Teissier, Bernard*, [**Limites d\u2019espaces tangents en g\u00e9om\u00e9trie analytique.

[ZBL0658\\.32010](https://zbmath.org/?q=an:0658.32010)..\n\nHere's a summary. Assume that $X$ is a complex algebraic variety (embedded in $\\\\mathbb{C}^n$ if affine or $\\\\mathbb{P}^n$ if projective) and that $Y \\\\subset X$ is a smooth quasiprojective subvariety. Then the pair $(X\\_\\\\text{reg},Y)$ satisfies Condition (B) if and only if there is a containment of ideals $$I\\[\\\\textbf{Con}(X) \\\\cap \\\\textbf{Con}(Y)] \\\\subset \\\\overline{I}\\[\\\\kappa\\_X^{\\-1}(Y)]$$\n\nSome explanation: here $I\\[Z]$ means the generating ideal of $Z$, while $\\\\textbf{Con}(X)$ is the conormal variety of $X$ and $\\\\kappa\\_X:\\\\textbf{Con}(X) \\\\to X$ is the conormal map. The bar on the right side here denotes *integral closure*.

The Le-Teissier criterion states that for a complex algebraic variety X and a smooth quasiprojective subvariety Y, the pair (X_reg, Y) satisfies Whitney's condition (B) if and only if there is a containment of ideals I[Con(X) \u2229 Con(Y)] \u2282 I[\u03ba_X^(-1)(Y)], where the bar over the right-hand side denotes integral closure of the ideal. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the characterization does involve integral closure of ideals. \n\nAnswer B is close but misses the crucial aspect of integral closure on the right-hand side of the containment. \n\nAnswer C overstates the case; while the characterization is algebraic, it doesn't completely eliminate geometric intuition, as concepts like conormal varieties are still geometrically motivated. \n\nD correctly captures the algebraic characterization as presented in the Le-Teissier criterion, including the important detail of integral closure."

However, many guides have been telling me to use two generators, such as crippling wave for AOE damage and FoT for single target. What about the other two? \n\nI just do not understand how the system works, because it's not like I can level up CW/FoT to a higher rank every level.\n\nThe same question applies to runes.

You can attach a single rune to each of these skills at a time. You can change skills and runes at any time, including in combat, but doing so triggers a cooldown on that slot. You may choose any skill for any slot, if you have Elective Mode enabled in the games options.\n\nGetting used to changing skills often is ill advised as at end\\-game doing so is penalised heavily in the form of resetting a buff you gain called Nephalem's Valor which improves the number and quality of drops you obtain through your game session.

It is asking for **translating C\\+\\+ code into Java**. In addition to this point, it is also a mix of low quality and lack of clarity.\n\nBecause of these reasons, I flagged the question for moderator attention:\n\n> This question is off\\-topic (translating C\\+\\+ code to Java), but I can't vote to close because it has a bounty on it.\n\nThe flag got declined with the following statement:\n\n> That doesn't make a question off\\-topic. Low quality perhaps but not explicitly off\\-topic\n\nI improved some of the formatting problems. But my question remains the same: Is asking for translating code from one language to another on\\-topic? \n\nIf there wasn't a bounty on the question, I would have closed it as off\\-topic or too broad (give me teh codez).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe this should be interpreted as follows: the moderator rejection reply says nothing about if the source question is off\\-topic or not; it is stating that the reason you provided (conversion from C\\+\\+ to Java) is not specific enough to validate asking for moderator intervention. That statement alone is not enough information for a moderator to act on, to begin with it does not prove that the question is off\\-topic. It is merely arguably a strong indicator that it is so.\n\nIf you flag for moderator intervention, you should make sure you are basically laying out the situation on a silver platter such that the required action can be understood without first having to study the source question. It helps to specifically state what moderator intervention is requested. Should the bounty be removed? Should the question be closed? Something else?\n\nTo provide a background to that interpretation, I have this other meta question in mind:\n\n[How should questions that contain links to an infected/virus page be flagged?](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293973/how-should-questions-that-contain-links-to-an-infected-virus-page-be-flagged)"

The documentation suggests that when flagging for moderator attention, users should provide very specific information and clearly state what action is requested. Simply stating that a question involves translating code isn't enough context for a moderator to act without further investigation. The flag should have detailed why the translation request made the question off-topic and explicitly stated what action was desired (e.g., removing the bounty and closing the question). \n\nOption A is incorrect because the moderator's response doesn't actually state an opinion on whether code translation questions are on-topic or not. \n\nOption C is incorrect because while the bounty does prevent normal close votes, moderators have the ability to refund bounties and close questions if warranted. \n\nOption D is plausible based on part of the moderator's comment, but it doesn't fully explain why the flag was declined. The key issue was the lack of specific information in the flag, not the moderator's assessment of the question quality."

The specs you should be most concerned with are the output voltage (12V) and current (no less than 850mA \\- more is ok)."

When connected to 120V, the output voltage would be reduced proportionally. We can estimate the output voltage using the ratio of input voltages: (120V / 220V) * 12V \u2248 6.5V DC. This lower voltage would cause the motor to underperform and potentially stall more easily, but it's unlikely to cause immediate damage to the adapter or motor. Options A and C are incorrect because the adapter is not designed for 120V input and won't work normally or burn out immediately.

It can either be set to SPI Motorola mode (0\\) or to SPI TI mode (1\\). (See the ARM reference manual page 695 [here](http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/REFERENCE_MANUAL/CD00225773.pdf).)\n\nThe datasheet of the SPI Flash (available [here](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CEIQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcatalog.gaw.ru%2Fproject%2Fdownload.php%3Fid%3D17019&ei=qEVjT4e1BYa48gP3z7iSCA&usg=AFQjCNGxHADH0jlYEafp0A31GarfzkfrFQ)) does not give indication regarding which mode I should use.\n\nWhat are the two different modes, and which should I use for the specific Flash chip I am using?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A brief glance at the ARM data sheet would suggest that the main difference between the TI mode and Motorola mode have to do with their handling of an output signal called SSPFSSOUT which many devices simply don't need. This signal is supposed to pulse high between bytes so as to indicate which bit of each byte should be considered the first. In TI mode, it goes high during the transmission of the last bit of a byte, while in Motorola mode it goes high and then low between bytes. The flash chip wants a chip\\-select signal which is held low for the entire duration of a transaction, so an output which goes high between bytes won't be useful for it.\n\nI would expect that even when SSPFSSOUT isn't used, Motorola mode would make data easier to read on a scope (since there would be a pause after every byte) but TI mode might be faster (since it wouldn't waste any time pausing between bytes). What's important, however, is to ensure that the sequence of signals the controller generates meets the requirements given in the peripherals' data sheet."

While Motorola mode is often more suitable for SPI Flash chips due to its handling of the chip select signal (which typically needs to be held low for the entire transaction), the key factor is meeting the timing requirements specified in the Flash chip's datasheet. Motorola mode may make data easier to read on a scope due to pauses between bytes, but TI mode could potentially be used if it satisfies the Flash chip's timing needs. The question emphasizes that the Flash chip's datasheet doesn't specify a required mode, so the most accurate answer acknowledges that either mode could work if it meets the chip's specifications, while noting Motorola mode's general suitability for this application."

Which of the following statements best describes the root cause and potential solution for this problem?\n\nA) The issue is primarily caused by Ubuntu's OS update, and reverting to Ubuntu 20.04 would resolve the problem completely.\n\nB) Firefox is the main culprit, and updating to the latest non-Snap version of Firefox would fix the issue without any drawbacks.\n\nC) The problem stems from Snap's containerization, which may cause incompatibilities with certain applications like Dropbox, and a long-term solution would involve developers adapting their software to work within Snap's constraints.\n\nD) Dropbox is solely responsible for the issue, and updating the Dropbox application would immediately resolve the problem for all users.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The problem is primarily related to Snap, a relatively new technology for package management in Ubuntu. Snap's containerization approach can lead to incompatibilities with some applications, including how Firefox interacts with Dropbox in this case. While workarounds exist (like installing Firefox without Snap), the long-term solution involves developers adapting their software to work within Snap's constraints or Snap itself evolving to better handle such interactions. This highlights the challenges that can arise when introducing new technologies in operating systems, even if they offer benefits in other areas."

The documentation suggests that if two accounts from the same location show a high correlation in voting patterns, especially if they frequently vote on each other's content, the system might flag this as potential vote fraud. In this case, the algorithm may have mistakenly concluded that both accounts belonged to the same person, leading to the deletion of one account as a preventive measure. This explanation aligns with the information provided about the colleague's occasional use, the shared workplace location, and the noticeable drop in the user's reputation due to lost votes from the deleted account."

Due to storage limitations, I want the repository to be empty initially and download packages once they are accessed.\n\n### Background\n\nI work a lot with local VMs. Anytime I create a new VM and install Fedora, a lot of packages are downloaded from the internet, and most of the downloaded packages are the same. To speed up the process I would like the RPMs to be cached on a server located on the same network.\n\nSimilar questions have been answered with a combination of `createrepo` \\& `reposync`. I do not like the `reposync` part, because I don't want to clone the whole repository up\u202ffront when I need only some of the packages.\n\n### Ideal Solution\n\nI would like the server on my local network to act as an RPM repository for my Fedora installations. It should pass\\-through the metadata from whatever is configured in `/etc/yum.repo.d/*`. The server should deliver the requested RPM if it is present in the local cache, or else download it and then deliver it.\n\nA less ambitious approach would be to configure a single RPM repository instead of `https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/...` and just use an http proxy.\n\n### Update: 02 Nov. 2015\n\nI already have an nginx running on the network, so I played around with a combination of `proxy_pass` and `proxy_cache`. It kinda works, but IMHO it has more drawbacks than benefits:\n\n* a separate configuration for every repo configured in `/etc/yum.repo.d/*`.\n* can't use `metadata` from `https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/` because of alternate mirrors.\n\nI dropped the nginx thing and installed `squid`, as suggested in comments. `squid` works great for me. With the `store_id_program` configuration, I am even able to use the alternate mirrors and still hit the cache, no matter where the RPM came from originally.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here you can find fine\\-tuned squid.conf for rpm caching:\n\n<https://github.com/spacewalkproject/spacewalk/blob/master/proxy/installer/squid.conf>\n\nYou just should modify memory and port setting."

A \"market rally\" refers to a period of increased trading activity and rising prices in financial markets, indicating a positive trend. The term \"peters out\" means to gradually diminish or come to an end. Therefore, when combined, this expression describes a situation where the market experiences a brief period of improvement or recovery (the rally), but this positive trend doesn't sustain itself and slowly fades away (peters out). This is different from a sudden crash (A), sustained growth (B), or wild fluctuations (D). The correct interpretation captures the essence of a temporary improvement that loses momentum over time."

Send a request to your API using: `=WEBSERVICE(\"http://example.com/v1/stuff\")` in eg. cell A1\n2. In cell A2 for example, add `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"rootProperty\";A1)+2;10)` (remember to change the separator characters (semicolons in my case) to match your locale in LibreOffice)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `MID()` will take a partial text from the full response\n* `SEARCH()` will look for the beginning index of the given text, eg. \"rootProperty\"\n* `+2` is the offset where to start reading the value (basically substring)\n* `10` is how many characters to read from the beginning of the text `SEARCH()` found (after the `+2` offset)\n\nSo if for example you get the following response in cell A1:\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": 12345678,\n  \"something\": \"Example\",\n  \"myThing\": \"Hello\",\n  \"another\": \"Not needed\"\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd your cell A2 has the formula: `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"myThing\";A1);13)`\n\nWhat the cell would have as value is: `myThing\": \"He`\nWhich is `13` characters starting from the first character in `myThing`, that you searched for in `SEARCH()`.\n\nSo obviously you wouldn't want to have the `myThing\": \"` part of it. To only get the value `Hello` from `myThing`, you would use this formula: `=MID(A1;SEARCH(\"myThing\";A1)+11;5)`.\n\nThis will:\n\n1. Find where `myThing` begins (caveat: if there's two instances of the string, you'll get the first one)\n2. Return 5 characters from the offset. So: `myThi`\n3. Then offsets the beginning to be from index `11` (the `+11` in the formula)\n4. So it skips the first 11 characters (`myThing\": \"`) and returns 5 characters from there on, which is `Hello`\n\nOf course, it's still fairly manual, but at least one workable way for simple things. Good luck!"

I understand that if I said just \"John and the director of my department went...\" \"THE\" would be necessary but does that change when stating the name also? \n\nSimilarly, do I need to put \"THE\" in this type of sentence:\n\n> **The** Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron announced changes in immigration policy.\n\nIf I don't need the definite article here then why so? Are the two examples equal? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can use them with or without an article, but the meaning is ever so slightly different. When you use them without the definite article, *THE*, then you are using an official title. Grammatically it is like a name, it's a Proper Noun. In this case you need to use capital letters for the title: *Managing Director*, for example.\n\nWhen you use the titles or positions without an article, that's just a description of the person's job. Its a bit like saying *I'm a teacher*. So we can say:\n\n* Managing Director of Leo LT, Kestutis Sliuzas ...\n\nor:\n\n* The managing director of Leo LT, Kestutis Sliuzas ...\n\nThe first is a title, the second a description. When we are using the second form we have the option to use capitals if we want to: *The Managing Director ...*\n\nIn the Original Poster's example:\n\n* John Smith and the director of my department Adam Gray went to a meeting yesterday.\n\nWe need to use the definite article here. The reason is that *the director of my department* is a description, not an official title. However if you wanted to use a title you could:\n\n* John Smith and Director of Marketing, Adam Gray, both attended the\nmeeting.\n\nThis is similar to how we use proper noun titles like *King* or common noun descriptions like *king*.\n\n* The king of my country is an idiot.\n* King of Spain, Felipe VI was asked yesterday ...\n\n*Hope his is helpful!*"

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the use of articles with titles or positions is correct?\n\nA) The definite article \"the\" must always be used before a person's title or position when it's followed by their name.\n\nB) When using an official title as a Proper Noun, it should be capitalized and used without \"the\", while a job description should use \"the\" and can be lowercase.\n\nC) There is no difference in meaning between using \"the\" before a title and omitting it; it's purely a matter of personal preference.\n\nD) Official titles should always be used with \"the\" to distinguish them from common nouns.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation explains that when using an official title as a Proper Noun, it should be capitalized and used without \"the\" (e.g., \"Managing Director John Smith\"). This is grammatically treated like a name. On the other hand, when describing a person's job or position, \"the\" is used, and the title can be in lowercase (e.g., \"the managing director of the company, John Smith\"). \n\nOption A is incorrect because the use of \"the\" depends on whether it's an official title or a description, not solely on whether a name follows.\n\nOption C is wrong because there is a slight difference in meaning: without \"the\" it's treated as an official title, while with \"the\" it's more of a description.\n\nOption D is incorrect because official titles, when used as Proper Nouns, should actually be used without \"the\"."
