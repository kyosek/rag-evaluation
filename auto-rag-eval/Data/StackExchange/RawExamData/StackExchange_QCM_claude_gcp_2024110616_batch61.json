The correct answer, B, is based on Jacobi's formulation of Maupertuis' principle as described in the documentation.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the robotic arm can be expressed as a quadratic function of generalized velocities (joint angular velocities), similar to equation (2) in the documentation. This allows the construction of a Riemannian metric in the arm's configuration space (generalized position space) using the mass matrix, as shown in equation (3).\n\nBy applying Jacobi's formulation, the arm's motion can be modeled as geodesics in this Riemannian manifold. This approach naturally incorporates the system's dynamics and constraints, leading to efficient, smooth motions that minimize the abbreviated action (equation 4).\n\nOption A (Hamiltonian approach) is a valid method in classical mechanics but doesn't directly utilize the geometric interpretation offered by Jacobi's formulation, making it less suited for this specific optimization problem.\n\nOption C (Lagrange multipliers) is a general optimization technique but doesn't capture the full dynamics of the system as elegantly as the Riemannian geometry approach.\n\nOption D (neural network) is a modern machine learning approach that, while potentially effective, doesn't leverage the known physical principles of the system and may require extensive training data.\n\nThe correct approach (B) combines advanced concepts from classical mechanics with real-world application, requiring analysis and synthesis of the provided information, thus targeting higher cognitive levels as per Bloom's taxonomy."}, "1": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/08/11", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/1540", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/870/"], "docs_id": 1540, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Assume you draw a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 *n* times.

I am by no means an expert in string theory and higher dimensions. I'm a 7th grader who recently wanted to learn about the 4th dimension.

How would that be possible in a 3 dimensional universe? If there is an actual \"4th dimension\" out there, it would have to exist as a subset of a 3 dimensional universe, which simply does not make sense.

That also doesn't make any sense. So, how can string theory claim there are more than 3 spatial dimensions in our world?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I have learned that superstring theory claims that there are 10 spatial dimension existing in our world. How would that be possible in a 3 dimensional universe?\n\nIf the universe has 10 dimensions, then it is 10\\-dimensional and only *appears* 3\\-dimensional. The other 7 spatial dimensions would have to be very \"small\" dimensions. An analogy would be a sheet of paper, which is 3\\-dimensional but appears 2 dimensional because one dimension, it's thickness, is very small compared to the others.\n\n> If there is an actual \"4th dimension\" out there, it would have to exist as a subset of a 3 dimensional universe, which simply does not make sense.\n\nActually, the 3\\-dimensional universe would be a subset of the 10\\-dimensional universe and \"fit inside\" it, the way a line fits on a piece of paper and a piece of paper fits inside a box.\n\n> Or, you could be saying that it exists outside our universe, which means there is an edge to the universe, or at least the 3D part of it, meaning you could stick your hand out and be in two dimensions at once?\n\nThere doesn't have to be an edge to anything, so long as the dimensions in question are unbounded. You can imagine an infinitely long line, for example, which has \"edges\" (boundaries) in two dimensions but not in the third. That line could have two similar lines orthogonal to it, and orthogonal to each other, and each of those infinite lines could act as the axis of one of our three dimensions in space, which also would then be infinite. Closed shapes can also be finite without having an 'end' or 'edge:' where is the edge of a circle, for example? If you think about it, when you stretch out your hand, you're not just in two dimensions at once, but three: but even though each of those three dimensions has \"edges\" of its own, in that it is only one dimension itself, the universe doesn't have an edge... That we can see at least.\n\nOn the topic of \"curled up\" dimensions, I'll give another analogy: if you've ever played the classic arcade game Asteroids, (check it out at freeasteroids.org if you haven't,) you're familiar with the concept of a small, closed dimension: when you go a certain distance in one direction, you come to what looks like an edge, but its not really an edge because you wrap back around to the other side of the screen. The left \"edge\" is connected to the right \"edge,\" and the top and bottom \"edges\" are also connected to each other. Each of the two dimensions in that game is a small (only a few inches) curled dimension. Your ship can travel in the same direction forever without ever leaving your computer screen. Now, imagine that in the real world there are closed dimensions like that, but instead of being a few inches like the Asteroids game, each dimension is about the size of subatomic particle like an electron: that's what string theory supposes the other seven spatial dimensions we *can't* see are like."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about string theory and higher dimensions, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A physicist is explaining string theory to a group of students and uses the analogy of a sheet of paper to describe the concept of higher dimensions.

The correct answer, D, best demonstrates the limitations of the sheet of paper analogy and requires a more sophisticated understanding of higher dimensions.\n\nOption A, while a common thought experiment, doesn't fully capture the complexity of higher dimensions in string theory.

In the first question, \"it\" cannot be the subject complement (we can't say \"An animal is it\"). However, in the second question, the subject and subject complement are interchangeable. We can say both \"A good way to go about this would be to examine it thoroughly\" and \"To examine it thoroughly would be a good way to go about this.\"\n\nThis interchangeability allows the speaker to place the longer phrase \"a good way to go about this\" at the end of the sentence as a subject complement. This avoids having a long subject before the copulative verb in the embedded question, which would make the sentence sound awkward. The ability to interpret the long phrase as either subject or subject complement provides this flexibility without requiring inversion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the presence of \"would\" doesn't inherently prevent inversion.

Then a subset $R\\\\subseteq B$ is said to be independent if $R$ freely generates a subalgebra of $B$. Then $R$ is independent if and only if whenever $r\\_{1},...,r\\_{n}\\\\in R$ are distinct elements and for all $i$ either $s\\_{i}\\=r\\_{i}$ or $s\\_{i}\\=r\\_{i}'$ we have $s\\_{1}\\\\wedge...\\\\wedge s\\_{n}\\\\neq 0$. Recall that a subset $p$ of a Boolean algebra $B$ is a partition if $0\\\\not\\\\in p$, $\\\\bigvee p\\=1$ and where $a\\\\wedge b\\=0$ whenever $a,b\\\\in p,a\\\\neq b$. A collection of partitions $\\\\mathcal{P}$ of $B$ is said to be independent if whenever $p\\_{1},...,p\\_{n}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}$ and $a\\_{1}\\\\in p\\_{1},...,a\\_{n}\\\\in p\\_{n}$ then $a\\_{1}\\\\wedge...\\\\wedge a\\_{n}\\\\neq 0$.\n\nThis notion of independence in a Boolean algebra can be thought of as both an algebraic independence and a probabilistic independence. For example, if $R\\_{1},...,R\\_{n}$ are events in a probability space with $P(R\\_{i})\\\\in(0,1\\)$ for $1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n$ and $R\\_{1},...,R\\_{n}$ are independent in the probabilistic sense, then $R\\_{1},...,R\\_{n}$ are independent in a Boolean algebraic sense. \n\nThe main result about independence in Boolean algebras is the result by [Balcar and Franek](http://www.randomservices.org/random/prob/Independence.html) which states that every infinite complete Boolean algebra $B$ has an independent subset $R\\\\subseteq B$ with $\\|R\\|\\\\subseteq\\|B\\|$ and hence a free subalgebra $A\\\\subseteq B$ with $\\|A\\|\\=\\|B\\|$. One corollary of this result is that if $A,B$ are complete Boolean algebras with $\\|A\\|\\\\leq\\|B\\|$, then there is a surjective Boolean algebra homomorphism $\\\\phi:B\\\\rightarrow A$. Furthermore, Balcar and Franek go on to show that complete Boolean algebras have not just large free algebras, but they also have large independent sets of large partitions in the following sense.\n\nSuppose that $B$ is a Boolean algebra. Recall that the saturation $Sat(B)$ of $B$ is the least cardinal such that every partition of $B$ has cardinality less than $Sat(B)$. Then $B$ is said to be well\\-semifree if there is an independent family $\\\\mathcal{P}$ of partitions such that if $\\\\lambda\\<Sat(B)$, then $\\\\{p\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}:\\|p\\|\\=\\\\lambda\\\\}\\=Sat(B)$.

I think if we use $Q\\_n\\=c\\_n(1\\-x^4\\)^n$, our estimate would have to be different. Thus, for (50\\), $Q\\_n$ would be less than something different than $\\\\sqrt{n}$. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure if this correct. I'm feeling as if though the proof would have bigger changes if we used $Q\\_n\\=c\\_n(1\\-x^4\\)^n$ as my professor gave me this question to contemplate about. \n\n---\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DYP5p.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DYP5p.png)\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sv2cB.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sv2cB.png)\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/M9uRy.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/M9uRy.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It wouldn't change much, since\n$$(1\\-x^4\\)^n \\\\geq 1\\-nx^4$$\nby the same reason (ie, the derivative of $f(x)\\=(1\\-x^4\\)^n\\-1\\+nx^4$ is $\\-4nx^3(1\\-x^4\\)^{n\\-1}\\+4nx^3$, which is positive on $(0,1\\)$) and then you can integrate up to $1/\\\\sqrt\\[4]{n}$ and get a similar analysis for $c\\_n$. Then, the only times that we see $(1\\-x^2\\)^n$ appearing again is in justifying the uniform convergence of $Q\\_n$ outside any small interval around $0$, which will hold by essentially the same argument, and in the last inequality, which will not make a difference. \n\nHowever, there is more to it than \"it wouldn't change anything\". The idea of the proof by Rudin is that the convolution of two functions should preserve the best properties out of the two functions. One good example of this is the convolution with a smooth compactly supported function, which is a good way to prove uniform density of the smooth functions on $C^0(I)$, for example. So he strikes for a convolution with a polynomial.\n\nThe point is: if $f$ is a function (continuous, $L^1\\_{loc}$ or whatever depending on context), we expect that after making a convolution with a function $\\\\phi$ which is normalized as to have $\\\\int \\\\phi \\=1$, if the support is small enough and concentrated near $0$, then the convolution $\\\\widetilde{f}$ is near $f$ (think of a discrete averaging where $\\\\phi$ is a \"weight\", and the convolution at a point is the average of the function according to that weight centralized on the point. If we put more weight at the point, and less on its near values, then the average shouldn't shake things that much). This is easy to arrange for $C^{\\\\infty}$ functions, since we have bump functions. But here we would like to prove density of *polynomials*, which are not so malleable. With effect, we can't have a polynomial with compact support and integrating $1$ (we can't have non\\-trivial polynomials with compact support at all!).\n\nSo we try to emulate a compact support by taking a polynomial which is highly concentrated near the origin. The polynomial $p(x)\\=1\\-x^2$ is maybe the most trivial example of something concentrated near the origin. An important observation is that since the function is defined on $\\[0,1]$, what matters to our avering polynomial is its behaviour in $\\[\\-1,1]$, so the fact that $(1\\-x^2\\)$ explodes outside of $\\[\\-1,1]$ is irrelevant. Then we raise it to the power of $n$ since, being on $(\\-1,1\\)$, this will concentrate things even more near the origin (you can plot a few powers to try and see this). The estimates that Rudin do are to guarantee that everything goes well and represent the technical difficulty of not having compact support (also as small as desired). \n\nThe polynomial $1\\-x^4$ also satisfies the property that if we raise it to $n$, things will concentrate near the origin. The only difference is that it is less concentrated than $1\\-x^2$, so that the error you make with the convolution will probably be bigger than if you used $1\\-x^2$."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation and the requirements, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A mathematician is attempting to extend the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem proof to a more general case. They propose using Qn = cn(1-x6)n instead of Qn = cn(1-x2)n. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the implications of this change on the proof and the theorem's applicability?\n\nA) The proof remains largely unchanged, but the convergence rate of the approximating polynomials becomes significantly slower.\n\nB) The theorem no longer holds for continuous functions on [0,1], as the new polynomial fails to concentrate sufficiently near the origin.\n\nC) The proof requires substantial modification, particularly in the estimation of cn, but the theorem's conclusion remains valid with different bounds.\n\nD) The change invalidates the theorem entirely, as the new polynomial cannot effectively approximate non-polynomial continuous functions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The change from (1-x2)n to (1-x6)n would require substantial modifications to the proof, but it doesn't invalidate the theorem. The key aspects affected are:\n\n1. Concentration near origin: (1-x6)n still concentrates near the origin as n increases, but less rapidly than (1-x2)n. This affects the rate of convergence but not the fundamental ability to approximate.\n\n2. Estimation of cn: The lower bound for the integral of (1-x6)n would need to be adjusted. Instead of integrating up to 1/\u221an, we might integrate up to 1/n^(1/6), changing the estimation of cn.\n\n3. Uniform convergence: The argument for uniform convergence outside small intervals around 0 would need adjustment, but the principle remains valid.\n\n4. Final inequality: The last step of the proof would require different bounds, but the overall structure of showing that the supremum norm of f-p can be made arbitrarily small remains intact.\n\nThis change demonstrates the robustness of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem. While the specific polynomial used affects the efficiency of approximation and the technical details of the proof, the core concept of polynomial density in C[0,1] persists. This question tests the understanding of the theorem's essence beyond the specific implementation in Rudin's proof, requiring analysis of how changing the approximating polynomial affects various aspects of the proof without invalidating the theorem's conclusion."}, "14": {"documentation": {"date": "2014/07/04", "source": ["https://askubuntu.com/questions/491825", "https://askubuntu.com", "https://askubuntu.com/users/285205/"], "docs_id": 491825, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using pulseaudio loopback's to link together my system sounds and my microphone.

The most likely cause of these issues is a compromised rolling code system in the opener. Here's why:\n\n1. The neighbor's remote initially working suggests the opener was using a fixed code system or had a compromised rolling code system.\n\n2. Reprogramming the remote with a new frequency should have solved the issue if it was merely a frequency overlap problem.\n\n3. The door continuing to open randomly, even when the homeowner is away, indicates that the issue is not with the remote itself but with the opener's security system.\n\n4. Modern garage door openers use rolling code technology to prevent code grabbing and unauthorized access. If this system is malfunctioning or has been compromised, it could lead to seemingly random activations.\n\n5. The lock button on the wall not helping further supports that the issue is with the opener's internal security system rather than external interference or wiring problems.\n\nOption A is less likely because faulty wiring typically wouldn't cause such specific issues with remote functionality and random openings.

The 8 GB swap partition is a reasonable size for most systems, though the documentation notes this can vary based on needs.\n\n5. This approach allows for future resizing by shrinking the Windows partition and expanding /home, as suggested in the documentation.\n\nOption A is limited by using the basic tool and doesn't offer the flexibility of separate partitions.

You would for example be able to run Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu with various graphical environments (Gnome, KDE, whatever).\n\nOtherwise, there is no obvious reason that would give bare metal hypervisors a performance advantage compared to host based hypervisors like VirtualBox.

At the present time, however, the photon energy density has a much smaller effect than either dark energy or dark matter. This is due to the different ways in which the energy densities of the various components scale with the size of the universe. Dark matter energy density (unsurprisingly) scales like ordinary matter density\n\\\\begin{equation}\n\\\\rho\\_{DM}\\\\propto a(t)^{\\-3}.\n\\\\end{equation}\nThat is, as the universe expands and the scale factor increases, the dark matter energy density decreases by three factors of scale, one for each spatial dimension.\n\nPhotons, however, in addition to having their density diluted by the expansion of space, are also redshifted, so that their energy density drops by an additional inverse scale factor\n\\\\begin{equation}\n\\\\rho\\_{\\\\gamma}\\\\propto a(t)^{\\-4}.\n\\\\end{equation}\nLastly, we have dark energy, also referred to as the cosmological constant. It is constant with respect to scale factor. \n\nSo, we see that as time evolves and the scale factor increases, dark energy density is constant, dark matter density drops as $a(t)^{\\-3}$ and photon energy density drops like $a^{\\-4}$. This is the reason why we currently live in a period of accelerating expansion: radiation and dark matter density have been sufficiently diluted by expansion so that dark energy dominates. \n\nIt is important to note that the universe evolves differently during periods dominated by either radiation, dark matter or dark energy. Specifically, only dark energy can produce accelerated expansion. Radiation and dark matter both act to slow and eventually reverse expansion, albeit in quantitatively different manners.\n\nAt sufficiently early times, when $a(t)\\\\ll 1$, the photon density will be large compared to the dark matter density and dark energy density. During this radiation\\-dominated epoch, radiation energy density will drive scale factor evolution. \n\nThe graph below shows how the scale factor evolved in a universe like our own. Following an initial period of exponential expansion (inflation), the universe was radiation dominated, then matter\\-dominated, and finally dark energy\\-dominated. \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXiov.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXiov.gif)\n\nFinally, a calculation of the present day photon energy density from the CMB temperature can be found in [this answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/94221/58448)."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the expansion of the universe and the effects of different energy densities, I've created the following question:\n\nQuestion: An astrophysicist is studying the evolution of the universe and observes that the expansion is currently accelerating.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"we currently live in a period of accelerating expansion: radiation and dark matter density have been sufficiently diluted by expansion so that dark energy dominates.\"\n\n2.

Over time, this leads to dark energy becoming dominant as the other energy densities are diluted by expansion.\n\n4.

It follows Magento's recommended practice of using custom modules and rewrites instead of modifying core files.\n2.

Which of the following approaches would be the most efficient and automated way to accomplish this task?\n\nA) Manually search the 'master.bib' file for each citation used in a paper and copy them to a new file\nB) Use a text editor's find function to locate cited references in 'master.bib' and extract them\nC) Utilize RefTeX's 'reftex-create-bibtex-file' function within their LaTeX editing environment\nD) Write a custom Perl script to parse the LaTeX document and filter the 'master.bib' file\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most efficient and automated approach to extract only the cited references from a large BibTeX file is to use RefTeX's 'reftex-create-bibtex-file' function. This solution directly addresses the user's need without requiring manual intervention or custom script writing. RefTeX is integrated with LaTeX editing environments and can automatically analyze the LaTeX document to identify citations, then extract only those entries from the master bibliography file. This method is more efficient than manual searching (option A) or using basic text editor functions (option B), which are time-consuming and error-prone for large documents. While writing a custom Perl script (option D) could potentially solve the problem, it requires additional programming skills and time to develop and test, making it less efficient than using an existing, specialized tool like RefTeX. The RefTeX solution combines ease of use with automation, making it the most suitable choice for the described scenario."}, "25": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/14", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/288145", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/164355/"], "docs_id": 288145, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I started playing on Torment with my Crusader and I'm not sure what would be the best way to upgrade my gear so I can play at higher Torment levels.\n\nShould I aim for crafting recipes?

The correct answer (C) aligns with step 1 of the recommended priority list, which states to \"Fill every slot with a legendary\" by gambling with blood shards for every slot except weapons (which are crafted). This approach is the most efficient for rapid initial power progression because:\n\n1. It targets the immediate goal of getting legendaries in every slot, which is a significant power boost.\n2. It avoids wasting resources on less efficient methods early on.\n3. It sets the foundation for handling Torment 1, which is a crucial stepping stone.\n\nOption A is incorrect because crafting set items is not mentioned as an efficient early strategy and requires specific recipes and materials that may not be readily available.\n\nOption B is a common misconception. While higher Torment levels do increase legendary drop rates, attempting them too early is inefficient and potentially impossible due to the difficulty spike.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it delays power progression unnecessarily.

Everywhere I've worked there was a build manager who took care of all of that \\-\\- I'd compile locally with the IDE for development and unit testing, then check in the source code and notify the build manager who did what was necessary to compile everybody's files for the shared environment.\n\nNow that I'm between contracts I've been working on my own self\\-funded project and it's getting to the point where it could be good enough to actually make money. I even have a potential investor lined up and plan to show them a beta version in the next few weeks.\n\nBut all along I just click the build button on the IDE, and it creates the Jar file and it works just fine. Of course, the conventional wisdom suggests that I \"should\" be writing my own Ant/Maven/Gradle scripts and using that instead of the IDE, but what are the concrete advantages of that in my situation (working alone)?\n\nI've done some reading about how to use those build tools, and it just looks like I'd be writing hundreds of lines of XML (or Groovy or whatever) to do to what the IDE does in one click (the IDE\\-generated Ant XML for the project is over 700 lines). It just looks error\\-prone and time\\-consuming and unnecessary for my situation. Not to mention the learning curve, which would take away time from all the other work I'm doing to get the product ready to show people.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'd suggest you look into using Maven as opposed to Ant. If your IDE can build your project in one click, then it's likely that Maven can also build your project with virtually no custom configuration.\n\nAnd to answer the question, simplifying the deployment process is one concrete example. If you're building a distributable locally that means that you have to manually deploy that distributable on your production system, and implies that you probably had to do a fair bit of manual configuration on the production system to get it ready for deployment (installing Tomcat, perhaps, or copying over dependencies and resources required by your application). This can be time\\-consuming, and may make deploying updates become a tedious, manual process. It also allows the potential for any minor configuration differences between your production platform and your development environment to cause obscure, difficult to track down errors. \n\nSo anyhow, what I do to get rid of this manual drudgery is that I configure my project to build with Maven, and I configure my `pom.xml` file with all the information required to (in the case of a Java web\\-app) find and download the correct version of Tomcat, install it locally, set up the correct Tomcat configuration files, deploy any project dependencies and the project WAR file itself, and then start Tomcat. I then create a simple shell script (and also a `.bat` version for Windows) that uses Maven to build and start the server:\n\n```\nmvn clean install cargo:start -Dcargo.maven.wait=true\n\n```\n\nSo instead of packaging up a deployable on my dev environment and then manually pushing it up to production, all I have to do is sync from the version\\-control system onto the production server, and then the production system itself builds, installs, and runs the deployable (and does it in a way that is *identical* to how it is done on any development system, minimizing the possibility of platform\\-specific errors or misconfigurations). And whether in the development or production environment, all I do to build and start the server is:\n\n```\n./startServer.sh #or startServer.bat for Windows\n\n```\n\nAnd to deploy an update to the production environment the process is just:\n\n1.

See [this question](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/65425/4280), which has two valid answers, one of which mine.\n\nThe fact that you have shown the rectangles are a base, plus the fact there is *some* countable base, shows that we can thin out the rectangles to a countable base, and so we can use that countable subfamily to form the unions.\n\nThere is also another way, which might be easier (but the thinning out is a useful fact in general): suppose $O \\= \\\\cup\\_{i \\\\in I} U\\_i$ where the $U\\_i, i \\\\in I$ are open and $I$ is any index set, and suppose we also have some countable base $B\\_n, n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$. Then for every $x \\\\in O$, pick $i(x) \\\\in I$ such that $x \\\\in U\\_{i(x)}$, and then pick $n(x) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$ such that $x \\\\in B\\_{n(x)} \\\\subseteq U\\_{i(x)}$, as we have a base. \n\nHaving done that, consider $N' \\= \\\\{n(x) : x \\\\in O \\\\}$ which is countable as a subset of $\\\\mathbb{N}$. For every $n \\\\in N'$, $n \\= n(x)$ for some $x \\\\in O$, pick one, and define $I'$ to be the set of all $i(x)$ of the $x$ chosen this way.\n\nThen $I'$ is at most countable, as we pick one element for each $n \\\\in N'$. And $O \\= \\\\cup\\_{i \\\\in I'} U\\_i$. Why? right to left inclusion is obvious, as we omit sets, and if $x \\\\in O$, we have $i(x), n(x)$ as before such that $x \\\\in B\\_{n(x)} \\\\subseteq U\\_{i(x)}$ and this shows that $n \\= n(x)$ (for this $x$) is of course in $N'$. So we picked some $x' \\\\in O$ such that $n \\= n(x')$, and so also $x \\\\in B\\_{n(x)} \\= B\\_{n(x')} \\\\subseteq U\\_i(x')$, and $i(x') \\\\in I'$ by construction. This proves the other inclusion. \n\nWe have shown that in a second countable space every family of open sets has a countable subfamily with the same union. This property is known as being \"hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f\". \n\nNote that both of these proofs heavily use choice. So we could also use an ad hoc proof that immediately specialises to rectangles with rational endpoints, using the fact the rationals are dense in the reals. But these general facts are also quite useful to know."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A topology researcher is working on proving that any open set U in R^n can be represented as a countable union of open rectangles. They have successfully shown that for any point x in U, there exists an open rectangle V_x^\u03b5 that is contained in U. However, they are struggling with the final step of the proof. Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate to complete the proof rigorously?\n\nA) Use the Axiom of Choice to select one rectangle for each point in U, then argue that this selection must be countable.\nB) Apply the Baire Category Theorem to show that the union of rectangles must be of the second category, implying countability.\nC) Utilize the fact that R^n has a countable base, and apply a thinning out lemma to the collection of all possible rectangles.\nD) Construct a bijection between the set of all possible rectangles and the set of rational numbers in R^n.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most rigorous approach to complete this proof is to utilize the fact that R^n has a countable base and apply a thinning out lemma. This method is explicitly mentioned in the top answer as a valid and general approach. \n\nThe thinning out lemma states that if a space has a countable base, then any other base has a countable subfamily that is also a base. In this case, we've shown that the collection of all possible rectangles forms a base for the topology of R^n. Since R^n is known to have a countable base (e.g., open balls with rational radii centered at points with rational coordinates), we can apply the thinning out lemma to conclude that there exists a countable subfamily of rectangles that is still a base.\n\nThis countable subfamily of rectangles can then be used to represent any open set U as a countable union. This approach is more general and doesn't rely on specific properties of the rectangles or R^n beyond its separability.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Axiom of Choice could be used to select rectangles, it doesn't guarantee countability. Option B misapplies the Baire Category Theorem, which isn't directly relevant to countability in this context. Option D, while creative, is unnecessarily complex and doesn't directly address the countability issue in the context of open covers.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (bases in topology, countability, and covering properties) and tests the ability to identify the most rigorous and general approach to completing a mathematical proof."}, "33": {"documentation": {"date": "2019/03/02", "source": ["https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/324695", "https://meta.stackexchange.com", "https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/132742/"], "docs_id": 324695, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Today I clicked a link to a question on SO and got, [404 \\- This question was removed from Stack Overflow for reasons of moderation.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48034930/azure-automation-cannot-invoke-method) That took me to another page, [Why and how are some questions deleted?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/deleted-questions).\n\nI am accustomed to things like GitHub.

Be aware that any features added after this version will not be available to any player.\" This represents a critical trade-off in multi-version server management: to support a wide range of client versions, the server must operate at the lowest common denominator in terms of features.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of the provided information (L3+ in Bloom's taxonomy) by asking the test-taker to identify not just the cause of the issue but also understand its implications. It integrates multiple concepts from the documentation, including server setup, version compatibility, and feature availability.

Using the line out port, green one, works from time to time, but more often than not, using any of the other ports will output the what you'd expect from line out. In a way, the issue is resolved since if I use any other ports than the line out, the sound is working like it should. I'd rather not though as Windows doesn't output anything at all when not using line out, and there are times where linux too won't output to anything but line out. \n\nHow come linux gets so confused?

It uses the concept of \"trimming down\" by choosing a resistor above the target value (5100 \u03a9) and connecting a much larger resistor in parallel. The parallel combination can be calculated using the formula: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2. Solving this equation with R1 = 5100 \u03a9 and R2 = 220 k\u03a9 yields approximately 4750.2 \u03a9, which is extremely close to the target value.\n\nC) While this solution would work (2200 \u03a9 + 2200 \u03a9 + 330 \u03a9 = 4730 \u03a9), it uses three components instead of two, making it less efficient in terms of component count.\n\nD) This option applies the correct concept of parallel trimming, but the calculation (1/R_total = 1/4700 + 1/470000) yields about 4653 \u03a9, which is further from the target than option B.\n\nOption B demonstrates the application of the principle: \"to lower the value of a resistor by 1%, say, put a resistor 100 times as large in parallel.\" In this case, we need to lower the value by about 6.86%, so we use a resistor about 43 times larger (220k / 5.1k \u2248 43), which is in the correct order of magnitude for the desired adjustment.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of resistor combinations, the ability to apply trimming concepts in a practical scenario, and the critical thinking required to balance accuracy with component efficiency."}, "45": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/01/03", "source": ["https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/53474", "https://english.stackexchange.com", "https://english.stackexchange.com/users/12373/"], "docs_id": 53474, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a term for people spelling out a name or some other word with their bodies (e.g. [YMCA](http://pigroll.com/img/ymca.jpg)), usually for the purposes of a fun photo?

They want to incorporate the concept of people spelling out words with their bodies in group photos. Which of the following strategies would be most effective in maximizing engagement while accurately representing this concept?\n\nA) Create a hashtag challenge called #BodyLanguageChallenge, encouraging users to spell out words using sign language gestures\nB) Launch an #AcrobaticAlphabetChallenge, asking participants to form letters individually using complex yoga poses\nC) Promote a #HumanAlphabetChallenge, where groups collaborate to spell out the brand name using their full bodies in creative poses\nD) Initiate a #LivingLogoCampaign, where users recreate the company's logo using props and body positioning\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most effective strategy for this campaign would be option C, promoting a #HumanAlphabetChallenge. This answer integrates multiple concepts from the documentation and applies them to a real-world marketing scenario. The term \"Human Alphabet\" is explicitly mentioned in the documentation as a correct term for this activity. This option accurately represents the concept of spelling out words with entire bodies, usually for fun photos, which aligns with the original question. It also incorporates the collaborative aspect, which is typical of these types of photos (like the YMCA example). \n\nOption A is incorrect because it focuses on sign language, which the documentation specifically distinguishes from the full-body spelling concept. Option B, while using the term \"Acrobatic Alphabet\" from the documentation, misses the mark by focusing on individual poses rather than group collaboration. Option D is a plausible distractor but doesn't specifically relate to spelling out words with bodies.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of the provided information to a marketing context, testing critical thinking rather than mere recall.

This approach addresses several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. It solves the rendering inconsistency that occurs when zoomed out or exported to PDF, which is the core problem described by the user.\n2. The shapeburst fill allows for a clear boundary between the colored area (equivalent to the red border) and the transparent area, matching the desired visual effect.\n3. By using a polygon with a shapeburst fill, the rendering is consistent across different zoom levels and export formats, eliminating the artifacts seen with the original line style approach.\n4. The top answer explicitly recommends this solution, stating that it can achieve the desired result and providing a visual example.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are plausible alternatives that a GIS user might consider, but they don't directly address the core issue of inconsistent rendering across zoom levels and export formats.

The output of vmstat would show this better during the problem scenario.\n\n```\nvmstat 1 30\n\n```\n\nHowever, neither top or vmstat are well suited for diagnosing issues after the fact. \n\nMy general advice would be to install the `sysstat` package. This will enable system metrics to be saved periodically and the information can then be retrieved later by `sar`. Sysstat may be configured for substantial detail, but the default configuration will give you an initial overview over CPU usage, system load, paging and swapping. \n\n```\nyum install sysstat\n\nsar \nsar -q\nsar -B\nsar -W\n\n```\n\nIf this reveals little of use, you may need to look deeper, however. Something may be going on that is not immediately visible through the common performance metrics, other than the process queue (load average). One possibility is that the CPU is preoccupied with excessive interrupt requests, causing processes to queue up for what little processing time remains available to the system. \n\nIf that is the case, you may be able to find some clues in /proc/interrupts\n\n```\ncat /proc/interrupts\n\n```\n\nPerhaps network adapters or the local timer show an unusually high number of interrupts?\n\nIt may come down to familiarizing yourself with `perf` and waiting for the next occurrence of the problem. Start recording once the trouble starts, or automate the process with a script that triggers on high load average.\n\n```\nperf record -a\n\nperf report\n\n```\n\nPerf provides an incredibly detailed view of operations on the system, but also collects a lot of data and causes significant overhead, making it impractical to have it running continuously. \n\nIn the case of CentOS 6\\.3 there is a chance that mysterious high load averages will go away with an upgrade to CentOS 6\\.4, which resolves a bug in the kernel source that relates to the local timer. However, your problem could just as well be caused by any given driver that may have been provided by your hardware vendor."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator is investigating a CentOS 6.3 web/mail server that experienced an extremely high load average (75) yesterday, causing system paralysis. Given the information provided in the automated email reports and considering best practices for performance troubleshooting, which approach is most likely to yield valuable insights for diagnosing the root cause of this issue?\n\nA) Analyze the current top output to identify CPU-intensive processes\nB) Install and configure the sysstat package to collect ongoing system metrics\nC) Immediately upgrade the system to CentOS 6.4 to resolve potential kernel bugs\nD) Focus on optimizing MySQL and PHP configurations for the WordPress blog\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided information and best practices in system administration. The correct answer, B, is the most effective approach for several reasons:\n\n1. The problem occurred in the past, and the current top output shows normal CPU usage. This makes option A less useful for diagnosing a past event.\n\n2. Installing sysstat allows for continuous collection of system metrics, which can be retrieved later using sar. This provides historical data that can be analyzed after an incident occurs, making it ideal for diagnosing intermittent issues.\n\n3. While upgrading to CentOS 6.4 (option C) might resolve some kernel-related issues, it's premature to do so without first gathering more data about the specific problem. It's also a more disruptive action that doesn't directly aid in diagnosis.\n\n4. Optimizing MySQL and PHP (option D) might be beneficial in general, but there's no clear evidence that these are the root cause of the high load. This approach doesn't address the immediate need for better diagnostic information.\n\nThe sysstat package provides a comprehensive view of system performance over time, including CPU usage, system load, paging, and swapping. This historical data is crucial for understanding what happened during the high-load event, especially when the issue is not currently present.\n\nFurthermore, this approach aligns with best practices in system administration by emphasizing the importance of proactive monitoring and data collection for troubleshooting complex, intermittent issues. It also allows for a more methodical and evidence-based approach to problem-solving, rather than making assumptions based on limited current data or immediately jumping to major system changes."}, "51": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/11/15", "source": ["https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/266060", "https://ell.stackexchange.com", "https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/123267/"], "docs_id": 266060, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Tom is at a party, hanging at the bar.

At the level of pragmatics, there is a strong implicature that it is true, though.\n\nFor example, *tell the truth* by itself comes with the default interpretation that the speaker's belief is correct; but it can be overridden by adding an adjunct phrase starting with *as*. Some examples from the NOW Corpus. I also add in some examples that suggest that whether *tell the truth* is felicitous also depends on whether the speaker has told \"the whole truth\" (e.g., they are not being deceptive through misplaced emphasis):\n\n> We want people to start **telling the truth** as it relates to my client\n>  and what she's been put through  \n> \n>  I believe they are each **telling the truth** as experienced and/or researched.

The politician's response doesn't fully meet the criteria for lying as defined in the documentation (saying something false, believing it to be false, with the intention of deceiving).

They are not saying something explicitly false, but rather reinterpreting their original statement.\n\nOption D is partially correct in that the politician's statement is misleading, but it doesn't fully capture the deliberate exploitation of linguistic ambiguity, which is key to equivocation.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about the nuances of truth-telling, lying, and linguistic manipulation in political discourse."}, "53": {"documentation": {"date": "2016/10/26", "source": ["https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/242595", "https://stats.stackexchange.com", "https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/24515/"], "docs_id": 242595, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In support vector machines (SVMs) and other Kernel based methods, like Gaussian processes, the Kernel replaces the inner product of two feature vectors $k(x\\_n,x\\_m)\\=x\\_n^Tx\\_m$.

I'll create a challenging multiple-choice question based on the provided documentation about Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Kernel functions, focusing on higher-order thinking skills and real-world applications.\n\nQuestion: A data scientist is developing a novel similarity measure for a specialized image recognition task. They propose using a modified Gaussian kernel function with a negative \u03b8 value, claiming it better captures the unique characteristics of their dataset. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the implications of this approach?\n\nA) The modified kernel will still be valid, but may result in overfitting due to increased flexibility\nB) The proposed function is no longer a valid kernel, as it violates the positive semi-definite requirement\nC) The negative \u03b8 will invert the similarity measure, potentially improving performance for dissimilar images\nD) The modified kernel will be valid only if applied to a subset of the feature space where positive semi-definiteness is preserved\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The proposed modification with a negative \u03b8 value invalidates the kernel function for use in SVMs and Gaussian processes. This is because a valid kernel function must be positive semi-definite (PSD), which is not the case when \u03b8 < 0.\n\nTo understand why, let's consider the Gram matrix for two distinct points x and y:\n\n[1     \u03b1]\n[\u03b1     1]\n\nWhere \u03b1 = exp(|\u03b8|/2 ||x - y||^2) > 1 when \u03b8 < 0.\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are 1 + \u03b1 and 1 - \u03b1. Since \u03b1 > 1, the second eigenvalue (1 - \u03b1) is negative. A positive semi-definite matrix requires all eigenvalues to be non-negative, which is violated in this case.\n\nThis violation of the PSD requirement has significant implications:\n1.

I'm not sure what `rsync`s actual algorithm is, but I believe that even if your `rsync` command wasn't trying to update the modification/access times that it'd probably have to start comparing blocks or checksums for blocks for everything that has a new modification time to see if it was actually changed or not."}, "answer": "Certainly. Here's a question based on the provided StackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A system administrator has recently migrated data from old disk arrays to new ones using the 'cp' command.

This conclusion is based on several key points from the scenario:\n\n1. The files were copied using the 'cp' command without explicitly preserving metadata (no mention of using the -p option).\n2. The rsync process is showing high CPU usage but low I/O activity, indicating computational work rather than data transfer.\n3. The behavior suggests rsync is \"going through the whole files\" rather than just copying incremental changes.\n\nWhen files are copied without preserving metadata, their modification times are updated to the time of the copy operation. Rsync uses file modification times as a quick way to determine if files have changed. When it encounters files with new timestamps, it assumes they may have been modified and performs a more thorough check, typically involving checksums.\n\nThis process is CPU-intensive (explaining the high CPU usage) but doesn't necessarily involve transferring large amounts of data (explaining the low I/O usage). Rsync is likely comparing checksums of file blocks between the source and destination to determine if any actual content has changed, despite the new timestamps.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are less likely:\nA) While inode changes can affect rsync, they typically don't cause this specific behavior.\nC) Different block sizes would more likely affect I/O patterns rather than just CPU usage.\nD) Rsync doesn't typically perform defragmentation as part of its normal operation.\n\nThis scenario highlights the importance of preserving metadata when migrating data, especially in environments where incremental backups or synchronization processes are used."}, "56": {"documentation": {"date": "2010/01/14", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/11747", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/2821/"], "docs_id": 11747, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The question is about characterising the sets $S(K)$ of primes which split completely in a given galoisian extension $K\\|\\\\mathbb{Q}$. Do recent results such as Serre's modularity conjecture (as proved by Khare\\-Wintenberger), or certain cases of the Fontaine\\-Mazur conjecture (as proved by Kisin), have anything to say about such subsets, beyond what Class Field Theory has to say ?\n\nI'll now introduce some terminology and recall some background.\n\nLet $\\\\mathbb{P}$ be the set of prime numbers. For every galoisian extension $K\\|\\\\mathbb{Q}$, we have the subset $S(K)\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{P}$ consisting of those primes which split (completely) in $K$. The question is about characterising such subsets; we call them **galoisian** subsets.\n\nIf $T\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{P}$ is galoisian, there is a unique galoisian extension $K\\|\\\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $T\\=S(K)$, cf. Neukirch (13\\.10\\). We say that $T$ is **abelian** if $K\\|\\\\mathbb{Q}$ is abelian.\n\nAs discussed [here](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/11688/why-do-congruence-conditions-not-suffice-to-determine-which-primes-split-in-non-a) recently, a subset $T\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{P}$ is abelian if and only if it is defined by congruences. For example, the set of primes $\\\\equiv1\\\\pmod{l}$ [is the same as](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/10457/what-are-the-prime-ideals-in-rings-of-cyclotomic-integers/10473#10473) $S(\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\zeta\\_l))$. \"Being defined by congruences\" can be made precise, and counts as a characterisation of abelian subsets of $\\\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nNeukirch says that Langlands' Philosophy provides a characterisation of all galoisian subsets of $\\\\mathbb{P}$. Can this remark now be illustrated by some striking example ?\n\n**Addendum** (28/02/2010\\) [Berger](http://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/~lberger/)'s recent Bourbaki expos\u00e9 1017 [arXiv:1002\\.4111](http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.4111) says that cases of the Fontaine\\-Mazur conjecture have been proved by Matthew Emerton as well. I didn't know this at the time of asking the question, and the unique answerer did not let on that he'd had something to do with Fontaine\\-Mazur...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think it is easiest to illustrate the role of the Langlands program (i.e. non\\-abelian class field theory) in answering this question by giving an example.\n\nE.g. consider the Hilbert class field $K$ of $F :\\= {\\\\mathbb Q}(\\\\sqrt{\\-23})$; this is a degree 3 abelian extension of $F$, and an $S\\_3$ extension of $\\\\mathbb Q$. (It is the splitting field of the polynomial $x^3 \\- x \\- 1$.)\n\nThe 2\\-dimensional representation of $S\\_3$ thus gives a representation\n$\\\\rho:Gal(K/{\\\\mathbb Q}) \\\\hookrightarrow GL\\_2({\\\\mathbb Q}).$  \n\nA prime $p$ splits in $K$ if and only if $Frob\\_p$ is the trivial conjugacy class\nin $Gal(K{\\\\mathbb Q})$, if and only if $\\\\rho(Frob\\_p)$ is the identity matrix, if and only\nif trace $\\\\rho(Frob\\_p) \\= 2$. (EDIT: While $Frob\\_p$ is a 2\\-cycle, resp. 3\\-cycle, if and only if $\\\\rho(Frob\\_p)$ has trace 0, resp. \\-1\\.)\n\nNow we have the following reciprocity law for $\\\\rho$: there is a modular form $f(q)$, in fact\na Hecke eigenform, of weight 1 and level 23, whose $p$th Hecke eigenvalue gives\nthe trace of $\\\\rho(Frob\\_p)$. (This is due to Hecke; the reason that Hecke could handle\nthis case is that $\\\\rho$ embeds $Gal(K/{\\\\mathbb Q})$ as a dihedral\nsubgroup of $GL\\_2$, and so $\\\\rho$ is in fact induced from an abelian character of the\nindex two subgroup $Gal(K/F)$.)\n\nIn this particular case, we have the following explicit formula:\n\n$$f(q) \\= q \\\\prod\\_{n\\=1}^{\\\\infty}(1\\-q^n)(1\\-q^{23 n}).$$\n\nIf we expand out this product as $f(q) \\= \\\\sum\\_{n \\= 1}^{\\\\infty}a\\_n q^n,$\nthen we find that $trace \\\\rho(Frob\\_p) \\= a\\_p$ (for $p \\\\neq 23$),\nand in particular, $p$ splits completely in $K$ if and only if $a\\_p \\= 2$.\n(For example, you can check this way that the smallest split prime is $p \\= 59$;\nthis is related to the fact that $59 \\= 6^2 \\+ 23 \\\\cdot 1^2$.).\n(EDIT: While $Frob\\_p$ has order $2$, resp. 3, if and only if $a\\_p \\=0$, resp. $\\-1$.)\n\nSo we obtain a description of the set of primes that split in $K$ in terms of\nthe modular form $f(q)$, or more precisely its Hecke eigenvalues (or what amounts\nto the same thing, its $q$\\-expansion).\n\nThe Langlands program asserts that an analogous statement is true for any\nGalois extension of number fields $E/F$ when one is given a continuous\nrepresentation $Gal(E/F) \\\\hookrightarrow GL\\\\\\_n(\\\\mathbb C).$ This is known\nwhen $n \\= 2$ and either the image of $\\\\rho$ is solvable (Langlands\\-\\-Tunnell) or $F \\= \\\\mathbb Q$ and $\\\\rho(\\\\text{complex conjugation})$ is non\\-scalar (Khare\\-\\-Wintenberger\\-\\-Kisin).\nIn most other contexts it remains open."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A number theorist is studying the Galois extension K|\u211a, where K is the splitting field of x\u00b3 - x - 1 over \u211a.

This aligns with the general principle of ladder operators outlined in the documentation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because [J\u2083, K\u208a] should equal a constant times K\u208a, not K\u208a itself, for K\u208a to be a raising operator.\n\nOption B is correct because it directly demonstrates the defining property of a raising operator. If K\u208a|m\u27e9 is an eigenvector of J\u2083 with eigenvalue m+1, it means applying K\u208a to an eigenstate of J\u2083 increases its eigenvalue by 1, which is precisely what a raising operator does.\n\nOption C is not specific enough.

Nick Drakos \\& Ross Moore's [Latex2html](http://www.tug.org/mailman/listinfo/latex2html) converter, written in Perl, which I think was the first converter to map equations to Math ML. In 1998, Ross Moore outlined [his goals for Latex2html](http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~ross/webtex/webtex/), tied to the now defunct, closed\\-source WebEq mathematics rendering software, and Webtex, which was an alternative syntax for mathematics designed for use in web pages. From [the WebEq documentation](http://www.sungchichu.com:8080/WebEQ.3.7/docs/reference/WebTeX/wtxsec1.html): *WebTeX always translates unambiguously into MathML, while LaTeX does not*.\n2. [itex2mml](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MML.html), in C by Paul Gartside \\& others, also based on Webtex, but with support for some Latex not supported in Webtex.\n3. [tex4ht](http://www.tug.org/tex4ht/), written in C by Eitan Gurari and other eminent figures. It avoids having to parse Latex source by running `latex` with modified macros that insert specials into the DVI output, and parses the DVI output instead.\n4. John McFarlan's [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), as mentioned by Aditya, written in Haskell. Note that Pandoc supports generation of HTML, both with and without Math ML.\n5. MathJax allows generation of Math ML besides the usual boxes plus image fonts output. It has [an impressive degree of support for Latex](http://www.mathjax.org/resources/docs/?tex.html#supported-latex-commands), including limited support for user macros.\n\n**Parsers generating XML**\n\nJason Blevins has a list of tools that convert Latex documents to XML\\-based formats, and that handle equations reasonably. Romeo Anghelache's [Hermes](http://hermes.roua.org/), which is part of a full Latex parser that generates XML with semantic markup, is worth singling out: like tex4ht, it works by running the Tex engine with macros to put specials in the DVI output, which it then parses; it supports a wider set of semantic markup. \n\n**Fragments of Latex or DVI**\n\nWith the exception of the systems referencing Webtex, there doesn't seem to be much interest in clearly codifying subsets of Latex to be parsed, I guess because these are regarded as moving targets. Instead, lists of commands supported, like that I mentioned for Mathjax, seems to be the way things are done.\n\nWith DVI\\-based converters, the issue of parsing Latex goes away, replaced by the relatively trivial issue of parsing marked\\-up DVI and the trickier issue of identifying the semantically significant macros and constructing markup\\-issuing replacements that do not improperly interfere.

Which of the following approaches would be most suitable for implementing a flexible and portable solution?\n\nA) Use Latex2html to convert equations to MathML, then implement separate renderers for each output format\nB) Implement a custom TeX parser based on the Webtex syntax, ensuring unambiguous translation to MathML\nC) Utilize Pandoc's Haskell-based parser and extend its output capabilities for the required formats\nD) Adapt the tex4ht system to generate intermediate XML, then develop custom renderers for each output format\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and consideration of real-world application. The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. Portability: Pandoc, written in Haskell, is likely to be more portable than solutions tied to specific environments or requiring extensive dependencies.\n\n2. Flexibility: Pandoc already supports generation of HTML both with and without MathML, indicating a flexible architecture that could be extended to other output formats.\n\n3. Parsing capability: As a full-fledged document converter, Pandoc likely has robust TeX parsing capabilities, avoiding the need to implement a custom parser or rely on potentially limited subsets like Webtex.\n\n4. Integration potential: Using a library-based approach with Pandoc would likely be easier to integrate into a new system compared to adapting complex systems like tex4ht or implementing everything from scratch.\n\n5. Multiple output formats: The question specifically asks for multiple output formats, and Pandoc's existing multi-format support makes it a strong candidate for extension.\n\nOption A is less ideal because Latex2html is primarily designed for HTML output, making multi-format support more challenging. Option B, while ensuring unambiguous MathML translation, would require significant custom development and may not easily support all required output formats. Option D could work but involves more complexity in adapting tex4ht and developing custom renderers, which may be less efficient than extending an existing library like Pandoc.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze various TeX parsing approaches, consider their strengths and limitations, and apply that knowledge to a specific software development scenario requiring flexibility and multiple output formats."}, "60": {"documentation": {"date": "2015/01/31", "source": ["https://mathoverflow.net/questions/195367", "https://mathoverflow.net", "https://mathoverflow.net/users/62601/"], "docs_id": 195367, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: 1.

In a cryptographic context, if gcd(a,n) = 1 (i.e., a and n are coprime), then there exists an integer x such that ax \u2261 1 (mod n). This x is the multiplicative inverse of a modulo n.\n\nThe ability to find multiplicative inverses is essential for many cryptographic algorithms, including RSA and elliptic curve cryptography. It allows for the computation of private keys from public keys and enables decryption operations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the GCD is used in factorization algorithms, its representation as a linear combination doesn't directly enable efficient factorization.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the GCD properties don't provide a method for generating truly random numbers.\n\nOption C is plausible but incorrect.

Option C, modifying the \\@xfloat command, directly targets the root cause of the problem. The setspace package redefines floating environments to use single spacing, which is why double spacing is lost in tables.

The table initially loads correctly, displaying columns based on a cookie value. However, when refreshing the table (without a full page reload), some columns briefly appear and then disappear. Using Chrome Developer Tools (CDT), the developer traces the issue to the 'complete' portion of the jQuery callback function. What is the most likely cause of this behavior, and what debugging approach should the developer take next?\n\nA) A race condition between the AJAX response and the cookie reading, requiring breakpoints in both the custom code and jQuery internals\nB) A memory leak in the jQuery library, necessitating a heap snapshot analysis in CDT\nC) Incorrect implementation of the toggle() function, requiring careful examination of the custom JavaScript using CDT's source panel\nD) An event propagation issue, best investigated using CDT's Event Listener Breakpoints feature\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The most likely cause is a race condition between the AJAX response handling and the cookie reading/column toggling logic. This explains the momentary appearance of columns before they disappear, suggesting that the toggle operation is happening after the initial rendering.\n\nTo debug this, the developer should:\n1. Set breakpoints in their custom code where the cookie is read and where the toggle() function is called.\n2. Set a breakpoint in the jQuery callback function, specifically in the 'complete' portion (around line 9548 of jQuery-3.3.1.js).\n3. Use CDT's step-through debugging to observe the exact sequence of operations.\n4. Pay attention to the timing of when the cookie is read versus when the toggle operations occur.\n\nThis approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of the execution flow, helping to identify if the cookie reading or toggle operations are happening at unexpected times relative to the AJAX response handling.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are plausible distractors:\n- B (memory leak) is unlikely as the issue is reproducible on refresh and doesn't accumulate over time.\n- C (incorrect toggle implementation) is possible but less likely given the specific behavior described.\n- D (event propagation) is a common issue in web development but doesn't align closely with the symptoms described.\n\nThis question tests the developer's ability to analyze a complex scenario, apply debugging techniques, and understand asynchronous behavior in web applications, aligning with higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "70": {"documentation": {"date": "2012/02/05", "source": ["https://serverfault.com/questions/356944", "https://serverfault.com", "https://serverfault.com/users/27515/"], "docs_id": 356944, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it possible to run pre\\-Lion OS X in an IPv6\\-only environment without static configuration?

They've successfully used multiple serial ports on x86_64 but are encountering issues with ARM. Given the information in the documentation, what is the most likely reason for their inability to use multiple serial ports on the ARM virt machine, and what would be the best approach to resolve this issue?\n\nA) The ARM virt machine in QEMU 3.0.0 only supports a single UART; applying a patch to add multiple UART support is necessary.\nB) The developer is using incorrect QEMU command-line options; they should use -serial mon:stdio instead of -serial for ARM.\nC) ARM architectures fundamentally do not support multiple serial ports; the developer should use a different debugging method.\nD) The issue is caused by an incompatibility between KGDB and ARM; switching to a different debugger like GDB would resolve it.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The documentation reveals that the ARM virt machine in QEMU 3.0.0 only supports a single UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) by default. This is evidenced by the memory map in the source code, which shows only one UART entry. The top answer provides a patch that adds support for multiple UARTs (UART0 through UART3) to the virt board in QEMU 4.0.1. \n\nThis question requires the candidate to:\n1. Analyze the given information about the limitations in QEMU 3.0.0.\n2. Understand the significance of the memory map in defining hardware capabilities.\n3. Recognize that the solution involves modifying QEMU itself, not just changing command-line options or debugging tools.\n4. Apply this knowledge to a real-world debugging scenario.\n\nThe other options are distractors that represent common misconceptions or partial understandings:\nB) While command-line options are important, they can't overcome a fundamental limitation in the emulated hardware.\nC) This is false; ARM architectures can support multiple serial ports, as evidenced by the patch.\nD) The issue is not with KGDB or ARM compatibility, but with the emulated hardware in QEMU.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts (QEMU internals, ARM architecture, debugging techniques) and apply them to a practical problem, aligning with the higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "73": {"documentation": {"date": "2020/07/14", "source": ["https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/372525", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com", "https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/254764/"], "docs_id": 372525, "title": "N/A", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to give myself an elytra that is named like this:\n\n```\nRockets\nRockets\n\n```\n\nBut the newline isn\u2019t showing up.

That said, people are free to vote how they want, and there's little that moderators can (or should) see and do about individual votes. It's only in cases of clearly coordinated targeted votes between people that we step in.\n\nSo there's little I can do to even verify that this person downvotes good answers. That only leaves the comments they might be giving on answers like this. If a person is particularly abusive or rude in these comments towards people answering, then I will remove those comments and most likely have a conversation with them about this.\n\nI looked through this person's recent history and saw no other comments like this over the last month, and the comments they had left on other answers all seemed civil. You and others made pretty clear points in your responses to their one comment about how they voted, so I think they got the idea about how you all felt.\n\nI saw no need to take further action, so I marked your flag as helpful and moved on. If you see them being rude to others in their comments, flag them and we'll act on that.

Option B is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. It uses the present perfect continuous tense (\"have been\"), which correctly indicates an action that started in the past and is still ongoing.\n2. The use of \"since\" at the beginning of the sentence requires a perfect tense to show the connection between the past event (graduating) and the present situation.\n3.

The impedance of an ideal inductor is given by Z_L = j\u03c9L = j2\u03c0fL. This means that the inductor's impedance increases linearly with frequency.\n\n2. A higher inductance value (L) causes the impedance to increase more rapidly with frequency, making it more effective at blocking higher frequencies.\n\n3.

Unfortunately my combat supplies are manufactured at one end of my base, so when I am at the other end it can take quite a while until the logistics fleet arrives.\n\nSo I placed multiple stashes of combat supplies in passive provider chests all around my perimeter, so my logistics robots can resupply from the nearest one. But now I have to make sure that all these supply depots are full all the time, which requires me to regularly drive around the whole base to refill them. This pretty much defeats the purpose of the logistics network system and I wonder if I can somehow automatize that.\n\nMy first idea was to place a requester chest and a passive provider chest next to each other with an inserter taking from the requester chest to the provider chest. The plan was that the requester requests the combat supplies from my combat supply production center which then get transferred to the provider chest which then transfers them to me when required. But this lead to an infinite loop because the requester would request from the provider next to it instead of from the production center.\n\nIs there a way to get my logistics robots to maintain a bunch of depots all around my base while also having them resupply me from said depots? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Update**\nStarting from 0\\.16 it seems it will be possible to use a new type of buffer chest explicitly for this purpose: [https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff\\-203](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-203)\n\nI have built several variations of the circuit\\-based approach described below since I wrote this answer to improve the design and work out annoyances (like no items ending up in the storage chest until requests have been satisfied). None of them have worked perfectly yet or became so complex they can't easily be explained so therefore I have not updated this answer yet. With a future (as of this writing) 0\\.16\\.x release it seems this problem will go away completely.\n\nThe new buffer chests (green) will be a hybrid between requester chests (blue) and passive provider chests (red). I presume the robots will attempt to fill these new chests before putting anything into generic storage chests (yellow), and also grab from them before going to storage or passive providers, given the images and descriptions in that blog post:\n\n> By using a buffer chest, you can setup a dedicated 'supply area', where the buffer chest will already contain all the typical items, and the bots can quickly top\\-up your inventory.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Using the buffer chest, it will be easy to setup nearby supplies to\n>  quickly repair the walls when needed.\n> \n> \n> *\\- Factorio devs*\n\n---\n\nCircuit network approach\n========================\n\nThe idea is to prevent an infinite loop by not requesting anything when it's not needed, and not allowing anything to be picked up from your remote depot until it has been filled completely, at which point it makes everything available to the player (or any other requester chests nearby).\n\n1. Put a requester chest somewhere near where you want things delivered,\ndo not make it request anything yet. Make sure it's set to **\"set requests\"**.\n2. Put a regular non\\-logistics chest next to it, leaving one space between them. This will be our \"buffer\" to prevent loops.\n3. Put an inserter between the chests, rotated so it picks from the requester chest and places into the regular chest.\n4. Put a storage chest 1 tile away from the regular chest.\n5. Put an inserter between those chests so it takes from the regular chest and puts it into the storage chest.\n6. Put a decider combinator somewhere nearby, set it to trigger if combat supply X goes below Y amount. Set the output type to \"1 of X\".\n7. Grab a wire (say red) and connect the regular and storage chests together with the inserter which **takes** from the regular chest, and connect them with the **input** side of the combinator. The combinator should now show the current total amount of supply X in the depot as its input value, and the output value should be 1 of that type.\n8. Set the condition on that inserter to only trigger if supply X is equal to the amount Y.\n9. Connect the **output** of the combinator to the requester chest.\n\nThe depot should now slowly begin to fill the regular \"buffer\" chest via the requester chest and the first inserter between them. Once the target amount Y has been reached the requests will stop and the other inserter will take over and dump everything into storage. Requests will resume once the total number of X\\-items in the chests goes below the Y threshold.\n\nSince bots prioritize fetching from storage chests, they will likely grab from there over a passive provider chest further away when you pass by.\n\nIf there's stuff left in the storage chest after you're tanked up, they will be moved back to the requester chest by the bots and end up in the buffer chest again, until the're eventually dumped back into the storage chest when the system has reached the threshold.\n\nThere are ways to tweak this system for various purposes and uses.\n\nIf you want to fill the depot faster; put an arithmetic combinator between the first combinator and the requester chest, and set it to multiply the input amount (1\\) by some factor (say 10\\) (make sure to output the same type). The chest will keep requesting 10 items until the system is full (prepare for some overflow as bots always grab/deliver a full cargo hold if they can).\n\nYou could use more combinators to always request the exact number of items left until the system is full, but simply multiplying the number of items requested uses fewer components.\n\nIf bots often end up re\\-filling the system from itself by emptying lots of items from the storage chest into the requester, add another decider combinator (using the green network) which triggers if the storage chest contains Z items, where Z is much lower than the total amount above (Y) and set it so the inserter only grabs that amount from the buffer.\nIt may take slightly longer to restock the player as the storage chest is emptied out more often, but the bots will more likely restock the depot more efficiently as there's not as much \"available\" from the depot itself.\n\nYou could also let the filling of the storage chest be player\\-controlled by hooking up a state\\-reading gate pole (or even multiple ones at different locations) to the iserter and only allowing it to operate while you're standing near the gate(s). But if you have to run to a specific location you may as well grab directly from the buffer chest, perhaps conveniently placed near your gates."}, "answer": "Based on the provided StackExchange documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An engineer is designing an advanced logistics system for a large Factorio base to efficiently distribute combat supplies.

It all depends on many factors including applications that are using the filesystem, what mix of read/write activity is going on and the hardware itself.\n\n`relatime` exists as a compromise to ensure that some (older) applications, such as e\\-mail systems, that use the atime value to determine if a file/message has been read since delivery. As such it is a safe option for a filesystem default.\n\nBefore considering mounting a filesystem with `noatime` you should audit the usage of the filesystem to ensure that no applications depend on atime for correct operation.\n\nAssuming that no user of the filesystem depends on atime then whether it is worth changing the default really depends on the volume of reads and writes to the filesystem. A read\\-mostly usage probably will not make too much of a difference but if there are a large volume of reads/writes to the same file (i.e. typical database workloads) then you will find that most reads also involve a write of atime and that will affect performance.\n\nIf the filesystem is only used for database work then it should be safe to use `noatime` and that will reduce writes to the filesystem.\n\nAt the end of the day `noatime` should not be used without due consideration and how much difference it makes can only be determine by benchmarking under a particular workload."}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Linux file system mount options, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A DevOps engineer is optimizing a high-performance database server running on Linux.

In doing so, he is suggesting that you test the implementation when you should be testing the interface. See [this blog for discussion](http://www.richardlord.net/blog/test-the-interface-not-the-implementation). \n\nThe op then proposed returning the number of added rules. But as far as I can tell it will always return 1\\. Even if the method did return varying values, you'd only be testing the values it returned, not the actual functionality you are interested in.\n\nSo how do you test this method? Firstly, don't think of it in terms of how to test that method. Instead, think about what behavior you want to test. Don't think about the internal state, or how it does it. Think about how the method will be used in the rest of your program.\n\nPresumably, you want to be able to do something like this:\n\n```\nvalidator.addErrorRule('foobar', function(payload) {\n   if (payload.cost > 50) {\n        return \"No. Price Too High\";\n   }\n});\nvalidation_results = validator.validate(payload)\n\n```\n\nAll we need in order to turn that into a test is to say:\n\n```\nassert.deepEqual(validation_results, [\n    {validator: 'foobar', error: 'No. Price Too High'}\n])\n\n```\n\nThis actually tests the functionality we care about and avoids introducing implementation details. \n\nMany coders have gotten the idea that they need to test each method independently. That's why people think they need to test `addErrorRule` separately from `validate`. Don't fall into this trap. Methods within the same object are usually tightly interconnected and attempting to test them independently is a fool's errand.

On the other hand 14 'resists' change because it has the same number of factors as 15\\. 23 is prime but 24 has lots of factors as if there is something about 23 that allows the number of factors to dramatically increase. Clearly the number of factors can increase an increasing instability or decrease a decreasing stability or resisting stability. I'd like to know what the proportion of each type of number is. Are there equal numbers of stable and unstable or not? What's the most consecutive stable numbers it is possible to have? It's just interest nothing more. Karl\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not much has been *proved* about the connection between the numbers of divisors of consecutive integers. There can be dramatic drops and rises, because of the primes, but not much else is known.\n\nOne partial exception has to do with numbers that, in your terminology, **resist change**.\n\nLet $d(n)$ be the number of divisors of $n$. Heath\\-Brown proved that there are infinitely many integers $n$ such that $d(n)\\=d(n\\+1\\)$. Thus there are infinitely many $n$ that resist change. Later, Pinner proved that for any positive integer $B$, there are infinitely many integers $n$ such that $d(n)\\=d(n\\+B)$. Heath\\-Brown gives an asymptotic estimate that shows that the phenomenon is in fact not very rare.\n\nPlease follow [this link](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisorFunction.html) for a survey of properties of the divisor function $d(n)$. You can find the [paper by Pinner here.](http://www.math.ksu.edu/~pinner/Pubs/dn.ps) It is now known that for any positive integer $a$, there are infinitely many $n$ such that $d(n)\\=d(n\\+1\\)\\=24a$.\n\nThere has been work, mainly computational, on sequences of more than two consecutive integers that all have the same number of divisors. **Edit**: Please see the comments of @Gerry Myerson below. \n\nIt is still an open question whether there are infinitely many $n$ such that $d(n)\\=d(n\\+1\\)\\=d(n\\+2\\)$.\n\nThe proofs of the results of Heath\\-Brown and Pinner are difficult. There is a University of Waterloo [Master's thesis by Pechenick](http://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/4378) that gives a less condensed proof of the result of Heath\\-Brown, and mentions and/or proves a number of other related results, for example about the number of *prime* divisors of consecutive integers."}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about divisor functions and consecutive integers, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A mathematician is studying the behavior of the divisor function d(n) for consecutive integers.

If you have access to the server config then you'd perhaps use a `<Directory>` container.\n\n### Using mod\\_rewrite\n\nIn `.htaccess` you can use mod\\_rewrite to restrict access to anything other than `/index.php` or `/app/dist/`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nRewriteEngine On\n\nRewriteRule !^(index\\.php$|app/dist/) - [F]\n\n```\n\nThe above will respond with a 403 Forbidden for any request that is not `/index.php` or does not start `/app/dist/`. If you wish to return a 404 instead then change `F` to `R=404`.\n\nThe `!` prefix on the regex negates the regex. Note that the URL\\-path matched by the `RewriteRule` *pattern* does not start with a slash.\n\nIf you only want to respond with a 403 for requests that would map to actual files or directories (and 404 otherwise) then add a couple of conditions that check the filesystem (but note that filesystem checks are relatively expensive, so unless you need them, don't use them). For example:\n\n```\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d\nRewriteRule !^(index\\.php$|app/dist/) - [F]\n\n```\n\nOnly if the requested URL is not in the allowed \"group\" *and* maps to a file or directory is the `RewriteRule` directive actioned.\n\nHowever, I would assume your URLs don't actually contain `index.php` (do they?), in which case the user requests `/` and mod\\_dir issues an internal subrequest for `/index.php` (the `DirectoryIndex`). In which case, you'll need to make the `index.php` optional.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nRewriteRule !^((index\\.php)?$|app/dist/) - [F]\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### Using an Apache Expression\n\nAlternatively, you can do this with an Apache expression (Apache 2\\.4\\)\n\n```\n<If \"%{REQUEST_URI} !~ m#^/((index\\.php)?$|app/dist/)#\">\n    Require all denied\n</If>\n\n```\n\nThe above responds with a 403 for any URL request that is not `/`, `/index.php` or start with `/app/dist/`.\n\nNote that `Order`, `Allow`, `Deny`, etc. are older Apache 2\\.2 directives and are officially deprecated on Apache 2\\.4\\.\n\n---\n\n### Using mod\\_setenvif\n\nAnother alternative is to use mod\\_setenvif and set an environment variable if one of the permitted URL\\-paths is requested and only permit access if this env var is set.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nSetEnvIf Request_URI \"^/((index\\.php)?$|app/dist/)\" ALLOWED\nRequire env ALLOWED\n\n```\n\nThe above sets the `ALLOWED` env var if the any of the permitted URL\\-paths are requested.

While the question presents several methods attempted by the user, including setExtent(), manually adjusting xmin and xmax, and using extent()<-, these approaches are not ideal for the specific transformation required (0, 360 to -180, 180).\n\nThe rotate() function is specifically designed to handle the conversion from a 0-360 longitude range to a -180 to 180 range, which is exactly what's needed in this scenario. This function not only adjusts the extent but also correctly repositions the data values, ensuring that the raster's content is properly aligned with the new coordinate system.\n\nUsing setExtent() or manually adjusting extent values (options A, C, and D) would only change the metadata of the raster without repositioning the actual data, leading to misaligned or incorrect representations of the global data.\n\nFurthermore, the rotate() function can be easily applied to a list of rasters using lapply() or a similar function, making it more efficient than a manual loop.
