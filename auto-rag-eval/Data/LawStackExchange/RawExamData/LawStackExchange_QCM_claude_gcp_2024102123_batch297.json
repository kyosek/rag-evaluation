Her insurance is aware that she \\-\\- the main driver \\-\\- has a provisional licence, and I am a named driver on her policy with a full licence.\n\nShe is having lessons with a professional instructor, but I have been supervising her on occasion as I meet the [requirements](https://www.gov.uk/driving-lessons-learning-to-drive/practising-with-family-or-friends):\n\n* I am older than 21\\.\n* Have a licence for that category of vehicle.\n* Had that licence for more than 3 years.\n\nWe have L plates shown on her car. She wanted to drive to her work, with me supervising, and then I drive the car home alone.\n\nMy question is: Would I be committing an offence by driving her car back home, by myself, with the L plates still showing?\n\nAs far as I can tell, it's at the very least advisable to remove them, but not illegal. I do not wish to waste police time, but I would expect an officer to pull me over and investigate why I'm driving alone with L plates.\n\nSadly I can't just remove the L plates since they're stickers. They won't go back on if I pull them off. Hence my question.\n\nAs a side note: I will not be using a motorway when driving alone.

The manufacturer and celebrity are from different countries, neither being the US, and sales would occur online globally. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this venture?\n\nA) The manufacturer needs to obtain copyright permission from the celebrity before proceeding with production and sales.\n\nB) As long as the toy is made out of respect for the celebrity, there are no legal concerns to address.\n\nC) The manufacturer should consult with a lawyer familiar with personality rights laws in relevant countries before proceeding.\n\nD) If the manufacturer donates all profits to a charity the celebrity would likely approve of, they are protected from any legal action.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. This scenario involves personality rights, not copyright. Personality rights laws govern the use of someone's name, image, or likeness, and these laws vary significantly between countries. Given the international nature of both the celebrity and the planned sales, consulting with a lawyer who understands personality rights in the relevant jurisdictions is the most prudent course of action. This will help the manufacturer understand their legal obligations and potential risks before proceeding with production and sales.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this is not a copyright issue. Option B is misguided, as the manufacturer's intentions do not negate potential legal issues. Option D is incorrect because donating profits does not automatically protect against legal action related to personality rights infringement."

While the forum initially processed data based on user consent, once deletion is requested, they must consider other legal bases for retaining the data. The forum needs to balance their legitimate interest in maintaining the integrity of discussions against the user's right to erasure.

Many laws in the US restrict acquisition or possession of a thing. One can have legal title to a physical thing whose possession is restricted in the person's jurisdiction, where the thing is located in a jurisdiction without the restriction. In that case, one would own the thing, but not be in possession of it in the restricted jurisdiction. \n\nI have never seen any US law that specifically restricts *ownership*, and I suspect that there are none (possibly for constitutional reasons). Is it a fact that there are no such laws? (If there *are* any such laws, what interests me is whether \"ownership\" can be construed as an \"act\"). \\[An earlier version asked about 'addresses', not it seems clear that it should be narrowed to 'restrictions', since various laws incidentally *mention* ownership].\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A random example I found is [16 USC 363](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=owner&f=treesort&fq=true&num=596&hl=true&edition=prelim&granuleId=USC-prelim-title16-section363), which forbids anyone to **own** a bathhouse in Hot Springs National Park which has been granted a hot water supply, if they already **own** another bathhouse nearby.\n\n[42 USC 2061](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=owner&f=treesort&fq=true&num=1930&hl=true&edition=prelim&granuleId=USC-prelim-title42-section2061) says that the Atomic Energy Commission shall be the exclusive **owner** of all production facilities for special nuclear material (with certain exceptions), which effectively forbids any other person to own such a facility.",

The passage provides two clear examples:\n\n1. 16 USC 363, which forbids ownership of multiple bathhouses with hot water supply in Hot Springs National Park.\n2. 42 USC 2061, which mandates that the Atomic Energy Commission be the exclusive owner of all production facilities for special nuclear material, effectively prohibiting ownership by others.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that while ownership restrictions may be less common, they do exist in US law. Options A and C are incorrect because they state absolute positions that are contradicted by these examples. Option B is incorrect because it makes an unfounded claim about constitutionality; the existence of these laws suggests they are not universally considered unconstitutional."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Religion and politics, as we know, shouldn't intermix. The purpose for having a legal marriage through the government is simple: When people decide to be romantically involved in a permanent way, they require certain legal protections in case that arrangement goes bad, in which case specific guidelines are followed to handle various situations between two people in this situation together. \n\nNowhere in that legal process does the sex of either of these two people matter in any way shape or form legally speaking. Am I wrong? \n\nSo someone, please explain to me, a straight guy (therefore non biased) by the way, why the legal system of the US goverment (previously) decided States could base the qualification for *legal* marriage, on the sex of the people wishing to be married, a position that is in every way shape and form culturally and religiously founded, with no business being included in the law?\n\nI find the distinction no different from our legal system, not too long ago, similarly deciding the people of different skin color couldn't be free. Its intollerance towards 'different', and as an American citizen, I find it appalling that my government recently applied this bevahior in its legal system. \n\nSo can anyone explain the legal justification for taking sex of the participants into account in the process of legal, government facilitated marriage? \n\nNote: I'm interested in legal reasoning that gay marriage wasnt supported by the Supreme Court until only last year. It seems like the only reason the change came was due to media pressure and coverage, and our legal system should protect minorities before such coverage is had, for example for the past decade and longer. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first thing to note is that your question is kind of the wrong way around. US states are sovereign and generally have the ability to make any kind of laws they want, *unless* they violate some specific tenet of federal law or the US Constitution. \n\nYou suggest, for instance, that arguments which are \"culturally founded\" have no place in the law, but that's just your opinion, and there isn't generally anything preventing a state from making law based on such things, should its elected legislature see fit to do so. (Indeed, one could argue that nearly all laws are in some sense \"culturally founded\", since they are based on some notion of what kind of behavior is or is not appropriate, and those tend to be culturally based.)\n\nSo legally speaking, the states aren't, by default, obligated to give any sort of justification for the laws they made. The burden of proof is on the other side. Someone seeking to overturn those laws would have to convince a court that the laws violated some specific provision of the Constitution (or another superior law). If they couldn't convince a court of this, the law would stand.\n\nFrom what I have read, before the US Supreme Court's 2015 legalization of same\\-sex marriage in [*Obergefell v. Hodges*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges), the previous precedent was set in 1971 by the Minnesota Supreme Court in [*Baker v. Nelson*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_v._Nelson). The [decision](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14283825888588258352&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr) itself is quite short and is worthwhile to read. Quoting Wikipedia's summary, the plaintiffs claimed that Minnesota's restriction of marriage to opposite\\-sex couples violated several provisions of the US Constitution:\n\n> * First Amendment (freedom of speech and of association),\n> * Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment),\n> * Ninth Amendment (unenumerated right to privacy), and\n> * Fourteenth Amendment (fundamental right to marry under the Due Process Clause and sex discrimination contrary to the Equal Protection\n>  Clause).\n\nThe Minnesota court determined that none of the plaintiffs' objections were valid. Again, I'll refer you to the decision for the details, but the court mainly focused on their Fourteenth Amendment arguments (the others may have been addressed by the trial court, whose opinion I can't find online). They wrote:\n\n> The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, like the due process clause, is not offended by the state's classification of persons authorized to marry. There is no irrational or invidious discrimination.\n\nThey specifically rejected any analogy to bans on interracial marriage, which had been held unconstitutional in [*Loving v. Virginia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia):\n\n> But in commonsense and in a constitutional sense, there is a clear distinction between a marital restriction based merely upon race and one based upon the fundamental difference in sex.\n\nBaker appealed to the US Supreme Court, but his appeal was [dismissed](http://www.scribd.com/doc/21017674/Baker-v-Nelson-409-U-S-810-1972) \"for want of a substantial federal question,\" without any further explanation. (Nobody quite seems to understand what they meant by that, but [here](http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/headnotes/much-supreme-court-explain-opinions/) is an essay discussing the situation in a little more depth.) The effect of the dismissal was that the Minnesota court's decision became binding precedent upon the whole nation \\- laws against same\\-sex marriage didn't violate those provisions of the Constitution. And that was how matters stood for 44 years until *Obergefell*. (Of course, there was nothing to stop individual states from deciding to allow same\\-sex marriage, and some in fact did so in the meantime.)\n\nYou have suggested that laws against same\\-sex marriage were *religiously* motivated. This might suggest an argument that they would violate the [Establishment Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause) of the First Amendment. The plaintiffs in *Baker* didn't raise that point, so it wasn't considered in the Minnesota court's opinion. I don't know whether any other courts have considered it; no such argument was mentioned in the opinion in *Obergefell*.",

Hodges decision, the legal precedent set by Baker v. Nelson in 1971 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court's dismissal \"for want of a substantial federal question\" meant that state laws restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples were not considered to violate the U.S. Constitution. This allowed individual states to decide whether to allow or prohibit same-sex marriage. Some states chose to legalize it, while others maintained bans. The federal government had not imposed a nationwide ban (A is incorrect), nor had the Supreme Court ruled such bans unconstitutional (C is incorrect). States were not required to recognize same-sex marriages from other states (D is incorrect) until the Obergefell decision in 2015."

These are declarations of the form \"I believe that the facts stated in this \\[document] are true\". The documents listed here in Practice Direction 22 Statements of Truth [https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure\\-rules/civil/rules/part22/pd\\_part22\\#1\\.1](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part22/pd_part22#1.1) must have a statement of truth.

This statement should be properly formatted as outlined in Practice Direction 32 Evidence and signed by the witness. However, at trial, evidence provided by a person who does not attend will be treated as hearsay evidence. This is the most appropriate and legally recognized method among the options given.\n\nOption A is incorrect as an informal email is not a proper legal document. Option B is not allowed as only the witness themselves can present their own testimony. Option D is not mentioned as a valid method in the provided information; testimony must typically be given in person, by video link, or through a written statement."

Yes, I should have done it 10\\-20 years ago, but I didn't. So now I'm in this situation:\n\nFirst of all, I logged in to my bank (Nordea in Sweden) and discovered that it now only supported dumping data from not very long ago at all. I think it was just a couple of years, or even months. So I contacted them.\n\nThey responded that they \"will not\" give me any data that is older than 10 years, but that I can exploit a secret bug (yes, they actually said this...) on their website to basically ignore multiple error messages and force their website to keep feeding me data, until it hit 10 years back. That's when it stopped feeding any data, so I dumped the CSV and exported it into my own local database.\n\nSo now I have all my bank transactions between the first day of 2009 up until today. (Yes, that \"10 year\" limit was slightly off, so you clearly cannot trust a single word they or their website claims...)\n\nI also tried to analyze the JSON data blobs and modify the requests to fetch older data, but it just displayed error messages then.\n\nBut obviously, the bank does have all my old transactions in their real database. I don't believe for a second that they have actually thrown it away, or that they ever will.\n\nSo why won't they give it to me? They didn't state a reason, and I kept asking repeatedly in different ways, but they consistently just told me that data older than 10 years isn't available or some cryptic sentencing like that. They didn't explicitly mention it, but many other companies keep using this stupid \"GDPR\" nonsense as an excuse to not give me their data, and perhaps this is somehow related to this.\n\nBut still. This is *my own* data. Not the data of somebody else. It's my personal bank account, and I'm logged in securely to prove my identity. I'm not asking for this via e\\-mail!\n\nClearly, they are unwilling to hand it out, but is there some way for me to force them to do so against their will? That is, without \"going to court\".\n\nIt really annoys me that I don't have a full transaction history to analyze. Can they be forced/persuaded?\n\nPS: I've even offered to pay them money for it, but even if you pay them, the time limit is still \"10 years\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Businesses only keep transaction data for as long as they have to\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor a live loan account they will keep transactions while the account is live and then for as long as local law dictates (it varies but 7 years is typical). For transaction accounts it will generally be only for as long as required by law \\- typically what is required by tax law (again 7 years is typical) or as long as you can sue them under statues of limitations (2\\-5 years). Banks (and other businesses) do not keep records indefinitely.\n\n10 years seems more than necessary.",

This is typically dictated by tax laws or statutes of limitations for potential lawsuits. The answer mentions that 7 years is a typical retention period, though it can vary. The bank in the example provided 10 years of data, which is described as \"more than necessary.\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because while GDPR is mentioned, it's not cited as the reason for limited data retention. Option B is not supported by the text, which focuses on a customer's own data. Option D, while potentially true, is not mentioned as a reason in the provided information. Option C most accurately reflects the explanation given in the documentation for why banks limit transaction history."

The answer states, \"You don't need to hire an attorney,\" but goes on to explain the advantages of professional legal representation. The analogy to building your own house or repairing your own car illustrates that while self-representation is possible, it may not be the most effective approach.

In jurisdictions that have a statute of frauds, your part performance by sending checks in the lease period consistent with the lease, and the landlord's part performance by continuing to allow you to occupy the premises without objection, would probably make the statute of frauds (which generally requires a signed writing by the party against whom a lease is enforced) to be inapplicable.\n\nOn the other hand, if you materially changed a version provided by the landlord, there is a real question over whether there has been an offer and acceptance, or a meeting of the minds, agreeing to the new lease.

The tenant's signature and delivery of the lease to the landlord makes it enforceable.

John Doe then does X, and the DOJ prosecutes Doe for it.\n\nCan John successfully use the defense of \"the DOJ said they wouldn't prosecute\"? If so, what are the limitations of that defense?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is \"yes\".\n\nThere is U.S. Supreme Court authority that supports this position, In particular, *United States v. Laub*, 385 U.S. 475 (1967\\), *Cox v. Louisiana*, 379 U.S. 599 (1965\\), and *Raley v. Ohio*, 360 U.S. 423 (1959\\), stand for the proposition that a defendant may not be punished for actions taken in good faith reliance upon authoritative assurances that he will not be punished for those actions.\n\nIf the U.S. Department of Justice (or a U.S. Attorney with jurisdiction over the place the offense was committed) (hereinafter DOJ) says this, people who reasonably rely on that pronouncement can't be prosecuted until a different policy is announced and people who acted in reliance on the previous DOJ position are given a reasonable opportunity to change their conduct in response to the newly announced policy. The statement does have to be a publicly announced policy (or a policy personally communicated to the defendant or his counsel), and not just a *de facto* reality in terms of prosecutions not being brought in the past, or a secret, unannounced policy (or, for example, an unofficial and offhand statement of the U.S. Attorney General at a party that does not amount to a policy statement).\n\nOf course, the defense doesn't protect you if the DOJ says it won't prosecute if you do X, but you do X times Y which goes beyond the safe harbor created by the DOJ pronouncement.\n\nFor example, the DOJ might say that they will not prosecute conduct involving marijuana offenses that is legal under state law, if it does not violate any other laws, and also meets certain conditions found in federal law (e.g. no offenses within 1000 feet of a school) that the DOJ chooses not to refrain from enforcing.\n\nBut, if the DOJ then publicly says that it will start enforcing federal law without exceptions on July 1, 2021 and has rescinded its prior policy, a reasonable time in advance, then this defense ceases for conduct after that date. What constitutes reasonable notice would depend upon the facts and circumstances.\n\nThe DOJ can also reach a binding agreement not to prosecute a particular instance of conduct by a particular person irrevocably in connection with plea bargaining type agreements, with respect to offenses of which the DOJ has jurisdiction (but not necessarily prosecutions by a different government such as a state government or the government of another country, for which the DOJ is not an authorized representative).\n\nFor example, suppose that a mail carrier is killed by a resident of a home claiming to have acted in self\\-defense in Denver, Colorado. The DOJ could reach an irrevocable agreement with the resident to accept a plea bargain to a misdemeanor charge of not paying the tax due on the sale of the firearm from a non\\-compliant gun shop, dismissing forever the charge of murder of a federal post office employee. But that agreement would not bar the District Attorney in Denver from bringing murder charges twenty years later under state law prohibiting murder of human beings in the State of Colorado. For the defendant resident to prevent that from happening definitively, an agreement from the State of Colorado's District Attorney in Denver, or the Colorado Attorney General, would also be required.",

Six months later, John Doe is arrested in California (where marijuana is legal) for possessing 2 grams of marijuana. The DOJ decides to prosecute him under federal law. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John Doe's potential defense?\n\nA) John Doe has no valid defense because federal law supersedes state law and DOJ policy statements.\n\nB) John Doe can use the defense of reliance on the DOJ's policy statement, but it will automatically fail because the DOJ has the right to change its mind at any time.\n\nC) John Doe can successfully use the defense of reliance on the DOJ's policy statement, and the prosecution will be barred unless the DOJ had publicly rescinded its policy with reasonable notice before John Doe's arrest.\n\nD) John Doe can only use the defense of reliance on the DOJ's policy statement if he can prove he personally received the policy information directly from a DOJ official.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the Supreme Court cases mentioned (United States v. Laub, Cox v. Louisiana, and Raley v. Ohio), a defendant may not be punished for actions taken in good faith reliance on authoritative assurances that such actions would not be punished. In this case, the DOJ's public policy statement serves as such an assurance. John Doe can successfully use this as a defense unless the DOJ had publicly announced a change in policy and provided reasonable notice before John Doe's arrest. Options A and B are incorrect because they ignore the established legal principle of protection for those who rely on official statements. Option D is too restrictive, as the information states that publicly announced policies (not just personally communicated ones) can be relied upon for this defense."

Which of the following statements is true regarding the type of LLC he should form?\n\nA) John should file for a Professional Limited Liability Company because software development is considered engineering.\n\nB) John should file for a regular Limited Liability Company because software development is not explicitly listed as a profession in the Idaho Code.\n\nC) John must file for a Professional Limited Liability Company if he has any state license related to his work.\n\nD) John can choose either type of LLC, as the distinction doesn't matter for software development businesses.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, the Professional Limited Liability Company is intended for specific professions listed in the Idaho Code, which include architecture, engineering, law, medicine, etc. Software development is not explicitly listed among these professions. Additionally, the key factor in determining whether a Professional LLC is required is whether the individual has a state license for their work. As software developers typically do not require state licensing, John should file for a regular Limited Liability Company.\n\nOption A is incorrect because software development is not automatically considered engineering in this context, especially without state licensing.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while having a state license would require a Professional LLC, software developers typically don't have such licenses, and it's not a requirement for all businesses.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is a clear distinction between the two types of LLCs, and choosing the wrong one could have legal implications."

They discover a US company has a registered trademark for \"Eagle Eye\" CCTV lenses. The Australian company has some US clients. Which of the following is the most accurate assessment of the Australian company's legal situation?\n\nA) The Australian company is not at risk because they sell software, not lenses.\nB) The Australian company can continue operations as usual since they are based in Australia.\nC) The Australian company is likely to face legal challenges due to potential trademark infringement.\nD) The Australian company can easily win any legal dispute by proving they entered the market later.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Australian company is likely to face legal challenges due to potential trademark infringement. Even though they sell software rather than lenses, both products are in the CCTV industry and could cause consumer confusion. The US company's trademark covers \"Video cameras and cameras for video conferencing; computer software for voice and video conferencing and data collaboration,\" which is closely related to CCTV software. The fact that the Australian company has US clients and advertises in the US market increases the risk of a trademark dispute. The similarity in product names and website domains (Eagle-Eye.com vs EagleEye.com) further compounds the issue. In trademark law, earlier registration and use generally take precedence, putting the Australian company at a disadvantage."

This type of salary remains constant regardless of the actual number of working days in a month.

Conveniently, the software is always out of stock, while the manufacturer \u201cbackdoors\u201d some licenses to a selective group of users, at a price of $6,500\\. Then, they raffle a few licenses at the advertised price among thousands of users. I feel like this is a clear and blatant violation to fair competition but I am by no means an expert. What strikes me immediately, though, is that the Robinson\\-Patman Act deems illegal the \u201cprice differences in the sell of identical goods that cannot be justified on the basis of cost savings or meeting a competitor\u2019s price.\u201d As software licenses are identical, I believe the act is violated. I have two questions:\n\n1. what other regulations this practice might be violating?\n2. is this something I can report to the FTC or other authority?\n3. do I need a lawyer to do it?\n\n**Edit:** It seems the post has been popular and there are additional questions as for why manufacturers do this. There is a whole secondary market for this type of software. Users buy and sell licenses at way\\-above\\-retail prices. For the software in turn, Nyte Software, retail is $599 and resell price has reached $7K at some point, in secondary markets. Manufacturers sell the copies at resale value to a select group of users, under strict rules imposed to the users on the prices they can resell the software at, all while the software is labeled as \"out of stock\" in their webpage (why keep the advertising of $599 in their webpage, right?). In this way, manufacturers control the market prices, while they cash through increasing the supply.\n\nAdditional competition questions that arise are about price manipulation through social media (manufacturers often intensively advertise the success of the software in social media to drive prices up, before selling), unfair product sale (cherry\\-pick buyers) and price control (strict resale rules). In [this blog post](https://econosneakers.blogspot.com/2021/06/the-bot-market-i-basics-incentives-to.html?m=1), there is an example that shows the different things these software manufacturers do, relating to their software distribution and market practices.

This question, and all details of the hypothetical case at hand, merely arose from a discussion I recently had, and the law surrounding it intrigued me.*\n\n**Facts of this hypothetical case**\n\nJoanne is the mother of Jordan, who is fourteen years old. She is a single mother after she left her ex\\-boyfriend, because he abused her. She's a manager at her local supermarket. She is also a content creator on the platform OnlyFans, where she makes large sums of money posting explicit content of herself. Jordan was unaware, until a certain point, that her mother had an OnlyFans account.\n\nOne day, at school, Jordan's peers reveal to him, in brutally humiliating fashion, that they have discovered his mother's OnlyFans account. Not only that, but an unknown source has leaked some of the content she uploads there. This leads to intense bullying. For a fortnight, Jordan is too embarrassed to speak about it to anyone. However, he eventually opens up to his mother about the bullying, and that it has been caused by her content on OnlyFans. He pleads with her to, at the least, engage in what he considers damage control, and delete the account, and that the extra money isn't a necessity. Despite this, Joanne refuses and continues to upload and sell content on OnlyFans.\n\nThe onslaught of teasing and bullying against Jordan continues. After around a month, he musters the courage to discuss his plight with his teachers. Much to his disbelief and frustration, the teachers say that, while they have noticed \u2018unusual\u2019 behaviour towards him, in class, for a while now, and while that behaviour may have indicia of bullying, they don't have enough evidence to take any action that would make a difference. In fact, they find the entire ordeal incredibly awkward themselves (though this they do not explicitly mention).\n\nAround a month and a half have elapsed since the first instance of bullying, and the bullying has not ceased. Jordan contemplates moving schools, but he convinces himself that it's futile, because, to him, everyone around his age in his town knows about his mother's OnlyFans account. Ultimately, after an acrimonious argument with his mother, in which he pleads one more time for her to delete her OnlyFans account, and she refuses, Jordan takes his own life.\n\n**Questions of law**\n\n1. In England and Wales, could Joanne be found guilty of gross\\-negligence manslaughter?\n2. Does any American state have a statute under which Joanne would be liable for her son's death?\n3. In any jurisdiction, could anyone but Joanne, in light of the aforementioned circumstances, face liability for Jordan's death?\n\nThanks in advance for any responses, and I apologise in advance if you find either the hypothetical or the questions asinine.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does any American state have a statute under which Joanne would be\n> liable for her son's death?\n\nProbably not. None of the mother's conduct seems like a basis for a homicide prosecution.\n\nSuicide is only prosecuted, in states that allow it to be prosecuted at all, for conduct with a calculated purpose to cause a suicide, or encouragement of someone to commit suicide. These facts don't show that. There is no intent to cause suicide and there is no encouragement of the son to commit suicide by on the mother.\n\nA survey of selected laws on point by the Connecticut Legislative Research Service can be found [here](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0197.pdf).\n\nThe case law and related legal theory is reviewed and analyzed in [this law review article](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/american-criminal-law-review/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2019/01/56-1-The-Puzzle-of-Inciting-Suicide.pdf) with the following abstract:\n\n> In 2017, a Massachusetts court convicted Michelle Carter of\n> manslaughter for encouraging the suicide of Conrad Roy by text\n> message, but imposed a sentence of only fifteen months. The conviction\n> was unprecedented in imposing homicide liability for verbal\n> encouragement of apparently voluntary suicide. Yet if Carter killed,\n> her purpose that Roy die arguably merited liability for murder and a\n> much longer sentence. This Article argues that our ambivalence about\n> whether and how much to punish Carter reflects suicide\u2019s dual\n> character as both a harm to be prevented and a choice to be respected.\n> As such, the Carter case requires us to choose between competing\n> conceptions of criminal law, one utilitarian and one libertarian. A\n> utilitarian criminal law seeks to punish inciting suicide to reduce\n> harm. A libertarian criminal law, on the other hand, justifies\n> voluntary suicide as an exercise of liberty, and incitement of suicide\n> as valuable speech. Utilitarian values are implicit in the\n> foreseeability standards prevailing in the law of causation, but\n> libertarian values are implicit in the reluctance of prosecutors to\n> seek, and legislatures to define, homicide liability for assisting\n> suicide. The prevalence of statutes punishing assisting\u2014but not\n> encouraging\u2014suicide as a nonhomicide offense reflects a compromise\n> between these values. These statutes are best interpreted as imposing\n> accomplice liability for conduct left unpunished for two antithetical\n> reasons: it is justified in so far as the suicide is autonomous and\n> excused in so far as the suicide is involuntary. This explains why\n> aiding suicide is punished, but less severely than homicide. Yet even\n> these statutes would not punish Carter\u2019s conduct of encouragement\n> alone. Her conviction although seemingly required by prevailing\n> causation doctrine, is unprecedented.\n\nGuyora Binder and Luis Chiesa, \"The Puzzle of Inciting Suicide\" 56 American Criminal Law Review 65 (2019\\).\n\n> In any jurisdiction, could anyone but Joanne, in light of the\n> aforementioned circumstances, face liability for Jordan's death?\n\nMaybe the bullies could be prosecuted for homicide or some lesser charge like harassment intended to provoke a suicide or something like that. More facts would have to be developed on that point.\n\nMaybe teachers have civil liability for negligence, but not criminal liability for not intervening since they didn't intend to cause or encourage the suicide.",

Since you have a duty to prove that you received valid consent, it may be necessary to keep longer\\-term records.\n\nConsent is one legal basis among many\n-------------------------------------\n\nWhen processing any personal data within the scope of the GDPR, it is necessary to have a \u201clegal basis\u201d.\n\n* Clearly, you can process data for the purpose of fulfilling a contract with the user, such as providing a service that the user requested.\n* And using the data as legally required is also fine, for example keeping financial records for tax purposes.\n* Some processing activities are not core to providing the application's service, but might be necessary for a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d. This requires conducting a \u201cbalancing test\u201d where that interest is weighed against the interests and rights for the user. For example, keeping security logs is typically covered by a legitimate interest.\n* Finally, some activities are not strictly necessary and cannot be reasonably expected by users. Then, it is necessary to ask the user for their consent. For example, you might need consent for sharing data with an ad network. Or for loading an embedded YouTube video (but I repeat myself). Many applications can work just fine without ever having to ask for consent.\n\nIn some cases, consent is legally mandated in order to alert the user. Such consent is often necessary when dealing with \u201cspecial categories\u201d of data, such as health information.\n\nConsent is also mandated when storing or accessing information on the user's device, unless this is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user (and thus expected by the user). This is known as the \u201ccookie law\u201d, but it applies to any technical means to access/store information, and also applies if the information doesn't qualify as GDPR personal data.\n\nWhen trying to obtain valid consent, a number of criteria must be fulfilled. Consent is a freely given, specific, and informed indication of the data subject's wishes. You can't coerce the user. You can't make access to a service conditional on unrelated consent.\n\nDemonstrating that you obtained valid consent\n---------------------------------------------\n\nImportantly, it is *our* responsibility as a data controller to demonstrate that you obtained valid consent. I would separate this condition into two parts:\n\n* existence: demonstrate that you obtained consent from that user\n* validity: demonstrate that you obtained consent in a valid manner\n\nFor demonstrating validity, you might save snapshots from the consent flow of our application, showing that the user was sufficiently informed and that they could decline consent without detriment. You should be able to reproduce what the user was told at the time.\n\nFor demonstrating the existence of consent, it is common to keep explicit records: when did who give consent, with which version of the consent flow? When was the consent withdrawn? Sometimes, this is done by storing a history of consent\\-related events, and retaining them for later auditing.\n\nYou don't have to go overboard here. You can decide how you can demonstrate consent appropriately given the circumstances of your applications.\n\nRelation between consent and technologies like OAuth or device permissions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome technologies impose consent flows. For example, mobile OSes and web browsers will ask the user for consent before microphone or location access is granted to an app/website. OAuth authorization flows will generally ask the user for consent to authorize some third\\-party application to perform some actions.\n\nSuch technological flows may be part of a GDPR consent flow, but are not sufficient to achieve GDPR consent. For example, the user might not have sufficient information from the consent flow alone in order to make an informed decision.\n\nIt is also possible that the user has to go through a consent flow for technical reasons, even though you don't need consent from a GDPR perspective.\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* [Art 7 GDPR \u201cConditions for consent\u201d](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/)\n* [EDPB guidelines 05/2020 on consent (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en)\n* [UK ICO guidelines on consent](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/consent) (technically only UK GDPR, but often more actionable than EDPB advice)",

This scenario would most likely require explicit user consent under GDPR.\n\nD) Keeping financial records for tax purposes falls under the legal basis of legal obligation and does not require separate user consent.\n\nThe correct answer is C because sharing data with third-party advertisers is a common scenario where explicit consent is typically required under GDPR, as it's not necessary for the core service and involves sharing personal data with external parties."

The language was passed as part of [HR 5005](https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/5005), becoming Public Law 107\\-296, and this provision now appears at [49 USC 44921](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/44921). \n\nThe exact text of this provision is:\n\n> A Federal flight deck officer shall not be liable for damages in any action brought in a Federal or State court arising out of the acts or omissions of the officer in defending the flight deck of an aircraft against acts of criminal violence or air piracy unless the officer is guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\nThe language makes it clear that this is only referring to *civil* liability. So, if the officer is defending the flight deck, and they are sued for damages resulting from their actions, the plaintiff will not win (assuming the law is correctly applied). But this law says nothing about whether or not they can be prosecuted for a crime. In any case, the officer in your example does not appear to have been defending the flight deck, so this law wouldn't apply at all.\n\nIn your example, the officer's defense against a murder charge would probably be based on *defense of others*. There is a discussion on [Justia](https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/self-defense/). It seems that a key question would be whether shooting the unruly passenger was *proportional* \\- was there a reasonable fear that the passenger was actually going to *kill* someone?",

However, this protection does not extend to criminal charges. The officer may still face criminal prosecution, such as for murder, and would need to rely on defenses like \"defense of others.\" Additionally, the civil liability protection only applies when defending the flight deck, which may not be the case in this scenario with an unruly passenger elsewhere on the plane. Therefore, option C is the most accurate, as it recognizes the limited civil protection while acknowledging the possibility of criminal charges."

My interpretation is that it means with exception of. \n\nHere's how it's written,\n\nOn page 29 of the 5th Amendment, the definition of education is outlined for the Education Trust. It is:\n\n3. Definition of \"Education.\" Notwithstanding subparagraph 5(b) of Article Twenty of this agreement, as used in this Article only, the term \"education\" shall mean only undergraduate and graduate study leading to a degree, in any and all fields whatsoever, whether of a professional character or otherwise, at an accredited university, college, or other institution of higher learning, whether public or private. The activities described in this paragraph may be carried on either in the United States or elsewhere. In determining payments to be made for all such education, the Trustee shall take into account and may pay for the beneficiary's reasonable costs of tuition, room, board (whether or not charged by an educational institution at which such individual shall be a student), books, laboratory or other equipment or tools (including computer hardware and software), fees, travel to and from school, transportation and charges for tutoring.\n\nThank you so much for any input and observations.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What is the meaning of notwithstanding in this context?\n\nThe clause that starts with \"*notwithstanding*\" narrows down the levels of studies that are eligible for payment by the Trustee(s). In other words, for purposes of payment of benefits, \"*education*\" can be interpreted only as \"*undergraduate and graduate study*\", and thus it overrides \\-\\-only pursuant to that clause\\-\\- the wide encompassing notion of \"*education*\" as defined in [paragraph 5(b)](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/49785/18505).\n\nThe clause implies that *any other* levels of studies, such as \"*elementary or high schools*\", are not eligible for payment by the Trustee(s).\n\nThe inclusion of \"*notwithstanding*\" seems intended to reflect the *awareness* of apparent discrepancy of the definitions of \"*education*\", and to consequently clarify the *intent* that paragraph 5(b) be regarded as the appropriate definition of \"*education*\" for everything except the matter of payments.",

What is the most accurate interpretation of its use in this scenario?\n\nA) It means that the definition of education in this clause completely replaces any other definition in the entire Trust document.\n\nB) It indicates that the definition of education in this clause applies in addition to other definitions found elsewhere in the Trust document.\n\nC) It signifies that the definition of education in this clause applies specifically for the purpose of determining eligible payments, overriding other definitions only in this context.\n\nD) It suggests that the definition of education in this clause is optional and Trustees can choose whether to apply it or not.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct interpretation is that \"notwithstanding\" in this context means the definition of education provided in the clause applies specifically for determining eligible payments under the Education Trust, overriding other definitions only for this purpose. It doesn't completely replace other definitions (A), nor does it apply in addition to them (B). It's not optional for Trustees to apply (D). The use of \"notwithstanding\" here serves to narrow down the eligible levels of study for payment purposes, specifically to undergraduate and graduate studies, while acknowledging that a broader definition may exist elsewhere in the document for other purposes."

However what happens on a large website where users can upload images as they wish. Moderators can't be educated on whether every user has permission to publish that image. In the event that a user posts a copyright image that they do have have permission for on a community forum, how to the website owners protect themselves from a claim?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the USA, you are covered by the DMCA act, which you should most definitely read. \n\nI can't sue you and your website for copyright infringement unless I first send you a DMCA takedown notice. (Of course I can sue, but I will lose). \n\nIn the DMCA notice I have to tell you who I am so that you can contact me, I have to tell you under perjury that I am the copyright holder or an agent of the copyright holder of some work, and that I believe your website is infringing on that copyright. You then have the choice to remove the material, which means I cannot sue you for copyright infringement because you acted on my DMCA notice, or you can refuse to remove it and I can include you in a copyright infringement lawsuit. By not acting on a DMCA notice you take full responsibility. \n\nIf you remove the material, you should inform the person who uploaded it. That person can decide to be Ok with the removal (and hope they won't get sued for copyright infringement, and they usually will be fine), or they can send you a counter notice. That counter notice would tell you that the uploader believes he or she isn't infringing any copyright. After receiving a counter notice, you may reinstate the material, and you tell the sender of the DMCA notice. Again, you are now legally protected.

This approach follows the DMCA process and maintains the website owner's legal protection. \n\nOption A is incorrect because permanently deleting content and banning users is not required by the DMCA and could be seen as overreaching.\n\nOption B is incorrect because ignoring a valid counter-notice goes against the DMCA procedure and could potentially expose the website owner to legal action from the user.\n\nOption D is incorrect because forwarding the counter-notice to law enforcement is not part of the DMCA process.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was disputing with one person about buying software licenses. For example, on ebay/aliexpress there are offers to buy Microsoft Office for 2 USD or Adobe PhotoShop for 3 USD. For me, it cannot be true and probably licenses are illegal. But another person argued that it does not matter until software works and in worst\\-case he will lose that 2\\-3 USD.\n\nMy question is not about if this kind of software is legal or illegal (probably not). My question is about the legal responsibility of a person who lives in the western world (USA/European Union) and bought these things.\n\nIf a person truly believed that this license is legal when he was buying software. If the person did not know that license is illegal. Will it lead to any legal consequences for him? What will be the worst\\-case scenario? Will he go to jail or he will have to just delete this software and lost 2 USD?\n\nUPDATE 1:\n\nPlease only consider the case when the person bought it and installed it successfully on his own PC for personal use only. He really uses it and it works fine. He did not give it to someone else. He did not share it. He did not put it on the Internet. Only 1 installation to 1 home PC for personal use.\n\nDo not consider companies, the question is only about personal use. Everything related to business is much more complicated.\n\nAlso, situation, when the person bought the software but did not install/use it, does not make any sense. Do not consider it.\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nAs I understand from answers and comments, basically there is no difference from the legal point of view between buying and installing $2 license or downloading/installing from crazy sites for free (for example Microsoft Office, which normal price from vendor Microsoft is $150\\).\n\nLet's say there are 2 situations:\n\n1. Normal person, has no much knowledge in IT (waiter in the restaurant, construction worker, etc.). The person wants to buy Microsoft Office for home use. He just wants to write a nice CV to get a better job. He saw Microsoft Office a few times in his current job and wants to have it at home. He has no idea who much it really cost. What he did: Google \"buy cheap Microsoft Office\", open ebay/aliexpress, click buy, download, install. done. everything works for him for $2\\. He also read on the seller side or contacted the seller, that this license is legal and the whole page of explanation why it is so cheap. What did he do wrong?\n2. IT Professional who knows how much is it. He was using it for 20 years in the office, etc. He buys/downloads it from ebay/aliexpress for $2 and pretends that he has the legal license and did not know that it is fake, but of course, he knows that 95% it is not.\n\nIs there any difference between these 2 cases from the legal point of view or worst\\-case Legal consequences will be the same? Or what would be \"worst\\-case Legal consequences\" and \"most probable Legal consequences\" in case if it will be revealed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, it is possible that the software is in fact legal. Copies of older versions bought in bulk for resale but never sold are sometimes sold at large discounts because no one will buy them at more normal prices. And there are other scenarios (such as OEM licenses) under which these might be legal. In that case, there is no problem for anyone.\n\nIf these are not legal, they may not come with a valid product key. In that case, they may not install properly, and the purchaser would have nothing of value. Or they might come with a valid, but non\\-unique key. In that case, they might install, but not provide product support if any is ever needed.\n\nIn either of these cases, the seller is probably committing copyright infringement, and could be sued should the copyright holder become aware of it. It is possible that the seller is even committing criminal copyright infringement, but even if that is so, prosecutions are rare. But the purchaser is not committing infringement. The purchaser did not make any copies, nor distribute any. Thus the purchaser could not be sued, much less charged with a crime.\n\nMany large companies have agreements with software vendors not to use pirates software, and under these regularly check their networks for unauthorized copies of software. If an employee installs unauthorized software on a company machine such checks may find it, in which case it may be deleted and the employee may be in trouble with his or her boss. But that doesn't apply to a private individual installing software on a private computer not used for work.",

According to the information provided, the purchaser who merely buys and installs the software for personal use is unlikely to face legal consequences. This is because they did not engage in copying or distributing the software, which are the primary actions that constitute copyright infringement. The text specifically states that \"the purchaser is not committing infringement\" and \"could not be sued, much less charged with a crime.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because criminal charges for copyright infringement are rare, especially for end-users, and usually target distributors.\n\nOption B is partially true but overstated. While the belief in legitimacy might be a mitigating factor, it doesn't guarantee immunity from all potential legal issues.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the information suggests that the individual purchaser is not likely to face a civil lawsuit either, as they did not commit acts of infringement.\n\nThe correct answer reflects that while the seller might be liable for copyright infringement, the end-user who simply purchases and uses the software is unlikely to face legal repercussions."

Some employees, particularly young single mothers, find this requirement financially burdensome. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal situation regarding this policy?\n\nA) The employer can legally require all employees to comply with the testing policy, regardless of their personal circumstances or the original terms of employment.\n\nB) The employer cannot enforce this policy unless it was explicitly included in the original employment contract.\n\nC) The employer can terminate employees who do not comply with the policy if they are at-will employees, but cannot legally force them to take the tests.\n\nD) The employer must provide free testing or cannot enforce the policy at all.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In at-will employment situations, which are common in many US states, employers can terminate employees for any reason that is not discriminatory against protected groups. While the employer cannot legally force employees to take the tests if this wasn't part of the original employment agreement, they can choose to terminate employees who do not comply with the new policy. This is because at-will employment allows for changes in working conditions, and employees who do not agree can be let go. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the employer can implement the policy, they cannot legally force employees to comply if it wasn't in the original agreement. \n\nAnswer B is too restrictive; even if not in the original contract, new policies can be implemented in at-will employment situations.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the employer is not obligated to provide free testing or completely abandon the policy. They can implement the policy and terminate non-compliant employees, even if it creates a financial burden for some."

This logo design consists of letters that represent the name of the company but also incorporate a silhouette of a city skyline merged with these letters. I found a simple city skyline silhouette through a Google Search. I modified it slightly and incorporated it into the logo design. The image vector was listed as royalty free. I have since learned that \"royalty free\" obviously does not mean it is free to use in the manner that I intended. I have found this same image in more than one place, with different contributor/artist names listed in association with it.\n\nThe company I am making the logo for intends to use it obviously to represent their business, but also intends to place the logo on clothing and other items that potentially may be sold by the company as merchandise in addition to their regular course of business.\n\nWill there be problems with the logo if it incorporates the image described above? And if so, are there any ways around it, other than trying to design my own city silhouette to replace it? \n\nHere is the link to the original I downloaded to use and the site from which I downloaded it: [https://www.kisspng.com/png\\-birmingham\\-skyline\\-silhouette\\-royalty\\-free\\-skyline\\-750511/preview.html](https://www.kisspng.com/png-birmingham-skyline-silhouette-royalty-free-skyline-750511/preview.html)\n\nUPDATE: I sent the following email to this site regarding the image in this link, [https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty\\-free\\-vector/birmingham\\-silhouette\\-vector\\-6709511](https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/birmingham-silhouette-vector-6709511) \n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nIs it allowed for me to download and use the shape of the city outline incorporated in this image (see ID and link below), modified slightly, as part of a larger logo design to be used by a for profit company? For clarification, I do not intend to use this entire image, but only the solid black portion to be merged with letters of the company logo.\n\nI attempted to contact the Contributor/Artist directly, but did not see that contact info on your site. If you can provide it, and it is necessary to contact said artist, please let me know. \n\nImage ID: 6709511 \n\nTheir response was: \n\nDear Brandy, \n\nYes you can use our images in this way, \nBest Regards / Admin Team \n\nBased on the Answers I have received so far, it is clear that the best option is to just bite the bullet and create from scratch the silhouette of city skyline I want to incorporate into the logo. That said, the Company I am making the design for has seen the original design and really does NOT want it changed, unless I can convince them of the legal ramifications for not doing so. Would this site's terms and provided image make any difference in what I am trying to accomplish for this company? (I assume that based on your answers, that because the image in this latter link is similar to images that i have found elsewhere that it means their authorization to use the image \"in this way\" is in doubt).\n\nThanks again,\n\nBrandy \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I have found this same image in more than one place, with different contributor/artist names listed in association with it.\n\nThat means that you cannot trust that **any** of these are the original artist or the current copyright holder. \n\nIf you were to use this image as part of the logo design, both you and your client could be sued for copyright infringement by whoever is the actual copyright holder, and damages could be based on your income or profits obtained using the image. \n\nYou will need either to design your own image from a blank start, or use an image from a **reliable** stock image site, probably one with a fee attached, that will guarantee (not just \"believe\") the copyright status of an image and the usage rights you will obtain. \n\nIt is unlikely that any image designed for computer use and found on the internet will be in the public domain, although some will have permissive licenses that allow reuse under specified conditions.

Others such as [this](https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/) are creative commons.\n\nFrom my understanding, on one hand, you can't \"copyright\" something that is recorded (I read that somewhere). You can't copyright a record of the rainfall statistics, or a collection of phone numbers or addresses in a phone book. I am not sure why exactly, but it sort of makes sense. This data is part of \"nature\", it is \"public\". The same with stuff like fossils. They grew out of nature and so are part of the public. But hmm, maybe if they were found on private property (someones private land), maybe then they would be considered not public, not sure. But it makes sense to me that fossils or records of phone numbers aren't copyrightable because they are public / natural data.\n\nWhich makes me wonder about \"data\". If someone has data in a database *about* natural stuff, like the data at the above fossil sites (images of fossils, or metadata of fossils such as [this](https://paleobiodb.org/classic/basicCollectionSearch?collection_no=56767)), then that is still technically something from nature. That is, it is public information / a public resource. But then maybe not. A website that tracks user behavior, that data is private. But that would make sense because the website is like a business with private access and which they own the transactions. So that just gets me more confused.\n\nAlso, I know photographers stuff is protected under copyright, even though it is of nature. But maybe there is a boundary between \"documentation photos\" and \"creative photos\". This may be why the museums can limit the use of their photos to personal/educational use.\n\nSo to summarize, I'm wondering a few things:\n\n1. If database records (just the metadata part) of natural resources can by copyrighted.\n2. If the *use* of database records (metadata) of natural resources can be limited in scope by a provider (not sure if this is the same thing as copyright).\n3. Same for the images.\n\nBasically just would like to understand better what data can and can't be copyrighted to prevent certain uses.\n\nA related example is digitizing a public domain book. The book *content* is public domain. But if someone hosts a digitized book (that is, an image of the content), I wonder if they can say \"you can only use this for personal use\". Or if they go one step further than just pasting an image online of a public domain work (like archive.org does), and instead post the unicode textual data of the book, if that can be copyrighted (that is, if they can say \"you can only use this for personal use\"). By textual form I mean, more than just a PDF/image of the book, but something you can actually copy\\-paste into a Word document or text editor. So we know the *content* is public domain. Then in the case of archive.org we know the *images* of the content are public domain. Next to know is if the text that was taken out of the image and put into a text document is public domain. The reason is because technically it does require technology/work to create the *artifact* at each step ($10,000 digitizing tools to digitize books at scale, or complicated/private OCR technology for getting the text from the images, or the work of manually entering in the text by looking at the image or book directly).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright protects literary and artistic expression, not facts.\n\nSo, in a database, the structure of the tables, the construction of the queries and the presentation of the user interface are all subject to copyright. The data stored in each record is not subject to copyright if it is a fact but is subject if it is a literary or artistic work. For example, in the IMDb database, the name of a film, the year it was made, the director\u2019s name, the actors\u2019 names etc. are not copyright, however, the star ratings, the reviews, the table structure, the queries and the user interface all are.\n\nFor your fossil example, the fossil, where it was found, who found it, when etc. are all non\\-copyrightable facts. Any photographs of it, drawings of it or scientific writing about it are all copyright because they all involve creative transformation of the fossil.\n\nThat creativity is key.\n\nFor the book, if the scanning is automated and the text is generated by OCR then there is no new copyright. If a human makes editing or compositional choices, there is.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As I understand it, many corporations have provisions in their articles of incorporation that allow them to issue new shares (or options) by board vote and give those shares to themselves or their friends and thereby dilute the value of shares held by other existing shareholders. So, for example, a minority shareholder could essentially have their stake in a company reduced to zero.\n\nThis just seems like theft to me. What is the legal basis for it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Corporations are creatures of statute. In the U.S., the vast majority of corporations (99\\.9999%) are organized under state or territorial, rather than federal law. Those statutes generally authorize the issuance of new shares for new consideration, although the process by which this is authorized differs from state to state.\n\nThese statutes or case law also usually impose fiduciary duties, or at least some sort of duties, on the board and majority shareholders to minority shareholders. Sometimes this is also called the law of \"majority oppression.\" Some corporate statutes also allow minority to cash out if dilution is alleged.\n\nIssuance of new shares only dilutes existing shareholders when the price of the new shares is less that the per share market capitalization of the old shares. If the price is the same, the value of the existing shares doesn't change. If the price is lower, the new shares dilute existing shares. If the price is higher, the new shares increase the value of existing shares.\n\nA bright line rule is difficult because the value of shares is not self\\-evident and is to some extent a matter of opinion upon which informed people can differ to some extent. So, a blanket prohibition makes no sense and it isn't a good fit for \"theft\". \"Theft\" usually involves an actual taking of property (like a share) not merely a change in its value, which can happen for all sorts of legitimate reasons as well as illegitimate ones.\n\nSince shareholders are usually similarly situated, in an arms\\-length transaction, corporations will not knowingly issue new shares that dilute existing shareholders. Instead, this only happens when there is collusion between controlling shareholders/board members and new share purchasers, something that mostly happens in closely held companies and is where the case law on the duties of boards and majority shareholders arises.",

Which of the following legal concepts or remedies is MOST applicable in this situation?\n\nA) Criminal theft charges against the board members\nB) Breach of fiduciary duty claim\nC) Federal securities fraud lawsuit\nD) Automatic nullification of the new share issuance\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect. While the shareholder may feel that this action is theft-like, it doesn't meet the legal definition of criminal theft, which typically involves the actual taking of property.\n\nB) Correct. This situation likely involves a breach of fiduciary duty. Board members and majority shareholders often have fiduciary duties to minority shareholders, and issuing shares at below-market value to friends and family could violate these duties. This concept falls under what's sometimes called the law of \"majority oppression.\"\n\nC) Incorrect. While this might involve securities, it's unlikely to be a federal securities fraud case. Most corporations are governed by state law, and this situation is more likely to be addressed under state corporate law.\n\nD) Incorrect. There is no automatic nullification for such actions. While the minority shareholder might seek to challenge the issuance, it wouldn't be automatically voided without legal action.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the importance of fiduciary duties in corporate governance and the legal protections available to minority shareholders in cases of potential oppression by majority shareholders or board members."

The shorthand definition for UPL is usually given as something like \"doing what lawyers do.\" When your \"help\" goes beyond \"studying law\" and begins to deal with applying that law to a particular legal matter, you're definitely in the neighborhood. If you're encouraging people to compensate you monetarily, even on the sly (or perhaps especially on the sly) that's just going to make it shadier. \n\nThere's no clear line that divides \"assistance\" from \"advice\" or \"information\" from \"counsel.\" You're not going to find a statute or professional rule that helpfully explains just how close you can get to UPL through wink\\-wink\\-nudge\\-nudge \"unofficial\\-but\\-maybe\\-you\\-should\\-still\\-pay\\-me\" legal \"information\\-but\\-not\\-advice\" before liability attaches, which seems to be the drift of the question (although I understand it was edited).\n\n***People v.

The definition above quoted from People v.

While Bob clarifies he's not a lawyer, his actions go beyond simply studying law or providing general information. By offering help with a specific legal matter (the landlord-tenant dispute) and suggesting payment for a favorable outcome, Bob is treading into territory typically reserved for licensed attorneys. In California, UPL is defined flexibly and situationally, often described as \"doing what lawyers do.\" The suggestion of payment, even indirectly, makes the situation more problematic from a legal standpoint. There's no clear line between \"assistance\" and \"advice,\" but Bob's actions, particularly the implied request for payment based on the case outcome, likely cross into UPL territory."

There are plenty of intellectual properties that can't be kept secret. The most obvious ones would be a writer, musician or composer \\- the whole reason for their work is to publish it and make it available to as many people as possible. How could that possibly be a trade secret? Similar with trademarks. The whole point of a trademark is to be widely visible.\n\nAnd there are patents. Here the situation is different. Before patent law, inventors kept their inventions indeed secret. Then people realised that this secrecy is in the way of progress. So patent law was created, which gives an inventor rights beyond those of a trade secret, at the cost of having to publish their invention. Even if you invent today, you have the choice of keeping your invention secret and relying on trade secret law, or patenting it and relying on patent law. Again, some inventions are clearly visible. When the bycicle was invented, it was clearly visible to everyone and couldn't be kept secret.",

Trade secrets must be kept confidential, which makes them unsuitable for works meant to be widely distributed, such as books, music, or visible products like bicycles. Patents offer protection for inventions that might be visible or easily reverse-engineered, while also promoting progress by requiring public disclosure. Trademarks are specifically designed to be widely visible. Each form of protection has its place depending on the nature of the intellectual property in question.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it ignores the limitations of trade secrets for publicly visible or distributed works. Answer B is false because trade secrets are not always preferable, especially for creations that need to be public. Answer D is incorrect as patents were created to complement trade secrets, not replace them entirely, and inventors can still choose between patent protection and trade secret protection depending on their needs."

Of course, if there are, the answer would have to be just \"yes,\" because giving or reading examples would be illegal.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are not \"illegal thoughts\" in the abstract, but what you are thinking can make the difference between something being a crime or a basis for bringing a lawsuit, and actions being non\\-criminal or not a basis for any legal liability.\n\nIf you fire someone because they are black, you've engaged in actionable employment discrimination. If you fire the same person, in the same circumstances, because you've noticed that they were late to work by 10 minutes every day this month but recorded their hours as if they came on time, you've acted legally.\n\nIf you shoot someone in bear suit hovering over your toddler in your backyard at twilight believing it is a bear, you haven't committed a crime. If you realize that the person in the bear suit is your husband playing a prank and shoot anyway, you are guilty of aggravated assault or attempted murder if he lives, and murder if he doesn't.\n\nIf you buy a $200 refrigerator thinking that it's a bankruptcy fire sale price, you are not guilty of anything. But, if you know that the refrigerator was stolen because you hear the store owner talking about it in the back room, you are committing the crime of trafficking in stolen goods if you buy it.\n\nIf you record a song because it just comes to you when you've never heard it before, you haven't infringed a copyright. But if you've heard it (at least if you remember it) and then record it, you've infringed the copyright in the song (assuming you don't get permission to do so and the copyright is still valid, etc.).\n\nWhat a person committing an act is thinking is part of what must be proven in court for someone to be guilty or liable in the case of all but a small minority of crimes and torts (i.e. civil wrongs which can be the basis of a lawsuit). Often, the element that involves what you are thinking as one part of a case that must be established in court is described with the latin phrase *[mens rea](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mens_rea)* (which translates literally as \"guilty mind\").\n\nConversely, sometimes thoughts are not crimes or torts unless there are actions taken in connection with the thoughts.\n\nIf you carefully plan out a murder, but take no concrete actions to carry out your plan, you haven't committed a crime or tort. But, if you have planned out a murder and take significant affirmative acts to carry it out, you've committed attempted murder, even if those acts might not have constituted attempted murder if you took those actions for purposes unrelated to a plan to commit a murder.\n\nSimilarly, if you imagine a seven year old having sex with you in your head, you haven't committed a crime (although if you are a sex offender, doing so might prevent you from receiving parole), but if you download or make a video depicting that act, you've committed a crime.",

The passage emphasizes that a person's thoughts or intentions at the time of an action can be a crucial factor in determining whether that action constitutes a crime or civil wrong. This is exemplified by several examples in the text, such as the difference between firing someone due to racial discrimination versus legitimate reasons, or the distinction between accidentally shooting someone in a bear costume versus intentionally shooting a known person.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage clearly states that there are no \"illegal thoughts\" in the abstract, and thoughts alone without actions are not typically grounds for prosecution.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because the text explicitly mentions mens rea as an important concept in most crimes and torts, describing it as a necessary element to be proven in court.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the passage provides multiple examples where the underlying thoughts or motivations can indeed make the difference between a legal and illegal action, even if the surface-level action appears the same."

The contract states \"Green shall solicit and negotiate contracts with qualified independent contractors approved by Blue owners for repairs to the property motorcycles\".\n\nDoes that statement prevent our firm, Blue, from contacting and negotiating contracts directly with contractors to repair our motorcycles?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In other words, you are asking if the contract is exclusive.\n\nMy own opinion is that there is more than one fair reading of the contract language in isolation. One possible reading is that \"for repairs to the property motorcycles\" has an implied meaning \"for repairs to all of the property motorcycles of Blue\" and the other is that it has an implied mean \"for repairs to all of the property motorcycles of Blue that it directs us to do work upon.\"\n\nMy first step to resolve that ambiguity would be to look at the definition of \"property motorcycles\" in the contract, and also to any other terms of the contract that would suggest that it is an \"exclusive\" contract as opposed to a master \"supply\" contract with an indefinite amount of work.\n\nFor example, if the price were a fixed one every month, not dependent upon how much work was done, that would tend to suggest an exclusive contract. Similarly, if the contract also contained a geographic scope or a non\\-competition term that would suggest that it was an exclusive contract.\n\nOn the other hand, if the arrangement were a fee for service payment and the mechanics under the contract of arranging for maintenance were such that this was really up to Blue, it might be read differently.\n\nIf the entire language of the contract read together left the ambiguity in place, it would be appropriate to look to extrinsic evidence such as the course of dealings of the parties and the discussions that went into negotiating the contract in order to determine the intent of the parties at the time that the contract was entered into in order to resolve that ambiguity.\n\nIt isn't at all uncommon for the meaning of a contract term in isolation to have more than one possible reading when taken in isolation. Often, it is necessary to refer to a greater context to describe its meaning. Sometimes, the overall context will even demand that a term in a contract be given the reading that is less plausible when it is read in isolation because the overall context of the contract manifests an intent and scheme that makes the more obvious reading a poor fit to the overall scheme of the agreement.",

As the documentation suggests, there could be multiple interpretations of the clause. It's unclear whether the contract grants Green exclusive rights to manage all repairs or if it's a non-exclusive arrangement. To determine if Blue Corp's actions are permissible, more context is needed, such as:\n\n1. The definition of \"property motorcycles\" in the contract\n2. Other terms that might suggest exclusivity or non-exclusivity\n3. The pricing structure (fixed monthly fee vs. fee-for-service)\n4. Geographic scope or non-competition clauses\n5. The overall language and intent of the entire contract\n6. Extrinsic evidence like the parties' course of dealings and negotiation history\n\nWithout this additional information, it's impossible to definitively state whether Blue Corp's actions are allowed or prohibited by the contract.

But, over time, for a variety of reasons, the consideration requirement of contract law was eroded until it is almost meaningless. And, most of the time \"failure of consideration\" now means something akin to unconscionable, because the payment is too small in a context where a gift is not intended.\n\nConsideration wasn't originally used in any context other than contract law, so the need to distinguish between payment and some other consideration wasn't present as the terminology developed. But, as the concepts were generalized, other reasons for supporting an agreement (e.g. justified reliance) emerged, but the terminology was by then closely associated with a particular fact pattern and so it remained.\n\nUsing new terminology is always disfavored in law because it divorces a decision from the long case law history that uses the term. \n\nAs another example, there is a modern tendency to favor the terminology of issue preclusion and claim preclusion in lieu of collateral estoppel and res judicata. But, if you want to find cases before the 1970s or so referring to those doctrines, you need to use the old terminology.",

Instead, it is a question of a common law right of publicity, which in India is recognized in some circumstances, but is not well developed and has many gaps that courts will have to resolve as cases are presented to them.\n\nThe right of publicity is largely a right to sue if another person without permission profits commercially from someone's likeness without their consent and it is unclear to what extent, if any, it encompasses a right to control the use of one's own image otherwise. It is not in and of itself a crime, even though it is a tort which is the basis for a civil lawsuit for money damages and perhaps injunctive relief. As explained [here](https://www.bananaip.com/ip-news-center/india-and-right-of-publicity/#:%7E:text=In%20India%2C%20the%20right%20of,to%20the%20celebrity%27s%20individual%20persona.&text=These%20rights%20are%20transferable%20and,name%2C%20likeness%2C%20and%20persona.):\n\n> In India, the right of publicity is governed by common law and accrues\n> to the celebrity\u2019s individual persona. It is a right to a celebrity\u2019s\n> particular distinguishing and identifying characteristics, features,\n> behavior, likeness, image or other unequivocal aspects. These rights\n> are transferable and are generally used as an individual\u2019s right to\n> control and profit from the commercial use of his or her name,\n> likeness, and persona. . . .\n> \n> \n> The Indian Courts scrutinize the law governing publicity as a right in\n> which an individual\u2019s identity suffers the loss of commercial purpose.\n> Some courts refer to the unauthorized appropriation of an individual\u2019s\n> identity as an invasion of the right of privacy. However, the two\n> bodies of law can be distinguished as follows: while the right of\n> publicity provides the individual with a property right in his or her\n> identity, the right of privacy protects an individual from the\n> publication of private facts that are embarrassing or intimate, or\n> that portrayal of him or her in a false light is offensive. The right\n> of publicity claims usually arise from the publication of information\n> of which the public is already aware; the celebrities thrive on being\n> known and talked about.\n> \n> \n> In Sourav Ganguly v. Tata Tea ltd., Sourav Ganguly returned from an\n> extremely successful tour of England and Tata Tea Ltd., where he was\n> then employed to promote a tea packet, offered the consumers a chance\n> to congratulate Sourav through a postcard which was inside each\n> packet. The company intended to profit from his popularity and his\n> latest success. Sourav could successfully challenge it in the Court\n> before settling the dispute amicably.\n> \n> \n> The right of publicity protects all persons\u2019 rights from birth to\n> death and beyond. When the right of publicity extends after death, it\n> is called the post\\-mortem right of publicity. However, whether the\n> right of publicity extends beyond life is jurisdiction specific. For\n> example, the post mortem right of publicity has only been recently\n> recognized in the US in California and will soon be recognized other\n> American states too. Legal recognition of post mortem rights of\n> publicity usually permits the deceased\u2019s beneficiaries or heirs to\n> control and financially benefit from the use of a deceased\u2019s image and\n> likeness. The news about the movie Dirty Picture having been\n> challenged by the kin of the deceased actress Silk Smita, claiming\n> that the movie does not depict her personality in the right spirits,\n> is first of its kind in India.\n\nThe linked examples, showing satirical portrays of a famous U.S. politician, hinge on the issue of what constitutes commercial use, as opposed to other uses.\n\nThe right of publicity doctrine arose at common law when images of models were used to market consumer goods, when the models for the painting and photographs weren't paid. It has not generally been used to prohibit political cartoons or their 3D equivalent, the basic thrust of which is political commentary or satire that does not suggest endorsement by the subject of the image. In the U.S., such a broad reading of the right of publicity would probably be overcome by the very strong First Amendment protections of free speech. But while India also protects the right to free speech, it, like most former British colonies, tends to be less extreme in the extent to which other generally applicable laws and protections of other individual rights yield to free speech protections than the United States.\n\nI doubt that a right of publicity lawsuit by the individual depicted in the linked materials which appear to be basically satirical political depiction would be recognized in India, and it is likely the some of the same considerations that apply to fair use of copyrights or nominative use of trademarks without permission would inform its judgment on the scope of this common law right. But because India's common law in this area isn't very well developed it isn't possible to know with certainty how a case like this one would be evaluated by an Indian court.\n\nThis said, there are a couple of caveats that should be added.\n\nFirst, it is easy to imagine that the 3D image is obtained by some illegal means which could be tortious (i.e. the basis for an invasion of privacy lawsuit) or criminal. The illegality in obtaining the information could arise not just from common law protections but also, for example, for statutory or contractual non\\-disclosure requirements.\n\nFor example, if this was obtained obtained from records maintained for health or educational purposes it could violate laws providing privacy protections in those areas. Obtaining the 3D image surreptitiously and without the knowledge of the person whose image is obtained (e.g. through a secret camera in a changing room) would probably be both a crime and a tort.\n\nSecond, if the 3D model were used to defraud someone, e.g., by impersonating them on a Zoom call, this would likely be both a crime and a tort under the general principles that apply to fraud in general, as a form of affirmative misrepresentation, even though it is visual rather than verbal.",

In India, the creation and sale of 3D models of celebrities without their consent is a complex legal issue primarily governed by the common law right of publicity. This right is not well-developed in Indian law and has many gaps that courts will need to resolve as cases are presented.\n\nA is incorrect because while freedom of speech is protected in India, it is not absolute and may not always cover commercial use of a celebrity's likeness.\n\nB is incorrect because it's not strictly illegal or a criminal offense. The right of publicity is a civil matter, not a criminal one, and its application can vary based on the specific circumstances.\n\nD is incorrect because the post-mortem right of publicity is not well-established in India, and the legality doesn't solely depend on whether the celebrity is alive or deceased.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the nuanced nature of this issue in Indian law, where the right of publicity exists but its exact boundaries and applications are still being defined through court cases."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A lot has changed in our laws and statutes since the Roe vs. Wade ruling in 1973\\. The United States Constitution does not explicitly address a right to health care. The words \"health\" or \"medical care\" cannot be found anywhere in the text of the Constitution. The provisions listed in the Constitution are evidence that the framers were more concerned with guaranteeing freedom from government, rather than providing specific rights to procedures and services related to health care.\n\nLaws such as [\"The Patient Self\\-Determination Act\" of 1991](https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/5067), [\"The Affordable Care Act\"](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3590), [\"The Uniform Determination of Death Act\"](https://www.findlaw.com/healthcare/patient-rights/what-is-the-uniform-declaration-of-death-act-or-udda.html), [\"Preventing Maternal Deaths Act\" of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1318), [\"The Unborn Victims of Violence Act\" of 2004](https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/1997) and so many others were created and defined to protect citizens rights as they relate to the complex issue of life, death, healthcare and patient outcomes.\n\nAt the time that Roe vs Wade was passed there existed few legislative statutes governing a citizens rights with regards to their health care decisions. Now there exists a multitude of federal laws and regulations to define and protect patients. Yet no one has been talking about or whether these laws would protect access to abortion as an healthcare decision even without Roe vs Wade.\n\n\\*\\* I made some edits to the original question to clarify my intent: Do existing laws, which did not exist in 1973, serve to protect the right to choose in the absence of Roe vs. Wade?\n\n\\*\\*\\* Additional Edits\nIn a previous version of this question I made an argument on the legal status of unborn life. It was just intended as an example but it distracted from the main purpose of the question. The core of my question is still valid. I still want to know about any laws that could protect a woman\u2019s right to an abortion as a medical decision. Since posting the question the White House has now quoted the [\u201cEmergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act\u201d](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EMTALA) as a Federal law on emergency treatment that preempts State Laws and Regulations that ban the procedure without exception. Are there others like this law that provide additional protections?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One question raised here and worth at least noting is that the Texas argument in [Roe](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/#tab-opinion-1950136) includes the following assertion from Blackmun:\n\n> The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a \"person\"\n> within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In\n> support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well known\n> facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is\n> established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the\n> fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the\n> Amendment.\n\nWhat follows is an investigation of the question whether a fetus is a person \u2013 basically, it has not been legally (constitutionally) determined that a fetus is a person. Issues of dying, being a citizen, being alive etc. are irrelevant since the central concept that relates to right is being a \"person\".\n\nIt is reasonably well\\-known that statutes forbidding abortion were originally passed in order to protect the health of women \u2013 that was the original justification. However, there is a massive disagreement over what things \"protect the health of women\". In some states, it has been decided that allowing abortion is a rational, indeed compelling state interest; in other states, the opposite is the case. Although the federal government does get involved in health care matters, health care is fundamentally a state interest. Federal intervention power in medicine has two sources: the Commerce Clause, and the Tax and Spend Clause (Congress, which dispenses a lot of money, gets to say how the money will be used). There is ample case law saying that Congress cannot force states to repeal their bans against abortion, under penalty of losing federal money. I have yet to see a plausible Commerce Clause argument that would override the states' right to define their \"compelling interest\" in health care. Health care is not a constitutionally defined federal interest and it is a state interest, so we are back to square one, when it comes to using federal power to remove state discretion.",

After the overturning of Roe v. Wade, abortion regulation has largely returned to being a state-level issue. While some federal laws like EMTALA may provide limited protections in specific circumstances (such as medical emergencies), they do not guarantee broad abortion access. The Constitution does not explicitly mention health care or abortion rights. Federal health care laws passed since 1973, while numerous, do not automatically protect abortion rights nationwide. States now have significant discretion in regulating abortion, based on their interpretation of compelling state interests in health care and fetal life."

His cousin C (father's brother's son) also \"borrows\" the phone regularly, which is impossible to refuse without offending close relatives in this joint family. \n\nCousin C is a college student who has recently fallen in with bad company and my friend B is now apprehensive that his cousin may be misusing the device to engage in some questionable online activities, being cunning enough to avoid directly exposing his own name, mobile number or email id. He might be doing this using either browsers or simple sms, which do not record which person is actually making use of the mobile device.\n\nI have strongly advised B not to allow the cousin any further access to the phone, even at risk of unpleasantness within the family, but if his cousin had already infringed the law (strictly hypothetical, since we have no proof he has done so) will the responsibility fall upon my friend A solely for being the registered owner of the sim, or upon her brother B for being the primary user, when there is no other indication that either of them have actually participated in such an activity? Specifically, how can A and B defend themselves without blaming C when there is no conclusive evidence against any one of them being the guilty party? \n\nResearch done: I have tried to take advice from various websites devoted to questions on Indian law such as those listed in [ask law india google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=ask+law+india&oq=ask+&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i61l3j69i65.2027j0j4)\nbut found that most of them will only answer to an actual legal problem and refuse to allow such hypothetical or 'academic' questions, unlike Law Stack Exchange.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Typically, there would be sufficient evidence in this situation to indict and investigate with formal legal process like arrest warrants, subpoenas and search warrants, all of the known users of the phone in the relevant time period and commence criminal proceedings against all of them based upon the improper use (although often charges would initially be brought only against the registered owner of the phone since authorities wouldn't be aware of any other users). \n\nBut, the burden of proof at trial would be on the prosecution to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the person charged is actually the person who used the phone improperly and if they could not meet this burden of proof as to one particular person, no one should be convicted.\n\nThere are some rare and isolated circumstances analogous to this, under either statutes or common law rules, where everyone could be convicted and individuals would have an affirmative defense of showing that they weren't involved that they would have to show (e.g. in the case of people who were initially part of a single criminal conspiracy, but one or more of those people disavowed the conspiracy's course of action in a legally sufficient way before the crime was completed). But, to my knowledge, there is no jurisdiction in India that has such a law in the case of improper conduct involving mobile phones.",

It is not, however, illegal.\n\nIn general, the dissolution of a state is not in itself illegal according to national or international law, as long as it happens voluntarily. There are some precedents: For example, during the German Reunification of 1989, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) under the (old) Article 23 of the *Grundgesetz*. One could argue that the German Democratic Republic effectively dissolved itself by that accession.\n\nWhat *would* probably be illegal would be to call for a violent end of the state of Israel, or even for a war. The relevant laws:\n\n* [\u00a7130 Strafgesetzbuch](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__130.html) \\-\\- *[Volksverhetzung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung)* (incitement to hatred)\n* [\u00a713 V\u00f6lkerstrafgesetzbuch](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vstgb/__13.html) \\-\\- *[Angriffskrieg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angriffskrieg)* (war of aggression)\n* and, only applicable to the state: [Art. 26 Grundgesetz](https://dejure.org/gesetze/GG/26.html) \\-\\- *[Angriffskrieg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angriffskrieg)* (war of aggression)\n\nSpecial case \\- civil servants\n==============================\n\nCivil servants are citizens, too, so mostly the same laws apply to them. However, for civil servants specifically there are higher requirements when it comes to respect for the German constitution, specifically for the \"[*freiheitliche demokratische Grundordnung*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiheitliche_demokratische_Grundordnung)\" (literally: \"basic free and democratic order\"). That means that opinions which are \"extremist\" but not illegal may not be tolerated.\n\nApplicable laws/regulations:\n\n* [\u00a77 Beamtenstatusgesetz](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/beamtstg/__7.html)\n* [\u00a79 Richtergesetz](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/drig/__9.html)\n* \u00a73 of the [Tarifvertrag der L\u00e4nder (TV\\-L)](http://www.tdl-online.de/fileadmin/downloads/rechte_Navigation/A._TV-L__2011_/01_Tarifvertrag/TV-L__i_d_F__des_%C3%84TV_Nr__9_VT.pdf)\n\nAs far as I can see, the rules for whether something violates these rules would be similar as above.\n\n---\n\nNote that there are even some Israelis who think that the state of Israel should not exist, at least not in its present form, so such a position is not totally unthinkable.

Which of the following options would best achieve John's goal while being legally valid?\n\nA) John should include a clause in his will stating that if Mary remarries, all assets must transfer to their children immediately.\n\nB) John should leave all his assets to Mary in his will, trusting her to distribute them to their children appropriately.\n\nC) John should create a trust with a trustee he trusts, setting up rules for asset distribution to the children when they are of age.\n\nD) John should specify in his will that his assets can only go to Mary if she promises not to remarry.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the best choice to achieve John's goal while remaining legally valid. Creating a trust with a trustee and specific rules for asset distribution allows John to bypass leaving assets directly to Mary, ensuring they eventually go to the children. This avoids the issue of conditions subsequent on bequests, which are not legally enforceable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it attempts to place a condition subsequent on the bequest, which is not legally valid. Option B doesn't achieve John's goal of ensuring the assets go to the children if Mary remarries. Option D is also an attempt at a condition subsequent and is not enforceable.\n\nThe question also incorporates the advice to hire a lawyer, as setting up a trust would require legal assistance to ensure it's done correctly and legally."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the United States, private colleges often have campus police, who are employed by the school but are sworn law enforcement officers with full police power in a certain jurisdiction (which can easily extend beyond the campus). Colleges also have living areas for students, which are the home of the student while they're at school (if anywhere has a reasonable expectation of privacy, it seems like a dorm room would), although these are typically not leases.\n\nNow: From what I can tell, US law says that if you have a reasonable expectation of privacy on some property, the owner of that property can't just give police permission to search it, nor can police ask the owner to search it. For instance, a hotel manager can't consent to search of a hotel room while the occupant is paying to rent the room. However, without a lease, the property owner can enter and search if *they* got the idea to do that.\n\nIn a university context, this seems to imply that a school administrator could search a dorm room for evidence of violation of school rules, but that city police would need a warrant or consent from the *student*. What's the rule for university police? Do they wear a \"school employee\" hat, which lets them search school property with permission from the school? Or do they wear a \"police officer\" hat, which (presumably) requires them to have a warrant? Or does it depend what they're looking for (so looking for drugs might need a warrant, while looking for space heaters might not)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I did not perform a complete survey but [The Jurisdictional Limits of Campus Police](http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2353&context=mlr) reports that, \"subject to jurisdictional constraints, campus police officers had virtually the same powers as their municipal counterparts.\" (Internal quotes omitted.) **Generally speaking, police are police not administration**.\n\nHere are some statutes:\n\n**ILLINOIS**\n\n> **HIGHER EDUCATION (110 ILCS 1020/) Private College Campus Police Act.**  \n> \n>  The Board of Trustees of a private college or private university, may\n>  appoint persons to be members of a campus police department....\n>  Members of the **campus police department shall have the powers** of\n>  municipal peace officers and county sheriffs.\n\n**MASSACHUSETTS**\n\n> **General Laws PART I TITLE II CHAPTER 22C** Section 63\\.  \n> \n>  The colonel may... at the request of an officer of a college, university, other\n>  educational institution... appoint employees of such college,\n>  university, other educational institution or hospital as special state\n>  police officers.

The campus police want to search the room but don't have enough evidence for a warrant. Which of the following actions would be most legally appropriate?\n\nA) The campus police can search the room without a warrant because they are employed by the private university.\n\nB) The campus police should ask a university administrator to search the room and report any findings back to them.\n\nC) The campus police must obtain a warrant before searching the room, just like any other law enforcement agency.\n\nD) The campus police can search the room with permission from the university administration, without needing the student's consent.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, campus police at private universities generally have the same powers and limitations as regular police officers. This means they would need to obtain a warrant to search a student's dorm room, just like any other law enforcement agency.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even though campus police are employed by the private university, they still function as law enforcement officers and are bound by the same rules regarding searches and seizures.\n\nOption B, while potentially a loophole used in some cases (as seen in the People v. Boettner case), is not the most legally appropriate action. It could be seen as an attempt to circumvent proper legal procedures.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the university administration cannot give permission for a police search of a student's private living space. The student has a reasonable expectation of privacy in their dorm room.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the legal status of campus police, the rights of students in university housing, and the requirements for lawful searches by law enforcement."

Under these circumstances, which of the following statements is most accurate according to general road rules?\n\nA) You must always yield to vehicles coming from your right when merging onto a new road.\nB) The vehicle that arrives at the merge point first has the right of way.\nC) Both vehicles can proceed without yielding, provided they stay within their designated lanes.\nD) You should come to a complete stop before merging to ensure safety.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Based on the principles outlined in the UK Highway Code (which are assumed to be similar in many countries), when merging onto a multi-lane one-way street, vehicles can proceed without yielding to each other as long as they remain in their designated lanes. The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. Rule 131 states that on wide carriageways divided into lanes, drivers should keep between the lane dividers.\n2. Rule 133 indicates that changing lanes requires checking mirrors and signaling, implying that staying in one's lane doesn't require yielding.\n3. Rule 143 for one-way streets advises choosing the correct lane early and avoiding sudden lane changes.\n\nTherefore, as long as both vehicles enter the four-lane one-way road in their own clearly marked lanes, they don't need to yield to each other. Yielding or changing lanes would only be necessary if a driver intends to switch lanes after merging."
