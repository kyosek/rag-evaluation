It is a question that can only be answered by Google and is dependent on their practices. Frankly though, it seems to me that Google search results might not be important based on the purpose of your proxy service. However perhaps your user base has evolved.\n\nYou are a service provider under 17 USC 512(k)(i). If you aren't we need to clear that up!\n\nAs for the copyright holders, you haven't received notice complying with 17 USC 512 (c)(3\\)(A)(i\\-iv). As such you don't have notice.\n\nEven if these notices don't qualify then we argue about whether you have red flag notice \\- based on facts and circumstances. (See *Grokster*)\n\nEDIT TO ADD:\n\n[17 U.S. Code \u00a7 512 \\- Limitations on liability relating to material online](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512) is one of the sections created by the DMCA. It is sometimes referred to as the safe harbor. You can read about it on Wikipedia\u00ae page for the [Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act).\n\nIf you read that Wikipedia\u00ae page you will see a short [section on Red Flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#Red_flags). They say it as well as I could: \n\n> \\[In addition to notice from a copyright holder, the second way] that an OSP can be put on notice that its system\n>  contains infringing material, for purposes of section 512(d), is\n>  referred to the \"red flag\" test. The \"red flag\" test stems from\n>  the language in the statute that requires that an OSP not be \u201caware of\n>  facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.\u201d\n> \n> \n> The \"red flag\" test contains both a subjective and an objective\n>  element. Subjectively, the OSP must have knowledge that the material\n>  resides on its system. Objectively, the \"infringing activity would\n>  have been apparent to a reasonable person operating under the same or\n>  similar circumstances.\"\n\nThe reason that notice is important is that the safe harbor provided is only available if you do not know that infringing is happening. Plaintiff's prove knowledge through the letter or through red flags.\n\nI am glad that you asked about Grokster, because that was the wrong case! The case to look at is [Viacom Int'l, Inc. v.

The red flag provision, because it\n>  incorporates an objective standard, is not swallowed up by the actual\n>  knowledge provision under our construction of the \u00a7 512(c) safe\n>  harbor. Both provisions do independent work, and both apply only to\n>  specific instances of infringement.\n\nIn other words, you lose your safe harbor protection if you know of facts and circumstances that would lead an ordinary person to know that infringement is happening.\n\nSo the question for you is \\- do the letters forwarded by Google mean that you have knowledge and are outside of the safe harbor? Well that's the question that lawyers fight about! In fact [Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. v.

He was screwed from the start.\n\nNow again, this does not really help you with the google blacklist problem, but it should help you understand what you need to do as a service provider to not be complicit in copryright infringement.\n\nYou really should read the *Fung* case and 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512 \\- they will go a long way to help you understand the analysis a court will apply.\n\nEDIT\n\nRegarding your legal exposure, I always assume that a cease and desist letter will precede a lawsuit. With that said, only you know how much infringing is coming across your server. Fung made his money directly from the infringement. He attracted website visitors specifically because of the infringement. He had emails and other documents proving this. \n\nDiebold is interesting because they attempted to use copyright to control the spread of their emails. First the court said no commercial harm and no diminishment of value of the works. Then the court found that the stuff wasn't even subject to copyright. This is obviously not a typical case. But it sounds like you see yourself as OPG in this case. **I don't see how you can become a plaintiff against bona fide copyright holders who follow the links as far as your server**.

While the letting agency claims tenants are responsible for mold damage, the legal reality is more complex. Tenants may be held responsible if their negligence caused the mold (e.g., leaving windows open during rain). However, if the mold is due to structural issues or lack of proper ventilation systems, the landlord would typically be responsible.\n\nAdditionally, the answer touches on the deposit issue raised in the question. Landlords or letting agencies can potentially deduct money from the deposit, but they must provide proof and explanation for any deductions within a specified timeframe. This aligns with the information given about the landlord needing to provide receipts and explanations for kept deposit money.\n\nOptions A and B are too absolute and don't account for the variability in mold responsibility based on circumstances.

The second sentence addresses exchanging The Work for Something Else Copyrighted, so would not appear to be relevant to anything that you could do in a museum. (It does, however, say that there can't be any monetary compensation, so if you put the stuff on a DVD, you can't recoup your materials cost, though you can require an exchange DVD).\n\nIn case the work in question is music, (d) and (e) are relevant, the Licensor (creator) asserts the right to collect public performance royalties in case the primary purpose is \"commercial advantage or private monetary compensation\". This mildly contradicts what 4 restricts. This is just crazy, but required by law, because US Copyright law already has the concept of [\"compulsory license\"](http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ73.pdf). The importance of that is that if the law allows X, the license cannot disallow X. [17 USC 115](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/115) compels the copyright holder to license nondramatic musical works under certain conditions, so the seemingly contradictory language pertaining to music just mirrors the situation with the law.

Jury nullification, while controversial, is a legal concept in the United States. As noted in cases like SPARF v.

It was simply several trucks in the right lane which obstructed my view of a sign on the other side of the trucks. Not like the trucks that have flashing lights behind workers filling potholes or anything. Just a giant vehicle directly to my right that prevented me from seeing the only sign informing me the speed limit had changed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the judge is kind, yes\n-------------------------\n\nHowever, this is at the discretion of the judge. Even if the judge believes every word you say, you still broke the law.\n\nThe speed limit in Michigan is \u201ca careful and prudent speed not greater than nor less than is reasonable and proper\u201d and that is not \u201cgreater than that which will permit a stop within the assured, clear distance ahead.\u201d (MCL 257\\.627(1\\)). The posted speed limit is an upper bound on what is \u201ccareful and prudent\u201d.\n\nGiven you description of trucks obstructing your view, it\u2019s arguable that the speed you were travelling at was not \u201ccareful and prudent\u201d.\n\nThe speed limit in school zones may be set at \u201cnot more than 20 miles per hour less than the speed limit normally posted but shall be not less than 25 miles per hour.\u201d (MCL 257\\.627a(2\\)). And the speed limit on a local street in an area zoned for residential use is 25 mph \u201cunless another speed is fixed and posted.\u201d If you were in a residential street, the school zone speed is no different from the normal speed \\- the lights just serve to warn drivers that children are about.\n\nFinally, you are responsible for knowing the law. You are on that road at that time, it\u2019s your duty to know what the posted limit is as well as determining what speed is \u201ccareful and prudent\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s hard to know, the law presumes you know it.\n\nAll that said, if you catch the judge in a good mood, they might give you a break. You don\u2019t have a legal right to one so ask, don\u2019t demand.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Michigan, a driver is ticketed for speeding in a school zone, claiming they couldn't see the flashing sign due to trucks blocking their view. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the driver's legal situation?\n\nA) The driver has a strong legal defense because they were unaware of the school zone due to obstructed view.\n\nB) The driver is not liable for the ticket if they can prove the trucks were blocking the sign.\n\nC) The driver is still legally responsible, but a judge may show leniency at their discretion.\n\nD) The driver can automatically have the ticket dismissed by presenting photographic evidence of the obstructed sign.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the driver may have a compelling story about why they couldn't see the school zone sign, they are still legally responsible for following traffic laws, including knowing and adhering to speed limits. According to Michigan law, drivers must maintain a \"careful and prudent speed\" appropriate for conditions, which could be argued was not the case if view was obstructed. \n\nThe law presumes drivers know the rules, even if signs are difficult to see. However, judges have discretion in such cases. If the judge is sympathetic, they may show leniency, but this is not guaranteed or required by law.

Can I refuse entry to a specific representative of theirs (e.g. a plumber), and if so, on what basis am I allowed to refuse?\n\nResponse to answer/comment:\n\nMy reasoning for wanting to refuse them access is as follows:\n\n1. I do not trust the representative (rep). Mostly because I don't know\nthem so why should I.\n2. I currently work from home.\n3. This particular rep has been very unprofessional, particularly with communication and time management (always late, has twice cancelled after they were\ndue at the property, always underestimates ETAs \\- by months\nsometimes).

The question is not clear on that point.\n\nIf there is a specific and reasonable ground for refusing a particular representative or agent of the landlord, you might be able to do so. If, for example, that particular worker had previously insulted you in your apartment, or had attempted to steal from you there, you could probably refuse entrance and request the landlord to send a different worker to do the job.\n\nBut in general the landlord may choose his or her agents, and if it is a reasonable for an agent to be admitted, you must admit whatever agent the landlord sends. You can probably demand reasonable notice, depending on the terms of the lease. You may be able to demand to be present when the agent is to be in the premises, again depending on the lease.

Is it all just an act?***\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As I mentioned in [this answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/78365/17500) following the rule of law does not imply that the law guarantees any particular right, or adheres to any particular standard. It also does not imply that justice is done in every case.\n\nThe rule of law is a norm, an aspiration, not a promise that is kept in every case. It is probably beyond human ability to do exact justice in every legal case. In any event, the rule of law *per se* does not have to do with doing justice fairly, it has to do with respecting the laws as they stand, and not being subject to unlawful injustice by corrupt or biased officials.\n\nIf the law decrees, say, that sentences for using crack cocaine (favored by the poor and back) are ten times those for using powder cocaine (favored by the richer and whiter) and a court follows that law strictly, imposing those disparate sentences, then the rule of law has been fully satisfied, although perhaps not the principle of fair justice.\n\n> Why do people on this forum, and lawyers in general, behave as if their profession is so objective, unbiased, etc? Is it all just an act?\n\nMany answers on law.se have recognized that injustices in court, including wrongful convictions, happen with distressing frequency. It has also been mentioned that various laws are or may be perceived as unjust themselves. But since law.se is devoted to describing and explaining what the law is, and how it is supposed to work, unjust events which violate the law are of only limited relevance here, beyond noting that they do indeed violate the law. Whether an existing valid law is unjust is of even less relevance here, because the main subject is what the law is, not if it is good law or bad.\n\nIt might be argued that prosecutorial discretion vests excessive power over criminal cases in a single official, and that this is contrary to the general principle of the rule of law. But it has a very long history, and some practical reasons behind it. The courts do not have the resources that would be needed if every arguable violation of law were to be prosecuted to the limit, and in many cases doing so would quite likely work injustice, not justice. Perhaps a different system, involving some sort of review, might be better. But it is less than clear if such a system would in fact be an improvement, and it would surely add delay and expense. (In practice, most such decisions are made by an assistant prosecutor under one title or another, and reviewed by a senior prosecutor, so there is not a **single** official able to act on whim unchecked.)\n\nWhile it is true that (in the US) the Police cannot be legally compelled to enforce the law in a particular case, they normally do enforce it, and political and social forces combine to incline them to do so in most cases.\n\nI agree that it should be easier to overturn apparently wrongful convictions in the light of new evidence, but this is in part because the laws, as currently written, make it hard, and the courts are following the laws, thus upholding the rule of law. It has been said that courts do not enjoy a random commission to do acts of justice, meaning that they must follow the law. even when the result seems unjust to the judges.\n\nIt is also true that those involved in an allegedly wrongful conviction are **very** reluctant to admit past error, thinking that to do so will harm their current reputations, and perhaps endanger their political futures, and so such officials place unneeded obstacles in the way of such proceedings.\n\nI think that while US laws are sometimes unjust, and court proceedings are sometimes rigged or biased, this is less common than in some places, particularly in authoritarian countries. I will not claim that the US is the \"Greatest country in the world\", but I think that I can truly state that it has a higher level of ordinary justice than many places do, although perhaps not the highest anywhere.\n\nBut a high level of justice is **not** not the same as \"following the rule of law\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the passage, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the rule of law and justice in the United States legal system?\n\nA) The rule of law guarantees fair and unbiased justice in every legal case.\nB) Following the rule of law always results in just outcomes, even if the laws themselves may be perceived as unfair.\nC) The rule of law is an aspiration that focuses on respecting existing laws, but does not necessarily ensure justice in every case.\nD) The rule of law and justice are completely unrelated concepts in the US legal system.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The passage states that \"following the rule of law does not imply that the law guarantees any particular right, or adheres to any particular standard.

Instead they are consolidations, classifications, and editorial codifications made by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel.\n\nTitle 42 (noted in phoog's answer) is not a positive codification. This means Congress did not choose its numbering scheme. Only the titles with an asterisk [on this page](https://uscode.house.gov/#.xhtml) have been enacted as positive law.\n\nInstead, the law codified into Title 42 are the various public statutes passed by Congress over the years that the Law Revision Counsel has included in Title 42\\. It is the public statutes that have the force of law. See e.g. [Pub.

Title 42 is comprised of many individually enacted Federal statutes\u2013\u2013such as the Public Health Service Act and the Social Security Act\u2013\u2013that have been editorially compiled and organized into the title, but the title itself has not been enacted.\n\n[Whether a provision of a public statute is included in the U.S. Code and where it will be included is determined by the Law Revision Counsel](https://uscode.house.gov/about_classification.xhtml), although placement may be obvious when a statute amends an already codified statute.\n\nAs for the cramped numbering ([contrary to the comment of Weather Vane](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/94580/why-are-some-sections-of-the-us-code-formatted-so-weirdly#comment217877_94580), which says that insertions would require renumbering of subsequent clauses), the Law Revision Counsel says:\n\n> Chapters based on statutes that have been amended many times may have cumbersome numbering schemes with section numbers such as 16 U.S.C. 460zzz\\-7 and 42 U.S.C. 300ff\\-111\\.\n\nWhere the U.S. Code skips over large portions of section numbers this could be an intentional decision to leave room for growth, especially in a title that has undergone positive codification process through Congress, or it could be the result of previous sections that have been removed after repeal.\n\nFor more background, see the [detailed guide](https://uscode.house.gov/detailed_guide.xhtml) from the Law Revision Counsel.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the nature and organization of the U.S. Code?\n\nA) All titles in the U.S. Code are positive codifications enacted by Congress, with numbering schemes deliberately chosen for emphasis and separation.\n\nB) The U.S. Code is entirely organized by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel, with no input from Congress on structure or numbering.\n\nC) Most titles in the U.S. Code are non-positive codifications, compiled by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel from various public statutes, with only some titles enacted as positive law by Congress.\n\nD) The U.S. Code's unusual numbering and lettering schemes are always intentional choices made by Congress to allow for future insertions without renumbering.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage explains that many titles in the U.S. Code are not positive codifications, but rather consolidations and classifications made by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel. Only some titles (those marked with an asterisk on the official website) have been enacted as positive law by Congress. The unusual numbering schemes, especially in non-positive law titles, are often the result of multiple amendments over time and the need to insert new sections without renumbering existing ones.

The US government's position on what a derivative work is [here](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ14.pdf). They identify as an example \"A musical arrangement of a preexisting musical work\". One can check relevant US case law [here](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html) pertaining to \"fair use\" (a likely defense in case \"copying\" was found). The statutory definition of \"derivative work\" at [17 USC 101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101) is that it is\n\n> a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a\n>  translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,\n>  motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,\n>  condensation, or any other form *in which a work may be recast,\n>  transformed, or adapted*. A work consisting of editorial revisions,\n>  annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole,\n>  represent an original work of authorship, is a \u201cderivative work\u201d.\n\nOne may presume that the map is \"based on\" a protected work, so the question is whether it is recast, transformed of adapted: presumably, it is. A rhythm can be an element in a finding of infringement ([Dorchester Music v. National Broadcasting Company](http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/171/580/1555697/) 171 F. Supp. 580: melody and rhythm were fund to be substantially similar). However, many rhythms are centuries old or more, e.g. Dhruva Tala, Scandinavian polska. [This resource](http://mcir.usc.edu/) may also be useful in sorting out musical infringement questions. The essential question is whether the map \"copies\" a protected element of a composition, and that depends on what the map \"is\".\n\nWhether or not this matters to you depends mostly on whether you are creating the possibly infringing work (a map). If you are just creating a program that allows people to do something with what they already have, then there is no liability for infringement (just as a person who creates a program allowing sound to be recorded or sound files to be manipulated is not liable for infringement if someone uses the program to infringe on copyright). There are ample non\\-infringing uses for such a program.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer creates a rhythm game where players must provide their own MP3 files and download separate \"map\" files that contain rhythm information for each song.

If the maps are found to recast, transform, or adapt copyrighted elements of the songs (such as their rhythm structure) in a way that infringes on the original work, the developer could be liable for copyright infringement if they create these maps. However, if the developer only provides the software platform and users or third parties create the map files, the developer would likely not be liable, as they would be providing a tool with substantial non-infringing uses.

Unfortunately, there is effectively no money in the estate which would allow me to hire a lawyer, so I'm hoping you folks can help.\n\nBy the time I found out about the passing, the house had lain fallow for six months. There were break\\-ins, burst pipes, the cops had been called multiple times but openly refused to investigate (we actually had a voicemail where the police officer explained that they didn't bother investigating reports of looting for that property anymore) which also meant there was no way to file reports with the police to report the stolen goods because they outright refused to have anything to do with the place.\n\nThe house had been refinanced six months before the passing. By the time I came on the scene, the house was in ruins and the refinancers were going crazy from lack of feeding\\- er, payment. I tried to ask for a stay from them, explaining the circumstances, and that I was trying to get the various paperwork and such in order. They conveniently lost almost every single document I sent them at their request, and when they did manage to track them down, would dispute them.\n\nMeanwhile, the insurance company (as an aside, we were more assuredly not in good hands, they made the whole process into a nightmare and if I had the money I would sue them for fraud) eventually paid out a check for the personal items and a check for the damage to the house. The former went into the estate account, the latter went to the mortgage company. A week before that resolution, the lenders announced that they were foreclosing on the property.\n\nAn hour ago, I was served with the foreclosure paperwork. I don't particularly see anything that I could do to stop the foreclosure (in part because I'm not really sure what I could do, and I also live several states away so showing up in court would be difficult), and none of the heirs particularly wants the place, especially now, so there doesn't seem much point in fighting it.\n\nSo. The money from the insurance company to pay for repairs for the house is a substantial percentage of the mortgage on the house ($45,000 on a mortgage of \\~$110,000\\). Assuming the house is foreclosed upon and presumably sold, what happens to the money? Can the loan company do what they want with the money, use it to fix up the house? Or can they short sale it and pocket the difference? What are my options here? Is the estate entitled to any money left after selling the house assuming the sale price plus the insurance money is above the mortgage loan balance? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: IANAL. I am not your lawyer. The following is not legal advice.\n\nThe insurance company, regardless of how you feel about their process, has it appears, to have discharged their duties, namely they have paid out two separate claims. The personal property claim has been paid to the estate as the beneficiary, while the property claim has been paid out with the mortgage company as the beneficiary.\n\nThe mortgage company seems, to me (disclaimer, I work at a financial institution, albeit in an IT role), to also be reasonable. Six months is an extremely long time without contact or payment (where I work, the loss mitigation department is sent all loans that are 3 months delinquent); the fact that you, the estate executor were not aware of the passing of the debtor is of no consequence. Also, many loans contain clauses that allow the lender to accelerate the loan (i.e. demand \"immediate\" payment of the whole outstanding balance). So they've started foreclosure proceedings, probably about 3 months ago.\n\n**As for the foreclosure proceedings:** The received $45,000 will be applied to the loan. The property (not just the house, but the entire lot) will be sold at public auction, as all foreclosed houses are in the state of New York. Proceeds from the sale of the house shall be applied to paying off the loan. If the proceeds exceed the outstanding mortgage amount, the estate will be sent the remaining proceeds. If the proceeds are less than the remaining amount, the estate is retains (i.e. owes) the remaining debt.\n\nEDIT: As an example of why the noting of jurisdiction is important on this stack\\-exchange, Nate Eldredge has informed me that in New York, it is possible for a judge to reduce the \"remaining debt\" of the estate by declaring that the sold house had a higher \"fair market value\" than it sold for.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An estate administrator in New York is dealing with a foreclosure on a property.

See, for instance, [*Gibbons v. Odgen*, 22 U.S. 1, at 210\\-211 (1824\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/22/1/case.html#210) (emphasis added):\n\n> This opinion has been frequently expressed in this Court, and is founded as well on the nature of the government as on the words of the Constitution. In argument, however, it has been contended that, if a law passed by a State, in the exercise of its acknowledged sovereignty, comes into conflict with a law passed by Congress in pursuance of the Constitution, they affect the subject and each other like equal opposing powers.\n> \n> \n> But the framers of our Constitution foresaw this state of things, and provided for it by declaring the supremacy not only of itself, but of the laws made in pursuance of it. The nullity of any act inconsistent with the Constitution is produced by the declaration that the Constitution is the supreme law. The appropriate application of that part of the clause which confers the same supremacy on laws and treaties is to such acts of the State Legislatures as do not transcend their powers, but, though enacted in the execution of acknowledged State powers, interfere with, or are contrary to, the laws of Congress made in pursuance of the Constitution or some treaty made under the authority of the United States. **In every such case, the act of Congress or the treaty is supreme, and the law of the State, though enacted in the exercise of powers not controverted, must yield to it.**\n\nFederal preemption exists to ensure that the topics of regulation that the Constitution delegates to the federal government are under the effective control of the federal government. Regulation is not always restrictive; sometimes, Congress (or a federal regulatory agency) will decide that some actions should be *allowed* in order to achieve federal objectives. In *Gibbons*, for instance, Congress set up a licensing scheme for coastal maritime trade. New York had set up a monopoly on steamboat navigation in New York waters. Both laws are acceptable in isolation; New York can pass laws about New York waters, while Congress can pass laws about interstate shipping. But while it was possible to comply with both sets of laws, New York's laws would undermine the federal system of interstate shipping, and so they were preempted.\n\nWhen preemption comes up in court cases, the power of Congress to preempt is generally not in question (there are some edge cases, like when Congress is directly interfering with internal state operations, but those are edge cases). The question is whether Congress actually intended to preempt state laws. When Congress explicitly says \"state laws are preempted,\" it's easy to figure out that they did mean to preempt them. Otherwise, federal courts look to whether the state laws conflict with the federal laws (in the sense that it's impossible to comply with both), whether the state laws are an obstacle to the full achievement of Congressional objectives, and whether the Congressional regulation is so extensive that it occupies the field, leaving literally no room for states to do anything in the area.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes a provision stating that states cannot impose stricter requirements on health insurance providers than those outlined in the ACA.

Which of the following best explains the legal basis for the federal government's ability to override this state law?\n\nA) The Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce\nB) The Necessary and Proper Clause, which allows Congress to make laws needed to carry out its enumerated powers\nC) The Supremacy Clause, which establishes federal law as the \"supreme law of the land\"\nD) The Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Supremacy Clause, found in Article VI of the Constitution, is the correct legal basis for federal preemption of state laws. This clause establishes that federal laws made in pursuance of the Constitution are the \"supreme law of the land\" and take precedence over state laws. In this case, the ACA's provision explicitly preempting stricter state requirements would be considered valid under the Supremacy Clause, allowing it to override the state law requiring additional coverage.\n\nWhile the Commerce Clause (A) and the Necessary and Proper Clause (B) are relevant to Congress's authority to pass the ACA in the first place, they do not directly address the power to preempt state laws. The Tenth Amendment (D) actually limits federal power rather than expanding it, so it would not be the basis for federal preemption.\n\nThe question tests understanding of the constitutional basis for federal preemption, the concept of explicit preemption in federal law, and the ability to distinguish between different constitutional provisions related to federal power."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1010/how-do-you-collect-evidence-to-sue-for-robocalling", "docs_id": 1010, "title": "How do you collect evidence to sue for robocalling?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What's the best way to collect evidence to be prepared to sue for robocalling like in *[King v Time Warner Cable](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Time-Warner-Cable-Sued-For-Robocalling-Wrong-Woman153-Times-134405), U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14\\-02018* ([conclusion in html](http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2014cv02018/424841/33/) / [order and opinion denying stay and granting summary judgement in pdf](http://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2014cv02018/424841/33/0.pdf?ts=1436369262))?\n\nIt appears that in this case, there wasn't much dispute as to the facts (still, as a customer, where do you get the information as to the number of missed calls?), however, what if the business objects to the data you provide?

In the scenarios you have outlined elsewhere, an arbitration clause is to be enforced by virtue of it being a contractual matter rather than because the clause is about arbitration. A mere change of parties to a contract generally does not preclude enforcement of provisions in that contract. That is because the new party acquires the rights and obligations pursuant to the contract.\n\n> Does the new policy differ based on whether we know the two parties entered in an agreement to arbitrate at some point vs. when the parties dispute the formation of an arbitration agreement in the first place?\n\nNo. A dispute of whether the parties formed an arbitration agreement is moot if there is evidence \\-\\-i.e., \"*we know*\"\\-\\- that they entered an agreement to arbitrate. But the policy itself remains the same.\n\nEnforcement of the FAA is premised on the ascertainment that the party(\\-ies) \"*knew of the right \\[to arbitrate]*\", just as with any other contract.\n\n> Are there any instances where the courts have favored arbitration (especially in NJ), after the U.S Supreme Court ruling?\n\nThat seems unlikely.
