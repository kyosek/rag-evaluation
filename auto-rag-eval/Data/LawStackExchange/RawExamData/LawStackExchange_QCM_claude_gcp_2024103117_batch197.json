The voices in his head also contributed to the assaults. Also, attacking a non\\-sentient entity amounts to nothing more than criminal damage (not to know the nature and quality of the act they were doing).\n\nThe determination of insanity is down to the jury, but the above does satisfy all the criteria.

Otherwise, saying anything about 5 days is pointless.

If you had intended that a 7 day fee be assessed for 7 days late, but no fee would be assessed for up to 5 days of lateness, you would have said it differently.

The wording \"Late charges will be assessed after five days\" implies that the counting of late days starts on the 6th day after the due date. In this case, the rent was due on the 1st, so late fees would start accruing on the 7th. Since the payment was received on the 9th, there are 4 days of late fees (7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th), resulting in a total late fee of $40.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it counts all 9 days from the due date, ignoring the grace period. Option C is incorrect because it counts 8 days, assuming the grace period is only 1 day.

Under that concept, if you can reasonably prove the amount you would have earned during the period of time you were unable to earn it, you may be awarded that as damages. It's usually applied to a situation where you are injured by somebody's conduct and miss X amount of weeks of work. The court can then take what you earned in the X number of weeks prior to such injury and project out what you would have earned. This does not work with speculative profits, such as if you were just about to open your own business and then were injured. Thus, I believe if you're able to prove an individual purposely slow\\-played fulfilling a contract you relied upon and you can show what you would have earned had he not done so, you may be able to connect damages in that amount as a result.

The client, a small business owner, relies on this timeline to launch a new service. Sam deliberately delays the project by 2 months, causing the client to miss their planned launch date. The client can prove they would have earned $50,000 in the first two months of their new service. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the potential legal damages the client might claim?\n\nA) The client cannot claim any damages as opportunity cost is not considered a legal damage.\nB) The client can only claim the amount they paid Sam for the software development.\nC) The client can potentially claim $50,000 in damages for loss of profits.\nD) The client can claim damages for their emotional distress caused by the delay.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the concept of \"loss of profits\" mentioned in the documentation, the client may be able to claim damages for the profits they would have earned had the service launched on time. In this case, they can reasonably prove they would have earned $50,000 during the two-month delay period. This is not speculative, as it's based on a planned business expansion with a clear timeline and expected earnings. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while opportunity cost itself may not be a direct legal damage, provable loss of profits can be. \n\nAnswer B is too limited, as it only considers the contract price and not the consequential damages from the delay. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because emotional distress damages are typically not awarded in contract disputes, especially in a business context, unless there are exceptional circumstances."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17819/place-and-date-of-authors-death-and-copyright", "docs_id": 17819, "title": "Place and date of author&#39;s death and copyright", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Consider the following two situations:\n\n* An author of a book dies the 1st of January of 2000, in London, at 2:05 AM, GMT.

Yet, from the perspective of San Francisco, the author died the 31st of December of 1999, at 23:05 PM, PDT.\n\nIn these two cases, when will the copyright of the book expire? Both the US and the UK give *post\\-mortem* 70 years of copyright protection to authors' material. Does the answer depend on where the book was published?\n\n**Note**: this question is particularly relevant in the context of copyright defined in terms of \"end of calendar year\". This seems to be the issue in the definition of copyright protection length. For instance, see page 3 of [this document](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf) for the US, and the Notes at the end of [this page](https://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p10_duration).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright under the Berne Convention relies on the concept of \"country of origin\". This is the country where the work was first published or, for simultaneous (i.e. within 30 days) publishing the country that gives the *shortest* copyright term. While the country of origin may be disputed, particularly for works first published on the internet, every work has one, even if a court may need to decide which it is.\n\nTherefore the relevant time of death is the one in the country of origin.\n\nFor your UK/USA example, the country of origin if the works had been published simultaneously is the UK because, based on the time of death, it has the shortest copyright term: one year shorter than the USA\n\nFor a country entirely within one time zone, like the UK, this is straightforward. For countries that span multiple time zones, this will depend on the local law regarding time.\n\nFor example, the Australian *Acts Interpretation Act 1901* says:\n\n> **ACTS INTERPRETATION ACT 1901 \\- SECT 37**\n> \n> \n> **Expressions of time**\n> \n> \n> Where in an Act any reference to time occurs, such time shall, unless it is otherwise specifically stated, be deemed in each State or part of the Commonwealth to mean the legal time in that State or part of the Commonwealth.\n\nAt face value, as applied to the Copyright Act 1968 for an Australian work, this could mean that the work would have a years further protection in Western Australia than in New South Wales. However, such an interpretation would be unconstitutional as Commonwealth law must apply equally in each state and territory of the Commonwealth.\n\nWhen such a case comes up, the judge would need to hear the evidence and make a decision. We cannot speculate what that decision will be but some arguable possibilities include:\n\n* if the author died in Australia, the date in the place where they died\n* the date on their death certificate, being the *official* date\n* the date in the specific place where the work was created\n* the date of their death in Canberra, being the national capital.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An author dies on December 31, 2023, at 11:30 PM in Los Angeles (Pacific Time), which is January 1, 2024, at 2:30 AM in New York (Eastern Time).

According to copyright laws and the Berne Convention, when will the copyright for this book expire?\n\nA) December 31, 2093, based on the Los Angeles time of death\nB) December 31, 2094, based on the New York time of death\nC) December 31, 2093, based on the UK having the shortest copyright term\nD) It depends on which city the author considered their primary residence\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Berne Convention, for works published simultaneously in multiple countries, the country of origin is considered to be the one that provides the shortest copyright term. In this case, even though the author died on different dates in different time zones, the UK would be considered the country of origin because it would provide the shortest copyright term (expiring one year earlier than in the US due to the difference in death dates). The copyright would therefore expire on December 31, 2093, 70 years after the end of the year of death as per UK copyright law. The author's residence is not a determining factor in this scenario, and the specific time zone of death within the US is irrelevant for determining the country of origin under these circumstances."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1390/doctor-sending-private-information-over-whatsup-for-consultation", "docs_id": 1390, "title": "Doctor sending private information over whatsup for consultation", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a doctor sends screen grabs, taken by his smartphone, of different patients' confidential health files to other doctors for quick consultation, does that potentially violate any law?

HIPAA violations often result in fines rather than direct action against a medical license. License consequences are generally determined by state law and depend on the specific situation. Minor violations like using an insecure messaging client are less likely to result in severe penalties compared to more egregious privacy breaches.

There is an irreducible chance that no matter how clear the outcome should be that the jury will get it wrong. Based upon a review of the academic literature on wrongful convictions and inaccurate acquittals, I generally tell my clients that this is about 10%. Many people think that this is a low end estimate.\n\nAlso, sometimes a jury will acquit a defendant in a case where they think that the defendant was actually legally guilty because of extraordinary circumstances, and so the jury will disregard the law and acquit. This practice is called \"jury nullification.\"\n\nAnd, as other answers have noted, sometimes the prosecution or the judicial system screws up for reasons that are unforeseeable, after a not guilty plea, in a way that makes proving your guilt difficult or impossible.\n\nBasically, if you \"roll the dice\" there is some non\\-zero chance you will be acquitted, while if you plead guilty, there is none.\n\nAlso, sometimes court decisions will change the law in way favorable to you after the trial, and as long as your case is still on direct appeal from the conviction, you can benefit from those changes in the law, which you cannot if you simply plead guilty without any concessions.\n\nLikewise, if you are innocent and the evidence is currently strongly against you, but you wish to preserve the ability to later attack the conviction based upon future newly discovered evidence, not pleading guilty is generally necessary to preserve that option.\n\nAnother circumstance where going to trial but losing can still be worth it, is where there are extenuating circumstances that make your conduct understandable, even if it is not a legally valid defense. Getting these facts in front of the judge in a fuller fashion, as a trial can make possible, can convince the judge that while you are legally guilty, that you deserve leniency.\n\nGoing to trial typically results in a longer sentence, even without a plea bargain, however, so going forward with a hopeless trial is rarely a good move.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A defendant is facing overwhelming evidence against them in a criminal trial, with no possibility of a plea deal or lesser sentence.

Jury nullification (A) is a possibility where jurors might acquit based on extraordinary circumstances.

The passage specifically states, \"Going to trial typically results in a longer sentence, even without a plea bargain, so going forward with a hopeless trial is rarely a good move.\" Therefore, the guarantee of a shorter sentence is not a valid reason to proceed with a trial in this situation, making it the correct answer to the question of which is NOT a valid reason."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64559/is-it-gdpr-compliant-to-hide-a-competition-entry-behind-a-requirement-to-sign-up", "docs_id": 64559, "title": "Is it GDPR compliant to hide a competition entry behind a requirement to sign up to a newsletter", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm looking to run a giveaway competition on my website.

The relevant statute is [here](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleI/Chapter186/Section15B). A security deposit must be deposited in a separate account (1e), a signed receipt must be given upon receipt of the deposit (2b), the deposit must go in an interest\\-bearing account with a receipt showing name and location of bank and account number provided within 30 days (3a), also note that \"Failure to comply with this paragraph shall entitle the tenant to immediate return of the security deposit\". Subsection 4 requires returning the deposit within 30 days (not \"waiting at least 30 days\", much less 30 *working* days), minus deductions for damage, specified under 4(iii) as damage *excluding* normal wear and tear (light bulbs burning out). This does not include cleaning. and \"No deduction may be made from the security deposit for any purpose other than those set forth in this section\".\n\nSubsection 6 says:\n\n> The lessor shall forfeit his right to retain any portion of the\n>  security deposit for any reason, or, in any action by a tenant to\n>  recover a security deposit, to counterclaim for any damage to the\n>  premises...\n\nand the conditions triggering that forfeiture include under (6a) failing to deposit the funds per (3\\), or (6c)\n\n> uses in any lease signed by the tenant any provision which conflicts\n>  with any provision of this section and attempts to enforce such\n>  provision or attempts to obtain from the tenant or prospective tenant\n>  a waiver of any provision of this section\n\nwhich may be the case here and (6e)\n\n> fails to return to the tenant the security deposit or balance thereof\n>  to which the tenant is entitled after deducting therefrom any sums in\n>  accordance with the provisions of this section, together with any\n>  interest thereon, within thirty days after termination of the tenancy.\n\n(\"within\" means \"after N days or less\"). \n\nSubsection 7 states that \n\n> If the lessor or his agent fails to comply with clauses (a), (d), or\n>  (e) of subsection 6, the tenant shall be awarded damages in an amount\n>  equal to three times the amount of such security deposit or balance\n>  thereof to which the tenant is entitled plus interest at the rate of\n>  five per cent from the date when such payment became due, together\n>  with court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\n\nAnd subsection (8\\) statutorily states DaleM's point about contract terms not being above the law:\n\n> Any provision of a lease which conflicts with any provision of this\n>  section and any waiver by a tenant or prospective tenant of any\n>  provision of this section shall be deemed to be against public policy\n>  and therefore void and unenforceable.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if the Massachusetts courts interpret this as being an automatic severability clause.\n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nSecurity deposit law in Massachussets seems to be one of those cases where professional legal advice is virtually mandatory. Subsection 3a says\n\n> Any security deposit received by such lessor shall be held in a\n>  *separate*, interest\\-bearing account in a bank, located within the\n>  commonwealth *under such terms as will place such deposit beyond the\n>  claim of creditors of the lessor*, including a foreclosing mortgagee or\n>  trustee in bankruptcy, and *as will provide for its transfer to a\n>  subsequent owner of said property*\n\nAn attorney would be typically required to understand what the italicized portions mean. A reasonable interpretation would be that you have to set up an escrow bank account on behalf of the tenant. To do that, though, the tenant must cooperate to some extent (providing a Social Security number, providing acceptable ID). There is no law requiring a tenant to cooperate, which apparently puts the landlord in a legal bind.\n\nThe trick is that the statute has been interpreted \"functionally\" in [Karaa v. Kim 86 Mass. App. Ct. 714](http://masscases.com/cases/app/86/86massappct714.html) citing [Neihaus v. Maxwell 54 Mass. App. Ct. 558](http://masscases.com/cases/app/54/54massappct558.html) as simply meaning that the landlord cannot deposit the security money into their own personal bank account. In Neihaus, the landlord handed the problem over to a property management company, which had in place suitable accounting procedures so that the desiderata of being beyond the claim of creditors, being in a bank in the commonwealth, and being separate, were satisfied. In the case of Karaa, the tenants did not ever supply a Social Security number: the court ruled that the tenants action did not excuse violation of the statute, stating \"The failure of the tenants to provide a Social Security number did not preclude the Karaas from establishing a separate account in compliance with \u00a7 15B(3\\)(a)\".

Was it before 1970 when Cruz was born, or after? \n\nThis also suggests that Salon article is wrong (which is entirely possible)?\n\nTL;DR: Salon's article would apply to person born before 1932, not to Cruz.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is answered [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7177/whats-the-most-crucial-issue-when-deciding-senator-cruzs-citizenship/7185#7185).\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthright_citizenship_in_the_United_States), birthright citizenship was extended to children with citizen mothers and noncitizen fathers in 1934; the text of that law seems to be found [here](http://legisworks.org/sal/48/stats/STATUTE-48-Pg797.pdf).\n\nThe 1961 Supreme Court ruling that Salon is referring to seems to be [this one](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15260994842041643112), but they are interpreting the law as it stood in 1906, not 1961\\.\n\n> Petitioner, whose mother is a native\\-born United States citizen and whose father is a citizen of Italy (their marriage having been in the United States), was born in Italy in 1906 while his parents were temporarily residing there, and entered the United States with his mother later the same year.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is correct regarding Ted Cruz's citizenship status at birth in 1970?\n\nA) Cruz was not a U.S. citizen at birth because only his mother was a U.S. citizen, and the law at that time required the father to be a citizen for children born abroad.\n\nB) Cruz's citizenship status is uncertain because the law changed in 1961 to only recognize citizenship through the father for children born abroad.\n\nC) Cruz was a U.S. citizen at birth because the law had already been changed in 1934 to grant citizenship to children born abroad to U.S. citizen mothers.\n\nD) Cruz's citizenship status depends on whether his mother met the residency requirements in the U.S. prior to his birth, as stipulated by the law in effect in 1970.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. By 1970, when Ted Cruz was born, the law had already been changed (in 1934) to allow citizenship to be passed through mothers as well as fathers for children born abroad. However, the citizenship of children born abroad to one U.S. citizen parent was subject to residency requirements for the citizen parent. The relevant law (8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1401(g)) states that the citizen parent must have been physically present in the United States for a total of at least five years, with at least two of those years after the age of fourteen. Therefore, Cruz's citizenship status at birth would depend on whether his mother met these residency requirements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't reflect the law as it stood in 1970. Option B is incorrect because it misinterprets the 1961 Supreme Court ruling, which was actually about a 1906 case and not reflective of the law in 1961 or 1970.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin in places of public accommodation at the federal level. While this doesn't explicitly include sexual orientation, Oregon's Equality Act of 2007 expands these protections to include sexual orientation among other characteristics. The Act states that all persons are entitled to full and equal accommodations in any place of public accommodation without discrimination based on sexual orientation.

I'm not a lawyer, nor do I have much experience with the law, but the fact that this bill passed, almost unanimously, really concerns me. I want to clarify that I'm not advocating for prostitution or sex trafficking. I'm simply interested in the constitutional legality of the bill and the precedent that it sets.\n\nA summary of the bill and its actual contents can be found on Congress.gov: [H.R.1865 \\- Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1865).\n\nI have several questions about the legality of this bill. After reading through it, it seems to violate the constitution in a couple ways:\n\nSection 4, Subsection (b)\n=========================\n\n> \"Effective Date \\- The amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and the amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply regardless of whether the conduct alleged occurred, or is alleged to have occurred, before, on, or after such date of enactment.\"\n\nThis seems like a violation of Clause 3 of Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution which clearly states that Congress shall not pass any Ex Post Facto law. Meaning, a law that can be applied retroactively. **Am I missing something?**\n\nSection 2 and Section 3\n=======================\n\nThe purpose of these sections, and the bill in general, is to add an exemption to section 230 of the \"Communications Decency Act of 1996\" for websites that promote or facilitate prostitution or sex trafficking. The purpose of section 230 was to limit liability for the owners of a website in regards to content generated by the website's users. This new law essentially strips away that limitation. So, states can now prosecute an individual who owns or operates a website for content produced by the users of the site, if those users advertise prostitution or sex trafficking.\n\nThis seems like a clear violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution. **How can an individual be held legally liable for content, free speech, created by other individuals?** Consider the amount of content produced, even within a short period of time, by websites such as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc. How is it that they should be obligated to regulate the free speech of others?\n\n**What makes prostitution and sex trafficking the only crimes exempt?** Essentially, why not make all crimes exempt? That one simply defies logic, in my opinion.\n\nOther Concerns\n==============\n\nSection 4, Subsection (a) states:\n\n> \"Whoever, using a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, owns, manages, or operates an interactive computer service (as such term is defined in defined in section 230(f) the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(f))), or conspires or attempts to do so, with the intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both.\"\n\n**How is this a federal crime when the legality of prostitution is regulated by the states and is not among the enumerated powers of the federal government?** I'm guessing that because it stipulates that it must be a \"means of interstate or foreign commerce\", that it falls within federal jurisdiction?\n\nLastly, if indeed this law is unconstitutional, how does the public go about challenging it's legality? Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As for the ex post facto question, an ex post facto law is one that makes an act illegal when it was legal at the time of the commission. Let's now look at the clause:\n\n> (b) Effective date.\u2014The amendments made by this section shall take\n>  effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and the amendment\n>  made by subsection (a) shall apply regardless of whether the conduct\n>  alleged occurred, or is alleged to have occurred, before, on, or after\n>  such date of enactment.\n\nWhat amendment is made in section subsection a?\n\n> Section 230(e) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(e)) is\n>  amended by adding at the end the following:\n> \n> \n> \u201c(5\\) NO EFFECT ON SEX TRAFFICKING LAW.\u2014Nothing in this section (other\n>  than subsection (c)(2\\)(A)) shall be construed to impair or limit\u2014\n> \n> \n> \u201c(A) any claim in a civil action brought under section 1595 of title\n>  18, United States Code, if the conduct underlying the claim\n>  constitutes a violation of section 1591 of that title;\n> \n> \n> \u201c(B) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought under State law if\n>  the conduct underlying the charge would constitute a violation of\n>  section 1591 of title 18, United States Code; or\n> \n> \n> \u201c(C) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought under State law if\n>  the conduct underlying the charge would constitute a violation of\n>  section 2421A of title 18, United States Code, and promotion or\n>  facilitation of prostitution is illegal in the jurisdiction where the\n>  defendant\u2019s promotion or facilitation of prostitution was targeted.\u201d.\n\nThis does not make any act illegal. It say \"we don't mean by this that...\", and does not make any act illegal.\n\nThe basic definition of the crime is here:\n\n> \u00a72421A(a) Whoever, **using a facility or means of interstate or foreign\n>  commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce**, owns,\n>  manages, or operates an interactive computer service (as such term is\n>  defined in defined in section 230(f) the Communications Act of 1934\n>  (47 U.S.C. 230(f))), or conspires or attempts to do so, *with the\n>  intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person*\n>  shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 10\n>  years, or both\n\nlikewise \u00a72421A(a). The bold part is standard language invoking the Commerce Clause, which is the source of federal authority in what would otherwise be a state matter. The italicized part, referring to intent, indicates that the website owner/operator has to have a wrongful intent, so it's not just a penalty against those who own or operate a website for content produced by the users of the site, if those users advertise prostitution or sex trafficking.\n\nThe First Amendment has a number of limits, for example you are not free to threaten or defraud, or advertise murder for hire, of advertise employment, housing or lodging (etc) discriminatorily (e.g. \"Women need not apply\" is illegal). The question would be whether the government has a compelling interest in limiting free speech (I think the court would say yes), and is this the narrowest restriction possible that accomplishes that interest (again, yes). So it would probably pass strict scrutiny.\n\nThe purpose of the act is both to tune up the Communications Decency Act and to extend the [Mann Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-117), which makes certain forms of interstate sex a crime. So, 18 USC 2422 \n\n> (a)Whoever knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any\n>  individual to travel in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any\n>  Territory or Possession of the United States, to engage in\n>  prostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be\n>  charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so, shall be fined\n>  under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both\"; (b)\n>  Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or\n>  foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial\n>  jurisdiction of the United States knowingly persuades, induces,\n>  entices, or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 18\n>  years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any\n>  person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so,\n>  shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 10 years\n>  or for life.\n\nThis expands the federal limits on prostitution in a standard way.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the constitutional implications of H.R.1865, the \"Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017\"?\n\nA) The Act violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution by making previously legal actions retroactively illegal.\n\nB) The Act infringes on First Amendment rights by holding website owners liable for all user-generated content related to prostitution or sex trafficking.\n\nC) The Act is likely constitutional as it narrows the scope of Section 230 protections for specific criminal activities and requires intent on the part of website operators.\n\nD) The Act exceeds federal authority by regulating prostitution, which is solely under state jurisdiction.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because the Act does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause (it doesn't make previously legal actions illegal), it requires intent on the part of website operators (not blanket liability for all user content), and it invokes the Commerce Clause to establish federal jurisdiction.

The article says that thsi follows from provision in the Patents Act 1977, the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988, the Registered Designs Act 1949, and the Regulation on Community Designs (6/2002/EC).\n\nA key provision here is \"during the course of their employment\". The article goes on to explain that:\n\n> Most IP disputes which arise between an employer and an employee hinge on whether the intellectual property in question has been created 'during the course of employment'. This is determined by a number of factors including whether the work falls within the job description of the employee, whether the work was created during working hours, whether the employee could have reasonably been expected to create the work and whether any agreement exists relating to the work between the employer and the employee. However, it is useful to note that just because a work is created during working hours does not necessarily mean that the intellectual property in that work is owned by the employer (though this may give rise to a disciplinary procedures for misuse of company time, computer equipment etc). Similarly, if work is produced outside working hours but falls squarely within the job description of the employee then it may be that the first owner of that intellectual property in the product of that work is the employer, notwithstanding the fact that the work was created, for example, in the evening.\n\nThe article also says that:\n\n> As a consultant is an independent party then unless otherwise agreed, all IP created by a consultant will be owned by them and not the company engaging the consultant.\n> \n> \n> Therefore, it is important that companies ensure that an appropriate consultancy agreement is entered into between the company and the consultant.\n\nIt seem clear that absent an agreement to the contrary, a UK employer will own work that is created as part of an employee's job, even if outside of working hours.

Most of that phrase other than the final bit is self explanatory but the use of the word \"ordinary\" just seems quite odd.

(Before 1948 it was not a formal committee; proceedings took place in the Lords chamber as part of the House's normal business.)\n\n1. You could be Lord Chancellor. The most recent LC to have done this was Derry Irvine, Lord Irvine of Lairg (e.g. in *Boddington v British Transport Police* \\[1998] UKHL 13\\).\n2. You could be a regular member of the House of Lords who was qualified to sit as a judge, by virtue of having held \"high judicial office\". In principle, this would include hereditary peers who had taken a legal career path, but most often meant life peers. That would include distinguished members of the judiciary who had been given a life peerage, former holders of the office of Lord Chancellor. and (since 1889\\) retired Lords of Appeal in Ordinary. For example, Lord Mackay of Clashfern (LC until 1997\\) continued to hear cases for several years on an ad\\-hoc basis. There were also current former Masters of the Rolls, Lords Chief Justice, and senior Scottish judges in this category.\n3. You could be appointed as a \"Lord of Appeal in Ordinary\", which means that you were named to the House of Lords in order to serve as a judge (and by convention, not to participate in debates and votes). The \"in Ordinary\" phrase expresses that you are a Lord of Appeal as your main job \\- not because it's an additional job on top of being a peer.\n\nBefore the reforms of the late 19th century, any peer could participate in judicial business, at the discretion of the House in general. Some peers with legal experience were de\\-facto regarded as \"law lords\", and were the ones who by consensus took charge of appeal cases. The last time a lord without this experience tried to do this was 1883, in *Bradlaugh v Clarke*: Lord Denman (whose father had been Lord Chief Justice but who himself had no legal qualifications) tried to vote but the Lord Chancellor ignored him. That follows a precedent of 1844 (*O'Connell v The Queen*) that other Lords should gracefully decline to contribute, once the Law Lords had given their opinions.\n\nEven in that century, the emerging and eventually formalized category of \"law lords\" did not capture the nuance of who was making judicial decisions. The committee was typically \"assisted\" by professional judges, drawn from the serving judiciary, who would privately give their opinions to the actual named Lords. This was also the system used in trials of peers, where the House sat as a court of first instance if a peer was charged with a felony: nominally, any lord could take part in proceedings, but in practice the process would be stage\\-managed by a qualified Lord, with a panel of normal judges quietly doing much of the real work.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the historical context and purpose of the term \"Lord of Appeal in Ordinary\" in the British legal system?\n\nA) It referred to any peer who could participate in judicial business at their discretion, regardless of legal experience.\n\nB) It designated hereditary peers who had taken a legal career path and were qualified to sit as judges in the House of Lords.\n\nC) It identified peers appointed specifically to serve as judges in the House of Lords, distinguishing them from those who had other primary roles.\n\nD) It was a term used to describe the Lord Chancellor when exercising judicial functions in the House of Lords.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The term \"Lord of Appeal in Ordinary\" specifically referred to individuals appointed to the House of Lords for the primary purpose of serving as judges. This distinguished them from other types of Lords of Appeal, such as the Lord Chancellor or regular members of the House of Lords with legal qualifications.

The case prohibited a showing of a \"special need\" for a concealed weapon to allow one to have a permit. Many California concealed carry laws have similar requirements.\n\nBut, California doesn't have just one concealed carry law. There is a default rule that applies in small, rural counties, but most larger cities and counties in California have their own specific concealed carry laws and the precise grounds for denying a concealed carry permit would matter.\n\nIn all likelihood, many provisions of existing California concealed carry laws would remain grounds to deny permission to concealed carry (e.g. age, history of drug abuse, criminal record, restraining orders in place, etc.), while others provisions would no longer constitute valid grounds for a denial.\n\nThis particular decision is about denying permits based upon lack of a particularized need for one different from other members of the general public, rather than about any possible reason that the permit applicant could be deemed untrustworthy to have a permit. The decision discusses the idea that it is problematic to have unfettered discretion in issuing permits, but doesn't really base its ultimate conclusion on that ground. So, something like a general residual \"good character\" requirement, while vague, wouldn't be squarely within the scope of the most recent decision.\n\nThe case also doesn't itself prohibit (nor does the case law) some reasonable fee for issuance of a concealed carry permit.\n\nThus, the new case does not require uniform law with \"constitutional carry\" for everyone permitted by federal law to own a gun.

The Supreme Court decision prohibits states from requiring applicants to demonstrate a \"special need\" for carrying a concealed weapon. However, it does not invalidate all grounds for denying a permit. California can still deny permits based on various factors that suggest an applicant may be untrustworthy or unsuitable for carrying a concealed weapon, such as age restrictions, history of drug abuse, criminal record, or active restraining orders. The decision primarily targets the \"good cause\" or \"special need\" requirements, not all possible criteria for permit issuance.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the decision does not mandate blanket approval for all non-federally prohibited individuals.

The reasons can be as mundane as \"my car broke down\", \"my babysitting arrangements fell through\", \"I'm actively working on getting a lawyer to help me,\" and \"a winter storm interfered with my ability to prepare for the hearing because the power went out at my home/office most of yesterday.\"\n\nCourts also not infrequently will continue a hearing *sua sponte* (i.e. without any party requesting it) because some emergency matter has come up on the judge's schedule (e.g. in the counties where I practice, domestic violence restraining orders have priority over almost everything and any available judge can be interrupted in the middle of another hearing for half an hour or so to deal with one), or in the judge's personal life (I once had a hearing where the judge started to collapse on the bench in the middle of a three day trial that had to be continued for five months after he was rushed to the hospital and then recovered.)\n\nAnother fairly common reason to continue a hearing, that happens maybe one hearing out of five or six in my world, is that it takes longer than anticipated for some reason for the parties to present their evidence and make arguments and the allocated time for the hearing runs out, due to no real fault of the parties, so additional time is squeezed in a week or two later.\n\nFor example, one of the courthouses where I practice frequently is next to a fire station and in the event of a major fire, the commotion as fire trucks rush out to respond to the fire can make it impossible to hear what is going on for as much as fifteen or twenty minutes, which can disrupt the schedule in a short hearing.\n\nIn contrast, if you miss a hearing or deadline entirely, your excuses have to be vastly more impressive (e.g. \"I was hit by a bus on the way to court and was taken to the hospital.\", something that I've had come up in cases I was involved in, although not personally, knock on wood, three or four times).\n\nIn general, there are lots of ways to slow down a judicial proceeding, and there are few effective ways to make it go faster or insist that it stays strictly on schedule.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A judge in a small claims court has adjourned a payment hearing after the debtor claimed to have filed a dispute with the Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT), despite the creditor having a validated court order.

For example, if the now convicted defendant is granted bail before sentencing, could the judge at the sentencing stage overrule the verdict and set the defendant free?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is called a \"Directed Verdict\" and exists in all cases where a jury trial is present. A judge can make a directed verdict at any time up to and including the return of the verdict from the jury and the reading of the verdict in the court.\n\nA directed verdict can only be made in the defendant's favor (A Directed Verdict finds the defendant not guilty is the only option) and may be one of the few grounds for appeal available to the prosecution. Typically the judge makes them when they feel that the evidence presented is insufficient for any reasonable jury to convict the defendant.\n\nAlthough I wasn't able to find a U.K. procedures, I was able to find procedures in the U.S. Typically the first time this will happen is when the Prosecution Rests their case, the defense may make a motion for a directed verdict which allows the judge to rule on if one or more of the charges are dropped as the judge reasons the prosecution did not present evidence to convict.\n\nThe judge may also make a directed verdict at any point after the jury has received the case up to the point where the jury announces the verdict. Typically this occurs in civil suits when the jury awards damages in excess of legal limits, at which point the judge will alter the damages awarded to the maximum limit set by law (This was the case in the Depp v. Heard defamation case, where the jury awarded Depp punitive damages that were higher than the limit for such damages one could be awarded for Defamation by Virginia Law) but they do occur in criminal cases (typically the judge will not issue directed verdicts because they are hoping the jury realizes they shouldn't convict, and but the judge will if the jury some how convicts anyway.). Typically, in these are matters of law, not matters of fact (the jury deliberates on the facts of the case). For this reason, they are usually entered as \"Judgements as matter of law\" which basically says \"the law says this isn't a crime, so not guilty of a crime\".\n\nIn the U.S., a directed verdict entered after the jury receives the case for deliberation is one of the few times in U.S. law that the prosecution may initiate the appeals process.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of a Crown Court trial in England & Wales, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding a judge's power to overrule a jury's guilty verdict?\n\nA) The judge can only overrule the verdict before the jury begins deliberations.\nB) The judge can overrule the verdict at any time, including after sentencing.\nC) The judge can overrule the verdict up until the point where the verdict is read in court.\nD) The judge can only overrule the verdict if the prosecution requests it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Note that your father could, if he chose, directly leave both the house and the IRA to his partner. \n\nIf you become the homeowner after your father's death, and the \"3\\-year right to use\" and the cost sharing provisions are not in writing, then neither is legally binding. You and the partner may choose to honor your father's wishes, but if he does not put them in the will or another legal document, neither of you is bound.\n\nThe question says:\n\n> I cannot evict her if needed, as she is a senior citizen, living in my home, with no lease.\n\nI do not know of any jurisdiction in which there is a general ban on evicting a senior citizen in all cases. There will be some restrictions no doubt, but they will depend on the local laws. And of course you may not wish to exercise all the legal rights you may have.\n\nYou would ultimately, have the right as homeowner to evict the partner. I don't what procedures would need to be followed legally \\-\\- that will depend on the specific jurisdiction, which the question does not list. As the homeowner, you would be legally responsible for maintaining and paying taxes and other expenses on the house. The partner would be either your tenant or your guest.\n\nOnce you have title (and that will take some time after your father's death, in all probability) if the \"right to use\" was never put in writing, you could ask the partner to sign a lease. The terms could be whatever the two of you choose to agree on. If she becomes a tenant under such a lease, she has both legal rights and legal responsibilities, and each of you has the protection of a clear agreement.\n\nYou would be wise to consult a lawyer to learn exactly what the local law does and does not permit. Your father might well be wise to put his wishes more clearly in writing while he still can.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, if the father's wishes regarding the partner's right to occupy the home and share expenses are not put in writing, what is the most accurate statement about the legal situation after the father's death?\n\nA) The partner automatically has a legally binding right to occupy the home for three years.\nB) The inheritor is legally obligated to share homeowner expenses 50/50 with the partner until the IRA is exhausted.\nC) The partner becomes a tenant with a formal lease agreement.\nD) The inheritor becomes the homeowner with the right to evict the partner, subject to local laws and procedures.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because without written documentation, there is no legally binding right for the partner to occupy the home.\nB is incorrect as verbal agreements about expense sharing are not legally binding in this situation.\nC is incorrect because no formal lease agreement exists in this scenario.\nD is correct because once the inheritor gains title to the property, they become the homeowner with all associated rights and responsibilities, including the potential right to evict, subject to local laws and procedures.

As explained in the documentation, even after securing a conviction, a prosecutor may still be motivated to locate the victim's body. This is because the prosecutor represents the state's interests, which include justice and the wellbeing of its citizens. Returning the body to the victim's loved ones allows for proper burial and can provide closure for the family. This aligns with the state's commitment to justice and citizen protection, even after a conviction has been obtained.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the conviction was already secured, so saving time on the trial is not relevant.
