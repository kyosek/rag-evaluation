People who are engaged, like spouses, are generally considered to be in a \"confidential relationship\" with each other which imposes higher duties with respect to fairness in their dealings with each other than strangers, but generally less high duties than fiduciaries.\n5. While not strictly arising from the status of being engaged, adult cohabitants are generally [agents for service of process of each other at their shared home](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_4), and are often considered to have a legally significant relationship for purposes of domestic violence statutes (usually related to either domestic violence crimes or temporary restraining orders).\n\nI am not familiar enough with the law of France to fully answer the balance of the question, which someone more familiar with that law can expand upon. \n\nBut, there is similarly a special immigration status in French law for a fiance(e).\n\nAnd, French law, in a flourish so romantic it could scarcely be any other country's law, also [allows people who are engaged a right to marry after one of them has died in certain circumstances](http://www.thelocal.fr/20140228/grieving-french-woman-to-marry-dead-partner):\n\n\"The legislation that allows posthumous marriages stems back to when a dam burst in 1959 and killed 420 people in southern France.\" It was most recently invoked in 2014 when a grieving French woman was granted permission by the French President to marry her former fianc\u00e9, who tragically died in 2012, just a month before they were due to wed.

The correct answer is C because, as stated in the documentation, \"If they can't get you in B, they will at least be able to ban you from A.\" This highlights that even if the company is structured to minimize direct legal exposure in Country A, it can still face significant consequences there.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation clearly states that the company won't be protected from litigation in Country A just by being domiciled elsewhere: \"No matter what country B your business is domiciled in, if you do business (have customers) in country A, you won't be protected from litigation in that country.\"\n\nOption B is partially true but oversimplified.

No.\n\nIntellectual property practitioners and professors often describe copyright as \"a bundle of sticks.\" This means that intellectual property laws grant the creator of a copyrightable work a large number of rights, and the creator can grant or deny others each of those rights individually. So, for instance, an author can grant a publisher the right to publish his or her book in one country, but not in another, or to copy it verbatim but not to alter it.\n\nThe purpose of a license, any license, is to specify which of those rights pass to the licensee (the end user) and which stay with the licensor (the creator).\n\nThis is true of creative commons just as it is for any other license.

The same issue would arise if the product contained public domain images in the advertisements that aren't present in the work itself.\n\nEssentially, the question comes down to whether there was actionable deceptive advertising. Usually, these claims arise under specialized consumer protection statutes that offer remedies and means of enforcement different from an individualized fraud lawsuit, and usually a deceptive advertising claim is easier to prove than traditional fraud lawsuit.\n\nTraditional fraud lawsuits normally require a showing of damages caused by reasonable reliance upon the misrepresentation, which is uneconomic to prove in the case of an individual small consumer purchase.\n\nUsually, deceptive advertising of consumer products is established in a lawsuit by a government official in charge of regulating deceptive advertising or a class action lawsuit, and often statutory damages are assigned to each violation rather than requiring detailed proof of economic harm for compensatory damages from some but not other images being present.\n\nOften fine print in the advertisement or in a purchase form before buying the product discloses the disconnect. Also, the mere presence of an image in an advertisement doesn't necessary imply that it is included in the product.

If it *ever* was, it has been completely undefended for the last 40 years, so it's much too late to now attempt to claim rights.\n\nSentinel and Scourge\n--------------------\n\nLet me dodge that one and generalize: Can you use *Alliance\\-Horde?*  \n\n*Terran\\-Protoss\\-Zerg?*  \n\n*Empire\\-Rebellion?*  \n\n*Gryffindor\\-Hufflepuff\\-Ravenclaw\\-Slytherin?*\n\nSee, there's a real spectrum there! The four names *alone* are so unique that J.K. Rowling would come after you if you used them *anywhere*. But Empire\\-Rebellion is too generic to assert an IP claim over.\n\nAnd if you pluck *non\\-paired* names from an IP, like Ravenclaw\\-Granger, that's not a problem either. A Wild West movie with feuding families the Grangers and Ravenclaws, would be absolutely fine; whereas Ravenclaws and Gryffindors would not be fine!\n\nDOTA 1, however, is a copyright morass. Many games permit fan\\-created \"mods\", ranging from the TM:PE traffic modeling mod in *Cities: Skylines* to the TSM auction pricing mod in *World of Warcraft*. The mod is nothing without the game. The game author doesn't own the mod, The mod author doesn't own the game. They coexist mostly by consent.\n\nDOTA I was an arena \"mod\" to *Warcraft III* and there has been quite considerable fighting over ownership of that IP.

Option B is the most appropriate approach because:\n\n1. The three-attribute system (Strength, Agility, Intelligence) is described as a common trope in RPGs and unlikely to be protected by intellectual property rights due to its widespread use over the past 40 years.\n\n2. Using generic faction names like \"Guardians\" and \"Marauders\" avoids the potential issues associated with directly copying specific names from existing games. The documentation explains that while unique names like \"Gryffindor-Hufflepuff\" are protected, more generic pairings like \"Empire-Rebellion\" are too generic to assert an IP claim over.\n\n3. This approach draws inspiration from established games without directly copying protected elements, which aligns with the advice that \"original games create original IP.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses the exact faction names from DOTA 1, which could lead to legal issues given the complex copyright situation surrounding DOTA.\n\nOption C is incorrect because copying exact hero abilities, even with changed names and designs, would likely be considered a derivative work and infringe on existing IP.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the four-attribute system is common and likely not protected, using the specific faction names \"Alliance\" and \"Horde\" could be problematic as they are closely associated with World of Warcraft.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the given information, apply it to a practical scenario, and make a judgment that balances creative inspiration with legal considerations in game design."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/63975/if-one-is-the-owner-of-an-mit-licence-can-that-person-relicense-the-software", "docs_id": 63975, "title": "If one is the owner of an MIT licence, can that person relicense the software?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that someone (S) has supervised a group of students for a school project to produce software.

If S is the sole copyright holder, S can issue any other non\\-exclusive license in parallel, and can also stop offering the software under the MIT license.

What copyright transfers or assignments are valid depends on the local laws, e.g. some jurisdiction do not recognize copyright as transferable and at most allow the assignment of economic aspects of copyright.\n* S might not be the sole copyright holder, but have additional permissions to the work. For example, there might have been extra licensing agreements, outside of the MIT license. Or S might have special rights for a work of joint authorship, if and only if the jurisdiction recognizes such additional rights.\n* S might not be the sole copyright holder and not have any agreements outside of the MIT license. Then S has no additional rights, and is bound by the terms of the MIT license.

This is because the declaration defines the legal status of different parts of the property and outlines maintenance responsibilities.\n\nIf the balcony is classified as a limited common element, it means that while the homeowner has exclusive access to it, it's actually owned by the condominium as a whole.

This can happen if, for example, you witnessed something that is incredibly unusual. It might also happen if enough other people conspire to lie about something that you know the truth about.\n\nThe fifth amendment to the constitution should prohibit you from being forced to testify in a situation where you have a reasonable belief that truthful testimony could subject you to prosecution for a crime. But it seems like that can't help you in this case. Immunity from prosecution for truthful testimony won't help you if a prosecutor can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that your testimony is false. And I can't imagine a prosecutor allowing someone to testify with immunity from prosecution for making false statements in that very testimony.\n\nThis can't be so rare it has never happened. If it has happened, what happens when someone tells a judge that he pleads the fifth because he believes that if he gives the testimony he believes is truthful it will subject him to perjury charges because it can be proven false beyond a reasonable doubt (despite his belief that it is true)? If it has never happened, what should happen in this case?\n\nTo be precise, the assumption behind this question is that you have an objectively\\-reasonable belief that an answer that you believe is true would subject you to criminal liability for perjury.\n\nTo be clear:\n\n1. The person has not yet testified.\n2. They are being asked to testify.\n3. They have an objectively\\-reasonable fear that the testimony they would give will subject them to criminal liability for perjury.\n4. They therefore invoke their fifth amendment right.\n\nAssume none of these points are controversial. Obviously, others may not agree that the testimony they say they will give is truthful. But there is no reason to doubt their claim that the testimony they would give would subject them to criminal liability for perjury.\n\nThe question is whether this has ever occurred and, if so, what happened. Or, if it has not occurred, what would happen next? Can the person be granted immunity from prosecution for perjury in the very testimony they are given? Or can they be compelled to testify even though they have an objectively\\-reasonable belief that the testimony they would give will subject them to criminal liability? Or is there some third alternative?\n\nLastly, if this has never happened, why not? It seems like this wouldn't be a terribly uncommon situation. I don't think it would happen every day or even every year \\-\\- but never in the history of jurisprudence?!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The California [jury instructions for the crime of perjury](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/2600/2640/) give more detail on what it means to commit perjury: it's not just that you make a statement that is false, you have to willfully state that the information is true even though you know it is false. If you have a belief that you will be convicted for perjury (or any crime) by testifying, you may invoke your 5th Amendment right (I assume you are not testifying as the defendant in a criminal matter). You might (theoretically: see below on immunity and perjury) be granted immunity from prosecution, in which case there is no 5th Amendment right to refuse to testify (you are not putting yourself in criminal jeopardy), and the court can order you to testify. Or, you might not be granted immunity and still be ordered to testify.\n\nThe federal immunity statute, [18 USC 6002](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/6002), also needs to be scrutinized. When ordered to testify, \"the witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his privilege against self\\-incrimination\", but it generally cannot be used against him:\n\n> no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any\n>  information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or\n>  other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal\n>  case\n\nHowever, there is an exception:\n\n> except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or\n>  otherwise failing to comply with the order.\n\nIn other words, you cannot be immunized against a perjury charge.\n\nIn [Kastigar v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/406/441/), 406 U.S. 441 defendant refused an order to testify, on the grounds that they (allegedly) believed that the government's grant of immunity was not broad enough, i.e. that there were areas where they might be questions and forced to criminally implicate themselves. They refused, and were held in contempt.\n\nThe opinion recognized that the 5th Amendment \"protects against any disclosures that the witness *reasonably* believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used\" (emphasis added). \n\nIn [Mason v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/244/362/), 244 U.S. 362, the court held that\n\n> The Fifth Amendment does not relieve a witness from answering merely\n>  on his own declaration or judgment that an answer might incriminate\n>  him; whether he must answer is determinable by the trial court in the\n>  exercise of its sound discretion, and unless there is reasonable\n>  ground, as distinct from a remote or speculative possibility, to\n>  apprehend that a direct answer may prove dangerous to the witness, his\n>  answer should be compelled.\n\n[Heike v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/227/131/), 227 U.S. 131 asserts that \"the constitutional protection is confined to real danger, and does not extend to remote possibilities out of the ordinary course of law, citing [Brown v. Walker](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/161/591/), 161 U.S. 591 (itself quoting Lord Chief Justice Cockburn):\n\n> \"the danger to be apprehended must be real and appreciable, with\n>  reference to the ordinary operation of law in the ordinary course of\n>  things; not a danger of an imaginary and unsubstantial character,\n>  having reference to some extraordinary and barely possible\n>  contingency, so improbable that no reasonable man would suffer it to\n>  influence his conduct\"\n\nAlthough the wording of the immunity statute does not allow immunity from prosecution for perjury, the 5th Amendment right can only be invoked against a real legal jeopardy. They *can* be compelled to testify, they probably cannot be immunized against a perjury conviction (certainly not at the federal level).

The witness firmly believes they observed the defendant commit the crime, but is aware that several other witnesses and substantial physical evidence contradict their account. The witness fears that testifying truthfully (according to their belief) could lead to a perjury charge. What is the most likely legal outcome if the witness invokes their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination?\n\nA) The court will grant the witness immunity from perjury charges, compelling them to testify.\nB) The witness will be allowed to refrain from testifying based on their Fifth Amendment claim.\nC) The court will evaluate the reasonableness of the witness's fear and may compel testimony if deemed unfounded.\nD) The witness will be charged with contempt of court for refusing to testify.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario presents a complex interplay between Fifth Amendment rights, perjury concerns, and judicial discretion. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination, but its application is not absolute. As stated in Mason v. United States, the court has the discretion to determine whether the witness must answer.\n\n2. The key factor is whether there is a \"reasonable ground\" for the witness to fear self-incrimination. The court must assess if the danger is \"real and appreciable\" (Heike v. United States) rather than speculative or remote.\n\n3. In this case, while the witness sincerely believes their account, the existence of contradictory evidence suggests that their fear of perjury charges might be considered reasonable by the court.\n\n4. However, the court must balance this against the need for testimony and the reality that one cannot be immunized against perjury charges (as per 18 USC 6002).\n\n5. The court would likely evaluate the specific circumstances, the nature of the contradictory evidence, and the overall context of the case to determine if the witness's fear is objectively reasonable.\n\n6.

Who is the judge going to believe?\n\nOr yet a simpler example. Say Party 1 has some witnesses. Party 2 claims what these witnesses say is not correct and presents some kind of counter evidence. What is going to happen?\n\nIn the end, what determines which party the judge is going to believe?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In law there are two different concepts: admissibility of evidence and the weight of that evidence.\nYour question concerns both. I will begin by discussing a little bit about what both these two terms mean.\n\nAdmissibility means that this evidence may go before the trier of fact. Typically the trier of fact is the jury, however, if both parties have waived their rights to jury trials (particularly the defendant) the judge is the trier of fact as well as the law. When documents or testimony by witnesses is admissible, the trier of fact can consider it in reaching a decision.\n\nWeight of evidence is a different concept. The weight of evidence is what someone believes. For example if two witnesses who were bystanders testify that the light was red, but the defendant testifies that the light was green, most people would believe the bystanders. However, in this case the evidence by the defendant that the light was green is admissible, but the trier of fact may not afford it much weight.\n\nNow let's consider these logs. In the United States all statements made out of court, whether verbal or written, are considered hearsay (with some exceptions, a couple will be discussed later). Hearsay is generally inadmissible; however, there are many hearsay exceptions.\n\nOne exception is a record of a regularly conducted activity. The requirements are (summarized, you may refer to the federal rules of evidence 803\\-6\\.) for the full text):\n(A) the record was made at the time of the event by someone who knew about what happened\n(B) the record was kept in the course of this regularly conducted activity\n(C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity\n(D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness\n(E) neither the opponent does not show that the source of information nor or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n\nNow if these logs fit these requirements you can most likely use them in court. If they don't you probably will not be able to use to in court, unless one of the following applies:\n1\\.) you are being sued by someone (or you are suing them) who made the logs and you are offering the logs against them (this is referred to in legal settings as party\\-opponent statements) OR\n2\\.) the other party has offered evidence that you are lying and you are offering this logs to show you are telling the truth.\n\nMost likely the only admissible evidence would be the testimony of the employee and the employer. This leads to a he said she said scenario and the legal results will be highly ambiguous. The credibility of both witnesses will be likely assessed by the trier of fact and the trier will consider who has a higher incentive to lie. If there are more witnesses saying one thing versus another, it is likely they will be believed unless there is a reason all of them are lying.\n\nAlthough this is not legal advice, my suggestion for an employee in such a situation is to gather evidence that an employer asked you to commit a crime as part of your job. Print out emails, get written requests from the employer, and have witnesses present at the time of the request. Then the employee should refuse to perform the act. If as a result the employee is fired, one can sue. All these statements of the employer can be admitted as party\\-opponent statements. \n\nAdditionally I suggest that you advocate for your company to adopt policies which require record keeping, which will satisfy the hearsay exception given above.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is asked by their manager to modify log files to conceal a security breach before a potential audit.

Option B is the strongest because:\n\n1. Email exchanges constitute written records that could be admitted as party-opponent statements, which are an exception to the hearsay rule. These are likely to be given significant weight by the court.\n\n2. Testimony from a colleague who overheard the request provides corroborating evidence from a third party, strengthening the developer's claim.\n\n3. This combination addresses the documentation's advice to \"gather evidence that an employer asked you to commit a crime as part of your job\" and to \"Print out emails, get written requests from the employer, and have witnesses present at the time of the request.\"\n\nOption A is weaker because a personal diary is less reliable and may be seen as self-serving. Option C involves potential legal issues with recording conversations without consent, depending on the jurisdiction. Option D is less effective because polygraph tests are often inadmissible in court, and work activity logs don't directly prove the manager's request.\n\nThis question tests the application of legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple ideas from the documentation and critical thinking about evidence admissibility and weight in a legal context."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8438/is-it-legal-to-own-lockpicks-in-pennsylvania", "docs_id": 8438, "title": "Is it legal to own lockpicks in Pennsylvania?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am interested in learning about lockpicking as a hobby.

The accused was busted in mildly suspicious circumstances at 5:20 am in the dead of winter, urinating. The court notes that \"There is no evidence that appellant's hands were on the door or that he made an attempt to extract the tools from his pocket and apply them to the door. In fact, there is no act or statement by appellant that would lead one to infer that he intended to use the tools at that time\", and that \"appellant is a certified locksmith and it is not unreasonable to find the tools of his trade in his pocket, especially when he is wearing his work attire\". Note that this is on appeal: he was convicted initially. The point is that there is a lot of slop in cashing out the legal concept of \"intent\".\n\nPennsylvania does not, apparently, have any specific laws that refer to lock picks. It does have a statute that addresses having criminal tools, which are defined as (including) \"Anything used for criminal purposes and possessed by\nthe actor under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for lawful uses it may have\". Mr. Gendrachi had those very tools, and the appeals court did not say anything to suggest that the tools were not \"criminal tools\" (and in FN 5 they actually point out that the Commonwealth cannot say that the tools were weapons, a ludicrous proposition never raised by anyone \u2013 so by failing to deny that lock picks are criminal tools, they are adoptively admitting that they *are* criminal tools).

As you are no doubt aware, the lease is essentially a contract between the landlord and the tenant, stipulating rights, reservations and obligations over a demised piece of land. It is common for freehold management companies to charge fees for issuing consents to alterations, keeping pets and such like. And of course premiums can be charged by a landlord for renewing leases, although the legislation governing leasehold houses is slightly different (see [Leasehold Reform Act 1967](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/88/contents)).\n\nThis kind of freehold/leasehold arrangement was also common in older 'equity release' sale and leaseback schemes, where the owner sells the freehold to a third party who then leases the property back to the tenant, usually at a nominal rent.\n\nThat being said, some developers of new estates have sold houses as leasehold (as good as freehold, apparently). It's a problem that's come into sharp focus recently and the government has issued [White Paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fixing-our-broken-housing-market) intending to legislate further, and perhaps ban the sale of new leasehold houses. \n\nIt may have been the case for the previous owner that when they came into ownership of both leasehold and freehold interests it didn't affect their enjoyment of the property in any way, so the titles were never merged. \n\nProvided there are no outstanding charges or incumbrances, both freehold and leasehold titles are in the same ownership and there is clear intention to merge the estates, this can be dealt with quite easily by application to the Land Registry. \n\nI'd suggest asking your solicitor to send you the lease, and explain any terms or provisions you're not sure of or don't understand.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A prospective homebuyer discovers that the property they're interested in has both freehold and leasehold titles held by the current owner.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"you can't really measure 'control' as a simple percentage.\" This indicates that the 80% ownership alone doesn't automatically grant Company B the right to bind Company A.\n\n2. The answer points out that affiliates often have contracts with parent companies, and these can be very detailed, specifying exactly what the parent company has control over.\n\n3. The key phrase \"when the parent is selling widgets, it can reasonably claim control over its affiliate\" suggests that control is context-specific and can depend on the particular business activity in question.\n\n4. Option A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the relationship between ownership and control. \n\n5.

However, if a seller knows or has good reason to know that a buyer does in fact had dementia or some other mental problem, and is not or may well not be able to understand the nature of the deal or the reasons why it is or is not a good bargain, if the seller took advantage of the buyer's mental condition, then the seller may be liable.\n\nAlso, if the buyer's condition is such that the buyer is deemed not to be capable of properly entering into a contract, that is the buyer lacks the capacity to contract, then the contract may well be void from teh4 start.\n\nThe Video\n---------\n\nThe video linked in the question shows a man confronting a salesman who, he alleges, sold two houshold doors to his mother for a total of just under 6,000 pounds UK. The son claims that it was obvious that his mother was impaired. He claims that the only problem was that one door had a broken handle and latch, which could easily be repaired for 50 pounds. He claims that the salesman falsely states that the doors were \"not safe\" without mentioning that the one with a problem could easily be repaired, and need not be replaced. He also claims that the salesman took checks in payment, in spite of the printed terms on the invoice saying that no payment was due until after installation. He says repeatedly that the salesman \"pressured\" his mother into making this purchase, and describes it as \"robbery\".\n\nNo proof is shown in the video, and no court decision is refereed to.

The correct answer is C because the documentation states that \"if a seller knows or has good reason to know that a buyer does in fact had dementia or some other mental problem, and is not or may well not be able to understand the nature of the deal or the reasons why it is or is not a good bargain, if the seller took advantage of the buyer's mental condition, then the seller may be liable.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no general rule requiring sellers to determine the mental condition of buyers, and criminal liability is not automatic in these situations.

The university has informed F that they cannot start working until they receive their Social Security Number (SSN), which may take 3-4 weeks. However, F is expected to begin teaching immediately. Which of the following best describes the legal and practical implications of this situation?\n\nA) F should refuse to teach until receiving the SSN to avoid violating visa terms\nB) The university is acting illegally by asking F to work without being on payroll\nC) F can legally begin teaching while awaiting the SSN, but the university should provide appropriate documentation\nD) F must enter the US early to apply for the SSN before the official start date\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Social Security Administration document referenced in the answer, foreign workers are not required to have a Social Security number before starting work. While the IRS requires employers to use SSNs to report wages, there is a legal workaround for this situation. The employer can use a letter from the SSA stating that the employee has applied for a number, along with immigration documents proving work authorization.\n\nThis approach allows F to begin teaching legally while awaiting the SSN, which addresses both the university's need for F to start teaching and compliance with legal requirements. The university should provide F with the necessary documentation (SSA application letter and work authorization proof) to legally begin work.\n\nOption A is incorrect because refusing to teach isn't necessary and could jeopardize F's position. Option B is incorrect because the university can legally have F work while awaiting the SSN if proper documentation is provided. Option D is incorrect because F is limited in how early they can enter the US based on visa restrictions (10 days before the start date).\n\nThis question requires analysis of the legal situation, integration of multiple concepts (visa rules, SSN requirements, and employment practices), and application to a real-world scenario, meeting the criteria for a challenging, higher-order thinking question."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43147/is-the-statement-i-we-am-are-pressing-charges-incorrect", "docs_id": 43147, "title": "Is the statement &quot;I/we am/are pressing charges&quot; incorrect?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the media and in everyday life it is common to hear things like:\n\n\"Are you going to press charges?\"\n\n\"Did Bob Press charges?\"\n\n\"I am going to press charges against that jerk\"\n\nOr something along those lines.\n\nThese statements make it seem like individual citizens have some ability and all mechanisms at their disposal to bring a charge upon someone or something.\n\nI am wondering if what is really being said in these statements is \nmore like:\n\n\"I am going to press the District Attorney to charge my assailant\"\n\nOr\n\n\"I heard Jan and Bob feel very wronged by Mike and they will be speaking with the DA today in hopes that charges will be filed\"\n\nSo the question is this:\n\nIs pressing charges the act of convincing or informing the true authority that can do such a thing to indeed take the action?\n\nOr is there some mechanism/action that takes place when a person says they are going to \"press charges\" that I am unaware of?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The General Rule: The Prosecutor And Not The Crime Victim Decides\n=================================================================\n\nYou are correct that this is mostly wrong.\n\nPressing charges is something that happens. But, this simply consists of making a report to law enforcement about an incident and asking that the prosecutor either directly, or indirectly through a request directed to the law enforcement officer to whom a report is made, to pursue criminal charges in the case.\n\nBut, this request has no binding or legal effect, even though many law enforcement agencies and prosecutors offices have a formal or informal unwritten policy of honoring a crime reporting victim's wishes whenever possible. In the United States, a prosecutor can commence a criminal case against someone without consulting a victim of a crime, or over the objections of the victim of the crime, and can even (and sometimes does) incarcerate the victim of the crime to force the victim to testify against a criminal defendant (this most often happens in cases of statutory rape, domestic violence and cases involving organized crime or gangs).\n\nLikewise, a prosecutor (in the United States) can choose to decline to prosecute a criminal case despite irrefutable evidence tied up with a bow and the pleas of the victim and lots of other members of the general public.\n\n(Not all countries are like this. For example, in Germany, some crimes can only be prosecuted with the victim's consent, and within reason a prosecutor is required to prosecute every case in which there is clear evidence that a crime was committed and the victim's consent, if necessary, is present. While Germany is something of an extreme case, it is much closer to the norm than the U.S. is in countries that do not have a common law legal tradition, while the U.S., while an extreme case, is closer to the norm of countries in the common law tradition of British law.)\n\nA crime victim's wishes aren't entirely irrelevant in practice. Many states have a \"victim's bill of rights\" that requires a prosecutor to confer with a victim when possible over whether a criminal case will be commenced against a defendant, and in practice, many prosecutors in ordinary type cases come to think of the victims of crimes, rather than \"the People\" as their client, even though that isn't technically correct from a legal perspective.\n\nMost of the time, a crime victim's wishes will be respected by prosecutors whether conveyed directly to a prosecutor, or indirectly through a law enforcement officer. But, nothing requires either a law enforcement officer or a prosecutor to do so.\n\nLaw enforcement officers in some ways have even more discretion than prosecutors do and simply don't pass on information about myriad crimes that they have knowledge of and could prove, every day. But, prosecutors can choose to disagree with a law enforcement officer's exercise of discretion when they do know about an incident, either by declining to prosecute a crime, or by prosecuting a crime that law enforcement officers didn't want to prosecute. And, law enforcement officers as a matter of practical reality can be forced by prosecutors to execute search warrants and arrest warrants.\n\nAlso, it is true that when neither law enforcement or prosecutors know a crime has been committed that they can't prosecute it, and usually, the way that they learn of a crime is that a crime victim reports the crime to law enforcement. The decision to report or not report a crime not known to law enforcement is, in practice, what \"pressing charges\" or \"not pressing charges\" usually means and this does, in practice, constitute a veto power over further criminal proceedings arising from an incident, even though the language used implies a more formal step in a legal process than it does.\n\nExceptions To The General Rule\n==============================\n\nN.B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are a few exceptions to the general rule.\n\nA handful of U.S. states, so far as I know, all on the East Coast (and also England and South Africa), allow individuals who are crime victims to directly commence the prosecution of minor crimes in a court of law without the intervention of law enforcement or a prosecutor, or grand jury, often without an attorney. Usually, if this is done, the prosecuting attorney's office can take over the case from the private individual litigant if they choose to do so. A discussion of the historical practice with case citations can be found [here](https://www.insurancefraud.org/role-of-victims.htm).\n\nIn the roughly half of U.S. states and in the federal system, where felony criminal charges must be brought via a grand jury indictment before they can be tried, a so called \"[runaway grand jury](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2005/09/what-s-a-runaway-grand-jury.html)\" can bring criminal charges that the prosecutor has a duty to make a good faith effort to prosecute, without the request of the prosecutor convening the grand jury.\n\nFor example, [in a recent Alabama case](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/us/alabama-pregnant-woman-shot-in-stomach-manslaughter-indictment-trnd/index.html), prosecutors went to a grand jury seeking felony charges against someone who shot a pregnant woman, and the grand jury decided to indict the woman who was shot for manslaughter on the theory that she caused the death of her unborn child by starting a fight that led to the shooting. The prosecutor's office once it had control of the case, and had observed the public outrage over the decision, then dismissed those charges.\n\nThere are a few states where a crime victim who is dissatisfied with a prosecutor or law enforcement officer's exercise of discretion can apply to a court to have a disinterested and uninvolved attorney appointed as a [special prosecutor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_prosecutor) to review the facts of an alleged crime and decide independently regarding whether criminal charges should be pressed in a case where law enforcement and the prosecutor's office declined to do so. This is most frequently invoked when the alleged perpetrator of the crime is connected to law enforcement or the prosecutor's office.\n\nAlso, just become a prosecutor declines to bring a criminal case despite a crime victim's desire to \"press charges\", this doesn't mean that the victim can't sue the person who committed the crime for money damages (including punitive damages in many cases) from the same conduct that constituted the crime. In big dollar cases involving fraud or theft from a small number of affluent victims (a kind of case I frequently handle in my law practice), this happens all the time.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A local activist group is outraged that the district attorney's office declined to prosecute a high-profile case of alleged corporate fraud.

Which of the following outcomes is most likely, given the information in the documentation?\n\nA) The activist group can directly file criminal charges in court, bypassing the prosecutor's decision.\nB) The group can petition a judge to appoint a special prosecutor to review the case independently.\nC) The group's attempt to \"press charges\" will have no legal effect on the criminal proceedings.\nD) The group can convene a grand jury to indict the corporation without the prosecutor's involvement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of the legal concept of \"pressing charges\" and the limitations of public influence on criminal proceedings. The correct answer is C because, as stated in the documentation, the phrase \"pressing charges\" has no formal legal meaning or effect. The decision to prosecute lies solely with the prosecutor's office, and individuals or groups cannot override this decision through their own actions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while a few states allow individuals to directly commence prosecution for minor crimes, this is not a widespread practice and wouldn't apply to a high-profile corporate fraud case.\n\nOption B is plausible but not the most likely outcome. While the documentation mentions that some states allow for the appointment of special prosecutors, this is typically in cases where there's a conflict of interest with law enforcement or the prosecutor's office, not simply because the public disagrees with the decision.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, although the documentation mentions \"runaway grand juries,\" these are rare exceptions and not something that can be initiated by a public group.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about the limitations of public influence on the criminal justice system.

Long story short, I entered into a contract with a general contractor for the construction of my new home. I have been moved into the home but there are multiple problems with the construction. These defects have been verified by third party inspectors. Despite the third party reports, my general contractor refuses to fix the problems.\n\nMy contract states that any disputes must go to binding arbitration through the AAA. This can be an expensive process and it's my understanding that I am unable to recover my legal costs in a judgement. \n\nI was reviewing the contract and doing some research on the contractor and came across the following:\n\n* The general contractor has an LLC. Let's say his legal business name is Smith Homes, LLC.\n* He has also registered a fictitious, or DBA, name with the state called Smith Homes.\n* My construction contract has his business logo in the top left corner. The logo only states the DBA name, Smith Homes.\n* In the top right corner of the contract it does list his state registration number.\n* The contract states the following: \"This contract made on 5th day of March 2018, by and between John Doe (my name) hereinafter called the owner and Smith Homes hereinafter called the contractor.\n* The signature line on the bottom simply states \"Contractor\" and then a place for the general contractor to sign.\n* Nowhere on the contract does it list the full legal name of the contractors business, Smith Homes, LLC.\n\nFrom my research, the DBA name can enter a contract if it is noted that it is a DBA of the legal company name when the parties are introduced at the beginning of the contract. You might write, for example, \"Smith Homes, LLC, d/b/a Smith Homes.\" \n\nWith all of that said, is this contract enforceable since the legal name of the contractor's business was not stated in the contract? Also, since the contractor signed his name at the bottom of the document, could he be personally liable in a lawsuit?\n\nThank you all in advance!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The contract is enforceable\n---------------------------\n\nNo one is in any doubt that the parties to the contract are you and Smith Homes and everyone knows that Smith Homes means Smith Homes LLC.

The contract specifies binding arbitration through AAA for dispute resolution, but the homeowner notices discrepancies in how the contractor's business is identified in the contract. Which of the following actions is most likely to be successful in challenging the contract's enforceability?\n\nA) Arguing that the contract is void because it only lists the DBA name \"Smith Homes\" instead of the full legal name \"Smith Homes, LLC\"\nB) Claiming personal liability of the contractor because he signed his name without specifying his role in the LLC\nC) Contesting the arbitration clause due to the potential high costs and inability to recover legal fees\nD) Seeking to invalidate the contract based on the construction defects verified by third-party inspectors\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of contract law, dispute resolution, and business entity concepts. The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The contract's enforceability is unlikely to be successfully challenged based on the use of the DBA name alone (option A). As mentioned in the documentation, contracts are not typically invalidated for minor irregularities, especially when the parties' identities are clear.\n\n2. The contractor's personal liability (option B) is a separate issue from the contract's enforceability and would likely require piercing the corporate veil, which is generally difficult.\n\n3. The construction defects (option D) are a reason for seeking remedies under the contract, not a basis for invalidating it.\n\n4. Challenging the arbitration clause (option C) is the most promising approach. Courts have been known to scrutinize arbitration clauses, especially in consumer contracts, for fairness. The high costs of AAA arbitration and the inability to recover legal fees could potentially be argued as unconscionable or as effectively denying the homeowner access to dispute resolution.\n\nThis answer requires integrating knowledge of contract law, business structures, and arbitration principles, applying them to a real-world scenario, and critically analyzing the most strategic approach to challenging a contract provision.

The correct answer, B, is the most strategic approach for several reasons:\n\n1. By insisting on a token payment, the developer establishes a clear record that the software was not created \"during the course of employment\" and that the employer recognizes the developer's ownership. This addresses the key legal issue mentioned in the documentation.\n\n2.

Baltimore*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/32/243/) (1833\\), the Supreme Court held that the Bill of Rights was enacted as part of the federal constitution and only restricts the exercise of the federal government's authority. State and local governments are instead bound by the *Fourteenth* Amendment, which says that\n\n> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nOver the years, the courts have held that state action that deprives someone of fundamental rights deprives them of life, liberty, or property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In [Wolf v.

If an investigating authority thinks a crime has been committed and not yet been adjudicated, it is free to investigate, even if others disagree.\n\nThere are plenty of avenues for starting an investigation:\n\n* Congress can exercise its oversight power to initiate an investigation. State legislatures can do the same, so you could petition the New York Legislature, the Virginia General Assembly, or the Pennsylvania General Assembly.\n* At both the state and federal level, attorneys general have the authority to initiate an investigation of crimes committed within their jurisdictions.\n* At both the state and federal level, a judge's authority to appoint a special prosecutor is a power considered to be inherent in the courts, so nearly any court could appoint someone to pursue the investigation. Of course, the prosecutor's authority could be jurisdictionally limited \\-\\- if a New York state judge appointed a prosecutor, he wouldn't really have much authority to investigate federal crimes, and if a small\\-claims court judge in Idaho appointed a prosecutor, he'd be limited by both his lack of authority to investigate events outside his jurisdiction and the practical difficulties of enforcing a subpoena from out of state.\n* Even at the local level, law enforcement and legislative bodies have the authority to launch investigations. If NYPD or the Somerset County Sheriff or the Arlington County Board want to investigate, they could do so.\n* I don't know what the relevant rules are in each jurisdiction, but some states allow lawsuits for civil damages based on criminal activity. So if the gist of the sponsor's complaint is that someone used \"explosives and/or incendiaries\" to kill his son, it may be that he could bring a lawsuit over that, which would in turn open up the the tools of civil discovery. Of course, that's only if the claim isn't time\\-barred; now that we're nearly 17 years out, I'd guess that it would be too late.\n* And there's always the possibility of continuing an independent investigation. Using the same tools that the press uses \\-\\- interviews, freedom\\-of\\-information laws, etc. \\-\\- any member of the public is free to make an inquiry into any matter of public concern.\n\nObviously, I'd expect any of these authorities to be reluctant to take up the cause due to the investigatory consensus against the inside\\-job/cover\\-up theory, and I'd also expect \\-\\- for the same reason \\-\\- that any authority that tried to take it up would run into serious roadblocks from all the other authorities that have declined.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A group of citizens is seeking to reopen the 9/11 investigation, citing new evidence.

Option B is the most effective approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Federal judges have the inherent authority to appoint special prosecutors, which can overcome the reluctance of other bodies to investigate.\n2. A federal-level investigation would have broader jurisdiction than state or local efforts, allowing for a comprehensive review of the 9/11 events across multiple states.\n3. Unlike a civil lawsuit (option C), which may be time-barred after 17 years, there's no specific time limitation mentioned for a judge appointing a special prosecutor.\n4. A federal special prosecutor would have more resources and authority than local investigations (options A and D), making it easier to overcome potential roadblocks from other authorities.\n5. This approach addresses the practical difficulties of enforcing subpoenas across state lines, which could be an issue with state or local investigations.\n\nWhile all options presented are technically possible based on the documentation, option B provides the most comprehensive and practically feasible approach to initiating a new investigation, considering the multi-state nature of the 9/11 events and the potential resistance from other authorities.

[This legal brief](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/documents/reference/current/membersonlybriefs/132adultsupport.pdf) by the Ohio Legislative Service Commission indicates (based on case law in Ohio) that\n\n> Outside the criminal law, an adult child has no legal duty to support\n> a parent unless a contract, express or implied, exists.\n\n[California has a law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=9.&chapter=1.&part=4.&lawCode=FAM) imposing a similar financial responsibility on children, and [also has a law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=12350.&lawCode=WIC) denying such responsibility.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. As demonstrated in the Melmark v. Schutt case, filial responsibility laws can be applied across state lines. This case showed that parents in New Jersey could be sued under Pennsylvania law.\n\n2. However, enforcing such a judgment is not automatic and involves complex legal considerations. The key concept here is \"choice of law,\" which was crucial in the Melmark v. Schutt case.\n\n3. In that case, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had to determine which state had the greater interest in applying its law. They concluded that Pennsylvania's interest prevailed.\n\n4. In our scenario, a Texas court would need to conduct a similar analysis. They would have to consider whether to apply Texas law (which has no filial responsibility statute) or Pennsylvania law (which does).\n\n5. The court would likely consider factors such as where the care was provided, where the debt was incurred, and the public policy interests of both states.\n\n6. Option A is incorrect because Texas courts wouldn't automatically reject the case.

Alex*, [2017 SCC 37 at para. 31](https://canlii.ca/t/h4mzd#par31)).\n\nMany factors would pull a court to interpret a statute more narrowly or broadly than an acontextual, isolated reading of the words would suggest. Generally, this includes the full text, context, and purpose of the statute. Courts will look to:\n\n* the words of the provision\n* the surrounding words and related provisions\n* the words of the entire statute\n* the entire statute book\n* the legislative purpose as revealed through legislative history and the mischief the provision is meant to deal with\n* the presumption of constitutionality\n* etc.\n\nBasically every doctrine of statutory interpretation will pull towards either a narrow or broad reading of a provision. I would hesitate though to call these \"corrections\" of \"legislative flaws\" but rather an attempt to give effect to the legislative intent.

Instead, they would first attempt to interpret the statute in a way that gives effect to the legislative intent, considering factors such as the entire statute, legislative purpose, and the mischief the provision is meant to address.\n\nOption C contradicts the principle of narrow interpretation and would likely exacerbate rather than resolve the issue. Option D, while a valid constitutional remedy, would only be considered after a full interpretation reveals the law to be unconstitutional, and is not part of the initial interpretive process.\n\nThe correct approach (B) involves using contextual interpretation to understand the legislature's intent and narrow the law's scope to a specific public safety concern that might have motivated its creation. This aligns with the court's practice of looking at the full text, context, and purpose of the statute, as well as considering the legislative history and the problem the provision is meant to address.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking and application of legal principles rather than mere memorization, and requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation in a real-world scenario."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82425/what-happens-if-you-are-convicted-and-put-on-probation-in-a-state-you-dont-live", "docs_id": 82425, "title": "What happens if you are convicted and put on probation in a state you don&#39;t live in?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How is probation handled when the offender commits a crime in one state, but lives in another?\n\nFor example \\- a DUI usually does not involve a jail/prison sentence, but probation.

He lives in\n> California.\n> \n> \n> In what state will the trial be?\n\nOregon. State law crimes are always tried in the jurisdiction where they are committed. A crime is committed either where the acts causing the crime took place or where the harm caused by the crime is directed. In the classic example, if you shoot and murder someone in Oregon from within California, either state (or both states) can prosecute you for murder. If you have a DUI in Oregon that doesn't involve crossing the state line, California can't try you for that crime.\n\n> If he's convicted, will he have to move to Oregon to serve probation\n> or would he automatically serve probation in California since he lives\n> there?\n\nA standard condition of probation is to not leave the state without court permission, but the court imposing probation can authorize you to leave the state subject to other restrictions devised by the court (e.g. forfeiture of one's passport until the probation sentence is completed so that extradition is available if a felony is committed while on probation).\n\nThere is also a process in place by which states can cooperate to have their probation officers supervise a convicted defendant's probation order from one state in another state (usually with the requirement that the sentencing state either pay for that service, have the defendant pay for that service, or that there be reciprocity such that California will only agree supervise people placed on probation in Oregon if Oregon will agree to supervise people placed on probation in California).\n\nIt is also possible that even though probation is an available sentencing option, that for an out of state defendant, a jail sentence and/or a larger than usual fine will be imposed in lieu of a probation sentence, to avoid these complications.\n\nOf course, unless you let your lawyer (or if you are representing yourself, the court) know what you would like to arrange and take the proper legal steps to do so (which realistically requires the skills of an experienced criminal lawyer), the court won't allow you to do so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A California resident is arrested for a DUI while on vacation in Oregon.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The trial cannot be moved to California (eliminating option A), as the documentation clearly states that \"State law crimes are always tried in the jurisdiction where they are committed.\"\n\n2.

You can publish whatever you want that the university doesn't have a legal interest in. The clause that says \"If you have co\\-authors or co\\-researchers you must ask their permission before publishing, and include their names\" is true, and defines a limit on their control.

The correct approach is nuanced:\n\n1. The official's request overreaches by stating approval is needed for \"anything\" posted online, which is not legally enforceable for all types of speech.\n\n2. However, the university does have legitimate interests in certain types of publications, particularly those involving co-authors, research, or university affiliation.\n\n3. The First Amendment protects the student's right to free speech, especially at a public university, but this right is not absolute in an academic setting.\n\n4. The absence of this requirement in the graduate manual suggests it may not be an official, enforceable policy.\n\n5. The most appropriate action is to seek clarification (option C). This allows the student to:\n   - Understand the actual scope of the requirement\n   - Differentiate between academic work (where the university may have some say) and personal expression\n   - Potentially negotiate a more reasonable policy that respects both academic integrity and personal rights\n   - Avoid unnecessary conflict while still asserting their rights\n\nOptions A and B represent extreme positions that don't account for the nuances of the situation.

Here is a list of some of them:\n\n* Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs (\\>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Olmec Inscriptions (\\>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Mayan Glyphs\n* Ancient Aztec Glyphs\n* Old English Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Old Runic Inscriptions (\\>1000 years old)\n* Old Irish Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Inscriptions (\\>3000 years old, like the [oracle bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone))\n* Ancient Latin Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Greek Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Etc. There are many other cultures such as Finnish, Tibetan, etc.\n\nSome of these are owned by places like the Catholic Church, others by places like the British Library, or other Libraries or Museums, even others are held by Universities, and still others are held by private individuals who may post an image online of the artifact for a variety of reasons, like [this person did](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/4t9kop/book_written_in_geez_ancient_ethiopic_unknown_age/). Also, some artifacts may have been *created* in one place (like in China), but *hosted* in another place (like at the British museum).\n\nSo the question is about looking at an online image of one of these artifacts, which is provided by one of the owners, and then either drawing a picture to replicate the object (like the image below), or copying it into text form, such as [this](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/), which was transcribed from [an image of a manuscript](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/manuscripts/cp/?tp=ob), into [electronic text](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/view/#edition/translation).\n\nSpecifically, all of the things I am talking about are pre\\-copyright era, the actual objects themselves. So then someone finds/discovers the item (either they found it pre\\-copyright era, like 1000\\+ years ago finding something and putting it in the king's library), or it was discovered post\\-copyright\\-starting era. So somebody owns it. I am not concerned with that part. But then they take a picture of it and put it online. Some of the pictures (like the reddit image) are just quickly shot with an iPhone. Others require significant cost, care, and tooling, such as taking a picture of a fragile ancient manuscript, while others require that much cost/care/tooling to startup, but then can be automated for thousands or millions of artifacts (like the Google books project). But in the end, an image of a natural, copyright\\-free artifact (since it was created pre\\-copyright era) is online and publicly available.\n\nWhat you see in this situation often is \"this image is copyrighted\". To me that means that you can't directly sell the image, or host it on your site/product for commercial gain. But given the *content* of the image is in the public domain (again, the content from all those cultural resources listed at the beginning) because it was created thousands of years ago, I wonder what you are allowed to do with the image.\n\nI wonder if you are allowed to:\n\n* Make a drawing of it (like the sketch below).\n* Transcribe the text contained in the original document (which you could *see* because of the copyrighted image).\n\nObviously the drawing wouldn't be a straight copy of the *photograph*. It would draw the essence of the content instead. So the content is public domain, but the image is copyrighted and the artifact is owned. I wonder if you are allowed to essentially write down in electronic form what is in the manuscript artifact, or in the case of glyphs, to write down the glyphs.\n\nWhat this would mean is that one could go to a museum website and view their manuscripts, and transcribe them, and then do what you want with the transcription. If that's not allowed, I would be interested to know the reason.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you're describing is generally permissible in the United States.\n\nThe photographer has copyright in the photograph itself, not in the items photographed. This means that they have copyright in the way that they composed the photograph \\-\\- what background they placed it against, lighting, camera placement, etc. \\-\\- but not in the ancient manuscript. \n\nIf you are strictly transcribing the text of the script, you're not infringing on anything that's copyrighted. If you make a sketch, there's more potential for infringement, but I suspect that you would not be working to faithfully copy the angles of the shadows as much as you would working to faithfully copy the image and condition of the artifact. \n\nEven if you were, calling that a copyright infringement would require that the image truly be copyrighted, and I'm not 100 percent convinced that they would be. Copyright is only available to *original* works of authorship, and that means that the author has to make some meaningful efforts to create something new out of the copyrighted elements discussed above.\n\nBut what has the photographer done in that picture of the Coronation Oath? It appears that they've photographed the book head\\-on, as it's displayed by the museum, with lighting as provided by the museum, in an effort to recreate the display one would see while visiting the museum. Is that really sufficiently \"original\" to merit copyright protection that could be invoked to prevent someone from drawing a duplicate? I doubt it.\n\nBut that picture of the Ge'ez book may be different. Someone appears to have grabbed the book, opened it up under weird lighting, kept their hands in the photograph, and otherwise actually composed a photograph that may not be particularly artistic, but is nonetheless difficult enough to duplicate that it can be considered original.\n\nSo let's be generous to the copyright trolls and assume that the sketch you're imagining is protected. Even then, that only raises the question of whether the copy is a fair use. You haven't said anything about how the hypothetical copier would be using these materials, but I have a hunch that the idea isn't to launch a multimillion dollar merchandising enterprise. If the idea is more academic or cultural, you'd have a better claim to fair use.

It contributes to 939\\.48(1m)(b), which modifies 939\\.48(1m)(ar), which expounds on (1\\).  \n\nTo paraphrase the law,  \n\n939\\.48 (self\\-defense)  \n\n1\\) A person may only use lethal force to defend themself or others from an immanent crime that would cause death or great bodily harm.  \n\n1ar) When defending your home or business, you may presume that someone breaking in poses the threat of death or great bodily harm.  \n\n1b) On second thought, you MAY NOT presume this under a couple of conditions:  \n\n1b1\\) You are actively engaged in criminal activity  \n\n1b2\\) You have reason to believe the person breaking in is a police officer, fire fighter, or paramedic engaged in their lawful duty.  \n\nIn legal terms, a presumption is something you shall / may act on before you have firm evidence to the contrary.  \nIf someone is breaking into your home, you do not have to identify them or see clear evidence of a threat (e.g., if it's too dark to see).  \n\nBUT if you can see someone clearly, and see a clear threat / clear lack of threat, you are no longer acting under presumption.  \n\nSo,  \n\nIf you are in bed, and someone breaks into your house, you may normally fire on them without clearly seeing a weapon.  \n\nBut if your spouse flips on the light and the intruder sees your gun and surrenders, you may no longer fire. You have firm evidence the intruder is not a threat.  \n\nIf you are hacking into the pentagon's computers late at night, and someone kicks in your door, you may **not** shoot at them, because you cannot presume threat. (It may be the FBI serving a no\\-knock warrant.)  \n\nBut if you flip on the the light and see someone in a ski mask threatening you with a crow bar, you may shoot him. You now have firm evidence of a threat to your life.  \n\nNone of this has any effect on the Kyle Rittenhouse case.\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nKyle was not defending his dwelling or business.  \n\nKyle's legal defense does not rest on a (claimed) presumption of threat, it rests on (claimed) evidence of threat.  \n\nLikewise, the accusations against Kyle don't claim that illegal possession of a firearm negates self\\-defense.  \n\nI don't know of any case law in Wisconsin involving self\\-defense while illegally carrying a gun, but there's nothing in the statute law that would bar self\\-defense in that situation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about self-defense laws in Wisconsin, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner who is illegally growing marijuana in their basement hears someone breaking into their house at night.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The homeowner's criminal activity (growing marijuana) does not completely negate their right to self-defense. The law doesn't universally bar self-defense for those engaged in criminal activity.\n\n2.

There are on the other hand other rights like those to information and right to privacy that are provided through civil law or administrative law or hounourable court's order. My question is why can't all rights directly come from the Constitution? As far as I knew constitutional law mainly deals with the functioning of states and governments so why encode certain rights directly into the Constitution while others as separate law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the right to privacy *derives* from the Constitution, as \"an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution\", see [Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd) vs Union of India](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/127517806/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=5acaba5e380f6eae795ea1b36840600880fc48d8-1608839571-0-AVbX96SupH8XC4my66wi255vodkdxh4r_hbLBTafUEU8kHGPTH7AEfeuhCsmmX-mB6Ab3mJtiwa7tnb4zETVg9vAMwMF8y92tDm2TrA0ybhmxi5MzN1mhTtsqkTz77ChScRLupmO9iCeCBlz7kycFgDUciu7NuTupsEqQmRPCI3GMWP7iNQ7bH8CtBdJbIW6tBhQTwFQqEUUeAJtVRDgWMmuPOYeIoAQkzIYTwdFnTxAWSg8GftF2ovctNdNg0-NJLWsIxAoHvBHZyZo1lK61Yffg-DszgN-wCQyNVdLzGvmBbAQYG-2bfbiAVTjEhy8Lqvw7XPc8VLjpccYbtaQ5wDPdf6AhEOr2kpzrZjT8P1MGl0rlu2Y0WuOjfvaIIyXWg). The issue here is that prior to this ruling, the right to privacy was only *implicit* in the Constitution, and it took a lawsuit and argumentation to extend the interpretation of the Constitution. The right to information is a [statutory right](https://rti.gov.in/rti-act.pdf). The rights created by this law are stated explicitly, so no lawsuit or interpretation is required (unless a court case is required to understand what a \"competent authority\" is, or whether the right includes more than the 4 enumerated sub\\-rights). That is, this statute specifically creates a right, which could not be inferred from the Constitution.\n\nThere are three ways to create a new right. One is to \"discover\" that it was implicit in existing law, as in the Aadhaar ruling. Another is to amend the Constitution and add something to Part III. Turn to the [Constitution itself](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/India_2015.pdf?lang=en), art 368, which describes amending the Constitution. The third way is to do this statutorily, as in the right to information. Acts of Parliament are \"easier\" than Constitutional amendments: an amendment requires a 2/3 quorum, and us subject to other specific restrictions, possibly requiring approval by a majority of states. Likewise the right to free, compulsory education is Art. 23a of the Constitution, but the details of implementation are a statutory creation, subject to judicial review unlike Constitutional amendments (hence [Pramati Education and Cultural Trust v. Union of India (2014\\)](https://clpr.org.in/litigation/pramati-educational-cultural-trust-ors-vs-union-of-india-ors/)).\n\nTheoretically, the Constitution could be amended to require that all rights must be encoded in the Constitution, which would make it more difficult to create new rights.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A civil rights activist in India is proposing a new fundamental right to be added to the Constitution. Which of the following approaches would likely be the most challenging and time-consuming to implement, while also providing the strongest legal protection for the new right?\n\nA) Drafting a detailed statute to be passed by Parliament, similar to the Right to Information Act\nB) Filing a lawsuit to argue that the new right is implicitly covered under existing constitutional provisions\nC) Proposing a constitutional amendment to add the new right explicitly to Part III of the Constitution\nD) Requesting the Supreme Court to issue an administrative order recognizing the new right\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided information about how rights are established in India. The correct answer, C, is the most challenging and time-consuming approach, but also provides the strongest protection:\n\n1. Constitutional amendments, as described in Article 368, require a 2/3 quorum in Parliament and may need approval from a majority of states. This makes it more difficult than passing a regular statute (option A) or pursuing other legal avenues.\n\n2. Amending the Constitution to add a right to Part III would make it an explicit fundamental right, providing stronger protection than a statutory right (A) or a right derived from judicial interpretation (B).\n\n3. Unlike statutory rights (A), constitutional amendments are not subject to judicial review, making them more robust.\n\n4. While option B (arguing for implicit coverage) has been successful for rights like privacy, it relies on judicial interpretation and may not provide as strong or clear protection as an explicit constitutional right.\n\n5. Option D (administrative order) would likely not have the same legal weight or permanence as a constitutional amendment.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the different mechanisms for establishing rights in India, their relative difficulty, and their legal implications, requiring integration of multiple concepts and critical thinking about the pros and cons of each approach."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55206/non-profit-granting-rights-of-use-of-software-to-for-profit", "docs_id": 55206, "title": "Non-profit granting rights of use of software to for-profit", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: we have two organizations \\- one for profit and one non\\-profit, that are related.

What is the most appropriate and legally compliant way for these organizations to structure their collaboration with respect to the use of discounted SaaS tools?\n\nA) EduAccess can sublicense its discounted SaaS tools to TechInnovate as compensation for office space and support\nB) TechInnovate should apply for its own non-profit status to access the same discounted rates\nC) EduAccess and TechInnovate should form a joint venture to share the discounted SaaS tools\nD) TechInnovate must obtain separate licenses for the SaaS tools directly from the providers\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the legal and contractual implications of the scenario. The correct answer is D because most SaaS providers, including Slack as mentioned in the documentation, typically have non-transferable and non-sublicensable terms in their agreements. The documentation explicitly states that Slack's terms of service grant a \"non-sublicensable, non-transferable\" license.

Under UK consumer law, consumers have a right to cancel a contract for services formed off-premises within 14 days and receive a full refund. The documentation states, \"... around 1 week and then around another week ...\" which might be within this 14-day window. If the cancellation was made within 14 days, the consumer would be entitled to a full refund regardless of the company's terms and conditions. If it was after 14 days, the company's claim might be enforceable. \n\nOption A is less relevant because consumer protection laws can override unfair contract terms, even if agreed to. Option C, while important for general contract law, is superseded by the statutory 14-day cooling-off period.

Even with new evidence, no court has the jurisdiction to question the validity of a law that has been through the Article 26 process.\n\nOption C is incorrect for the same reason as A. The Supreme Court, like any other court, is bound by Article 34.3.3 and cannot revisit the constitutionality of a law that it has already approved under Article 26.\n\nOption D is a tempting distractor because it tries to find a middle ground, but it's still incorrect. Article 34.3.3 doesn't allow for partial reviews or questioning of specific aspects of a law that has been through the Article 26 process.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the examinee to understand the finality of Article 26 decisions and their impact on future legal challenges, even in the face of new evidence. It also touches on the real-world implications of this constitutional provision for the Irish legal system and the balance of powers between the judiciary and the legislature."}, "65": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11891/foia-for-legal-fees", "docs_id": 11891, "title": "FOIA for legal fees?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to find out how much my school district is paying a private lawyer to work on a particular matter.

CVovert recordings by one of the parties in the conversation are not illegal in England, at least when it is between two private individuals. It is not in itself considered problematic to the evidence's admission.\n\nModern evidence rules (mostly from the *[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/contents)* for criminal cases) mean that confessions in particular may be subject to pre\\-trial proceedings (*voir dire*) to make sure that the confession can be considered reliable.

If C intimidated and/or pressured M during the call into confessing, is this covertly recorded call, in these circumstances, still admissible?\n\nMaybe, depending on the circumstances.

The judge will consider the whole circumstances to decide.\n\n> c. If C constantly reassures M that she won't go to the police if he freely discusses with her the events of the previous night, which leads to a confession of the rape, is this covertly recorded call, in these circumstances, still admissible?\n\nThese circumstances alone most likely won't affect the admissiblity. Public policy encourages the reporting of criminal activities and promising not to go to the police is not coercive or manipulative in such a way that a person will confess to a crime that they did not commit. It may be perceived as \"unfair\" by some between the two individuals, but it does not make a criminal trial unfair.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Understood. I'll create a challenging multiple-choice question based on the LawStackExchange documentation provided, targeting higher cognitive levels and incorporating real-world applications. Here's the question:\n\nQuestion: In a complex rape case in England and Wales, the victim (V) covertly records a phone conversation with the accused (A) the day after the alleged incident. During the call, A apologizes for \"non-consensual sex\" after V promises not to involve the police. V later reports the crime and provides the recording as evidence. Which of the following factors would most likely lead to the exclusion of this evidence in court?\n\nA) The recording was made without A's knowledge or consent\nB) V promised not to report the incident to the police during the call\nC) The confession was obtained through extreme emotional manipulation and threats\nD) The recording only captured A's apology without full context of the conversation\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of evidence admissibility in English criminal law, particularly regarding confessions. The correct answer is C because, under Section 76 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, a confession may be excluded if it was obtained through oppression or in circumstances likely to render it unreliable. Extreme emotional manipulation and threats could be considered a form of oppression or create circumstances that make the confession unreliable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because covert recordings by private individuals are generally not illegal in England and Wales and don't automatically render evidence inadmissible. \n\nOption B is incorrect because, while potentially seen as unfair, a promise not to report to the police doesn't typically make a criminal trial unfair or render a confession unreliable in legal terms.\n\nOption D is plausible but less likely to result in exclusion. While context is important, if the apology for \"non-consensual sex\" is clear, the lack of full context may not be sufficient grounds for exclusion.\n\nThis question tests the application of legal principles to a complex scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and critical thinking about factors that influence evidence admissibility in sensitive cases."}, "67": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58185/can-a-tenant-force-their-building-management-to-let-the-tenant-access-their-apar", "docs_id": 58185, "title": "Can a tenant force their building management to let the tenant access their apartment&#39;s electricity meter?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I rent an apartment in a building with several units.

It is recommended reading.\n\n**TL;DR**: The *controller* is the one who calls the shots (i.e. what personal data to process, what means to use to process it, the purpose of processing, and the legal basis for processing). This is usually the owner of information system. The *processor* is the the entity that actually do the processing.

This also means that the client is the *controller*.\n\nA \"privacy policy\"\\-type document is not sufficient to regulate the relationship between the *controller* and *processor*. \n\nHow to regulate this relationship is described in [GDPR Article 28 (3\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/). Its start out by saying:\n\n> Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject\\-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller.\n\nIt then goes on to describe what stipulations the contract must contain.\n\nThis contract is usually called a **DPA**. The initials may stand for \"Data Processing Agreement\" or \"Data Protection Addendum\".\n\nBasically, if you personal process data on behalf of clients, you *need* to have this place.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. As a website owner, the developer is a data controller for their own site and needs a privacy policy explaining what data is processed, why, and how.\n\n2. When processing data for clients, the developer acts as a data processor. This relationship is not adequately covered by a privacy policy alone.\n\n3.

While copyright exists automatically upon creation of a work in Canada, registration provides official proof of ownership as per the Copyright Act, \u00a753ff. \n\nOption A is incorrect because copyright registration is not required for selling or licensing internationally. Option B is misleading because copyright protection in other countries is generally governed by international treaties, not by Canadian registration. Option D is incorrect because the right to create derivative works is part of the copyright itself, not a result of registration.\n\nThe correct answer, C, accurately reflects the main benefit described in the documentation. In a potential infringement lawsuit, having a registered copyright simplifies the process of proving ownership. This is valuable because it reduces the burden on the copyright holder in legal proceedings, making it easier and potentially less costly to defend their rights.

The fundamental issue here is that the roommate (older brother) is attempting to evict the tenant, not the landlord.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, including Michigan, only the landlord or property owner has the legal authority to evict a tenant. A co-tenant, even if they're paying a larger share of the rent, cannot unilaterally evict another tenant. The roommate's attempt to evict the 19-year-old is therefore invalid on its face, regardless of the notice period or alleged lease violations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, even if failing to pay for the cats constitutes a lease violation, the roommate still lacks the authority to evict. Option C is incorrect because joining the military doesn't automatically terminate a lease agreement for co-tenants. \n\nThis question requires the test-taker to critically analyze the situation, understand the limits of tenant rights and responsibilities, and recognize that the fundamental issue lies in who has the authority to evict, rather than the specifics of the eviction notice itself.

And when they do, it's going to take a pretty drastic series of events to diminish the admissibility or weight of the evidence in court.\n\nTen years ago chain of custody was taken more seriously but after many recent court opinions about proportionality and cooperation, lawyers don't challenge chain of custody unless something glaring appears to be wrong.\n\nI could go on, but suffice it to say \\- I don't know of any case where chain of custody made a difference in civil litigation.\n\nBe aware that adding cloud storage adds a step to your processing and production workflow.

If the data is hosted in the cloud rather than your local server your attorneys will be waiting for you to get the data uploaded to the review platform. And then when the review is done the production might take longer because of the download. Obviously the production delay is not as severe as the upload for review. There are ways around this, like rolling the upload, but this takes more human hours because of the additional management required.\n\nI'll also add security as the reason to stay out of the cloud.

Dont these \"community standards\" violate freedom of speech? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's look at the Ur\\-example of a free\\-speech law, and the most wide\\-ranging, the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. It says (my emphasis):\n\n> **Congress** shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\nThis limitation applies only to the **government**. Indeed, it has been [argued](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2060713) that this limitation only applies to the legislative branch of government and not to the executive (except when exercising legislatively delegated power) or judicial branches. Certainly, the courts have held that it is within their power to issue \"gag\" restraining orders.\n\nNotwithstanding, it imposes no restrictions on how non\\-government actors can limit your free speech. The owner of a shopping centre can require you not to evangelise, the owner of a stadium can require you not to use offensive language and the owner of a social media platform can restrict your speech in any way they wish.\n\n**You have a right to talk \\- they have a right not to give you a platform.**", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A controversial political commentator's account is suspended from a major social media platform for violating \"community standards\" by questioning widely accepted scientific theories.

Which of the following best represents the legal perspective on this situation?\n\nA) The social media platform is violating the commentator's constitutional rights and must reinstate the account immediately.\nB) The government should intervene to ensure the platform allows all forms of political speech, regardless of content.\nC) The platform is within its rights as a private entity to set and enforce its own content policies.\nD) The commentator can sue the platform for discrimination based on political ideology.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the concept of free speech as it relates to private entities versus government regulation. The correct answer is C because, as explained in the documentation, the constitutional protection of free speech (using the U.S. First Amendment as an example) applies only to government actions, not to private entities. \n\nThe documentation clearly states: \"This limitation applies only to the government\" and \"it imposes no restrictions on how non-government actors can limit your speech.\" It further emphasizes that \"the owner of a social media platform can restrict your speech in any way they wish.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misapplies the concept of constitutional rights to a private entity. Option B is incorrect as it suggests inappropriate government intervention in a private platform's policies.

I did ref law.stackexchange but no on else posted anything.  \n\n2\\. The closest thing I found searching this site was a reference to the Joint Guidance on the Application of FERPA and HIPAA \\- which seems only to concern info collected by the school (not assignments) and who this can be disclosed to.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are certain privacy laws regarding what schools can reveal about students. To completely answer the question, we would have to know the state and school district involved, but we can get a pretty good estimate of the legal situation from applicable federal law, [34 CFR Part 99](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr99_main_02.tpl) (FERPA). That regulation addresses disclosure of student records, and they define \"record\" as \n\n> any information recorded in any way, including, but not limited to,\n>  handwriting, print, computer media, video or audio tape, film,\n>  microfilm, and microfiche\n\nwhich would include any written assignment (which is somehow written, and contains \"information\"). The regulations also refer to \"personally identifiable information\", which includes the student's name, which would normally be included on any assignment turned in, but could be removed if the teacher wants to in some way redistribute the essay.\n\nSubpart D addresses disclosing PID from a record, and generally consent is required (which could be from the parent, in the case of a minor), except as specified in [\u00a799\\.31](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=22e4dc673ac41bbc465f0af2269cac7e&mc=true&node=sp34.1.99.d&rgn=div6#se34.1.99_131). This would include for example those within the agency or institution who have been found to have an legitimate educational interest. This would include for example another teacher, the principle, the school psychiatrist (if there is one), but not the lunch lady or janitor. This would also include the psychiatrist who contracts with the school for consultation (but isn't an employee) as long as they are under the direct control of the school. It will also include disclosure to state and local educational authorities, under certain circumstances. (This is just a fragment of the conditions for non\\-consensual disclosure: the short version is, if the disclosure is to the school psychiatrist, it is allowed).\n\n\u00a799\\.36 then addresses \"health and safety emergencies\", which allows disclosure \"if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals\", where the agency \"may take into account the totality of the circumstances pertaining to a threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals\", and if it \"determines that there is an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals, it may disclose information from education records to any person whose knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals\".\n\nOne thing to note is that this regulation imposes restrictions on the school but not directly on the employee. The institution is expected to construct rules that implement the institutional requirements on their employees. If a disclosure is contrary to federal regulation, the penalty is visited by the government on the institution; the institution will then (hopefully) have established policies that employees will have to follow. Federal regulations do not anticipate that a teacher will make a *sua sponte* decision that a certain child may be a threat to public safety and therefore discloses a record. Instead, the teacher would probably make a disclosure within the organization, at which point the organization makes a decision whether the record needs to be turned over to the police, or someone else within the organization.\n\nAs for the specific case described, since the document presumably does not contain personally identifiable information, the disclosure restrictions do not apply. They do not apply to \"legitimate\" disclosure within the organization, and may not apply to certain kinds of disclosure outside the organization, but probably would prohibit disclosure to a neighbor who happens to be a child psychologist. The organization may well have promulgated rules that apply to employees which grossly misrepresent what the FERPA rules actually say (my employer did, \"out of an abundance of caution\"), so it is possible that the disclosure is contrary to FERPA\\-inspired local policy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: An instructor at a university receives a disturbing student assignment containing graphic violent content.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. FERPA allows disclosure within the educational institution to those with a legitimate educational interest, which would include a school-designated mental health professional.\n\n2. By withholding the student's identifying information, the instructor avoids disclosing personally identifiable information (PII), which is a key concern under FERPA.\n\n3. This approach allows for a professional assessment of the potential threat while maintaining student privacy to the extent possible.\n\n4. If the school's mental health professional determines there is an \"articulable and significant threat,\" FERPA's health and safety emergency exception could then be invoked for further action.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it involves immediate disclosure of PII to law enforcement without proper assessment, which could violate FERPA. Option B is problematic because consulting a personal acquaintance, even if they are a mental health professional, likely falls outside the scope of permitted disclosures under FERPA. Option D is overly cautious and ignores the potential safety concerns, as well as the provisions in FERPA that do allow for certain disclosures in the interest of safety.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from FERPA regulations, apply them to a realistic scenario, and consider the balance between student privacy and public safety concerns."}, "79": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45868/is-the-restriction-on-receiving-a-present-in-the-emoluments-clause-applicable", "docs_id": 45868, "title": "Is the restriction on receiving a &quot;present&quot; in the Emoluments Clause applicable?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The Emolument Clause:\n\n> No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\n\nThe part about receiving a title from a King, Prince... is clear enough; the question is about the receiving a \"present\".\n\nIs a \"present\" a \"*thing of value*\" not paid for at fair value?\n\nIs a thing of value a well defined legal concept when dealing with immaterial goods and ideas?\n\nWhat is fair value?

In the latter case, the question is whether he could receive the piece of paper \u2013 the conclusion was that he could receive it and then deposit it with the Dept. of State pending Congressional approval (actual citizenship was not conferred, only an honor was conferred, but also a piece of paper was given, which brought the matter within the scope of the Foreign Emoluments Clause.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. The honorary doctorate and robe would likely be considered \"presents\" under the historical interpretation of the Emoluments Clause, as they are tangible items being presented, regardless of their monetary value.\n\n2.

In some cases there is little description of the test beyond the dealer plugging the car into a computer, *doing something* and the computer generating a \"pass\" or \"fail\" response with no further explanation of what determines a pass or fail.\n\nAdditionally, some people report that their dealer required that the car's software be updated (for a fee) prior to performing said test.\n\nSo, is it legal for a warranty to hinge upon undisclosed criteria?

However, even if it was, it is possible that it would not meet the [federal minimum standards for warranties](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67241/what-are-the-legal-protections-to-buy-if-seller-refunds-instead-of-delivering-wh/67242#67242) as, per paragraph (d) a warranty has to provide for remedy without a charge. If there is absolutely no way for you to obtain the information to prove that a remedy is due \u2014 for e.g. no third party has legal or technical capacity to diagnose the vehicle \u2014 that is likely also a term to be found unconscionable and void, and may be found fraudulent, malicious and/or oppressive which may entitle one to collect punitive damages. (It is worth obtaining written confirmation of whether this decision is made in accord with their policies or on a line that they announce to be recorded)\n\n**Question 2:** Most likely same as Question 1\\.\n**Question 3:** Most likely same as Question 2\\.\n\nAccording to 15 U.S.C., subsection (a) of [Section 2302](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2302) entitled \"Full and conspicuous disclosure of terms and conditions; additional requirements for contents:\n\n> \"In order to improve the adequacy of information available to consumers, prevent deception, and improve competition in the marketing of consumer products, any warrantor warranting a consumer product to a consumer by means of a written warranty shall, to the extent required by rules of the Commission, fully and conspicuously disclose in simple and readily understood language the terms and conditions of such warranty.\n> \n> \n> (4\\) A statement of what the warrantor will do in the event of a defect, malfunction, or failure to conform with such written warranty\u2014at whose expense\u2014and for what period of time.\"\n> \n> \n> (5\\) A statement of what the consumer must do and expenses he must bear.\n> \n> \n> (6\\) Exceptions and exclusions from the terms of the warranty.\n> \n> \n> (7\\) The step\\-by\\-step procedure which the consumer should take in order to obtain performance of any obligation under the warranty, including the identification of any person or class of persons authorized to perform the obligations set forth in the warranty.\n> \n> \n> (12\\) The characteristics or properties of the products, or parts thereof, that are not covered by the warranty.\n> \n> \n> (13\\) The elements of the warranty in words or phrases which would not mislead a reasonable, average consumer as to the nature or scope of the warranty.\n\nIt may, in addition to any or all of the above, be a violation of paragraph (8\\), (9\\), (10\\) and/or (11\\) based on specific fact patterns.\n\n**To the 2nd point added:** If the manufacturer stated that the vehicle would run at least a certain number of miles on a full charge for a certain number of miles driven or number of years, and did not stipulate it otherwise, they would have to remedy this. It is highly likely that they tried to evade making such written statement (if not written, it's not a warranty under Magnuson\\-Moss). If they did, and they did not define the scope of what they would have to do in the case of a defect or malfunction, they would have to remedy it by repairs within a reasonable time; if they fail, they would have to refund or replace.\n\nThis does not mean that it is likely worth pursuing the matter in court other than maybe in small claims (See: [ohwilleke's reply to this question for a general explanation](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67241/what-are-the-legal-protections-to-buy-if-seller-refunds-instead-of-delivering-wh/67242#67242)). Moreover, most auto manufacturers put arbitration provisions in their sale contracts and/or their warranties and generally it may be required of one to opt out of it within 30 days of entering into the agreement. If that took place, first the dispute would likely need to be disputed through a qualified dispute resolution mechanism of the manufacturer, dealer, distributor and/or sellers choice depending on who gave the warranty.\n\nThe specific State's lemon laws may provide for civil penalties for willful violations which may or may not be a very high bar to meet depending on the State's case law, and which is more likely to make it worth for \"lemon\" lawyers to take the case, but generally they are not a great deal more like hyenas of this segment of the law.

Option D, limiting tests to authorized dealers, is a common practice that's generally permissible.\n\nHowever, requiring a paid software upgrade to perform a warranty-related test is likely illegal.

It effectively creates a paywall between the consumer and their ability to claim their warranty rights, which goes against the spirit and likely the letter of consumer protection laws.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts, application to a real-world scenario, and critical thinking about which practice is most likely to cross the line into illegality."}, "90": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/88559/is-there-a-hidden-meaning-in-this-eu-regulation", "docs_id": 88559, "title": "Is there a hidden meaning in this EU regulation?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In [Regulation (EU) No 540/2014](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02014R0540-20190527&from=EN) Annex VIII Section IV is stated, that:\n\n> \"Switch\n> \n> \n> Any mechanism to enable the driver to halt the operation of an AVAS (\u2018pause function\u2019) shall comply with the requirements of paragraph 6\\.2\\.6 of UNECE Regulation No 138, Supplement 1 to the original version of the Regulation, 01 series of amendments (OJ L 204, 5\\.8\\.2017, p.112\\).\"\n\nThe [UNECE Regulation No 138](https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2017/R138r1e.pdf) paragraph 6\\.2\\.6 \\-\n\n> \"Pause function\n> \n> \n> Any pause function as defined in paragraph 2\\.7\\. shall be prohibited\"\n\n2\\.7 says \\-\n\n> \"Pause function means a mechanism to enable the driver to halt the operation of an AVAS.\"\n\nWhat is purpose then to link to different document, instead of just saying in 540/2014, that Switch for AVAS is prohibited?\n\nThe [mentioned supplement 1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:42017X0071(01)&qid=1674633475502&from=EN) also says\n\n> \"Paragraph 6\\.2\\.6, amend to read:\n> \u20186\\.2\\.6\\.

In this case, if I decide to go and then they suddenly accelerate and crash into me (e.g., for insurance fraud), am I at fault for being in the way? Even if they shouldn't have accelerated into me, realistically speaking, in the absence of dashcams, is a traffic officer likely to believe my story that they \"let me go,\" versus the more common scenario of me going when it isn't safe? Of course this depends on the officer and situation, but the possibility of being \"framed\" bothers me.\n\nAccording to [Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/car-accidents-proving-fault-29604.html):\n\n> A car making a left turn is almost always liable for a collision with a car coming straight in the other direction.

You're liable.\n\nNow the situation may be more complicated if an oncoming vehicle appears to yield to you. You can choose to proceed or you can choose to wait. In your case you choose to proceed and if there is no incident, life goes on.\n\nBut you posed the hypothetical that the oncoming driver appears to yield but in fact doesn't or intentionally speeds up after you begin your turn and there is a collision.\n\nSo legally speaking the oncoming driver is at fault because intentionally causing an accident, nearly everywhere, is illegal. But how do YOU prove that happened. It's going to be your word against his unless there are bystanders who witnessed it. It's going to be an uphill battle to win in this case because it appears that you are at fault. Say you had a dashcam that shows the whole thing. Would that necessarily be convincing?

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. D1's position in the chronology allows them to potentially argue that both D2 and D3's actions were intervening acts that broke the chain of causation. This gives D1 two potential \"breaks\" in the chain to argue.\n\n2. D2, occurring later in the sequence, can only argue that D3's actions broke the chain of causation, as D2's own actions cannot be an intervening act for themselves.\n\n3. The question highlights the principle that causation flows forward in time. D1 can argue about subsequent events (D2 and D3), while D2 can only argue about events that followed their involvement (D3).\n\n4. The strength of these arguments depends on whether the subsequent actions were \"grossly negligent\" or \"inexcusably bad,\" as per the Australian court standards mentioned in the documentation.\n\n5. D1's argument about D3 breaking the chain would not be identical to D2's, contrary to option B, because D1 must also account for D2's actions in their overall defense strategy.\n\n6.

The correct answer, B, aligns with federal law 18 USC 926A, which allows interstate transportation of firearms if they are unloaded and secured properly. This method is both legal and efficient, avoiding unnecessary shipping or FFL transfer fees.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no requirement to ship the firearm or register it in Washington for personal use. Option C, while technically legal, is unnecessarily complex and costly. Option D is incorrect and potentially dangerous, as open carry laws vary by state and there's no requirement to register the firearm in Washington for personal use.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to integrate knowledge of federal firearm transportation laws, state-specific regulations, and practical considerations. It also addresses common misconceptions about firearm transfers and registration requirements, making it a challenging and thought-provoking question that goes beyond simple recall of facts."}, "97": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58052/can-cloud-services-providers-be-asked-to-turn-over-data-from-foreign-countries", "docs_id": 58052, "title": "Can cloud services providers be asked to turn over data from foreign countries?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can cloud providers be asked to provide data from other countries to the government/law enforcement for security purposes? Can Amazon be asked to provide data from non\\-US countries for any security reason, substantiated or not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking a business can be subpoenaed to provide any records, electronic or otherwise, by any court with jurisdiction over that business. Most subpoenas are issued in the context of pending lawsuits or criminal cases, some can be issues by certain regulatory or criminal law enforcement agencies.\n\nThere are defenses to a subpoena which can be asserted to quash the subpoena before the information is provided by the business. The main defense is that the information is privileged, for example, because it contains attorney\\-client confidences, or it is protected as a trade secret which could be disclosed to a competitor or lose its trade secret status if access to the information is not controlled.\n\nBut, generally speaking, ordinary business records of dealings that a company like Amazon has with its customers are not privileged or otherwise exempt from disclosure pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nAnother process which is available but less common when dealing with a third\\-party is a search warrant. In general, a business is not exempt from disclosing records pursuant to a criminal search warrant simply because the records involve non\\-U.S. persons.\n\nThere are also special procedures similar to, but not identical to, subpoenas under the Patriot Act such as \"national security letters\" that can be issued when national security is at issue. Unlike a typical subpoena, the process involved in a national security letter information request must generally be kept secret from the public and from the target of the investigation. National security information requests are overseen the the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) Court which is a non\\-adversarial court that operates much like a judge or magistrate to whom a criminal search warrant application is made, except that attorneys that practice before it must have security clearances and its proceedings operate with a much higher level of secrecy. National security inquiries are still subject to legal limitations which the FISA court evaluates, although the FISA court has a reputation for being something of a rubber stamp (there is debate over whether this reputation is well earned).\n\nThere is a detailed body of law describing what justifications are necessary for various types of record requests and what exceptions to the duty to disclose exist, but without more specifics in the question, an answer in this forum is not a place for a comprehensive treatise reviewing all of them which could fill several law review articles.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A multinational tech company, CloudTech, is served with a subpoena from a U.S. court requesting data on users from various countries, including non-U.S. citizens.

Which of the following strategies would be most appropriate and legally sound?\n\nA) Refuse to provide any data, citing international privacy laws and potential loss of trade secrets\nB) Comply only with requests for U.S. citizen data, arguing lack of jurisdiction over foreign user data\nC) Provide all requested data immediately to avoid potential legal consequences\nD) Review the subpoena, prepare to comply, but consider filing a motion to quash for specific privileged information\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"Generally speaking a business can be subpoenaed to provide any records, electronic or otherwise, by any court with jurisdiction over that business.\" This means CloudTech can't simply refuse all requests (eliminating option A).\n\n2. The jurisdiction is based on the company, not the citizenship of the users. The documentation doesn't indicate that non-U.S. user data is exempt, stating \"In general, a business is not exempt from disclosing records pursuant to a criminal search warrant simply because the records involve non-U.S. persons.\" This eliminates option B.\n\n3. Immediately providing all data (option C) is not appropriate because there are potential defenses and exemptions to consider.\n\n4. Option D is the most appropriate because:\n   - It acknowledges the general obligation to comply with a subpoena.\n   - It allows for a review of the subpoena, which is crucial to understand its scope and legality.\n   - It considers the possibility of filing a motion to quash for specific information, which aligns with the documentation's statement: \"There are defenses to a subpoena which can be asserted to quash the subpoena before the information is provided by the business.\"\n   - It specifically mentions privileged information, which the documentation highlights as a main defense: \"The main defense is that the information is privileged, for example, because it contains attorney-client confidences, or it is protected as a trade secret.\"\n\nThis approach balances legal compliance with protecting the company's and users' rights, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and application of critical thinking to a complex scenario."}, "98": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25011/why-did-jim-garrison-investigate-the-kennedy-assassination", "docs_id": 25011, "title": "Why did Jim Garrison investigate the Kennedy assassination?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Mr Garrison was the district attorney (DA) for the state of New Orleans and the assassination of President Kennedy happened in Dallas, Texas.\n\nWhy would a New Orleans DA be interested in this?

If that were true, then the conspirators who did those things would have been guilty of criminal conspiracy under Louisiana law, and the New Orleans District Attorney would be able to prosecute that crime.\n\nThe result of the investigation was an indictment and trial of Clay Shaw (he was acquitted). You can read Garrison's opening statement at <http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/russ/testimony/garrisono.htm>, which includes the detailed charges and some arguments by the defense over jurisdictional issues.

Which of the following best describes the legal basis and limitations of this investigation?\n\nA) The DA can fully investigate and prosecute all aspects of the crime, regardless of where the main event occurred, as long as some planning happened in their jurisdiction.\n\nB) The DA has no authority to investigate any part of the crime since the main event occurred outside their state, and they must defer entirely to State B's authorities.\n\nC) The DA can investigate and potentially prosecute conspiracy charges related to actions that occurred within their jurisdiction, but not the main crime itself.\n\nD) The DA can only assist State B's investigation in an advisory capacity, with no power to bring charges or conduct independent inquiries.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of jurisdictional limits and the nature of conspiracy charges in complex, multi-state criminal cases. The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the legal principle illustrated in the Garrison case.\n\nAs explained in the documentation, a district attorney can investigate and potentially prosecute criminal activities that occurred within their jurisdiction, even if they are related to a larger crime that happened elsewhere. In this case, the DA could investigate and bring charges for conspiracy based on meetings or other overt acts that allegedly took place in their state. However, they would not have jurisdiction over the main crime itself if it occurred in another state.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the DA's authority, suggesting they could prosecute all aspects of the crime, which is not true for events outside their jurisdiction.\n\nOption B is too restrictive, as it incorrectly states the DA has no authority to investigate any part of the crime. This ignores the possibility of prosecuting conspiracy charges for actions within their jurisdiction.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it understates the DA's authority. The DA is not limited to an advisory role and can conduct independent investigations and bring charges for crimes within their jurisdiction.\n\nThis question requires analysis of jurisdictional issues in complex criminal cases, integration of legal concepts, and application to a real-world scenario, thus meeting the criteria for a high-quality, challenging question."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7583/can-the-cashier-be-held-liable-for-credit-card-fraud-if-procedure-isnt-followed", "docs_id": 7583, "title": "Can the cashier be held liable for credit card fraud if procedure isn&#39;t followed?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Since the liability shift back in October, retailers are now liable for credit card fraud that occurs through them. This is to encourage them to move to the more secure chip and pin POS systems, but many retailers have not made said switch and instead have adopted more rigorous verification methodologies for the old system.\n\nOne such system I have seen requires the cashier to check the ID of the customer and match it with the card, as well as match the last four digits of the card with the last for digits that were read by the card reader.

The employer can sue the employee for breach of contract and win (see [Lister v Romford Ice Cold Storage](http://www.safetyphoto.co.uk/subsite/case%20i%20j%20k%20l/lister_v_romford_ice__cold_storage.htm)), however, such suits are rarely brought and even more rarely successful.\n\nThis is partly because of the bad publicity such cases generate but mostly because many jurisdictions have introduced laws to stop them like the NSW [Employee's Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ela1991217/).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A large retail chain has implemented new fraud prevention measures for credit card transactions, including ID checks and card number verification.

Which of the following scenarios is most likely to occur based on legal precedents and common practices?\n\nA) The company successfully sues the cashier for the full amount of the fraudulent transaction.\nB) The company is held fully liable, with no recourse against the employee.\nC) The cashier is held personally liable by the credit card company for the fraudulent charge.\nD) The company faces liability but is barred from taking action against the employee due to labor laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While in theory, the company could attempt to transfer liability to the employee for not following procedures, the documentation suggests that this is unlikely to occur in practice. The answer explains that employers are generally vicariously liable for employee actions during the course of employment. Although employers can technically sue employees for breach of contract, such suits are rarely brought and even more rarely successful. This is due to potential negative publicity and legal protections for employees in many jurisdictions, such as the NSW Employee's Liability Act mentioned. The question requires analysis of the legal concepts presented, integration of multiple ideas (vicarious liability, employee protections, practical considerations), and application to a real-world scenario. The distractors represent plausible misconceptions about employer-employee liability in such situations."}}
