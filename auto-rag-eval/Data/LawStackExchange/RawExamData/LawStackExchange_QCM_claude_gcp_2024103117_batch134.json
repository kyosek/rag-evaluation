Still, on paper are any laws being violated by twitter?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Federal laws prohibit false, deceptive, unfair etc. advertising, and there simply exists no federal law prohibiting advertising marijuana. Because of the First Amendment, there is no law prohibiting the advocacy of an illegal act. Because of the Commerce Clause, Congress could pass laws restricting commercial speech, as long as it passes strict scrutiny, see [Central Hudson Gas \\& Electric v Public Service Commission of New York](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/447/557/). However, \"For commercial speech to come within the First Amendment, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading\". So Congress *could* pass a federal advertising ban. A state where marijuana is illegal can do likewise, but as you noted Twitter does not cross that line. [Washington allows](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=314-55-155) marijuana sales and advertising, however \"A cannabis licensee may not engage in advertising or marketing that specifically targets persons residing out of the state of Washington\" (not even Oregon where the herb is also legal). Still, the state attempted to limit advertising which resulted in [Plausible Products, LLC d/b/a Hashtag Cannabis v Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board](https://www.gleamlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FINALORDER.pdf). The ruling observes that\n\n> The State argues that, \u201c\\[f]or purposes of the first Central Hudson\n> test, marijuana activity cannot be considered to be \u2018lawful activity\u201d\n> where its use, possession, manufacture, and distribution remains\n> illegal under federal criminal law.\u201d\n\n\u00a72(B) analyses this rationale, quoting from New England\nAccessories Trade Ass\u2019n v. City of Nashua, 679 F.2d 1, where the New England\nAccessories court also considers that\n\u201cIf New York, or some\nother state, decided to legalize the sale and use of marijuana, New Hampshire would have\ngreater difficulty . . . prohibiting an advertisement suggesting that the Big Apple was the\nplace to get high on marijuana.\u201d The Plausible Products court then concluded\n\n> It follows that, where one state could not avoid Central Hudson\n> scrutiny for banning advertisement of Washington recreational\n> marijuana, neither can the State here avoid Central Hudson scrutiny on\n> the basis that recreational marijuana is still illegal under federal\n> law\n\nThere are other relevant tests applicable to restrictions on commercial speech \u2013  \n\nis the government's interest substantial, does the regulation directly advance that interest, and is it narrowly tailored. Presumably, the state interest would be in preventing underage consumption (accepted by the court). Another possible interest, rejected by the court, was \"not tipping off the feds\", with reference to the \"federal government\u2019s expectation of a strong and effective marijuana regulatory system\". But as the court noted, the Cole Memorandum was rescinded, and states cannot rely on it, thus the \"asserted interest in avoiding federal\nintervention is too elusive to amount to a substantial interest under Central Hudson\".\n\nThe Twitter restrictions on cannabis ads are very similar to the Washington state regulations on such advertising.

In MCAC, the plaintiff was a private party who claimed MCAC's refusal to carry their program violated their First Amendment rights. In holding that MCAC was not a state actor, the Court didn't hold that MCAC had total unfettered discretion to kick anyone it wants off of its channels. What it held was that *the First Amendment* doesn't restrict MCAC.\n\nIn Turner II, the FCC was not claiming that the First Amendment required Turner to carry anything.

Therefore, it concludes, a woman has no rights that can outweigh the state's interest in protecting the potential life she is carrying.\n\n*Dobbs* also recognizes \\-\\- but does not take a position on \\-\\- the argument that a fetus is actually a person itself. If a legislature were to adopt that position, and the courts were to accept it, we would find ourselves in a position where whatever rights a woman has to self\\-determination and bodily integrity would have to be balanced against the fetus's rights to self\\-determination and bodily integrity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the legal principles discussed in the Roe v.

These are implied rights at best.\n\nB is incorrect because the Dobbs decision actually moves away from the privacy-based reasoning of Roe v.

Is there a legal standard of what constitutes a \"child\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [canada](/questions/tagged/canada \"show questions tagged 'canada'\")\n\nThe term \"child\" is expressly defined for various offences. For example, for [s. 172](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-172-20190919.html):\n\n> child means a person who is or appears to be under the age of eighteen years.\n\nThe offence of \"[child pornography](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-163.1.html)\" is expressly defined to relate to \"a person who is or is depicted as being under the age of eighteen years.\"\n\nThe offence of \"[child luring](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-172.1-20150717.html#wb-cont)\" has several variants, for luring those who are or who the accused believes to be under the age of 18, 16, or 14\\. They are all called \"child luring.\"\n\nOther sections criminalize conduct in relation to a child without defining the term. See e.g. [s. 243](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-243.html):\n\n> Every person who in any manner disposes of the dead body of a child, with intent to conceal the fact that its mother has been delivered of it, whether the child died before, during or after birth, is guilty...\n\nFor s. 243, courts had to conduct statutory interpretation in order to determine the meaning of the word \"child.\" The Supreme Court of Canada held that \"child\" in this offence includes children born alive and fetuses that were likely to have been born alive. See *R. v. Levkovic*, [2013 SCC 25](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13031/index.do).\n\nI know this is Canadian law, rather than Massachusetts law, but one thing you can take away from this is that terms can take on distinct legal meanings from one provision to another.

These meanings need not line up with the definitions you find in a dictionary.\n\nBut, for a general description from a specialized dictionary, see *Black's Law Dictionary*, 10th ed.

The deceased might have downloaded a form from the Internet, filled it in as best they could, then stuffed it in a drawer. Many people also do not have a will at all.\n\nIf there is a will, then it ought to name an \"executor\" (someone who can take charge of the deceased's affairs according to their wishes), who ideally would be someone who is still alive and willing to do it. If those conditions fail then an estate administrator can be appointed, and if there's no will then the administrator must follow the default rules for \"intestacy\". Often, the executor is someone within the circle of the deceased's family and friends who would find out about the death fairly quickly, and is already armed with some knowledge about where to find the will itself. People may also choose their bank (who would also soon be in the loop in the event of death) or their solicitor, either of whom might be looking after the original will.\n\nIf the will and executor do not emerge organically as news spreads, then someone will have to take responsibility for finding the deceased's will, or confirming that they don't have one. Helpful hints will include \\-\n\n* remembering things the deceased said during their lifetime, such as \"my will is in the shoebox in the spare room wardrobe\" or \"I've named cousin Alfred as my executor\" or \"Flybynight LLP was really helpful\"\n* going through their papers to find a will, a solicitor's invoice, or anything like that\n* calling around local legal firms to see if any of them have acted for the deceased\n* searching the \"[National Will Register](https://www.nationalwillregister.co.uk/)\" in case the will happens to be there (despite what the name might suggest, registration there is entirely optional).\n\nIt often happens that firms close down, change names, are bought by others, etc., and so the relevant solicitors may be completely different from the ones who were involved in originally writing the will. Practice rules mean that the documents still ought to be retained, but many things can happen over a long period of time.\n\nThere is no automatic system for notifying others in the event of a death. The government in Great Britain operates a scheme called \"Tell Us Once\" for updating all government departments, but the private sector does not hook in to this. Sometimes, people place notices in the [Gazette](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/): see the category \"missing wills\", as well as \"next of kin\" for finding relatives of the deceased. (The reason for this is that notices of probate are also placed in the Gazette, to identify creditors of the deceased who might have a claim on the estate, and so relevant parties nationwide could have their eyes on the Gazette already.)\n\nSomething else to note is that when following the practices above, there may be several wills found, as well as \"codicils\" (which are amendments to wills), and any documents found might not actually be valid.

If it is unlawful, is the offending (discriminatory) license clause invalidated (i.e. it is not part of the license), or does the clause remain valid but subject the licensor to liability for a discrimination lawsuit?\n\nFor example, any of the following hypothetical license clauses could be considered discriminatory under my definition above:\n\n* Persons with epilepsy must purchase an additional $50 Epilepsy License Rider in order to use this software. Purchasing this rider does not grant you access to epilepsy\\-related services, but only allows you to use this software despite having a medical diagnosis that would otherwise disqualify you from holding a license. If you hold a valid license to use this software and receive a new diagnosis of epilepsy, you shall have 30 days to purchase a Rider before your license to use the software terminates as a result of your disability. (disability discrimination)\n* Notwithstanding any other part of this license or any other correspondence or arrangement with Licensor, members of the Church of Scientology are forbidden from using this software.

Similarly, why someone would want to use software whose owner wants to forbid them from using it for discriminatory reasons is also out of scope.\n\nI am aware that some software might represent niche areas of interest that would appeal primarily to members of certain protected groups. For example, an app for Talmud study would probably appeal primarily to Jewish users and not, for example, to Muslims, Buddhists, or Scientologists. My question could be whether I could lawfully publish a Talmud study app that only Jews are licensed to use or whether doing this would either invalidate the restrictive license clause (allowing non\\-Jewish people to license the app for the same price or under the same conditions as anyone else) or subject me to liability for discrimination.\n\nIn response to Neil Meyer, I am not asking whether there is a distinction in law between lawful discrimination like choosing who to date or whose products to buy for personal use and unlawful discrimination like deciding not to hire people from a certain racial group for my business. I know that such a distinction is made and that it is not illegal for me to refuse a date on racial grounds or decide to quit my job because I discovered that the company was affiliated with a religion I disapprove of. I am not asking about what discrimination means, I am asking if what is commonly considered unlawful discrimination in public accommodation, employment, etc. is legal *if it relates only to software licenses*. For example, if I publish a \"Standard Edition\" of my software for $50 and then a \"Special Low\\-Cost Edition for White People Only\" at $20 with an EULA that specifies that the license is void if purchased by a non\\-white person, is that legal as long as I disclose what I am doing (e.g. on the box or on my website)?\n\nIn response to a comment by gnasher729, this question has nothing to do with Scientology per se.

This is legally required almost everywhere (both in the USA, where this depends on the state, and elsewhere). Rules vary on the required minimum amount, and the exact coverage (e.g. whether lost wages are covered in case of injury).\n* **uninsured motorist coverage** \\- pays damages you or others suffered, which are the responsibility of another driver who is not insured. This is mandatory in some states of the USA. In some other countries, these damages are covered by a public insurance or trust (such as the [Verkehrsopferhilfe](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkehrsopferhilfe) in Germany).\n* **personal injury protection** \\- pays your own medical costs, no matter who is at fault. Required in some states of the USA.\n\n> Is the lender's insurance supposed to cover it?\n\nThis depends on the insurance policy, but in almost all cases **the policy is for the vehicle** (and often has to be, under the laws requiring insurance). So if yes, if you lend your car to someone else, your insurance will cover them. Note, however, that some insurance policies restrict your right to lend your car \\- read the fine print!\n\nThere is one situation where your own policy may be relevant:\nIf the damages exceed the limit of the vehicle's insurance policy, your own policy *may* pay the rest \\- again, this will depend on the policy.\n\n> If so, wouldn't this not make sense? Insurance companies look at your \n>  driving history (\\& risk) when they offer you a plan, and if the borrower\n>  has a poor history, you've increased the company's risk without their\n>  knowledge, right? It would seem to open insurance rates to abuse.\n\nYes, exactly. That is why many (if not most) insurance policies place limits on lending your car. You may only be allowed to lend it to people over 21 years of age, or only to people who you have registered as car users with the insurance company.\n\n> Is the borrower's insurance supposed to cover it?\n>  If so, wouldn't this not make sense?\n>  Insurance companies charge you differently based on what and how many\n>  vehicles you want covered, so wouldn't borrowing someone's Lamborghini \n>  suddenly open your insurance company to a massive risk without their \n>  knowledge again?\n\nNo, the borrower's insurance does not usually apply.\n\nMaking the borrower's insurance apply would be problematic because the risk is based on the vehicle (type), too.\n\nAlso, the borrower may not have insurance (e.g. may not own a car). In particular, enforcing the mandatory liability insurance is easier in practice if it is per vehicle, because you can check the insurance at vehicle registration (which practically all countries already require). If the liability insurance were per driver, it would be difficult to prevent a person w/o insurance to borrow a car (as in your example).\n\nFinally, sometimes after an accident there is a dispute about who was driving the car (especially with hit\\-and\\-run accidents), but there is usually clear evidence (collision damage) what vehicle was involved.

In such cases, courts typically look beyond the literal wording to the mutually understood agreement. The most likely outcome is that the court would enforce the rent amount that was verbally agreed upon or evidenced by initial payments, rather than the erroneous $0 figure.

To the prosecution who is dying to prove an innocent man guilty? Or to the defendant who is dying to prove himself not guilty?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Legal Answer:\n=================\n\nAn officer's job is to turn over all evidence to the State's attorney and testify at trial truthfully. It is the State's attorney's job to turn over all evidence in discovery to the defense; to only prosecute people they believe are guilty or likely guilty; and to remedy clear and convincing false prosecutions as outlined in [ABA rule 3\\.8](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_3_8_special_responsibilities_of_a_prosecutor.html) which is echoed in many state laws.\n\n> Rule 3\\.8: The prosecutor in a criminal case shall:  \n> \n>  (a) refrain from prosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probable cause;...\n> \n> \n> ...(d) make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and to the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal;...\n> \n> \n> ..(h) When a prosecutor knows of clear and convincing evidence establishing that a defendant in the prosecutor\u2019s jurisdiction was convicted of an offense that the defendant did not commit, the prosecutor shall seek to remedy the conviction.\n\nIf this new exonerating evidence is turned over to the prosecutor they would be required to submit it to the defense and the trial would likely be postponed for both sides to evaluate the new evidence. If they suppress the evidence it would be grounds for appeal and disbarment of the prosecuting attorney. \n\nIt is not the officer's job to direct the trial, just supply evidence that supports the truth. But it also wouldn't help if the State's own witness suddenly started offering testimony contrary to supporting guilt and in light of new evidence the prosecution may reevaluate to not have this happen.\n\nThe Ethical Answer:\n===================\n\nKind of sticky going into ethics and the exact right response to this situation, but it sounds like the answer you want.\n\nAssuming an ethical prosecutor the this would be the same as the legal answer.

While the employment agreement specifies California law governs disputes (which would typically mean Section 2870 applies), the fact that John lives and works in Texas complicates matters. The correct answer is C because the applicability of Section 2870 ultimately depends on Texas law. If Texas has statutes similar to California's Section 925 that allow employees to void governing-law clauses that deprive them of their local law's protections, then John might be able to argue that Texas law should apply instead of California law.

In the absence of an express direction, the distribution must be made within a \"reasonable time\". If it is not, the shareholder could sue to corporation to compel it to make the dividend declared and could also be awarded interest at a statutory rate or a rate set forth in the governing documents of the corporation from the effective date of the dividend, and court costs (but in all likelihood not attorney fees).\n\nIn practice, the mechanics is distributing dividends from publicly held companies is a bit more involved than this simple scenario, however. Ownership of the vast majority of publicly held stock is not held in the name of the true owner in the books and records of the corporation.\n\nInstead, most shares are held by an intermediary institution in the institution's name called a \"street name\" and then the intermediary institution handles ownership registration of the shares either to the true owners, or to brokerage firms or mutual funds, which in turn hold the shares for the benefit of their customers.\n\nTypically, the publicly held corporation will wire transfer the total amount of the dividend payable to the 90%\\-99% of the corporation held in a street name to the street name intermediary firm on the effective date of the dividend. Then, the task of breaking up that sum of money to particular registered owners of the shares as of the effective date of the dividend, and of issuing 1099s to the recipients of the dividends, is handled by the intermediary firm.\n\nIn a worst case scenario, like a power grid failure affecting the relevant banks, or a natural disaster, or \"bank holiday\", the dividend is wired to the intermediary and a handful of direct owners of the shares in the company listed on the books and records of the company, typically within a few business days and as soon as is reasonably practicable. There is almost never a hitch in the distribution timing at this level in a publicly held corporation.\n\nThe intermediary firm's duties to distribute the dividends received from the corporation itself to the registered owners (some of whom may be brokerage firms holding shares for their customers) is governed by a contract of adhesion entered into between the corporation that hires the intermediary firm to handle this for it on an outsourced basis, and the intermediary firm, which binds the shareholders of the corporation.\n\nIn cases where the street name intermediary lists the owner of the shares as a brokerage account or mutual fund, the obligations of the brokerage account or mutual fund once the dividend of shares or money is received by it from the intermediary is governed by a contract of adhesion between the brokerage company and the customer in the case of shares held in a brokerage account, and between the fund and the members of the fund in a mutual fund.\n\nIn these cases, dividends are credited to the beneficial owner's account *nunc pro tunc* the date that the stock is received by the brokerage company or fund (or even to the effective date of the dividend in some cases), and the transfer from a brokerage account or fund to the actual customer, for example, in a check or wire transfer of a cash dividend, is sometimes only actually executed upon the request of the customer and is otherwise held in a money market account created for the customer until that transfer is effected in accordance with the contract between the customer and the brokerage or fund.\n\nThe default in all of these cases (distributions from intermediaries, from brokerages, and from funds) is \"reasonable time\", but the contracts with the customers are generally much more specific.\n\nAlso, while, in theory, this issue can be litigated in court, in practices, all \"back office\" functions involved in administering securities of publicly held companies are subject to securities industry arbitration agreements and so the disputes are actually handled in a specialized securities industry arbitration forum that is for all practical purposes, impossible to appeal and based upon an arbitrator's analysis that is not necessarily publicly disclosed to anyone but the parties to the dispute.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A publicly traded company declares a dividend with an effective date of March 1st.

In this scenario, the public company has transferred the dividend to the intermediary firm, which then distributes to brokerages. The shareholder's relationship with their brokerage is governed by a contract of adhesion. If there's a delay, the shareholder should first contact their brokerage. Disputes in these matters are typically subject to securities industry arbitration agreements, not court litigation. While the shareholder is entitled to the dividend within a \"reasonable time,\" the specific timing and process for requesting payment may be outlined in their agreement with the brokerage. Option A is incorrect because the shareholder does have recourse, albeit not directly against the public company at this stage. Option B is incorrect because court litigation is generally not the first or appropriate step in this situation. Option D is partially correct about entitlement to the dividend, but overstates the interest claim and ignores the proper channels for resolving the issue."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55483/can-law-enforcement-officer-solicit-complaints-can-you-cite-case-code", "docs_id": 55483, "title": "Can law enforcement officer solicit complaints?

They do not involve forming or joining a union. Under [29 USC 157](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/157) all employees have the right to form or join any union at any time. No election is needed. 29 USC 159 provides that:\n\n> Employees shall have the right to self\\-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities\n\nThe above section is part of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, as amended and updated. It is found in \\[Chapter 7 of 29 USC] ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter\\-7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-7))\n\nA union is formed as the voluntary act of its members. A union generally has a constitution that controls its operations. This will specify under what conditions the union will be dissolved. An individual may leave a union at any time.\n\nElections, such as those mentioned in the question, are held by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) when employees desire that a union become the designated collective bargaining representative for a bargaining unit (which is a group of employees deemed to have a \"community of interest\"). There is considerable flexibility in just which employees shall be designated as a bargaining unit. In the event of a dispute, this is resolved by the NLRB. (see 29 USC 159(b)). Elections may also be held when there is a desire by some workers to change representatives.\n\nA petition requesting a representation election can be filed by a union, a worker, or an employer.\n\nUnder [29 USC 159](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/159)(a) the representatives for a bargaining unit: \"shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment\". That is what representation elections are about.\n\nA union, or other organization, is supposed to be recognized or designated as the bargaining representative for a bargaining unit (BU) only if a majority of the workers in that BU who make a choice want that representative.\n\nIn addition to being certified by the NLRB after winning an election, a union can be recognized as the representative voluntarily by the employer on the request of a majority of the employees. Or such a request can trigger a secret ballot election.\n\n> My question is, how often can unionization votes be held?\n\nRepresentation elections are normally held no more often than once a year in any BU. Specifically, 29 USC 159(c)(3\\) provides that:\n\n> No election shall be directed in any bargaining unit or any subdivision within which in the preceding twelve\\-month period, a valid election shall have been held.\n\nCases recently in the news where a second election has been ordered or proposed in a shorter period of time involve cases where it has been held, or alleged, that the previous election was **not valid** because of unfair labor practices.\n\nAn election can also be held to decertify the bargaining representative, or to substitute a new representative. In all these cases a majority of the workers voting must agree for any change to be made. The \"no more than once per year\" rule applies to all these elections.\n\nIf there are more than two choices on the ballot (for example, if several different unions are proposed, perhaps along with \"no union\") and no one choice gets a majority, a runoff is held between the two choices with the largest number of votes. This is specified in 29 USC 159(c)(3\\)\n\nAll representation elections are held under the authority of, and are regulated by, the NLRB.\n\n> So when a union is formed, a company is no longer allowed to hire any worker outside of the union?\n\nThis is not correct. That is what is known as the \"closed shop\", and it is illegal under the NLRA. Arrangements that **are** legal (when they are part of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA)) under the NLRA are:\n\n* The \"union shop\". On being hired, an employee must join the union within a specified time (which must be at least 30 days, but may be longer). This is specifically permitted by [29 USC 158](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/158)(a)(3\\). However, many states have by state law prohibited union shop agreements.\n* An \"agency shop\". No employee need join any union, but any employee must pay the designated bargaining representative a fee (normally less than the union membership dues) for its efforts in representing the workers of that BU, and that worker specifically. Some states have by state law prohibited or limited agency shop agreements.\n* An \"open shop\". No worker need pay any dues or fee to any union or other representative., But if the representative is a union, its policies are set by the union members, and to become and remain a union member, a worker must pay union dues.\n\nAside from any shop agreement included in a CBA, 29 USC 158(a)(3\\) provides that it is an unfair labor practice (ULP) for an employer:\n\n> by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization ...\n\nIt is also a ULP (under 29 USC 158(a)(2\\)) for an employer to:\n\n> dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it ...\n\nThe provisions of the NLRA and some proposals that have been made to change it are summarized and explained in [\"The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA): Union Representation Procedures and Dispute Resolution\"](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL32930.html#fn54) from the Congressional Research Service (CRS).

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the unionization process and its implications?\n\nA) If a unionization vote fails, another vote can be held immediately the next day, as there are no restrictions on the frequency of such votes.\n\nB) Once a union is formed, the company can only hire workers who are already members of that union, known as a \"closed shop\" arrangement.\n\nC) Employees have the right to form or join a union at any time without needing an election, but an NLRB election is required for a union to become the exclusive bargaining representative for a unit.\n\nD) If a union is certified as the bargaining representative, it remains in that position indefinitely and cannot be decertified through any subsequent vote.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately reflects two key aspects of unionization under U.S. labor law. First, employees have the right to form or join unions at any time without requiring an election, as protected by the National Labor Relations Act. Second, while forming a union doesn't require an election, an NLRB-supervised election is necessary for a union to be certified as the exclusive bargaining representative for a specific bargaining unit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there are restrictions on the frequency of representation elections. Typically, elections cannot be held more than once per year in a bargaining unit.\n\nOption B is incorrect because \"closed shop\" arrangements, where a company can only hire union members, are illegal under the NLRA.\n\nOption D is incorrect because unions can be decertified through subsequent votes, typically not more often than once a year, if employees wish to remove or change their bargaining representative."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26656/can-victims-respond-to-victim-blaming-in-court", "docs_id": 26656, "title": "Can victims respond to victim-blaming in court?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From [this article about a rape case](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/nyregion/yale-student-not-guilty-saifullah-khan.html)\n\n> Mr. Khan\u2019s lawyers worked relentlessly to discredit the account of the\n>  woman, who was not identified by name in the arrest warrant\n>  application.

(4\\) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution\\[.]\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f922(g) is the law on possession:\n\n> It shall be unlawful for any person ... (4\\) who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n\nThe wording of the laws is past tense\u2014any person who \"has been\" committed\u2014meaning that there's a strong textual case for a lifetime ban. While not binding, the Supreme Court seems to agree:\n\n> A person adjudicated as a mental defective may later be adjudged competent, and a person committed to a mental institution later may be deemed cured and released. Yet Congress made no exception for subsequent curative events. The past adjudication or commitment disqualifies. Congress obviously felt that such a person, though unfortunate, was too much of a risk to be allowed firearms privileges.\n\n[*Dickerson v. New Banner Inst.*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/460/103.html), 460 U.S. 103, 116 (1983\\) (not binding because the case dealt only with persons who had served lengthy prison terms rather than those who had been involuntarily committed).\n\nMore importantly, Congress seems to agree. It allows states to receive certain federal grants only if they establish programs that provide an avenue for \"relief\" from the lifetime ban of \u00a7\u00a7\u202f922(d)(4\\), 922(g)(4\\). For example, \u00a7\u202f105 of the [NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007](https://www.congress.gov/110/plaws/publ180/PLAW-110publ180.pdf), 121 Stat. 2559, describes a state's program as qualifying in the following way: \n\n> (a) Program Described.\u2014 A relief from disabilities program is implemented by a State in accordance with this section if the program\u2014\n> \n> \n> \n> > (1\\) permits a person who, pursuant to State law, has been adjudicated as described in subsection (g)(4\\) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code, or has been committed to a mental institution, to apply to the State for relief from the disabilities imposed by subsections (d)(4\\) and (g)(4\\) of such section by reason of the adjudication or commitment;\n> > \n> > \n> > (2\\) provides that a State court, board, commission, or other lawful authority shall grant the relief, pursuant to State law and in accordance with the principles of due process, if the circumstances regarding the disabilities referred to in paragraph (1\\), and the person's record and reputation, are such that the person will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest; and\n> > \n> > \n> > (3\\) permits a person whose application for the relief is denied to file a petition with the State court of appropriate jurisdiction for a de novo judicial review of the denial.\n> \n> \n> (b) Authority To Provide Relief From Certain Disabilities With Respect to Firearms.\u2014 If, under a State relief from disabilities program implemented in accordance with this section, an application for relief referred to in subsection (a)(1\\) of this section is granted with respect to an adjudication or a commitment to a mental institution or based upon a removal of a record under section 102(c)(1\\)(B), the adjudication or commitment, as the case may be, is deemed not to have occurred for purposes of subsections (d)(4\\) and (g)(4\\) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code.\n\nMichigan, however, wasn't one of the states that implemented a relief program.

The federal law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4)) appears to impose a lifetime ban on firearm possession for those who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution. However, the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 allows states to implement relief programs. These programs can provide a path for individuals to have their firearm rights restored if they can demonstrate they are not a danger to public safety. This shows that while the ban can be permanent, there are potential avenues for relief in states that have implemented such programs. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the law refers to past commitments, not just current treatment.

It is extremely unlikely that you can get away with it at all on a military base or in a national park. You may be able to get away with it for longer on Forest Service land (legally speaking, you're supposed to move along after 14 days), but if you're looking for a permanent legal claim to the land, that will not happen without an act of Congress. \nIf public domain land has valuable minerals which you exploit, you may be able to chop down trees and build a cabin, but until Congress lifts the moratorium on mining claims patents, you cannot gain title to the land.

If the land was privately owned, Bob may have a claim through adverse possession, depending on state laws and if he meets all the requirements (such as continuous occupation, open and notorious use, etc.). However, if the land was owned by the government (federal, state, or local), adverse possession cannot be used to claim ownership. The passage specifically states, \"you can't dispossess a government.\" Additionally, the time required for adverse possession varies by state (5-30 years), so 15 years might be sufficient in some states but not others.

The year date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with accompanying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles; and\n> \n> \n> (b)(3\\) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner.\n> \n> \n> (c) Position of Notice.\u2014The notice shall be affixed to the copies in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright. The Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation, as examples, specific methods of affixation and positions of the notice on various types of works that will satisfy this requirement, but these specifications shall not be considered exhaustive.\n> \n> \n> (d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice.\u2014If a notice of copyright in the form and position specified by this section appears on the published copy or copies to which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be given to such a defendant\u2019s interposition of a defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in the last sentence of section 504(2\\).\n\nNote that this section lists the three elements in the order 1\\) symbol or word, 2\\) year, 3\\) owner's name. However, it does not explicitly require this order. As the notice is no longer required at all, and as the sole purpose is \"to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright\" and to defeat a defense of \"innocent infringement\", the order is probably not significant. But I would follow the text of the law and list the elements in teh same order that 17 USC 401 (b) does, that is, word or symbol fist, year second, name third. For example\n\n> Copyright \u00a9 2022 Jane Jones\n\nBut other forms probably have identical legal significance.\n\nNote that \"Copyright \u00a9\" is a redundancy and perhaps I should not have used it in the example here. But it is what I in fact use, and many commercial publishers do the same. I do it because I think the word will be clearest to many English\\-speaking people, but the symbol will be clearest internationally,\n\nNote also that a notice is no longer legally required. Under US law, until 1 January 1978 (the effective date of the 1976 Copyright Act) any publication without a notice caused the work to enter the public domain at once. After that, until 1 March 1989, any publication without a notice caused the work to enter the public domain in five years, unless the work was registered within that time. Once a work enters the public domain, there is no copyright in that work at all.\n\nEver since 1 March 1989, omission of a notice never causes a work to enter the public domain under US law, and currently, to the best of my understanding, a notice is not legally required in any country in the world, although it has some legal value under US law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to U.S. copyright law (17 USC 401), which of the following statements about copyright notices is most accurate?\n\nA) Copyright notices must always follow the order: copyright symbol, year, owner's name.\nB) The omission of a copyright notice today will cause the work to enter the public domain after five years.\nC) Copyright notices are no longer legally required, but can help defeat a defense of \"innocent infringement\" in copyright cases.\nD) The copyright symbol \u00a9 must always be used in conjunction with the word \"Copyright\" for legal validity.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided.

If a proper notice is present, it can prevent a defendant from claiming \"innocent infringement\" to mitigate damages.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the law lists the elements in that order, it does not explicitly require this specific order for the notice to be valid.\n\nOption B is outdated information. Prior to March 1, 1989, omitting a notice could cause a work to enter the public domain in five years, but this is no longer the case.\n\nOption D is incorrect.

While Mr. Smith mentions that the payments will continue \"so long as you remain unmarried,\" he does not explicitly request that Mrs. Jones refrain from remarrying or indicate that the payments are contingent on her choosing to remain single. The statement \"I hope this helps you maintain your independence\" suggests that the money is being offered as support rather than as consideration for remaining unmarried.

This was also true in the rest of the UK until the 1800s, when statutes were passed with the aim of making abortion law clearer (generally forbidding it). This didn't extend to Scotland leaving much of its abortion law unclear.\n\nThe 24 weeks limit that the Scotsman article references is from [Section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 (as amended)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/87/section/1). This act *did* apply to Scotland. The act specifies conditions under which abortion within the first 24 weeks is *legal*, and that it is always legal when there is grave risk to the woman's health.

The Abortion Act 1967 applies to Scotland and provides conditions under which abortion is legal, including the 24-week limit. However, unlike the rest of the UK, Scotland retained its common law approach for circumstances not covered by the Act.

There is a specific federal statute that obligates the school district to make accommodations if a student is diagnosed with ADHD (also a state law).

The unquestionably weakest cornerstone is understanding the realities of district policy.\n\nThere may be district\\-policy type reasons that motivate reticence to recommend testing, but such \"abundance of caution\" is not motivated by a legal mandate imposed on the teacher, it is more likely to be the result of a fear of reprisals (for triggering extra expenditures by the district).

You can reject their offer and present a counter offer in any format you wish.

Generally speaking, contract negotiations go better when the series of counter offers involve the minimum changes from the most recent necessary to effect the desired resulting changes.

If this ruling stands, officers acted legally, although they might still be required to return the phone with the images.\n\nWhether there is probable cause for an arrest (or a search) is always a very fact\\-based issue. I have not found the judge's actual decision, only a news summary of it, which can often be misleading. Specific facts about exactly what Robbins did or said may be important in determining whether there was in fact probable cause.\n\nIt appears that Robbins intends to appeal this decision. If he does there may be an opinion from a Circuit Court of Appeals expanding on whether there was probable cause or any violation of rights, and why.\n\nPrevious cases have established that normally there is no reasonable expectation of privacy for acts performed in public; that one my photograph or video record such public acts legally from anywhere that one may legally be; that there is a right photograph or record police officers engaged in official actions or the use of police powers; and that laws attempting to forbid such recording are unconstitutional when so applied. However, it seems from the news story that here the police officers were off\\-duty and not engaging in any official acts or use of police powers. That might change the ruling.\n\nI rather expect the district court's decision to be overturned, but there is no case exact;ly on point that i know of, and one can never be absolutely sure what a court will do in a particular case. I can see why police officers may have felt threatened, and why the Judge may have been inclined to sympathize with them, although I think the decision was incorrect.

Given the prevalence of personal filming devices, more and more \u201cnews\u201d is being gathered and disseminated by members of the public. The courts have found that freedom of the press applies to citizen journalists and documentarians just as it does to formal members of the press. (See, for example, [*Glik v.

While courts have generally upheld the right to record on-duty officers performing official duties, the situation becomes more complex when dealing with off-duty officers. The legality may depend on various factors, including:\n\n1. The specific behavior of the citizen (whether they were interfering or acting suspiciously)\n2. Local laws and ordinances\n3. The exact circumstances of the interaction\n\nAs the provided information suggests, even courts may disagree on such cases, as evidenced by the district court's ruling in the Daniel Robbins case.

If the internal audit of a company doesn't do due\n> diligence by not properly auditing the financial documents of the\n> company who is legally accountable for the lack of oversight of the\n> internal audit? The CEO and the CFO or just the CFO?\n\nThis answer is prefaced with a lot of context and discussion of possible fact patterns, because it contains some implicit assumptions about how liability for inaccurate financial statements works.\n\n**Context**\n\nPublicly held companies, non\\-profit organizations with certain kinds of grants, and some privately held companies with large unsecured bank loans, are required, as a matter of law, or as a contractual requirement, to prepare financial statements that are audited by a third\\-party certified public accountancy firm.\n\nThis kind of audit is one of the few accounting functions that can only be performed by a CPA, even though, in practice, most more sophisticated accounting tasks are performed by CPAs.\n\nThe process for conducting this kind of audit is established by industry standards adopted by a CPA industry non\\-profit organization called the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).\n\nThe Sarbanes\\-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the CEO of a publicly held company to certify that the financial statements of the company are materially true to the best of the CEO's knowledge, and that the CEO has reviewed the internal controls in the company and that they are either adequate, or that they have flaws which are expressly disclosed.\n\nFederal law also requires publicly held company to periodically change their outside CPA firms and regulates the governance requirements for such firms in connection with hiring and evaluating outside CPA firms.\n\nThe inclusion of a knowingly false or misleading statement about a matter that is material to a potential investor in a publicly held firm's financial statements or other public disclosures is one form of securities fraud. Someone who participates in securities fraud may have civil or criminal liability as a result, although civil liability requires a showing that a particular investor who is suing suffered damages caused by the false or misleading statement.\n\nThe inclusion of a knowingly false or misleading statement about a matter that is material to a lender or grant provider who contractually requires an internal audit of a privately held profit or non\\-profit firm is a breach of the lending agreement or grant agreement, that could have contractually determined penalties, and could sometimes, but not alway, constitute criminal fraud, or justify a civil lawsuit for fraud by the aggrieved lender or grant provider. These misstatements could also be a ground for making the breach of contract debt not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n\nAnother reason that firms sometimes conduct an internal audit would be for management to hire a CPA firm to investigate, forensically, a suspicion that fraud or misconduct has taken place within the firm, by someone at a lower level in the organization or affiliated with the organization, when management doesn't know for sure if something is amiss or not. This could happen in any kind of firm, but is most common in a large privately held company in which there is strong overlap between the group of senior managers of the company and the owners of the company.\n\n**What Can Go Wrong?**\n\nLegal accountability is something that is necessary only when the processes in the company to produce its financial disclosures and other disclosures are inaccurate for some reason.\n\nThere are a variety of people who could have legal accountability, and who is legally accountable depends upon why the disclosures were inaccurate.\n\nMost often, the firm that commissioned the audit may have legal liability to the people for whom the audited financial information was prepared. In the case of a publicly held company, this firm is called the \"issuer\" and the financial statements are prepared for the benefit of the holders of publicly traded stock and corporate bonds of the issuer.\n\nIn the case of a non\\-profit, this would be the grant issuer who imposed the audit requirement (and also the state attorney general, who has general supervisory authority over all non\\-profits in a state). In the case of a commercial lender to the firm, this would be the lender.\n\nUsually, the liability of an issuer for disclosing audited financial statements or disclosures that are inaccurate comes to be in the form of a civil lawsuit for money damages from someone who alleges that they were harmed by the inaccurate disclosure against the issuer.\n\nA civil lawsuit could also name, as co\\-conspirators or additional defendants directly in fraud claims, anyone who participated in preparing the financial statements and knowingly did something wrong in the process with an intent to mislead the person to whom the statements were directed.\n\nThis liability could arise because the CEO certified that the financial statements were accurate knowing that they were not accurate, or certified that there were adequate internal controls in place knowing that there were not adequate internal controls in place.\n\nThis liability could arise because some other officer or employee of the company knowingly manipulated the accounting records of the company, or knowingly set up an inaccurate reporting system to generate accounting records of the company, producing the wrong results. This could take the form of actual fake entries or omissions from accounting business records. It could also take the form of characterizing and aggregating data in accounting business records in a manner inconsistent with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) that are established by the FASB.\n\nThis liability could arise because the same kind of misconduct or negligence of some kind was committed by the CPA firm hired to conduct the audit. The issuer whose financial statements were inaccurate might sue the CPA firm for malpractice (effectively to indemnify it for the liability it incurred to others), or a third\\-party who relied upon the audited financial statements to its detriment could sue the CPA firm that conducted the audit as a third\\-party beneficiary of the representation from the CPA firm that the financial statements were materially accurate.\n\nAny of the people above, if they engaged in intentionally defrauding the intended audience of the financial statements with an intent to deceive (and not mere negligence) could also be prosecuted criminally for securities fraud.\n\nFor example, when a CPA at the national accounting firm of Arthur Anderson intentionally destroyed records with an intent to cover up misconduct, and prepared misleading financial statements for the failed oil and gas firm Enron, the firm was prosecuted criminally for that conduct, convictions were obtained against individuals and the firm, and the firm ceased to exist while the appeal of its conviction was pending. The conviction was ultimately overturned on appeal, but for reasons that don't change the basic concept that accountants and accounting firms can be prosecuting criminally for intentionally and knowingly misleading investors in a publicly held company that it audits with an intent to mislead the public about the audited firm's finances.\n\nAnyone who was in on the fraud and not deceived themselves could also have criminal liability, from a low level book keeper faking data entry records, to a CFO who, for example, intentionally reports the proceeds of loans owed by the company as purchase of stock in the company, in order to make it look like the company has less debt than it actually does.\n\nBut, suppose that the CEO relies upon information from the CFO and the CPA firm conducting the audit that the financial statements are correct and has no reason to suspect otherwise. In that case, even if the CEO certified that the financial statements were correct and was inaccurate in making that certification, the CEO would have no civil or criminal liability.\n\nCriminal liability for inaccurate financial statements or disclosures requires knowledge that they are inaccurate accompanied by a statement to the contrary, or knowing participating in conduct that causes the statements to be inaccurate (and not mere negligence).\n\nSometimes, there is civil liability, but not criminal liability, for \"negligent misrepresentation\" when there are inaccurate financial statements or disclosures, the person states that they are accurate, and due to that person's negligence (but not knowledge or intentional misstatement) the financial statements or disclosure are actually not accurate in a material way that harms someone. The damages available and the legal treatment of the debt in bankruptcy are much more serious for intentional or knowing misstatements than they are for negligent misrepresentations. Negligent misrepresentation liability is limited to actual economic harm and can be discharged in bankruptcy. Securities fraud liability can include punitive damages and is usually impossible to discharge in bankruptcy, and securities fraud debts may be collected from certain kinds of assets that are otherwise exempt from creditor's claims.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A publicly traded company's internal audit fails to detect significant financial irregularities due to inadequate procedures.

The company itself, as a separate legal entity, owns the copyrights.\n\nB is correct because shareholders can vote on company matters, which may include policies related to intellectual property, but they do not have direct rights to use the copyrighted material without permission.\n\nC is incorrect as share ownership does not grant any special rights to copy or use copyrighted material, even for personal use.\n\nD is technically possible but legally problematic.

It is legal for me to discriminate against someone on age if they are younger than 40\\. Why? Because that's what the law says.\n\nThe full list of what constitutes illegal discrimination in employment is a person's race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. It is also illegal to retaliate against a person because he or she complained about discrimination, filed a charge of discrimination, or participated in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit.\n\nElections aren't employment\n---------------------------\n\nVoters are free to vote for the candidate of their choice based on whatever reason they want.
