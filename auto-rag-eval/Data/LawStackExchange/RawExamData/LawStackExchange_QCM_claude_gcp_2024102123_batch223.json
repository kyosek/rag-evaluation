Is this illegal?\n\nI have seen a website that allows users to download manuals for almost any kinds of products free. Could they have asked all those manufacturers for permission to redistribute the manuals? As far as I remember, the site was pretty famous.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: User manuals are indeed copyrighted. On the other hand, since the people building the cranes are most likely interested in people reading these manuals, there is a good chance that you would get permission to copy them, for example as part of a mobile app, if you ask the manufacturer. \n\nOn the other hand, it is possible that the manual was written by a third party, who receives some fixed amount of money for every manual that the manufacturer gives away to customers for free. In that case, copying would destroy that persons earnings, so permission would be unlikely.\n\nYou definitely need to ask for permission and can't go forward without permission. It would also be possible that the crane manufacturer will want to check out your app to make sure that everything is correct \\- if someone damages a crane because of some omissions in your app, that would be very bad for them.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A mobile app developer wants to include screenshots of crane user manuals in their app to teach proper crane operation. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality and best practices for this situation?\n\nA) The developer can freely use the manual screenshots without permission, as user manuals are considered public domain.\n\nB) The developer must obtain permission from the crane manufacturer before using any manual content, and should be prepared for the manufacturer to review the app for accuracy.\n\nC) The developer can use the manual screenshots without permission as long as they provide proper attribution to the manufacturer.\n\nD) The developer only needs permission if they plan to charge for the app; free educational apps can use manual content under fair use.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: User manuals are copyrighted materials, and using screenshots without permission would be a copyright violation. The correct approach is to seek permission from the crane manufacturer before including any manual content in the app. Additionally, manufacturers may want to review the app to ensure accuracy and prevent potential liability issues if the information is presented incorrectly. This answer aligns with the documentation's emphasis on obtaining permission and the possibility of manufacturer review for safety and accuracy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because user manuals are not public domain; they are copyrighted works. Option C is false because attribution alone does not negate the need for permission. Option D is incorrect because the app's cost does not determine whether permission is required, and educational use does not automatically qualify as fair use in this context."

It uses a relatively short passage (30 sentences)\n2. It's for educational purposes\n3. It's on a free, publicly accessible website (non-commercial use)\n4. The source is credited\n5. It involves translation, which adds transformative value\n\nOptions B and C are less likely to be fair use due to the commercial nature of paid membership sites. Option D uses too much content (an entire chapter) which likely exceeds fair use limits. However, it's important to note that fair use/dealing is determined on a case-by-case basis, and consulting with a legal professional is advisable for specific situations."

An outgoing president wants to ensure this individual remains protected, even after he leaves office, and so considers issuing a blanket pardon to this individual for any and all crimes they may have committed (similar to how Ford pardoned Nixon). However, the president knows that such a move would be wildly unpopular and so wants to mitigate the risk of tarnishing his own reputation and legacy.\n\nIn such a scenario, could the president issue a pardon in the presence of witnesses who agree to hold it confidential, and then not publish it? Copies of the pardon would be given to the individual in question, and maybe also to the soon\\-to\\-be\\-ex\\-president and the witnesses. The individual does not disclose the pardon unless and until they are actually charged with or indicted for a crime, thus sparing the president any embarrassment in the event that the charge or indictment never happens. The authenticity of the pardon can be confirmed, if necessary, by checking with the ex\\-president and/or the witnesses.\n\nIs there any law which prevents this scenario from playing out?

There are also laws which require that records be kept of all Presidential activity, including pardons.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been living in London for several years now and experienced issues with one of my last letting agencies. I'm looking for your legal advice on what actions to take.\n\nIt was an Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement within a shared house. The issue with this tenancy which ended almost a year ago was that the landlord never paid me back my deposit and also never protected it under the deposit scheme. \n\n[This website](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/tenancy_deposits/tenancy_deposit_compensation_claims) states that \"before I start a court claim, I must send my former landlord a formal 'letter before action'. This letter must set out the detail of my claim.\"\n\nI found out that the court could force my landlord to pay up to 3 times the deposit amount. Is it 3 times on top of the reimbursement of the deposit (i.e. a total of 4 times the deposit in best case scenario), or including the reimbursement of the deposit?\n\nSo I prepared the template letter [as described here](https://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/word_doc/0003/1154118/Letter_before_action_failure_to_return_a_deposit_and_compensation_claim_TD7_sample_letter.docx).\n\nMy question to you is: **can I decide to take this to court if, let's say, the landlord does not agree to settle for at least 2 times the deposit amount?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under [section 214 of the Housing Act 2004](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/section/214) (as amended), the penalty for not protecting the deposit is considered separately from the deposit itself.\n\nIn the case where the tenant has already moved out (emphasis mine):\n\n> (3A) The court **may** order the person who appears to the court to be holding the deposit to repay all or part of it to the applicant within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the making of the order.\n> \n> \n> (4\\)The court **must** order the landlord to pay to the applicant a sum of money **not less than the amount of the deposit and not more than three times** the amount of the deposit within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the making of the order.\n\n(See also [here](http://tenancy_deposit_advice_for_landlords) and [here](https://www.landlordlawblog.co.uk/2012/01/30/tenancy-deposits-the-fatal-mistake-you-may-not-realise-you-have-already-made/)).\n\nIn other words, if this goes to court, the landlord may be faced with paying back (in the worst case for him) the entire deposit, **plus** a penalty of up to three times the deposit.\n\nTherefore, unless the landlord is feeling confident, privately agreeing for him to pay two times the deposit could be a good deal, as it's half what a court could award.",

The court may order the return of the original deposit to the tenant.\n2. The court must order the landlord to pay a penalty of not less than the amount of the deposit and not more than three times the amount of the deposit.\n\nTherefore, the maximum total amount a landlord could be ordered to pay is the original deposit plus an additional penalty of up to three times the deposit amount. This makes option C the correct answer, as it accurately reflects the potential maximum financial consequences for the landlord as stipulated by the law."

The \u201cZ\u201d symbol is used in a Russian context in support of this invasion. It is therefore understandable that a prosecutor has the reasonable suspicion that publicly posting a Russian flag with the Z symbol is public approval of this crime of aggression. [Spiegel Online reported of 140 similar cases across Germany](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/ukrainekrieg-mehr-als-hundert-ermittlungsverfahren-wegen-befuerwortung-des-russischen-angriffskriegs-a-83fd4196-3dcb-42b8-a435-6ad0a29a5c90).\n\nThus, the photo could be real. Of course, the accused should not accept this invitation to talk to the police and instead get themselves a criminal defense attorney. A defense strategy would likely argue that the profile picture was not \u201csuitable for causing a disturbance of the public peace\u201d so that the conditions of \u00a7 140 StGB were not fulfilled.

This law prohibits publicly approving of certain crimes, including crimes of aggression, in a manner suitable for disturbing public peace. While there's no exhaustive list of banned materials specifically for social media profiles, prosecutors may view such symbols as approval of Russia's actions, which are widely considered a crime of aggression in Germany.

Might it be lawful to make a public notice that I will not offer business to folks who want me to express Christian concepts? Is it any better/worse if I note that I will accept Christian clients as long as they don't ask for anything Christian to be expressed in the product?\n\nFor context, I'm attempting to understand the conjunction of [*Masterpiece*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colorado_Civil_Rights_Commission) and [*303 Creative*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/303_Creative_LLC_v._Elenis).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Probably not. The impediment is the claim that you have a genuinely held religious belief. Changing the context a tiny bit, your employer is statutorily required to make an accommodation for the requirements of your religion, therefore they cannot fire you for refusing to work on the Sabbath, unless it would impose an unreasonable burden on them. If they fire you, you complain to the EOC and the EOC sanctions them. The employer's defense would be that you did not request a reasonable religion\\-based accommodation (you failed to explain that this was about Sabbath). The employer does not scrutinize the validity of your claim (does not demand proof of what your religion requires).\n\nIn your planned announcement, you are not requesting a statutory accommodation from the government, analogous to requesting an accommodation from an employer, you are offering a defense in the case the government takes action against you for violating the law. There is a statutory exception to the prohibition against employment discrimination based on religion, that (roughly speaking) a church is not required to hire a rabbi instead of a mullah to deliver sermons. There is no statutory exception w.r.t. public accommodations and religious discrimination.\nTherefore, to implement your plan, you would have to have the law or the EOC's interpretation of it overturned as unconstitutional.\n\nTo succeed in your argument, you would have to show that the law unconstitutionally restricts your free exercise of your religion. One part would be a demonstration that your religion prohibits... The least likely scenario is that your religion prohibits doing business with a person outside of your religion. I don't of any religion that maintains a requirement of absolute religious segregation, but that is hypothetically a path to argue \u2013 that you will burn in hell forever if you do business with a Christian, or a Muslim. I am maximally skeptical that the courts would ever take such a claim seriously.\n\nA more likely possibility would involve \"compelled speech\" as well, where you are forced under the law to express a viewpoint that contradicts your fundamental religious beliefs. You cannot be compelled by law to express a viewpoint.\nWhat is less clear is what constitutes expressing a viewpoint, see [this](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/compelledspeech.htm). For example, there is a federal law withholding federal funds from schools which discriminate against military recruiters. Some law schools argued in [Rumsfield v Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/547/47/) that allowing military recruiters amounts to forcing the schools to express a viewpoint, but the court held that \"the Solomon Amendment regulates conduct, not speech\".\n\nThe upshot of [303 Creative LLC v. Elenis](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-476_c185.pdf) is that\n\"The First Amendment prohibits Colorado from forcing a website designer to create expressive designs speaking messages with which the designer disagrees\". A proposal to refuse to service Christians plainly does not fall within the penumbra of that ruling. Nor does a refusal to print books containing religious material (which you already created). You have to cater to Christians, but you do not have to create Christian messages. You could draw a line between a simple ISP who you pay to make available your religious website (you create it), versus hiring a company to *design* the website, which clearly involves \"expression\".\n\nThe issue is simplified if you don't make a claim based on a specific belief system, instead rely on simple \"compelled speech\" doctrine. General beliefs do not enjoy the same \"Free Exercise\" protections that religions enjoy. What matters is what you are \"expressing\", not what you are doing (like, printing).",

This option allows serving all clients while protecting the artist's right not to create specific content that conflicts with their beliefs.\n\nOption D would likely not be protected, as it involves refusing to provide a general service (printing) rather than protecting against compelled speech or expression.

According to the first-sale doctrine, the company can legally repurpose the devices by installing a custom Linux OS and sell them as part of a larger solution, even if they were originally sold with Windows for personal use. The key is that the pre-installed Windows OS is not being used for industrial purposes. Additionally, since the devices are being purchased for resale as part of the company's business model, they may qualify for a sales tax exemption on the initial purchase. This aligns with the information provided in the original answer, which states that the first-sale doctrine allows for this type of repurposing and resale, and mentions the potential for a sales tax exemption in such business models."

If so, what is the legal reason that this is the case and what policy does this serve?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **The Distinction Is Probably Between Criminal And Civil Enforcement**\n\nMy suspicion is that the distinction that you are picking up upon reflects of division of labor in which civil enforcement actions are mostly handled by lawyers assigned to the Securities and Exchange Commission (an independent federal government agency), while criminal securities fraud enforcement actions are mostly handled by lawyers assigned to the United States Department of Justice. \n\nBut, I strongly suspect that the fundamental source of the distinction is the kind of case handled by each agency and not agency of employment per se, because constitutionally and for most purposes, SEC employees and Justice Department employees are both employees of the same entity, the federal government of the United States of America.\n\nIf an SEC lawyer were loaned to the Department of Justice to work on a criminal securities fraud prosecution that the DOJ didn't have anyone qualified to prosecute due to lack of financial industry knowledge, I do not believe that the limitation that you assert exists would apply.\n\n**Search Warrants, Wiretaps and Arrest Warrants Are Generally Only Available In Criminal Cases**\n\nGenerally speaking, search warrants, wiretaps, and arrest warrants are investigative tools available only in criminal investigations, and in the absence of exigent circumstances, may only be issued upon a showing to a neutral magistrate or judge, supported by a sworn statement showing that probable cause exists that a crime has been committed and (1\\) in the case of an arrest warrant, that the person named committed that crime, and (2\\) in the case of a search warrant or wiretap, that the search or wiretap will reveal evidence of that crime. \n\n*Exceptions To The General Rule*\n\nThe main exceptions to this general rule is that arrest warrants may issue in a civil case (i) to compel the attendance of a witness who fails to make a timely response or appearance to a subpoena after being personally served in a timely manner with that subpoena, (ii) to compel someone to attend a quasi\\-criminal contempt of court hearing, and (iii) to arrest someone who have been held in contempt of court. In criminal contempt proceedings, contempt of court is a crime that is just prosecuted using an unusual procedure. In the case of subpoena enforcement and civil contempt enforcement the infringement on an arrestee's right is limited in that compliance with the court's order will promptly result in the person arrested being freed. Also in subpoena and civil contempt cases the person arrested does not get a criminal record as a result (although they may get an arrest record), so there are no collateral consequences to the proceeding as there would be a criminal case.\n\n*The Legal Basis For This Rule*\n\nThese limitations are a function of the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution which states:\n\n> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,\n>  and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be\n>  violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,\n>  supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the\n>  place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\nThe implied term that \"probable cause\" means probable cause that a crime has committed and that the object of the search or seizure is connected to that crime is a long standing interpretation of the 4th Amendment through case law. \n\nThis interpretation has been applied and has been enforced via the exclusionary rule in federal criminal prosecutions since *Weeks v. United States*, 232 U.S. 383 (1914\\) (the U.S. Supreme Court definitively applied the 4th Amendment exclusionary rule to state criminal prosecutions under the selective incorporation doctrine via the 14th Amendment in *Mapp v. Ohio*, 367 U.S. 643 (1961\\)). \n\nThe meaning of probable cause, however, is even older than the exclusionary rule (before which, a civil rights action would have been the primary remedy for a violation). But, federal criminal prosecutions were extremely rare in the first 90\\-150 or so years of the existence of the federal government because the scope of federal government activity relative to state government activity was much smaller, and because the combined scope of all government was smaller in a less complex economy.\n\n*Wire Taps Are 4th Amendment Searches*\n\nThe determination that a wiretap was a search for 4th Amendment purposes was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in *Katz v. United States*, 389 U.S. 347 (1967\\).\n\n*Policy Considerations*\n\nThe investigatory tools of search warrants, wire taps and arrest warrants, are frequently obtained *ex parte* and secretly (until the search, wiretap or arrest is complete), because the law considers it likely that defendants facing potentially lengthy incarceration will risk disobeying court orders and destroy evidence to avoid those consequences. \n\nIn a criminal case, the assumption that the defendant is basically a law abiding person which applies in civil cases no longer holds true once probable cause has been demonstrated to an independent magistrate, even though the defendant is presumed innocent for the purpose of an ultimate trial.\n\nThe policy purpose of this rule is to allow \"people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects\" from government intrusions allowing them privacy, comfort and security as a basic human right. The 4th Amendment is the way that the law balances those privacy interests and the compelling interest of the state in punishing crime so as to deter people from committing crimes.\n\n**Securing Evidence In Civil Cases**\n\n*What Are Civil Cases?*\n\nCivil cases are case where only money judgments and injunctive awards which do not involve incarceration if obeyed are potential punishments, and are generally considered less serious than criminal charges for which incarceration and various other collateral consequences are available as punishments, for a variety of procedural purposes.\n\nMost civil cases are brought by private parties, but governmental officials, usually in regulatory agencies, can also bring civil cases.\n\nIn civil cases, it is generally assumed that defendants and their lawyers, facing the limited stakes that they do, will comply with court orders and will cooperate in providing testimony and documents rather than upping the stakes to criminal obstruction of justice charges and civil spoilation of evidence charges.\n\n*Obtaining Evidence In Civil Cases*\n\nIn civil cases, evidence must generally be obtained voluntarily from third parties, obtained involuntarily from the parties via the disclosure and discovery process of the rules of civil procedure (which were greatly expanded around the same time that the SEC was created in connection with a major overhaul of federal civil procedure that resulted in the federal rules of civil procedure in effect with amendments today), and via subpoenas. These discovery and subpoena tools are all basically derivative of the common law trial subpoena power, and certain other powers that were vested in courts of equity, which is constitutionally recognized in federal criminal trials in the 6th Amendment which includes a right \"to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor\" and applies in civil trials by tradition, court rule and statute. \n\nThe SEC has statutory pre\\-litigation subpoena power even in the absence of a pending lawsuit between the SEC and the parties subject to the subpoena as do almost all other administrative agencies that enforce non\\-criminal law.\n\nAlso, because of the way that the securities laws enforced by the SEC are structured, it is possible to bring civil cases and try them without any need to resort to discovery or investigatory tools, based upon complaints filed by members of the public. For example, placing a newspaper ad offering to sell shares of stock without a registration of the offering with the SEC is a civil violation which can often be pursued in a civil case with a copy of the newspaper and the documents provided to a complaining witness by the defendants. In contrast, criminal charges almost always require third party evidence of criminal intent which is rarely publicly available.\n\nAnother useful tool in civil cases is that the 5th Amendment privilege against self\\-incrimination does not apply, so if the defendant refused to testify (perhaps claiming the 5th Amendment for fear of criminal consequences of truthful testimony) that refusal to testify can be used to infer that his testimony would have hurt him and to find civil liability.",

DOJ lawyers typically handle criminal securities fraud cases, which allow for the use of search warrants, wiretaps, and arrest warrants based on probable cause of a crime being committed. These tools are generally only available in criminal investigations due to Fourth Amendment protections.\n\nSEC lawyers, on the other hand, primarily handle civil enforcement actions. In civil cases, they are limited to civil discovery tools such as subpoenas, disclosure requirements, and the discovery process outlined in the rules of civil procedure. They cannot use criminal investigative tools like wiretaps or search warrants in their civil cases.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the actual situation. Option C is incorrect because it ignores the fundamental difference between criminal and civil case procedures. Option D is incorrect because while arrest warrants can be used in some limited civil contexts (e.g., for contempt of court), this is not a distinguishing factor between SEC and DOJ lawyers' investigative powers."

In most cases this is not considered to be a \"taking\" for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment, even if it reduces the value of the property, and the government does not have to compensate the property owner. See for instance [*Agins v. City of Tiburon*, 447 U.S. 255 (1980\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/447/255/). Roughly speaking, the Takings Clause only applies if the regulations are so restrictive that the land cannot really be used at all. Here you are still perfectly able to use the existing house, and it sounds like you can even build an addition \\- you just can't build in the exact way that you want.\n\nYou'll either need to design your addition to comply with the current setback rules, or see if you can get the village to approve a variance.",

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal situation?\n\nA) The village is required to compensate the homeowner for the change in zoning laws, as it constitutes a regulatory taking under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nB) The original seller of the property is liable for damages, as they sold the property with insufficient setback for future additions.\n\nC) The homeowner has no legal recourse for compensation and must either comply with current setback rules or seek a variance from the village.\n\nD) The neighbor is obligated to sell the required portion of their land to allow for the addition, as the original property division was flawed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the legal precedent set in cases like Agins v. City of Tiburon, changes in zoning ordinances or building codes that restrict property use are generally not considered a \"taking\" under the Fifth Amendment, unless they render the property entirely unusable. The village is not required to compensate the homeowner for the change in rules. The original sale was likely legal under the rules at the time, so the seller is not liable.

For example, the search and subsequent search results clicked could be used by Google to improve future search results, or improve ads personalization.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whether consent is necessary depends on the specific processing purposes. For example, general usage statistics about search terms or about the usage of the site likely fall under a legitimate interest.\n\nOutside of the GDPR, there can be consent requirements for the use of specific technologies. Per the ePrivacy directive, consent is required for accessing or setting cookies on a user device, unless the cookie is strictly necessary for the service requested by the user (\u201cfunctional cookie\u201d). This consent requirement also extends to other storage and fingerprinting technologies.\n\nA functional cookie could e.g. be used to store a history of search terms on the user device itself. However, ad personalization is not strictly necessary for the search functionality, so setting cookies (or using similar technologies) for ad personalization requires consent, regardless of whether ad personalization itself would require consent.\n\nTo determine whether a processing purpose falls under a legitimate interest,\nthe data controller must weight the interest against the data subject's rights and freedoms. There are no objective guidelines on this, and ultimately a court would have to decide. However, I would assume that the tracking necessary for ad personalization is an inappropriate infringement on the data subject's rights and freedoms, so that ad personalization cannot fall under a legitimate interest. The data controller would have to choose a different legal basis, which effectively only leaves consent.",

This question tests understanding of the nuances in data processing requirements under GDPR and ePrivacy directive.\n\nOption A is incorrect because ad personalization is not likely to fall under legitimate interest and typically requires consent.\n\nOption B is too broad. Not all processing beyond the search itself requires explicit consent. Some purposes, like general usage statistics, may fall under legitimate interest.\n\nOption C is correct. Functional cookies, which are strictly necessary for the service requested by the user (like storing search history), don't require consent. However, cookies for ad personalization are not strictly necessary for search functionality and thus require consent.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The need for consent is not determined by whether a user has a registered account, but by the nature of the data processing and the technology used.\n\nThis question highlights the distinction between different types of data processing, the concept of legitimate interest, and the specific requirements for cookie usage under the ePrivacy directive."

I then use that $500 to buy a pair of headphones for myself. Or I just buy the headphones straight away with Bitcoin, skipping the whole fiat conversion part.\n\nFor one reason or another, I never report this to the government. Maybe I simply had no idea that such a law existed (actually the case for me up until a few days ago), or I forgot, or I did know but actively wanted to avoid having to pay my money to an evil government. I doubt it matters why; let's just say that I never report it.\n\nBut then, one day, they find out. And they decide that I'm guilty of withholding $500 worth of BTC from them, of which I'm apparently supposed to pay 30% in taxes whenever I sell/spend them.\n\nI'm sure they will punish me somehow, and not care about any explanation I might have. But will the punishment be 40 years in federal maximum security prison, even though the amount of money is ridiculously small? Or will they just tell me to pay it and perhaps add a $20 fee on top of the 30% of $500 that they consider me to owe them?\n\nAgain, I'm talking \"in general\". In most countries. Feel free to use the USA as an example, but I'd be interested if it varies wildly.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short Answer**\n\nThe dollar amount of a criminal tax offense is considered at the sentencing stage, but is only one of many factors and merely helps determine which of several possible sentencing guideline sentences that a U.S. judge uses as a starting point when determining the sentence.\n\nWhile the amount of money involved is a factor, the punishment isn't usually \"proportional\" to the tax liability in a criminal tax case.\n\nBut criminal tax offenses make up only a tiny fraction of all punishments imposed for violating tax laws. Most tax law violations are punished with civil penalties that are often proportional to the amount of tax not paid or not reported.\n\nThe U.S. pattern in this respect is typical of punishments for violating tax laws in the developed world more generally.\n\nUndeveloped and developing country economies tend to be less bureaucratic and to have a more criminal law oriented system for punishing violations of their revenue collection laws, and also tend to have narrower tax bases limited to more concrete transactions. Many resource rich countries, like oil rich monarchies, often don't impose taxes on the general public at all.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\n> I'm sure they will punish me somehow, and not care about any\n> explanation I might have.

Or will they just tell me to pay it and perhaps\n> add a $20 fee on top of the 30% of $500 that they consider me to owe\n> them?\n\n*When Are Tax Crimes Prosecuted?*\n\nThe vast majority of the time, when you don't pay your taxes, tax collection authorities impose a monetary civil penalty, which often is proportional to the amount of money at stake, rather than punish your non\\-compliance in the criminal justice system. Less frequently, the civil penalty involves the forfeiture of property of the offending taxpayer (e.g. currency received as lawful payments for goods or services that is not disclosed to tax officials), or the loss of some tax law related benefit or privilege (e.g. disallowing a tax credit when a tax return upon which it should be claimed isn't filed by the due date).\n\nStrict liability or negligence based penalties for tax law violations are usually civil rather than criminal. Criminal penalties for tax law violations are usually reserved for intentional misconduct.\n\n*How Severe Are Tax Crime Penalties?*\n\nCriminal tax crimes usually involve intentional fraud or willful conduct influencing the amount of taxes you owe (as opposed to good faith efforts to lawfully not pay higher taxes than necessary, or negligent or unintentional actions that have that effect), or intentional non\\-reporting or misreporting of information necessary for the government to determine how much tax someone else owes, or willfully failing to pay or collect taxes when the taxable is able to pay or collect the taxes, or for conduct that thwarts tax collection more generally (like sending fake inaccurate tax forms to random people causing them to pay the wrong amount of taxes or none at all). The maximum penalty for serious tax crimes of this type are typically similar in severity to the maximum penalty for non\\-violent theft, forgery or fraud offenses not involving taxes, which is typically at the low to medium end for felony criminal conduct and is typically far less than the maximum punishment for violent crimes.\n\nCrimes involving willful manipulation of how much tax is owed by someone usually has higher maximum criminal penalties than willful failure to pay or collect taxes.\n\nConduct such as lying to tax investigators, or disregarding legal process during tax audits and litigation, or other fraudulent conduct that doesn't change how much is owed or paid directly but makes it more cumbersome to collect taxes (like intentionally filing a false information tax return, when the taxpayer reports the income anyway, or filing a false information tax return to harass someone who doesn't owe any tax in the first place), are typically misdemeanors with only comparatively minor criminal penalties (perhaps a few days to a year in jail and a fine in the hundreds or single digit thousands of dollars).\n\nThe main driver of the maximum penalty for the narrow range of tax law violations are actually tax crimes is how clearly malicious and unruly the conduct is, rather than the amount in controversy. Negligently failing to pay $10,000,000, or recklessly taking a very dubious tax law position in a tax return, will usually result in a large civil tax penalty, but no criminal prosecution. Intentionally forging or doctoring a $700 information tax return, or intentionally paying a tax bill with counterfeit currency, will usually have criminal penalties.\n\nThere are also quite a few crimes that arguably count as tax crimes for conduct like murdering tax collectors, kidnapping tax collectors, assaulting tax collectors, bribing tax collectors, blackmailing tax collectors to act unlawfully, stealing or destroying tax collection agency property, etc. that would be crimes even if there was no tax component to the conduct, that I do not consider in this answer. These crimes are usually punished only modestly more severely than they are in the non\\-tax context when no government officials or offices are involved, and are usually punished with about the same severity as other crimes against non\\-tax government officials.\n\n*Determining The Sentence For A Tax Crime Under U.S. Law*\n\nIn the U.S., the maximum period of incarceration for a federal tax related crime is usually not related to the amount of money that the government was denied in tax revenues, although the civil penalties for violations of tax laws are usually capped at a percentage of the tax not paid. Criminal fines for tax offenses are sometimes related to the dollar amount of the offense, and sometimes aren't related directly to the dollar amount, although they may be determined with the dollar amount of the offense in mind.\n\nThe length of the sentence of incarceration and the amount of the fine actually imposed by a federal judge upon a conviction for a federal tax related crime between the maximum and minimum sentences authorized by law is governed by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines set by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Commission.\n\nThe guideline sentence is based upon the specific subsection of the federal tax crime for which you were convicted and then a lot of factors that add or deduct points. Some of the points are related to your prior criminal history. Some of the points are related to your conduct in the litigation (e.g. did you cooperate with prosecutors), and some of the points are based upon the nature of the offense itself, including the dollar amount of the tax loss caused by the crime. Typically, there are several dollar ranges for each crime, and the number of points added to the number used to determine the sentencing guideline range is stated for each of the possible range of dollar values of the money at issue in the crime.\n\nThe number of points you have after the judge evaluates all of these factors (based upon a preponderance of the evidence with lower evidentiary standards than those that apply at the guilt\\-innocence phase of the case) to produce a non\\-binding recommended sentencing range for the crime. The judge than imposes the sentence.\n\nA sentence within a correctly determined sentencing guideline range is always upheld on appeal. A judge can impose a sentence that is higher than the guideline range but lower than the maximum statutorily authorized sentence, or below the guideline range by higher than the minimum statutorily authorized sentence, if the judge articulates reasons for doing so that are on a list of reasons that a judge can impose a non\\-guideline sentence.\n\nIf a sentence for a federal tax crime conviction is appealed, the appellate court evaluates whether the sentencing guideline range was determined correctly, and whether if the judge imposed a sentence outside the sentencing guideline range, if the reasons articulated by the judge were insufficient to justify that decision and hence constituted an abuse of discretion by the judge. If the appellate court makes that determination, the case is remanded for re\\-sentencing in accordance with the appellate court opinion (assuming that the conviction itself was affirmed on appeal).",

Which of the following is most likely to occur?\n\nA) The business owner will automatically face 40 years in federal prison due to the criminal nature of tax evasion.\n\nB) The IRS will impose only a $20 fee on top of the taxes owed, as the amount is relatively small.\n\nC) The business owner will likely face civil penalties proportional to the unpaid tax amount, unless there's evidence of intentional fraud.\n\nD) The case will immediately be prosecuted as a criminal matter, with sentencing primarily based on the dollar amount involved.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the vast majority of tax law violations are handled through civil penalties rather than criminal prosecution. Criminal cases are typically reserved for intentional fraud or willful misconduct, not simple omissions or negligence. Civil penalties are often proportional to the amount of unpaid tax.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it drastically overstates the typical punishment for tax issues, especially for relatively small amounts. \n\nAnswer B understates the likely consequence. While the amount is small, the penalty would likely be more than just $20.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it assumes immediate criminal prosecution, which is rare for simple omissions, especially of small amounts. Additionally, in criminal tax cases, the dollar amount is just one of many factors considered in sentencing, not the primary factor."

Her actions don't immediately constitute trespassing (ruling out option D), although if she persists in impeding others' use of the park after being asked to stop by park administrators or law enforcement, she could then be considered to be trespassing."

The original Trident Sugarless Gum advertisement claim was based on a carefully worded question asked to a small sample of dentists, with important context omitted in the final advertisement. The question posed to dentists was specifically about recommending the gum to patients who insist on chewing gum, not a general endorsement of gum chewing. This crucial context was left out of the final claim, making it appear more broadly supportive than it actually was. The company also stopped surveying after finding just five dentists with the desired ratio of responses, rather than conducting a comprehensive survey.

I read an affidavit of someone who wrote an affidavit for the other side. I am concerned about the content of that affidavit because it misleading. I believe the person who signed the affidavit is sincere but signed a version that had been heavily edited by someone else. Are there legal constraints on my contacting that person and attempting to talk w him about his affidavit. (I have had some contact with him in the past.)\n\nUpdate: Two witnesses on the other side said they have changed their affidavits based on my discussions with them, removing incorrect guesses that they originally had presented as fact. An attorney could have shown their original affidavits were not based on their own personal knowledge, but rather on conjecture, but that would have meant 2 depositions, costing several thousands of dollars. Already the case has cost many tens of thousands of dollars and is a severe strain on family resources.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Unless you received an order from the court prohibiting contact, it might be legal; but it's probably not the best idea.\n\n### Let the lawyers handle it\n\nAttorneys have far better, more effective means of dealing with this situation than the course of action you describe. Lawyers have productive tools to accomplish the job and they know how to use them.\n\nFor example, assume the best\\-case\\-scenario results from your idea and you get the other side to admit their affidavit is fallacious in some way. \n\n\"Aha!\" you shout. \"Success! Daylight!\"\n\nBut then what?\n\nIt's not on record. You can't testify to the admission because that's hearsay. Now imagine they next share this information about your little conversation with the counterparty that had them sign the affidavit in the first place. After first being alerted of your concerns, they both now act in concert to shore up their stories and you never see that \"daylight\" again.\n\nContrast that outcome with one where your guy or gal's attorney deposes the witness under oath, gets them to concede to your version of the facts then introduces the deposition as favorable evidence at trial. That's a much better outcome for \"your side.\" Wouldn't you agree?\n\n### Be wary of unintended consequences\n\nGenerally speaking, such direct contact between the parties is often problematic and rarely helpful. (Except, in some cases, when direct contact between the parties leads to a negotiated settlement. Which happens far less often than the direct contact going sideways making the situation even more intractable.)\n\nBefore you launch off on your own and do something that might be counterproductive. First, identify the areas of the affidavit that you think are inaccurate. Give that information to the party you support, then have them run it by their attorney to figure out the best way to handle the situation.",

Generally speaking, countries will only extradite someone if it is a serious offense under the domestic laws of the country of arrest as well as the country requesting that the person be handed over, and also only if the crime occurred in or was targeted at the requesting country.\n\nSometimes the arrest is not legal in the place where it is made. For example, in this case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court (the quote is from the official syllabus to the case):\n\n> Respondent, a citizen and resident of Mexico, was forcibly kidnapped\n> from his home and flown by private plane to Texas, where he was\n> arrested for his participation in the kidnapping and murder of a Drug\n> Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent and the agent's pilot. After\n> concluding that DEA agents were responsible for the abduction, the\n> District Court dismissed the indictment on the ground that it violated\n> the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Mexico\n> (Extradition Treaty or Treaty), and ordered respondent's repatriation.\n> The Court of Appeals affirmed. Based on one of its prior decisions,\n> the court found that, since the United States had authorized the\n> abduction and since the Mexican government had protested the Treaty\n> violation, jurisdiction was improper.\n> \n> \n> Held: The fact of respondent's forcible abduction does not prohibit\n> his trial in a United States court for violations of this country's\n> criminal laws.\n\n*[U.S. v. Alvarez\\-Machain](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/655)*, 504 U.S. 655 (1992\\).\n\n> I mean can a country just bring to jail any youtuber outside its\n> borders ( using its national language as the language of the video )\n> who uploads content of international appeal because of some law?\n\nIf the country can manage to arrest the person, yes. There are high profile cases from Saudi Arabia where that has happened. *See, e.g.*, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raif_Badawi) and [here](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/samar-badawi-arrested-1.4770268) (a blogger and his sister arrested in Saudi Arabia, while his wife and children flee to Canada), [here](https://cpj.org/2019/04/saudi-arabia-detains-3-more-bloggers/) (journalists for Lebanese periodical arrested in Saudi Arabia in relation to years old publications) [here](https://rsf.org/en/news/seven-more-journalists-writers-and-bloggers-arrested-saudi-arabia) (more journalists arrested in Saudi Arabia), [here](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/29/abu-sin-christina-crockett-saudi-arabia-videos-arrest) (\"A male Saudi Arabian teenager has been arrested in Riyadh over a series of online videos of conversations between him and a female Californian streaming\\-video star that went viral.\"), [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-rights-idINKCN24T1UR) (Yemeni blogger), and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi) (Washington Post journalist tortured and killed in Saudi Arabian embassy in Turkey at the direction of a senior member of the Saudi Arabian royal family).\n\n> Also can a country just hold liable for youtube's data privacy\n> practices a youtuber outside its borders and enforce the judgement if\n> the practices of both youtuber and their chanell and youtube is legal\n> in their home country?\n\nA country can hold anyone liable for anything its domestic laws allow it to hold someone liable for, and can enforce that judgment against any assets it can exert power over. Some countries with similar legal systems recognize each other's court judgments widely. Countries with very different legal systems often don't recognize each other's judgements.\n\nFor example, most European countries do not recognize U.S. money judgment for torts (i.e. civil wrongs such as personal injury awards).\n\nSimilarly, the U.S. does not recognize most foreign defamation judgments, and does not recognize most judgments of Saudi Arabian courts.\n\n> One last thing is wether inclusion of ads make a difference?\n\nUsually not. But it can matter for purposes of assertions of lawsuit liability over someone outside the jurisdiction seeking to impose liability for something that harmed someone in their country. If conduct amounts to \"doing business\" in the country seeking to impose liability or amounts to a \"purposeful availment\" of the laws of the country seeking to impose liability in some why, an imposition of extraterritorial liability is more likely, and that tends to happen more in cases where there are ads that are commercial targeting the people of the country where the courts seek to impose liability.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Zephyria's ability to enforce its law against the U.S.-based YouTuber?\n\nA) Zephyria can easily extradite and imprison the YouTuber since the videos are viewable in Zephyria.\n\nB) Zephyria has no legal authority over the YouTuber as long as they remain in the U.S.\n\nC) Zephyria could potentially enforce its law if the YouTuber enters Zephyria or a country with an extradition agreement with Zephyria.\n\nD) Zephyria can enforce monetary penalties against the YouTuber but cannot seek imprisonment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While Zephyria's law applies to content viewable within its borders, its ability to enforce that law against a foreign YouTuber is limited. Zephyria cannot easily extradite the YouTuber from the U.S., as option A suggests, because extradition typically requires the act to be a crime in both countries. Option B is incorrect because Zephyria's law does apply to content viewed within its borders, regardless of where it originates. Option D is partially true but incomplete, as Zephyria could potentially seek imprisonment if the YouTuber entered its jurisdiction or a country with an extradition agreement. Option C is the most accurate, reflecting that Zephyria's ability to enforce its law depends on the YouTuber's location and international agreements, aligning with the information provided about extraterritorial enforcement of laws against content creators."

In [accompanying media articles](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/new-zealand-river-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-being) it wasn't clear whether this meant a living entity, a person or a human; the article author says \"human\", the Whanganui representative is quoted as saying \"living entity\" and Finlayson is quoted as saying \"person\". I recognise that these are three different (although overlapping) legal definitions carrying different liabilities. And while I would agree that the net ecosystem services of a river clearly outweight its costs even before you consider the social and religious significance, as far as I am aware the law on corporate personhood does not recognise this. If/when you cause harm, you can be sued.\n\nAssuming that a direct quote from the minister responsible for the law (Chris Finlayson) can be taken at face value:\n\n> Te Awa Tupua will have its own legal identity with all the\n>  corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a legal person\n\n... I assume (and it would be sensible if) we're actually talking about legal personhood here. In which case, if the river floods, it is personally (and criminally) liable for the damage? If someone drowns, the river will be prosecuted for murder? What happens if a river goes bankrupt?\n\nThe [Economist article](https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21719409-odd-legal-status-intended-help-prevent-pollution-and-other-abuses-new-zealand-declares) mentions that some NZers have been 'joking' about whether the river can be prosecuted if someone drowns, but doesn't attempt to answer that. I assume it's implying that it's ludicrous, but that's not obvious to me from the information provided.\n\nI am interested to know whether this decision potentially creates significant legal liabilities for the river which may not be obvious to those who think this is a straightforward environmental 'win' for the Whanganui.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In context, the answer is *clearly not*. The precise reason that this is the case, requires a somewhat more sophisticated theory of what is going on than the *Economist* article cited seems to provide.\n\nThe most useful analogy to apply to a situation when a river or forest or some other non\\-sentient being is given legal personality would be the relationship of a [guardian and ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian). A guardian for a ward can be appointed by a court or other person with a special relationship to the ward (e.g. a parent or deceased parent for a child, or a spouse for an older person, or an indigenous tribe for a river), to look out for the best interests of a ward (sometimes at public expense). A ward could be a minor, or a person with advanced dementia, or otherwise unable to personally take legal action on their own behalf. In this case, the ward is a river.\n\nYou couldn't prosecute a river criminally or for most civil obligations (e.g., breach of contract and torts) for its own actions for the same sorts of reasons that you couldn't prosecute a six months old, or an individual in a coma, on that basis. A person such as that could neither have capacity to contract nor form the intent necessary to commit a tort and be legally responsible for that tort.\n\nIn the same way, the river doesn't actually walk into court, or sign affidavits, or sign contracts, or anything like that. Instead, it acts through a fiduciary appointed to act on its behalf in its best interests (in the [environmental law context](http://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3359&context=mlr) (also [here](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1559&context=wmelpr)), such a guardian is often called a \"[Lorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lorax)\" after the character in the Dr. Seuss book, \"The Lorax\" who says \"I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees. I speak for the trees for the trees have no tongues.\"). It merely has the capacity to sue, much like a corporation or a trust or a probate estate or a guardianship estate, through a fiduciary appointed on its behalf, and is granted legal standing in cases related to it.\n\nIf the river enters into contracts through its guardian, however, for example, to provide irrigation water to a company in exchange for the company ceasing to pollute it, that contract would probably be enforceable by specific performance, at least (the river is probably judgment proof, so a suit for money damages would be futile anyway), in a suit to which the guardian would be made a party and have standing to raise defenses.",

The legal personhood granted to the Whanganui River is best understood through the analogy of a guardian-ward relationship. Like a guardian acting for a ward (such as a minor or someone with dementia), a designated entity or \"guardian\" would act on behalf of the river in legal matters. This arrangement allows for legal standing in cases related to the river's interests, but does not imply that the river itself can be held criminally liable (ruling out option A) or enter into contracts directly (ruling out option B). Option C is incorrect because the river does have legal capacity to be involved in legal matters, albeit through its appointed guardian. This system allows for the protection of the river's interests within the legal framework without attributing human-like agency or liability to the natural entity."

The point is that if anyone enters and then claims to be in a certain employment situation, then they would create a liability by making that claim.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Washington D.C.'s anti\\-discrimination laws currently include political affiliation and source of income. Given that the city is home to a wide arrange of political actors from Congressmen/women to lobbyists for various causes, these laws were enacted so various industries may not refuse service to someone based on political affiliation or making money as a lobbyist for a cause they disagree with. Personally I wouldn't mind seeing this elsewhere in the nation, but I'm not sure if there are any other jurisdiction that does this in the U.S. There is talk about enacting protections against discriminatory protections against service for Uniformed First Responders (typically police) though most incidents I'm aware of this kind of discrimination are employees of fast food restaurants that will receive some public backlash that forces company higher ups to discipline the employee.\n\nCertain chains of restaurants do offer discounts to members of a certain profession. Mission BBQ is very military and first responder friendly and will offer anyone who can show ID backing up their claims discounts on certain days (Military Service \"Birthdays\" and September 11\\. On Memorial Day, they set a table aside (complete with table cloth, candle, dishes, and a single red rose) for those lost in service to the country. Most famously, because their primary food product became so associated, Dunkin' Donuts initially offered free coffee and donuts to cops, giving police their trademark favorite food. This wasn't so much of a promotion as a mutual exchange of services: Cops (especially those working the Graveyard shift) typically enjoy their caffinated and sugary foods for keeping alert, as well as an occasion parking spot to write up reports... Dunkin' Donuts, one of the first chains to run 24/7 service in the U.S. needed some security (especially during the Graveyard shift, when robbers were more likely to cause trouble because of very few witnesses) and found that for the price of a donut and some coffee, they could have the city's finest sitting in their parking lot, sipping coffee and writing reports, for way cheaper than hiring a security service. (This practice was discontinued eventually as police forces saw these gifts as a possible corrupting influence and told officers to pay for their coffee. It wasn't that Dunkin' was bribing cops, so much as it was creating a bad image to the public.)",

According to the information provided, Washington D.C. has anti-discrimination laws that include protections based on political affiliation and source of income. This could potentially apply to situations where businesses attempt to charge different prices based on a customer's employment, especially for government employees or those in politically-affiliated jobs.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that all jurisdictions have such prohibitions. In fact, it suggests that Washington D.C.'s approach is somewhat unique.\n\nAnswer C is false. There is no mention of federal law explicitly allowing such practices. The question actually asks about laws prohibiting this behavior, not permitting it.\n\nAnswer D is also incorrect. While the passage mentions that some businesses offer discounts to military and first responders, it does not state that most states have laws requiring this. These are typically voluntary business practices, not legal requirements."

One does not need to be a US citizen to sue in US courts. Under [28 U.S.C \u00a7 1332](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332) there is an option to sue in federal courts if the matter is between citizens of a state and subjects of a foreign state (unless the foreign subject is a permanent resident of that state). However, the amount has to be over $75,000\\. That probably leaves the matter to the California court: contracts often include clauses about where legal disputes will be settled (there might even be a binding arbitration clause). You would be allowed to file a suit, and the California courts nicely provide an outline of [what you need to do](http://www.courts.ca.gov/9616.htm). You will either need to appear, yourself, to plead your case, or hire an attorney to do so on your behalf. As for [small claims court](http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-smallclaims.htm), you would have to plead the case yourself (attorneys are not allowed).",

The company wants to sue the agency in the United States for $1,500. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their legal options?\n\nA) The Bulgarian company cannot sue in U.S. courts because they are not U.S. citizens.\n\nB) The company can file a lawsuit in federal court regardless of the amount in dispute.\n\nC) The company can file a small claims court case in California, but must appear in person to plead their case.\n\nD) The company must file a class action lawsuit with other victims to pursue legal action in the U.S.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, non-U.S. citizens can sue in U.S. courts. While federal courts are an option for disputes between U.S. citizens and foreign subjects, the amount in dispute must exceed $75,000, which is not the case here. Small claims court in California is a viable option for this dispute, but the company representatives would need to appear in person to plead their case, as attorneys are not allowed in small claims court. A class action lawsuit is not necessary, though it could be an option if there are many victims. Filing in small claims court for the $1,500 is likely the most practical approach given the circumstances."

A group of religious leaders is challenging this ban, claiming it violates their First Amendment rights. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the constitutional standing of Xanadu's ban?\n\nA) The ban is unconstitutional because it infringes on the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which protects religious gatherings from government interference.\n\nB) The ban is constitutional only if it exempts religious gatherings, as the separation of church and state requires special protection for religious activities.\n\nC) The ban is constitutional as long as it applies equally to all gatherings, including both secular and religious ones, and serves a compelling government interest.\n\nD) The ban is unconstitutional unless the state can prove that religious gatherings pose a greater health risk than other types of gatherings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, restrictions on religious gatherings can be constitutional if they satisfy a compelling government interest (such as preventing massive deaths from disease) and apply equally to all gatherings, not just religious ones. The ban in this scenario applies to all gatherings over 10 people, regardless of their nature, and serves the compelling interest of controlling a deadly pandemic. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the Free Exercise Clause does protect religious freedom, it doesn't exempt religious gatherings from generally applicable laws serving a compelling government interest.\n\nAnswer B is actually the opposite of what's constitutionally required. The Establishment Clause prohibits the government from granting special privileges to religions, so exempting only religious gatherings would be unconstitutional.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the government doesn't need to prove that religious gatherings are more dangerous than other gatherings.

Can a workplace for example ask if you are Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, Jehovah's Witness via survey... and then sub\\-questions based on your answers? I want cases and law not yes/no with \"I have seen this\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's sort of a toss\\-up. [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/pre-employment-inquiries-and-religious-affiliation-or-beliefs) says that \"Questions about an applicant's religious affiliation or beliefs (unless the religion is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ)), are generally viewed as non job\\-related and problematic under federal law\". They also state that (excluding positions with religious exemptions, like hiring a Catholic priest) \"Other employers should avoid questions about an applicant's religious affiliation, such as place of worship, days of worship, and religious holidays and should not ask for references from religious leaders, e.g., minister, rabbi, priest, imam, or pastor\". This reflects the standards by which they will make a finding of forbidden religious discrimination.\n\nThe actual statutory law, [42 USC 2000e\\-2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-2) does not prohibit asking questions about religion, instead it says\n\n> (a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u2014 (1\\)\n> to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise\n> to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\n> compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because\n> of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;\n> or (2\\) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants\n> for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n> individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n> his status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color,\n> religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n[29 CFR Part 38 Subpart A](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/subtitle-A/part-38/subpart-A) does not specifically prohibit asking questions. Although many labor\\-law web sites and HR advice firms state that asking questions is illegal, DoL and EEOC do not specifically declare categorical illegality. The fact of asking some question might constitute partial evidence for a finding of religious discrimination. So no court has held that it is flatly illegal for an employer to ask a question about religion.\n\nThe case of [EEOC v. Abercrombie \\& Fitch](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-86_p86b.pdf), which did find discrimination, gives you the required elements for a finding of religious discrimination. There is simply no \"don't ask\" cause of action. Asking might be evidence to support a claim of disparate treatment based on religion. The rule is: \"An employer may not  \n\nmake an applicant\u2019s religious practice, confirmed or otherwise, a factor in employment decisions\".\n\nI have found no cases where [EEOC found illegal discrimination](https://www.eeoc.gov/selected-list-pending-and-resolved-cases-alleging-religious-and-national-origin-discrimination) based exclusively on the fact of asking questions about religion.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employer is conducting a workplace survey that includes questions about employees' religious affiliations and practices. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal status of such inquiries under federal law?\n\nA) Asking any questions about an employee's religion is strictly illegal and constitutes automatic grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.\n\nB) Employers may freely ask questions about religion as long as they do not use the information to make employment decisions.\n\nC) Inquiries about religion are only permissible if they relate to a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) for the specific job.\n\nD) While not explicitly illegal, religious inquiries may be used as evidence to support a claim of religious discrimination if adverse employment actions follow.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate reflection of the current legal landscape regarding workplace inquiries about religion. The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. There is no specific law or court ruling that categorically prohibits employers from asking questions about religion.\n\n2. The EEOC advises against such inquiries, but their guidance is not legally binding.\n\n3. The actual statute (42 USC 2000e-2) prohibits discrimination based on religion in employment decisions, not the act of asking questions itself.\n\n4. Cases like EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch show that discrimination is found when religious practices influence employment decisions, not merely when questions are asked.\n\n5. Asking about religion could be used as evidence in a discrimination case, but it's not automatically illegal on its own.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they overstate the legal restrictions. Option B is incorrect because it understates the potential risks of such inquiries. Option D most accurately captures the nuanced legal position that while such questions are not explicitly illegal, they can contribute to a discrimination claim if coupled with adverse employment actions."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently read about protests blocking an interstate. I feel like ethically ~~no one~~ no (non\\-police) citizen has the right to obstruct my travel (on a public interstate for the sake of protest), therefore I'm interested to know if I personally have any legal route to retaliate against the individuals stopping my travel (exercising their rights at the expense of mine).\n\nJust because I think I should have the right to slowly push through a crowd unlawfully impeding my travel, doesn't make it the law, unfortunately. But that's why we have laws, right? So we can retaliate against people we feel are impeding our freedom in a peaceful manner. My question is simply of whether I have the ability to legally retaliate against the protesters who may have just made me an hour late for an important event by blocking a public freeway.\n\nEdit: Another way to look at it: If a police officer detained me without cause, and there were witnesses and video to verify this, I could sue the police department and win. Why then, can a group of citizens detain me without cause, without also facing legal repercussion?\n\n* I'm curious to know what legal grounds I would have in this situation to travel unobstructed.\n* Can I only call the police and hope they press charges?\n* Can I video the protesters and press charges against each of them, even sue each protester for damages?\n* In other words, is there any way for me to retaliate against the (unlawful) protesters legally and peacefully?\n\n**Note:** Many are responding with something along the lines of \"What if it were an accident? You couldn't press charges on the drivers in an accident for detaining you\". There's a huge difference between being detained by an accident, and a group of people intentionally and unlawfully detaining me on a public freeway. So I really don't understand these responses.\n\n---\n\nMy initial wording to the question seemed to confuse my intentions and lead to alot of \"no, you can't run them over\" rhetoric (which wasn't actually my question at all), so I've edited and simplified the question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **tl;dr**\n\nHitting the pedestrians is a separate crime, even if they shouldn't be there.\n\n**Background**\n\n*On a highway, you might have a legal right of way and therefore a claim against the pedestrians for failing to yield.*\n\nSince the states (and not the federal government) own and operate the interstate highway system, your specific answer depends on the state law. \n\nIn North Carolina, for example, pedestrians walking along or upon a highway have a [statutory duty](http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/trans/wolftrails/documents/wt-ped-laws.pdf) to yield the right of way to all vehicles. So you could probably videotape and press misdemeanor charges against them individually. That said, contacting the police and waiting (or taking an alternate route) is the best recourse.\n\n*Having the right of way (or feeling ethically justified) doesn't allow you to commit an offense like hitting a pedestrian.*\n\nThe fact that the pedestrians aren't supposed to be in your way is of little consolation in the charges you'll face if you injure or kill one. The court will see this as a legal/ethical problem, but one that won't go in your favor.\n\nIn particular, you deliberately directed your vehicle into the crowd with the knowledge that the action might cause harm. One doesn't have to imagine the [Austin Powers steamroller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PrZ-J7D3k) scenario to know that injuries are possible when cars go through crowds. That will pull all of the \"involuntary\"\\-flavored mitigations off the table.\n\nIn particular, driving a car into a crowd might be considered \"an inherently dangerous act or omission, done in such a reckless and wanton manner as to manifest a mind utterly without regard for human life and social duty.\" In the worst case scenario, where someone died as a result, a North Carolina prosecutor might push for [second\\-degree](http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_14/GS_14-17.html) murder (which operates on a \"recklessness\\-plus\" standard and might not be as crazy as it sounds since driving into the crowd is likely reckless, and driving in slowly with them yelling at you to stop could push a jury over the top). In that case, as a defendant, you'd hope your charge could be mitigated down to something like [death by vehicle](http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/statutes/statutelookup.pl?statute=20-141.4) (which is similar to \"vehicular manslaughter\" in other states), and you'd shoot for the misdemeanor version of death by vehicle since you weren't driving under the influence. However, a key element of proving death by vehicle is that you *unintentionally* caused the death\\-\\-\\-and the fact that you deliberately drove into the crowd might ruin your defense. In the case where you just hurt someone, you'd likewise hope to mitigate intentional charges to unintentional ones.\n\n*A claim for false imprisonment is unlikely to succeed.*\n\nFalse imprisonment is called a variety of things\\-\\-\\-like felonious/misdemeanor restraint, unlawful detainment, etc.\\-\\-\\-depending on where you live. To prove it (and generalizing a bit since this varies by state), you typically have to show (1\\) detention or restraint against your will, and (2\\) unlawfulness of the detention or restraint. A big challenge here is that courts often interpret this to mean detention or restraint by exercise of force or threat of force, as in *Harris v. Stanioch*, 150 Wash. 380 (1928\\) for example. The protesters are just in the way, so it's unlikely this would hold up.\n\n*Self defense almost surely won't be a viable excuse.*\n\nThe idea of driving the car slowly through the crowd relies on the notion that you should be able to escape the alleged detention. The escape you're considering in driving through the crowd likely comes at the expense of making contact with members of the crowd. Making unprivileged contacts might be allowable in self defense. However, self defense probably hold up either. Setting aside notions of proportional defense, you have to be defending yourself against something: force or threats of it by the protesters. So if they don't use force, or threaten it, against you, then your defense is going to be really shaky.",

The \"application\" referred to in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) is a formal legal document filed with the Court of Appeals that has jurisdiction over the relevant district court.

The overall result is that the customer has paid $1\\.50 for a bottle of water and a peanut, but because the money was ostensibly exchanged for the peanut, nothing illegal has taken place.\n\nIn fact, the placeholder purchase is not required, because each person could claim that they gave away the money or the item of their own free will, independent of expectation from the other.\n\nI'd like to know if this loophole, regardless of the goods that are forbidden to be sold, has ever been challenged in a court of law and what the outcome was. I don't care too much about jurisdiction but I'd prefer answers from the United States or countries with legal systems descended from English Common Law (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Depends on the law\n------------------\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if this is a contractural restriction on the shop or a local ordinance relating to the festival.

If it\u2019s on sale then this might work if done properly.\n\nIf it is a contractural restriction that the shop freely entered, it is unlikely that this ruse would protect them from a breach of contract suit because the shop is obviously acting in bad faith in a calculated attempt to avoid their obligations.\n\nIf it really is a law restricting sales, then giving it away free would work. However, what the shop is doing is not giving away free water \\- they are bundling a peanut and a bottle of water and selling that. To avoid liability, the shop would need to give the water away for free without selling the peanut to anyone that asked.\n\nAn analogous case related to liquor happened in [new\\-south\\-wales](/questions/tagged/new-south-wales \"show questions tagged 'new-south-wales'\"). All states in Australia require a liquor licence to sell alcohol in most cases, however, providing you comply with responsible service laws, it\u2019s not illegal to give it away to the public.\n\nAs is common, many hairdressers provide their customers with a complementary glass of wine. This is fine in Queensland or Western Australia because those states have specific exemptions for hairdressers, but illegal in NSW.\n\nA salon owner in Sydney was successfully prosecuted for this practice because, when the undercover police officer requested a \u201cfree\u201d glass without a haircut, she was denied. The magistrate concluded that this meant the wine was not, in fact, free and that the salon was therefore selling liquor without a licence. At $11,000 per glass, the salon lost money on the deal.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A music festival organizer is prohibited from selling bottled water to patrons. They decide to sell peanuts for $1.50 each and provide a \"free\" bottle of water with each purchase. Which of the following statements is most likely to be true regarding the legality of this practice?\n\nA) This practice is definitely legal as long as the organizer is willing to give away water for free to anyone who asks, even without purchasing peanuts.\n\nB) This practice is always legal because the money is exchanged for the peanut, not the water.\n\nC) The legality of this practice depends on the specific wording of the prohibition and how it's enforced, but it could potentially be challenged in court.\n\nD) This practice is definitely illegal because it's clearly an attempt to circumvent the prohibition.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of this practice is not straightforward and depends on several factors:\n\n1. The exact wording of the prohibition (whether it's on selling water or supplying water)\n2. Whether the prohibition is a contractual obligation or a legal ordinance\n3. How the transaction is structured and presented\n4. How courts in the relevant jurisdiction have ruled on similar cases\n\nAs seen in the example from New South Wales regarding free wine in hair salons, courts may look at the actual nature of the transaction rather than just its form. If the water is truly not free (i.e., not given without purchase), a court might view this as an attempt to circumvent the prohibition.\n\nTherefore, while this practice might work in some cases, it could potentially be challenged and found illegal in others, making C the most accurate answer."

Improper Use of Flags or Military Emblems, Insignia or Uniforms of the Adversary](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_nz_rule62):\n\n> According to custom, it is permissible for a belligerent warship to use false colours and to disguise her outward appearance in other ways in order to deceive an enemy, provided that prior to going into action the warship shows her true colours. Aircraft are not, however, enentitled to use false markings.\n\nFrom [false flag Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#cite_ref-9)\n\n> In land warfare, such operations are generally deemed acceptable under certain circumstances, such as to deceive enemies, provided the deception is not perfidious and that all such deceptions are discarded before opening fire upon the enemy. Similarly, in naval warfare such a deception is considered permissible, provided the false flag is lowered and the true flag raised before engaging in battle.\n\n**Initial question**: What is the intention of this law, like why is it considered unfair fighting to use false flags (when taking action/open firing already)? **ETA**: By which I mean to ask: Why is it considered unfair/inhumane/inhuman/unethical/immoral fighting to (continue to) use false flags (when taking action/open firing already)?\n\nContext:\n========\n\n1\n\nWhat I understand is that a 'war crime' is something which gives you an unfair advantage in that civilians are affected at the cost of your military progress eg [chemical weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention), [incendiary weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Certain_Conventional_Weapons) (at least in [our world](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/267014/what-are-likely-to-not-be-considered-war-crimes-in-atla-tlok); alternatively see [here](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/234792/what-are-likely-to-not-be-considered-war-crimes-in-a-universe-where-people-can-c) or directly [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QxLB2.jpg)) or well actually directly killing civilians for example.\n\n2\n\nMy intention is to genuinely understand what is inhumane/unfair/unjust about attacking with false flags. There's an answer given below that says\n\n> neither of these groups is afforded protection from the rules of war. Only if you fire under your own flag you get the protections of a POW if you fall into their hands.\n\nBut as Nassim Nicholas Taleb said\n\n> '[Someone saying \"ethics is good for success\" is missing the entire point of ethics.](https://www.facebook.com/nntaleb/posts/someone-saying-ethics-is-good-for-success-is-missing-the-entire-point-of-ethics/10153784942513375/)'\n\nI'm asking like: If there weren't these incentives, then what would be inhumane about doing this?\n\nSo far what I'm seeing is that this so\\-called war crime is not inhumane at all but really just some dumb rule...or at least some kind of 'deal' or 'gamble' like 'Ok fine, you can use false flags to attack, but you don't get this or that if you lose.'\n\n3\n\nAnd then finally I can ask on [SciFi SE](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/266987/is-there-false-flag-war-crime-in-atla) (about [Sokka from ATLA](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83486/did-sokka-commit-the-war-crime-of-false-flag-atla-s01e17)) **not merely** 'Why didn't Sokka follow this rule?' (cheap conventional, [stage 2 of 3 in Lawrence Kohlberg's moral development theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development#Conventional) that causes [reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)) like 'There's no Geneva/UN in ATLA. What are you talking about?') **but really** 'Why did Sokka do this seemingly inhumane thing?' (which would be postconventional, [stage 3 of 3 in moral development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development#Post-conventional)).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To my mind, one of the major goals of the customary laws of war is to try to limit the overall harm caused by a war, especially harm caused to parties other than the military forces of the nations who are actually fighting each other. Obvious examples are prohibitions on attacking civilians, destroying civilian property and infrastructure, neglecting civilian public health, harming prisoners who are incapable of fighting, and so on. I wouldn't say these are about \"fairness\" or any other such abstract ethical principle; they are simply pragmatic. All other things equal, the world is better off if fewer civilians end up dead.\n\nAnd so just as the laws try to avoid collateral damage to *individuals* who are not fighting (civilians, prisoners, injured troops, etc), they likewise try to avoid collateral damage to *nations* who are not fighting (neutrals). Combat under a false flag carries a risk of harm to the nation whose flag is impersonated, as the belligerents may get the wrong idea about who is attacking them.\n\nHere are a couple of scenarios that could occur if false flag combat were considered acceptable:\n\n1. Potsylvania is at war with Grand Fenwick, while Freedonia remains neutral in the conflict. The Potsylvanian ship *Fearless* sights the Fenwickian ship *Goose*, and as a ruse, the *Fearless* runs up a Freedonian flag. The *Goose*, knowing that Freedonia is neutral, assumes the *Fearless* is harmless and lets it approach. When within range, the *Fearless* fires at the *Goose*, while still flying the Freedonian flag. The *Goose* reports back to its government that they have been attacked by a Freedonian vessel. The Fenwickian government considers this a hostile act, declares war on Freedonia, and launches an immediate retaliatory invasion of Freedonian territory. Now Freedonia has been brought into the war despite no party actually having anything against them. This is not desirable.\n2. Same scenario, but instead of raising a Freedonian flag, the *Fearless* runs up a Fenwickian flag. The *Goose* knows the flag must be fake, as no genuine Fenwickian vessel would attack them, but they don't know what nation the *Fearless* actually does belong to. They faintly hear the captain of the *Fearless* shouting orders in Potsylvanian, but he has a Freedonian accent and they think he's speaking in Freedonian. They report to their government that a Freedonian vessel has attacked them, and Grand Fenwick again declares war on Freedonia.\n\nNote that using a false flag when *not* attacking doesn't carry the same risks, which is why it is not included in the prohibition. Suppose that the *Fearless* doesn't plan to attack the *Goose*, but simply wants to avoid being attacked so they can get away. If their ruse of flying a Freedonian flag is successful, then the *Goose* simply thinks they saw a neutral Freedonian vessel going about its business, and Grand Fenwick does not get the idea that Freedonia is doing anything aggressive. And if it's unsuccessful, then the *Goose* must have figured out that the *Fearless* is not Freedonian at all, but instead Potsylvanian, and so likewise Freedonia does not come under suspicion.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why using false flags during combat is prohibited by the laws of war, while using false flags for deception before combat is generally allowed?\n\nA) It gives an unfair military advantage to the side using false flags\nB) It violates the honor code between warring nations\nC) It risks inadvertently bringing neutral parties into the conflict\nD) It makes it impossible to identify prisoners of war\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is C. The primary reason for prohibiting false flag use during actual combat, while allowing it for deception beforehand, is to prevent accidentally drawing neutral nations into the conflict. As explained in the passage, if a ship attacks while flying a false flag of a neutral nation, it could lead to the attacked nation mistakenly believing that the neutral nation has committed an act of war against them. This could result in retaliation against an innocent party and unnecessarily expand the conflict.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while false flags might provide a tactical advantage, this isn't the main reason for the prohibition. The laws of war often allow for tactical advantages as long as they don't cause undue harm or expand the conflict.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because although honor and fair play are sometimes considerations in the laws of war, they are not the primary motivation for this particular rule. The focus is on practical consequences rather than abstract principles.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the use of false flags might complicate the identification of combatants, this isn't the main reason for the prohibition. The rule specifically allows for false flag use up until the point of attack, suggesting that identification of forces isn't the key issue."

The one-year lease option with a 10% increase is clearly within legal limits. The month-to-month option, while representing a larger increase, is presented as an alternative choice and does not invalidate the legal notice for the 10% increase.

Strict liability of an employer or principal for acts of an employee or agent, or by one general partner for another one, or of an insurer or surety for someone insured or guaranteed.\n2.

Shares held in nominee form all called \"[street name securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_name_securities)\" in the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nOwnership of mortgages sold in the secondary market in the U.S. is handled similarly. The original lender typically transfers nominal status as holder of the note obligation to [MERS](https://www.mersinc.org/products-services/mers-system/faq), a nominee firm, that in turn is held by a trust that owns a pool of mortgages called a mortgage backed security, that is in turn owned by secondary market investors through brokerage account trusts and often through personal trusts or a charitable pooled trust for the benefit of ultimate beneficial owner charities. See [here](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/secondary-mortgage-market/).\n\nCommodities such as gold are often traded this way as well, either in the system above and under a parallel system of negotiable warehouse receipts.\n\nWhile the legal environment in the U.K. for securities ownership is not identical, the basic economic reality of multiple layers of indirect ownership is the norm there as well.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company issues shares that are held in a chain of trusts. Which of the following most accurately describes the ownership structure of these shares?\n\nA) The company directly issues shares to individual investors who have full legal and beneficial ownership.\n\nB) A nominee company holds the share certificates, which are then held by a brokerage for its customers, who may in turn hold their interests through personal trusts.\n\nC) The shares are held directly by a single trust, which distributes benefits equally to all beneficiaries.\n\nD) Each investor holds their own physical share certificate, eliminating the need for any intermediaries.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B correctly describes the typical chain of beneficial interests for publicly traded securities. The share certificates are usually held by a nominee company, then by a brokerage for its customers, and these interests may be further held in personal trusts. This multi-layered structure is common in both the UK and US markets, allowing for efficient trading and management of securities while separating legal and beneficial ownership. Options A and D describe direct ownership models which are not typical for most publicly traded securities. Option C oversimplifies the ownership structure and doesn't reflect the multiple layers of trusts and intermediaries commonly involved."

According to the information provided, it is routine for someone to grant Power of Attorney to an individual residing in a different state. In this case, John in Florida can indeed grant POA to Sarah in North Carolina. \n\nThe answer suggests that including an express choice of law clause stating that Florida law applies would be advisable.

Abortion is one such topic. A person's view of an abortionist is very unlikely to be influenced by the ensuing legislation. To people who oppose abortion, abortionists are equally repugnant regardless of whether the act of aborting additionally constitutes a violation of some statute.

Meng is not charged with \"violating an embargo\" but with defrauding U.S. financial institutions. It may be easier to report that the \"crime\" is violating sanctions but it's a little more nuanced. Meng is charged with defrauding U.S. financial institutions in order to avoid sanctions.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n> The U.S. authorities allege Meng committed fraud by telling an HSBC executive her company was in compliance with U.S. sanctions against Iran limiting communication technology. The meeting took place in 2013, but the location was not revealed.\n\nHSBC is based in London with operations in the United States.\n\nJoanna Chiu, the Star reporter who followed the bail hearing, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/joannachiu/status/1071145156181553152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1071145156181553152&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2018%2F12%2F7%2F18131188%2Fhuawei-cfo-fraud-bail-defense-bail-us-canada):\n\n> US banks became concerned about the relationship between Huawei and subsidiary SkyCom.

As a result of those claims, banks in the U.S. cleared financial transactions for Huawei.\n\nThe nexus between Meng, Huawei, SkyCom and U.S. law is Meng making claims to HSBC that Huawei is not related to SkyCom inducing U.S. based financial institutions to unknowingly engage in transactions that violated sanctions with Iran.

Meng Wanzhou was arrested not for directly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran, but for allegedly defrauding U.S. financial institutions. She is accused of misrepresenting Huawei's relationship with its subsidiary SkyCom to HSBC, claiming they were separate entities when they were not. This misrepresentation allegedly led U.S. banks to unknowingly clear financial transactions for Huawei that may have violated sanctions against Iran.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Meng is not directly charged with violating sanctions, but with fraud related to avoiding sanctions.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because simply being a CFO of a Chinese company doing business with Iran is not the basis for her arrest. The issue is the alleged fraud, not her position or the company's general dealings.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the alleged fraudulent activities did not necessarily occur on U.S. soil.

Any legal charge of treason is treason against the country. Article III, Section 3, Clause 1 of the US constitution reads:\n\n> Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\n\nSee also [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2381 \\- Treason](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) which reads:\n\n> Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.\n\nIt is hard to see how making war on the United States, or helping an open enemy do so, could \"save the nation\" and in the absence of either of these, there is no treason, although other charges might possibly apply.\n\nThe [interactive Constitution site](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/article-iii/clauses/39) from the National Constitutions Center says about this provision of the Constitution:\n\n> Treason is a unique offense in our constitutional order\u2014the only crime expressly defined by the Constitution, and applying only to Americans who have betrayed the allegiance they are presumed to owe the United States. While the Constitution\u2019s Framers shared the centuries\\-old view that all citizens owed a duty of loyalty to their home nation, they included the Treason Clause not so much to underscore the seriousness of such a betrayal, but to guard against the historic use of treason prosecutions by repressive governments to silence otherwise legitimate political opposition. Debate surrounding the Clause at the Constitutional Convention thus focused on ways to narrowly define the offense, and to protect against false or flimsy prosecutions.\n> \n> \n> The Constitution specifically identifies what constitutes treason against the United States and, importantly, limits the offense of treason to only two types of conduct: (1\\) \u201clevying war\u201d against the United States; or (2\\) \u201cadhering to \\[the] enemies \\[of the United States], giving them aid and comfort.\u201d Although there have not been many treason prosecutions in American history\u2014indeed, only one person has been indicted for treason since 1954\u2014the Supreme Court has had occasion to further define what each type of treason entails.\n\n> The offense of \u201clevying war\u201d against the United States was interpreted narrowly in *Ex parte Bollman \\& Swarthout* (1807\\), a case stemming from the infamous alleged plot led by former Vice President Aaron Burr to overthrow the American government in New Orleans. The Supreme Court dismissed charges of treason that had been brought against two of Burr\u2019s associates\u2014Bollman and Swarthout\u2014on the grounds that their alleged conduct did not constitute levying war against the United States within the meaning of the Treason Clause. It was not enough, Chief Justice John Marshall\u2019s opinion emphasized, merely to conspire \u201cto subvert by force the government of our country\u201d by recruiting troops, procuring maps, and drawing up plans. Conspiring to levy war was distinct from actually levying war. Rather, a person could be convicted of treason for levying war only if there was an \u201cactual assemblage of men for the purpose of executing a treasonable design.\u201d In so holding, the Court sharply confined the scope of the offense of treason by levying war against the United States.\n\n> The Court construed the other treason offense authorized by the Constitution similarly narrowly in *Cramer v. United States* (1945\\). That case involved another infamous incident in American history: the Nazi Saboteur Affair. Cramer was prosecuted for treason for allegedly helping German soldiers who had surreptitiously infiltrated American soil during World War II. In reviewing Cramer\u2019s treason conviction, the Court explained that a person could be convicted of treason only if he or she adhered to an enemy and gave that enemy \u201caid and comfort.\u201d As the Court explained:\n> \n> \n> \n> > A citizen intellectually or emotionally may favor the enemy and harbor sympathies or convictions disloyal to this country\u2019s policy or interest, but, so long as he commits no act of aid and comfort to the enemy, there is no treason. On the other hand, a citizen may take actions which do aid and comfort the enemy\u2014making a speech critical of the government or opposing its measures, profiteering, striking in defense plants or essential work, and the hundred other things which impair our cohesion and diminish our strength\u2014but if there is no adherence to the enemy in this, if there is no intent to betray, there is no treason.\n> \n> \n> In other words, the Constitution requires both concrete action and an intent to betray the nation before a citizen can be convicted of treason; expressing traitorous thoughts or intentions alone does not suffice.",

This approach:\n\n1. Fulfills the employee's duty to protect the company's interests\n2. Helps mitigate potential legal and financial risks for the company\n3. Protects the employee from potential liability or job loss that could result from knowingly allowing copyright infringement to continue\n4. Allows management to take appropriate action, such as stopping the use of infringing code or ensuring proper licensing\n5. Demonstrates the employee's ethical behavior and commitment to legal compliance\n\nOptions A and B could potentially implicate the employee in the copyright infringement by not reporting it, while option D bypasses proper channels and may not adequately address the legal and business risks involved."

But one or more people on the jury is/are of the same party as that politician and thinks they did nothing wrong or they don't want them to go to prison. That person votes not guilty or asks for jury nullification regardless of if the more nonpartisan jurors agree the person is guilty.\n\nIn the United States, is such a scenario plausible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, such a scenario is plausible, and there are some cases where it has probably happened. But since juries do not normally give reasons for their votes, it is hard to establish when it has and when it has not happened, and I have seen no statistics on such occurrences.\n\nBy the way, \"Jury Nullification\" is simply when one or more jury members vote in a particular way because of something other than the law and evidence as presented in the trial. Most often the term is used when a jury votes to acquit because they dislike or disapprove of the law involved. For example, in the 1850s a number of people accused of violating the US Fugitive Slave Law by harboring runaway slaves were acquitted, reputedly because juries who disliked the law (quite unpopular in many northern states) no matter what the evidence. Later, during Prohibition, some people charged with possessing or selling alcohol were acquitted, reputedly by juries who disapproved of Prohibition. In both cases, it is hard to get authoritative sources that specific cases were actual instances of jury nullification.\n\nAnyway, a juror need not \"ask\" for jury nullification, that juror just votes to acquit. A jury that votes to acquit (or convict) because of political or personal views about the accused might be said to be \"biased\" but I am not sure if that would be described as \"jury nullification\".",

This can result in acquittals (or theoretically convictions) that go against what a strict interpretation of the law and evidence would suggest. It's important to note that jurors don't formally \"ask\" for nullification; they simply vote according to their conscience. While potentially controversial, jury nullification is a de facto power of juries in the U.S. legal system. Options A and D are incorrect as they mischaracterize the nature and legality of jury nullification. Option B is incorrect because there is no formal process for requesting nullification; it's an implicit power exercised through voting."

You are not allowed to make any copy of other people's stuff without permission. The TOS is how you get permission. First, the author uploads his material to You Tube, because he has an account and the TOS associated with the account specifies the license that he grants to You Tube and the world \u2013 same thing with Stack Exchange. The TOS says (roughly) \"when you upload stuff, you give permission for others to access your stuff using the You Tube interface\". Content\\-consumers likewise are allowed to stream content using their interface, but not generally download. (The license terms changes over time \u2013 previously there were more license types). Specifically,\n\n> You are not allowed to:\n> \n> \n> access, reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display,\n> sell, license, alter, modify or otherwise use any part of the Service\n> or any Content except: (a) as expressly authorized by the Service; or\n> (b) with prior written permission from YouTube and, if applicable, the\n> respective rights holders;\n\nand they don't expressly authorize ordinary download, you have to use their interface.\n\nYou might also directly contact the author of the work in question and negotiate a deal where you can directly acquire a license from the rights\\-owner. But if you want to access the material via You Tube, you have to do it in a way that is permitted, and You Tube says that you're not permitted to download.

According to the Local Government Finance Act 1992, council tax liability is calculated on a daily basis. The single person discount applies only on days when there is one resident. However, residency is determined by whether an individual has their \"sole or main residence\" in the dwelling, not just where they sleep. In this case, Bob's residency status would need to be assessed based on various factors, not just his sleeping arrangement. As Bob stays at Alice's place for part of the week, Alice would likely be entitled to the single person discount on the days Bob is not considered a resident, resulting in a partial discount calculated daily.

The general law is that\n\n> A person shall not drive a vehicle on a [highway](https://law.justia.com/codes/south-carolina/2016/title-56/chapter-5/section-56-5-430/) at a speed greater\n>  than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having regard\n>  to the actual and potential hazards then existing. Speed must be so\n>  controlled to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle, or other\n>  conveyance on or entering the highway in compliance with legal\n>  requirements and the duty of a person to use care.\n\nThere are various maximum lawful speeds that may not be exceeded, for example 70 on the interstate, or 30 in an \"urban district\". Local jurisdictions are authorized to modify the limits, and in [Charleston](https://library.municode.com/sc/charleston/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CICO_CH19MOVETR_ARTVIIOPVEGE_DIV3SPRE) the maximum is generally 25\\. However, a posted limit can also be set, so if the sign says 20, the limit is 20\\. Note though that state law refers to highways, defined thusly:\n\n> The entire width between boundary lines of every way publicly\n>  maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public for\n>  purposes of vehicular travel is a \"street\" or \"highway.\"\n\nA parking lot is not for the purpose of travel, so one cannot conclude that highway speed limits apply. [The law](https://law.justia.com/codes/south-carolina/2016/title-56/chapter-5/section-56-5-810/) also allows owners of private property to establish speed limits on their property.\n\nArticle 17 sets forth the right\\-of\\-way laws, which take into consideration whether the vehicle is turning left (yield), who gets there first (yield to the right if they arrive at about the same time), plus issues of being at an intersection, having a stop line, yield sign etc. It's impossible for us to guess what the factual circumstances are here.

There is no statutory speed limit for parking lots in South Carolina.\n2. The general rule is to drive at a speed that is \"reasonable and prudent\" under the conditions.\n3. Parking lots are not considered \"highways\" under state law, so standard speed limits do not automatically apply.\n4. Property owners can establish their own speed limits for private property like parking lots.\n5.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the citizen's right to record the interaction?\n\nA) The citizen can freely record both video and audio of the interaction without informing the police officer.\n\nB) The citizen can record video of the interaction but must obtain permission from the police officer to record audio.\n\nC) The citizen can record video of the interaction and can record audio if they are a party to the conversation, without needing explicit permission.\n\nD) The citizen is prohibited from recording either video or audio of the interaction with the police officer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the information provided specifically mentions New South Wales law, it suggests that the law is likely similar in Victoria. In New South Wales, it is legal to film police in public spaces. However, audio recording has more restrictions. You must either be a party to the conversation or have permission from all participants to record audio. Therefore, in this scenario, the citizen can record video freely as it's a public space, and can record audio of the conversation they are directly involved in with the police officer without needing explicit permission. Option C best reflects this balance of rights and restrictions."

Everything with that case has seemingly been complete and they've sent the check for the amount that the arbitrator awarded.\n\nHowever, their Customer Service Agreement has a clause that may result in them paying an increased amount (about 5x the awarded amount). There's definitely back\\-and\\-forth between us on whether they need to pay that or not. The arbitration service is CC'd on all the emails, but they're passive since the clause doesn't seem to involve *them* changing the reward amount.\n\nI've had the check for about a week now and I'm considering cashing it to cover some financial obligations coming up in the next week or so. I'm here to try and understand what limitations may pop up if I do decide to cash the check.\n\n**Questions:** \n\n* If I cash the check, will I ruin my opportunity to keep pursuing them for the increased amount?\n* Is there any merit to me sending them an email stating that I'll be cashing the check due to financial needs, but that the act of me doing that is not settling for the amount they paid (if that even has any legal ground)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Cashing the cheque does not relieve them of any other liabilities they may have.\n\nHowever, they almost certainly don't have any.

Once arbitration has been completed and a decision reached, the matter is generally considered closed, assuming the arbitration was conducted in accordance with the law. Attempting to reopen the case or argue for additional amounts based on information that should have been presented during the arbitration is likely to be viewed as an abuse of process. The law typically does not allow for the same dispute to be argued multiple times. While cashing the check doesn't automatically forfeit rights (ruling out A), and sending an email doesn't have special legal standing (ruling out B), these actions are largely irrelevant given the finality of the arbitration decision. The arbitration service cannot typically be compelled to reconsider their decision based on new information presented after the fact (ruling out D)."

However, it's important to note that while the copyright on the original work may have expired, other intellectual property rights may still be in effect. \n\nSpecifically, characters or other elements from the original work might be protected by trademark law, even if the work itself is in the public domain.

Can an employment contract stipulate that the 2 weeks are mandatory?\n\nI'm curious how it would be enforced in practice. What's stopping someone from calling in sick for 2 weeks? Or claiming their new job requires them to work certain hours and the old one must cater to a different schedule?\n\nIs it that if the company suffers damages because a person quit without enough notice the company could sue? Would this really be needed to be explicitly written into the contract? Would the company have to prove that they suffered damages that they otherwise wouldn't have if the employee continued his job for 2 weeks?\n\nEDIT: this is assuming the job doesn't have a high level of responsibility, for example it's working in a retail store and not taking care of young children who require it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While there is no statutory law in British Columbia that requires that employees give notice of resignation, employees can be contractually obligated to give notice and even absent a contractual requirement there is a common law obligation in Canada that employees give notice. There's no fixed two week notice requirement, the amount of notice required depends on the circumstances. It would be necessary for an employer to prove damages that resulted from an employee quitting without giving notice or sufficient notice.\n\nAn example of this would be [Consbec v Peter Walker](https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2014/2014bcsc2070/2014bcsc2070.pdf) where the defendant was determined to have failed to give reasonable notice of his resignation:\n\n> \\[212] Peter was obliged to provide Consbec with notice of his resignation. He did not give notice.\n> \n> \n> ### The Law\n> \n> \n> \\[213] The purpose of notice is to provide time for the employer to make\n> arrangements to have the work that the departing employee looked after by others,\n> or to find another employee.\n\nHowever [on appeal (2016 BCCA 114\\)](https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2016/2016bcca114/2016bcca114.html) the BC Court of Appeal determined that Consbec hadn't proven any damages had occurred as a result, so no damages were awarded:\n\n> \\[82] Although Consbec validly incurred costs and expenses of $5,875 as a result of Peter\u2019s failure to give one month\u2019s notice, it also saved $6,083 by not having to pay Peter\u2019s salary during that period (i.e., $73,000/12\\). Accordingly, it suffered no damages as a result of Peter\u2019s failure to give notice.\n\nIn many ways having a notice period specified in a contract is a much better option than ultimately leaving it up to a court decide. There seems to be very little precedent for this, especially for non\\-fiduciary employees. In Consbec the trial judge opted not to make a determination of what notice period was required in the case, something the appeal court determined was an error. The appeal court determined that a one month notice period was reasonable, but didn't explain how it came to this determination.\n\nOn the other hand, lawsuits like these a very rare for low ranking employees with little or no authority. As in the Consbec case, it would be hard for an employer prove damages. If Consbec hadn't been seeking large damages on other claims it's unlikely it would've brought a lawsuit.\n\n---\n\nSomeone who tried to falsely claim to be sick in order to avoid having to work their remaining notice period would likely at minimum owe their employer the same damages as if they had failed to give notice. If the sick time is paid and/or includes benefits they'd have to pay back or compensate the the employer for these wages and benefits. In addition, because they're still employed, they still owe a duty of loyalty to their employers that former employees do not, and so could face additional damages for doing things like working for a competitor.\n\nSomeone who started work at another job couldn't use this as an excuse to avoid working during the required notice period. The person would have meet their obligations to both employers and both employers would be entitled to damages for the employee failing to do so. Again, the employee could face additional damages than those caused by their failure to work.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee at a retail store in British Columbia decides to quit their job. Their employment contract stipulates a mandatory 2-week notice period. The employee informs their employer they are quitting effective immediately, citing that their new job requires them to start right away. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The employee cannot be held liable for any damages, as the 2-week notice period is merely customary and not legally enforceable.\n\nB) The employer can automatically deduct two weeks' pay from the employee's final paycheck as compensation for the breach of contract.\n\nC) The employer could potentially sue the employee for damages, but would need to prove that actual losses occurred due to the lack of notice.\n\nD) The employee is legally obligated to work the 2-week notice period regardless of their new job's requirements, or face criminal charges.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While employment contracts can stipulate mandatory notice periods, enforcing them is not straightforward. As seen in the Consbec v Peter Walker case, employers can potentially sue for damages resulting from an employee's failure to provide adequate notice. However, the key point is that the employer must prove that actual damages occurred as a result of the employee's actions. The employer cannot automatically deduct pay or force the employee to work, and the employee won't face criminal charges. The situation is treated as a civil matter, where the employer would need to demonstrate tangible losses to be awarded any compensation. Options A and B are incorrect because they misstate the legal standing of notice periods and the employer's rights. Option D is incorrect because it overstates the consequences and ignores the civil nature of the issue."

When, if ever, would calling a black person the N\\-word not be covered under free speech? I'm guessing it varies from state to state, but I'm not certain.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The spectrum of \"illegal\" is broad. One way in which racial epithets are (indirectly) illegal is via anti\\-discrimination laws, indeed labeled [\"harassment\"](https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment) by the EEOC\n\n> Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color,\n> religion, sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, or\n> pregnancy), national origin, older age (beginning at age 40\\),\n> disability, or genetic information (including family medical history).\n> Harassment becomes unlawful where 1\\) enduring the offensive conduct\n> becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2\\) the conduct is\n> severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a\n> reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.\n> Anti\\-discrimination laws also prohibit harassment against individuals\n> in retaliation for filing a discrimination charge, testifying, or\n> participating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit\n> under these laws; or opposing employment practices that they\n> reasonably believe discriminate against individuals, in violation of\n> these laws.\n\nIf an employer tolerates racial epithets, they are likely to be the target of a harassment lawsuit. There is no limit on who utters the epithet, thus a customer can be the trigger for a suit. In cases not involving supervisory employees, liability arises if the employer \"knew, or should have known about the harassment and failed to take prompt and appropriate corrective action\". Analogously, racial epithets in educational institutions are actionable. Framed in terms of a random epithet by a non\\-employee or campus visitor (where the institution has minimal leverage over the offender), the institution must act, when it becomes aware of such circumstances arising, and cannot just say \"What can *we* do??\".\n\nA second (remote) possibility is through the [fighting words doctrine](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/959/fighting-words), that the government can limit speech that is \"likely to incite immediate violence or retaliation by the recipients of the words\". This arose initially in [Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/315/568/) \u2013 one of the holdings was that\n\n> The Court notices judicially that the appellations \"damned racketeer\"\n> and \"damned Fascist\" are epithets likely to provoke the average person\n> to retaliation, and thereby cause a breach of the peace.\n\nThere have been numerous refinements of the doctrine over the decades, so the mere utterance of a racial epithet would not run afoul of properly\\-restrained \"breach of peace\" laws. One of the two most\\-relevant current opinions is [Brandenburg v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/), 395 U.S. 444, where the court held that the government cannot\n\n> forbid advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where\n> such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless\n> action and is likely to incite or produce such action\n\nbut uttering an epithet is not advocacy of force or law violation. The second is [R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/377/), 505 US 377 where defendant was charged with violating an ordinance that\n\n> prohibits the display of a symbol which one knows or has reason to\n> know \"arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of\n> race, color, creed, religion or gender\"\n\nSCOTUS ruled that \"the First Amendment does not permit a state to use content discrimination to achieve a compelling interest *if it is not necessary to achieve that interest*\" (emphasis added), holding that\n\n> A few limited categories of speech, such as obscenity, defamation, and\n> fighting words, may be regulated because of their constitutionally\n> proscribable content. However, these categories are not entirely\n> invisible to the Constitution, and government may not regulate them\n> based on hostility, or favoritism, towards a nonproscribable message\n> they contain. Thus the regulation of \"fighting words\" may not be based\n> on nonproscribable content. It may, however, be underinclusive,\n> addressing some offensive instances and leaving other, equally\n> offensive, ones alone, so long as the selective proscription is not\n> based on content, or there is no realistic possibility that regulation\n> of ideas is afoot.\n\nA further holding is that the law is\n\n> is facially unconstitutional because it imposes special prohibitions\n> on those speakers who express views on the disfavored subjects of\n> \"race, color, creed, religion or gender.\" At the same time, it permits\n> displays containing abusive invective if they are not addressed to\n> those topics. Moreover, in its practical operation the ordinance goes\n> beyond mere content, to actual viewpoint, discrimination.\n\nThe court has not clearly identified a context in which a law against a racial epithet would be constitutional, they have simply identified other bars that would have to be cleared for such a law to be permissible. No utterance, devoid of context, is illegal, so to discover where such an utterance could be part of a prosecutions, we would need a lot of specific context in the hypothetical.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, under what circumstances could the use of a racial slur potentially be considered illegal?\n\nA) Any use of a racial slur is always illegal under federal law\nB) Use of a racial slur is protected speech in all circumstances due to the First Amendment\nC) Use of a racial slur in the workplace that creates a hostile environment could be considered illegal harassment\nD) Use of a racial slur is only illegal if it directly causes physical harm to someone\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because there is no blanket federal law making all use of racial slurs illegal. \nB is incorrect because while free speech is protected, there are some limitations.\nC is correct. As per the EEOC guidelines, harassment based on race that creates a hostile work environment can be considered illegal under anti-discrimination laws.\nD is incorrect because physical harm is not a requirement for speech to potentially be illegal in cases of workplace harassment.\n\nThe key is that context matters greatly. In a workplace setting, persistent use of racial slurs that creates a hostile environment could violate anti-discrimination laws. However, casual use of slurs, while offensive, is generally protected speech outside of specific contexts like employment or education where anti-discrimination protections apply."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small game development company wants to create a game similar to an existing popular title. What is the most legally appropriate and ethical approach for the company to potentially access or use code from the existing game?\n\nA) Reverse engineer the existing game's code without permission\nB) Use the existing game's code without informing the original developers\nC) Formally request permission from the original game developers, potentially involving legal counsel\nD) Create a modified copy of the existing game and claim it as fair use\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most legally appropriate and ethical approach is to formally request permission from the original game developers, potentially involving legal counsel (option C). This aligns with the advice given in the top answer, which states \"You ask permission, preferably with legal counsel to handle the details.\" \n\nOption A (reverse engineering) could potentially violate copyright laws and end-user license agreements. Option B (using code without permission) is illegal and unethical. Option D (creating a modified copy and claiming fair use) is likely to be considered copyright infringement and does not align with the proper procedures outlined in the answer.\n\nThe correct approach respects intellectual property rights, opens the possibility for collaboration, and protects the new company from potential legal issues. However, as noted in the answer, it's important to be aware that such requests are often unlikely to receive a positive response, especially from competitors."
