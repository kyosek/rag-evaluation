Since obtaining a patent required that applicants swear an oath of citizenship, enslaved persons could not apply for patents.\n\nAccodring to H.E. Baker (\"[one of the most useful men in Washington](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Twentieth_Century_Negro_Literature/39R1AAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA398-IA2&printsec=frontcover)\", the Second Assistant Examiner at the Patent Office in the 1880s, valedictorian of his law class and postgraduate course, and a black man) in \"[The Negro as an Inventor](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Twentieth_Century_Negro_Literature/39R1AAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA400&printsec=frontcover)\":\n\n> In law, a patent is a contract between the government and the inventor or his assignees. **The slave, although the inventor, could not under the law be a party to a contract, and therefore could not secure the patent himself.**\n\nBaker further states that the government had a theory that \"a slave could not take out a patent for his invention\". (p400\\).\n\n**Generally, slave owners could not patent inventions of their slaves.** There were some exceptions made in the Confederacy's patent laws.\n\nBelow is a copy/paste of selections from \"[Invention of a Slave](https://lawreview.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Q-Frye-w-change.pdf)\" by Frye:\n\n> The antebellum Patent Act was amended and rewritten several times. After 1793, it included a \u201cPatent Oath,\u201d which eventually required patent applicants to swear to be the \u201coriginal\u201d inventor of the claimed invention and to their country of citizenship.This oath effectively precluded slave owners from patenting the inventions of their slaves. Additionally, it limited patents to \u201ccitizens of the United States.\n\n...\n\n> On June 10, 1858, the Attorney General issued an opinion titled Invention of a Slave, concluding that a slave owner could not patent a machine invented by his slave, because neither the slave owner nor his slave could take the required patent oath. The slave owner could not swear to be the inventor, and the slave could not take an oath at all. The Patent Office denied at least two patent applications filed by slave owners, one of which was filed by Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, who later became the President of the Confederate States of America. But it also denied at least one patent application filed by a free African\\-American inventor, because African\\-Americans could not be citizens of the United States under Dred Scott.\n\n...\n\n> Slave owners unsuccessfully tried to amend the Patent Act to enable slave owners to patent the inventions of their slaves, which the Patent Act of the Confederate States of America explicitly permitted. By contrast, abolitionists successfully convinced the Attorney General \\[in 1862] to issue an opinion concluding that free African\\-Americans were citizens of the United States, entitled to patent their inventions, among other things.\n\nHowever, before Dred Scott, free African Americans could receive patents.\n\n> The first known \\[free] African\\-American inventor to receive a patent was Thomas Jennings, who patented a method of \u201cdry scouring\u201d clothing in 1821\\.\n\n> But there were also many enslaved antebellum African\\-American inventors who could not patent their inventions, or own property of any kind. Some slave owners probably surreptitiously patented the inventions of their slaves. At least apocryphally, Eli Whitney\u2019s cotton gin was actually invented by a slave named Sam. Likewise, Cyrus McCormack\u2019s mechanical reaper is often attributed to a slave named Jo Anderson\n\n---\n\nSome further reading:\n\"[Race and Selective Legal Memory: Reflections on *Invention of a Slave*](https://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Swanson-Race_and_Selective_Legal_Memory.pdf)\" by Professor Kara W.

Enslaved individuals could not patent their inventions in the antebellum United States for two primary reasons:\n\n1. They could not swear the required citizenship oath that was part of the patent application process.\n2. As slaves, they lacked the legal standing to enter into contracts, which was necessary for patent agreements.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because enslaved individuals did not have intellectual property rights separate from their status as slaves.\n\nAnswer B is also incorrect. While slave owners attempted to patent their slaves' inventions, this was generally not allowed. The Attorney General's 1858 opinion \"Invention of a Slave\" specifically concluded that slave owners could not patent machines invented by their slaves.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the Patent Office did not make exceptions for enslaved individuals.

According to the documentation, while judges cannot outright contradict or disregard a clearly written statute (which would violate the principle of parliamentary supremacy), they do have some flexibility in interpreting the wording of laws.

The camera will be placed above the front door. Our front door is facing a garden entrance, and so to get to the front door, you must enter via a garden gate which is directly in front (maybe two or three metres) of the front door. The gate is an iron gate and so you can see a very small portion of the street outside if you look from the front door. So in short, the camera will see people coming in through the garden gate as they approach the front door, and may see people passing by the garden gate on the street.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [This article](https://wolford-wayne.com/can-your-landlord-spy-on-you-surveillance-rules-explained/) basically says \"it depends\":\n\n* If it is genuinely used to improve tenant safety then that is OK, but if it is used to track your private life then that is not acceptable.\n* Cameras that cover communal areas used by several properties are generally acceptable, but cameras covering individual properties are much less so. It sounds like this falls into the latter category.\n\nAssuming you haven't got the camera yet, I suggest you write to the Landlord asking for a written justification of the cameras, and a policy for the use of the camera. E.g. it will only be viewed if an incident is reported. Once you have the justification you can then look for inconsistencies (e.g. if they aren't planning to snoop at random times, how are they going to notice someone up to no good? And how would they tell?)\n\nYou could also just say \"no\". The installation of this camera probably counts as a material variation of the rental agreement.\n\nYou could also propose a compromise: you will install the camera, but only provide footage as you see fit rather than allowing your landlord to view the camera at any time.\n\nCCTV installations are covered by the GDPR, so you should ask your landlord for the [associated paperwork](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/does-your-use-of-cctv-comply-with-the-gdpr). Amongst other things they will need to state how long they want to keep the footage and provide a justification for that. \"We might want to re\\-run it\" is not a justification.\n\nHaving all this stuff written down will help if you ever suspect he is abusing the footage.\n\n**Edit** Another thought: does the landlord own other properties?

By requesting a written justification, usage policy, and GDPR paperwork, the tenant is taking a proactive approach to understand the landlord's intentions and ensure compliance with data protection laws. This allows for a more informed decision and potentially opens up a dialogue for compromise or alternatives. It also creates a paper trail that can be useful if any issues arise in the future.

The original lease likely holds the tenants jointly and severally liable, meaning the landlord can pursue any or all tenants for the full amount owed. By creating individual addendums with different terms, the landlord may inadvertently prejudice their right to hold tenants severally liable, as the tenants did not collectively agree to these new terms. This approach could create complications if issues arise later, such as damages or unpaid rent. A safer legal approach would be to terminate the original lease with all parties' agreement, contingent on each tenant entering into a new, separate agreement with the landlord."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/62370/do-changing-social-norms-change-the-definition-of-defamation", "docs_id": 62370, "title": "Do changing social norms change the definition of &quot;defamation?&quot;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: One hundred years ago, if you said that \"Miss X is not a virgin,\" when in fact she was, that would be grounds for a defamation suit.

This is long\\-standing law ([Tonini v. Cevasco (1896\\)](https://cite.case.law/cal/114/266/) 114 Cal. 266\\), which makes it difficult to erode in lieu of a change in statutory language (as in the case of the California Civil Code, amended in 1948\\).\n[Barnes\\-Hind v.

As a rule of thumb, your legal risks come from your actions.

(Admiralty law also applies to boats on the \"navigable waters\" of the United States such as the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.) It has its roots in a mix of customary international law, treaties related to the law of the sea, and domestic statutes. It is closer in some respects to the law of civil law countries than of common law countries, although it is distinct from both.\n\nIn the U.S., admiralty law is part of federal court jurisdiction and the U.S. district courts are our admiralty courts. But, each country with maritime commerce has some version of admiralty law based around a core of customary international law and treaties, with domestic statutes similar to those of other countries statutes dealing with the topic.\n\nAdmiralty law is distinctive and different from domestic law in a variety of circumstances, most notably:\n\n1. The law governing when a ship can be detained in port to make a judgment in an admiralty proceeding against it enforceable. This is similar to a writ of attachment in domestic law (a pre\\-judgment seizure of assets to make a potential judgment collectable) but more broadly available.\n2. The rights of seamen vis\\-a\\-vis their employers.\n3. The relevance of the flag under which a ship sails.\n4. The \"traffic laws\" of the sea.\n5. The duties of a ship that encounters another ship or individuals in distress at sea.\n6. The duties of a ship that encounters hostile others parties, such as pirates, at sea.\n7. The tort law applicable to torts particular to a maritime context that take place at sea. For example, in a collision of ships, or from a failure to honor duties related to distressed ships, or from interference with a ship's commercial activity (e.g. in connection with a fishing expedition).\n8. The law governing property interests and sharing of proceeds from \"prizes\" such as the salvage of sinking, sunk or abandoned ships.\n\nIn general, admiralty law has declined in importance as lots of high value commerce has shifted to air travel, and as ocean going ships have become bigger and better behaved corporate interests, and because modern conditions make ships at sea less isolated from the rest of the world."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A cargo ship flying the flag of Panama collides with a small fishing vessel in international waters off the coast of Florida.

According to the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Civil Procedure Rules, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The customer must wait for a specific statutory deadline before taking legal action, regardless of the timeframe they set in their communication with the dealer.\n\nB) The customer can only serve a letter before claim to the dealer's official address registered on gov.uk, as this is the only legally recognized address for such notifications.\n\nC) The dealer is required to fix the car within 30 days of being notified of the issue, or face automatic legal consequences.\n\nD) The customer can serve a letter before claim to any address where the dealer resides or carries on business in the UK, and the timeframe for the dealer to act should be reasonable based on the nature of the goods and circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The Consumer Rights Act 2015 does not specify a fixed deadline for traders to fix issues, but rather states that it should be done within a \"reasonable time\" considering the nature of the goods and circumstances.

Rockcoons* ([3:17\\-cr\\-03690](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6325721/united-states-v-rockcoons/)), the defendant [committed this offence through peer\\-to\\-peer bitcoin trading](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/man-sentenced-fraud-and-operating-unlicensed-money-transmitting-business):\n\n> Rockcoons advertised his Bitcoin exchange services on the website LocalBitcoins.com. In 2015, HSI identified Rockcoons as the most prolific San Diego\\-based seller. In April 2016, the defendant\u2019s LocalBitcoins.com profile showed that he continued to advertise as a trader and seller of Bitcoin in San Diego, with his profile reflecting that he had engaged in more than 500 transactions. As of October 2017, the defendant\u2019s profile indicated that he conducted more than 1,000 bitcoin trades with more than 644 people. Rockcoons received a commission of as much as 36 percent per transaction.\n\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, the law in the **United Kingdom** is explained in *Vladimir Consulting Ltd v Financial Conduct Authority* [\\[2022] UKUT 168 (TCC)](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/TCC/2022/168.pdf). VCL had been trading on LocalBitcoins.com since 2017, but from 2020, was required to become licensed as a \"cryptoasset exchange provider\" under the *[Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2019](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1511/contents/made)*.

Would they ask for a take down for any other reason, when various other manga reader websites are making money off them?\n\nMerely looking at the fact that the other sites have not been taken down is not a good metric to decide if you will face an infringement suit for your own site. Consider the following possibilities:\n\n* The manga on those sites may be published by a different publisher than the manga you want to host, and that publisher of your desired manga is more litigious.\n* The manga publisher may not have been actively pursuing infringement for the last several years, but they may suddenly decide this fiscal year it's a financially good idea to start aggressively pursuing infringement. They will go after the other sites and your site at the same time.\n* Because you plan to *give them money,* you are actively drawing attention to your infringing site. While they may not find it worth their while to seek out whatever new infringing sites pop up every week, in this case, they don't have to come looking for you. You show up to *them*, actively telling them that you're infringing their copyright.\n\nOf course, they might not care. They might love your idea. Regardless, the legally sound way to do this is to ask for permission *before* you do it, rather than forgiveness afterward. If you don't, you are certainly vulnerable to a lawsuit (whether or not the publisher will pursue the opportunity to sue you is a question left to the discretion of the publisher).\n\n> 2. Considering that myself is not going to be making any money off their work, does this still fall into the category of criminal act? If so, are there more than take down notices that can happen? (C\\&D? financial punishment? imprisoning?)\n\nHaving your infringing site taken down is the *minimum* that could happen. If you commit copyright infringement, the copyright holder is fully entitled to file a lawsuit against you at once. It's possible that they could just file a DMCA takedown notice to your ISP to have the content taken down, but they are entitled to sue you for damages as well.\n\nMaybe they won't sue you because it's not worth their while. If not: lucky you! So, ask yourself: do you feel lucky?\n\nCopyright infringement is typically a civil offense and only punished with fines. It can only qualify as a criminal offense [under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7506](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#506) when the infringement is \"willful\" and meets one of the following criteria:\n\n> (A) for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain;\n> \n> \n> (B) by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180\\-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000; or\n> \n> \n> (C) by the distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, by making it available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution.\n\nAs long as you don't violate any of those conditions, your infringement is not criminal. Condition B seems most likely, if I am reading it correctly: if your site serves a $10 book one hundred times, then you've met the $1000 threshold. The threshold of what makes an infringement \"willful\" versus \"ordinary\" is somewhat nebulous; see Wikipedia's article on [Criminal Copyright Law in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Copyright_Law_in_the_United_States)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner plans to create a manga reader site that publishes copyrighted works without permission, but intends to send all advertising revenue to the copyright holders.

(The exceptions mostly concern other kinds of documents that are acceptable when traveling by land or sea to Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean.) The law is [8 USC 1185(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1185): \n\n> (b) Citizens\n> ------------\n> \n> \n> Except as otherwise provided by the President and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may authorize and prescribe, it shall be unlawful for any citizen of the United States to depart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter, the United States unless he bears a valid United States passport.\n\nThere is no penalty for violating this law. And, of course, US citizens have an inherent right to enter the US. In practice, therefore, if a border officer recognizes that you are a US citizen without the required documentation, they are supposed to inform you of the requirements and then waive the requirement of section 1185(b) so you can enter.\n\nFor more discussion, see [What is the penalty for US citizens entering/leaving the US on a foreign passport?](https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/86059/19400) on [travel.stackexchange.com](http://travel.stackexchange.com).\n\n---\n\nThere was formerly a regulation allowing US citizen children of foreign diplomats to travel to the US on their foreign passports.

The children of foreign government officials, however, may use their foreign passport for entry into the United States. \n> \n> \n> (2\\) After the U.S. citizenship of a child has been determined by a citizenship officer, the consular officer may, to avoid delay or difficulty, give a written statement to the parents for presentation to carriers or immigration officials. The statement should make clear that the bearer of the foreign passport is a dual national child of a foreign government official or employee who is traveling to the United States on official business and as such may enter the United States on the foreign passport as an exception to the provisions of INA 215(b) regarding valid passport requirement. \n> \n> \n> (3\\) A child under 12 years of age who is included in the passport of an alien parent in an official capacity may be admitted if evidence of U.S. citizenship is presented at the time of entry. A determination of the childs citizenship should be made by citizenship officer prior to departure from a foreign country and the parent should be instructed to have evidence of such citizenship available for inspection by the admitting Department of Homeland Security Officer.\n\nIf this is indeed how your daughter got her US visa then the State Department's willingness to issue the visa presumably implies that CBP should allow her to enter with her Israeli passport and that visa."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. citizen child of a foreign diplomat is traveling to the United States.

Ohio as:\n\n> whether at \\[the moment of arrest] the facts and circumstances within \\[an officer's] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information \\[are] sufficient to warrant a prudent \\[person] in believing that \\[a suspect] had committed or was committing an offense\n\nIn the context of warrants, the Oxford Companion to American Law defines probable cause as:\n\n> information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime (for an arrest warrant) or that evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search (for a search warrant)\n\nIn Brinegar v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court defines probable cause as:\n\n> where the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a man of reasonable caution that a crime is being committed\n\nIn the scenario that you describe the testimony of the child almost certainly gives rise to probable cause.

The warrant obtained would likely allow law enforcement to follow leads that emerge during the investigation, including tracing back through associated email addresses and accounts. This is supported by the principle that if there's evidence of deletion or attempts to hide information, law enforcement can pursue those leads to wherever they may go.

Since Jane is paid hourly, she does not meet the criteria for exempt status, even if her job duties would otherwise qualify. Therefore, she is incorrectly classified and should be receiving overtime pay for hours worked over 40 per week.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even though Jane holds an executive position, the method of payment (hourly) disqualifies her from exempt status.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the $684 per week minimum is a requirement for exempt status, the method of payment (salary or fee basis, not hourly) is also crucial.\n\nOption D is partially true but incomplete.

They seem rather peaceful, but, suddenly, John hits Jane and Jane hits back.\n2.

Jill hits Jack and Jack hits back.\n\nWhat are the outcomes in both cases for these people? What consequences would be for someone under 18 or 16 and for someone over 18?\n\n**In your answers I'm particularly interested in**: Legislation/Act name, explanation/brief summary, way to prove how an event happened, charges and your source of information/law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Woa, that's actually more than one question :\\-). I'll try to answer as much as I can. For clarity, I split your post into multiple simpler questions.\n\nAs to jurisdiction: I'll try to keep my answer general for most European jurisdictions, additionally citing UK law.\n\nIs \"hitting back\" self\\-defence?\n--------------------------------\n\n*It depends.*\n\nTo quote the definition of self\\-defence:\n\n> A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the \n>  prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of \n>  offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large.\n\n*[Criminal Law Act 1967, section 3 (1\\)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/section/3)*\n\nAs you can see, violence is only self\\-defence if it is a) to prevent a crime, or b) to assist with a lawful arrest.\n\nSo if you just hit back to retaliate, it is not self\\-defence. However, if you believe the attacker will hit you again, and hit them to prevent this, it *is* self\\-defence. Of course, which case applies is something a judge/jury would have to decide, thus the answer \"it depends\".\n\nDoes it make a difference if violence was preceded by provocative actions?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Yes, but only for the person provoking.*\n\nIn your second example, the violence was preceded by a \"heated discussion\", possibly involving threats. Self defence is only permissible, as the term implies, to actually defend against a threat. Hitting someone because they annoyed you does not count.\n\nThat said, if you are accused of a violent act, the fact that you were provoked will probably count as a mitigating circumstance. However, this will at best reduce your sentence, it will not make something count as self\\-defence.\n\nAlso, in some jurisdictions, if Jill provokes Jack, and Jack then proceeds to hit her, this will (somewhat simplifying) make it more difficult for Jill to later claim self\\-defence if she hits back. Since she provoked the attack, she is only allowed to defend herself, but not to attack preventively (which would normally be considered self\\-defence). The idea is that you cannot provoke someone into attacking you, then attack back claiming self\\-defence.\n\nDoes it matter whether the people involved are adults or minors?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Probably not.*\n\nAs far as I can tell, the right to self\\-defence does not make distinctions based on age, so with respect to determining whether an act was in self\\-defence, it would not matter. The law does mention that the force used must be \"reasonable\", and for a minor accused of violence, a court might apply that criterion more leniently, because for a minor it might be more difficult to judge what is reasonable, but that is just my speculation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where two individuals, Alex and Sam, are involved in a heated argument that escalates to physical violence, which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered self-defense under English law?\n\nA) Alex pushes Sam first, and Sam immediately punches Alex in retaliation.\nB) Sam threatens Alex verbally, so Alex preemptively strikes Sam to prevent a potential attack.\nC) Alex hits Sam, who then uses reasonable force to prevent Alex from hitting them again.\nD) Sam insults Alex's family, causing Alex to lose control and punch Sam.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most likely scenario to be considered self-defense under English law. According to the Criminal Law Act 1967, section 3(1), self-defense is defined as using reasonable force to prevent a crime. In this case, Sam using reasonable force to prevent Alex from hitting them again would fall under this definition. \n\nOption A is not self-defense because it's retaliation rather than prevention of further harm. Option B is problematic because preemptive strikes based solely on verbal threats are generally not considered self-defense. Option D is a case of provocation leading to violence, which is not self-defense but might be considered a mitigating circumstance in sentencing.\n\nRemember, the key elements of self-defense are: \n1. The use of reasonable force\n2. The purpose of preventing a crime (in this case, preventing further assault)\n3. The belief that the threat is imminent and ongoing\n\nThe correct answer demonstrates these elements, while the other options fail to meet one or more of these criteria."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58675/what-restrictions-can-organisations-impose-on-the-method-of-making-a-dsar", "docs_id": 58675, "title": "What restrictions can organisations impose on the method of making a DSAR?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From the [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-of-access/) \"An individual can make a \\[Subject Access request] SAR verbally or in writing, including on social media.

It must be emphasized that each decision point represents an unsettled area of law. Nobody knows which path through that flowchart the law will take, or even if different forms or implementations of AI might take different paths. The short and disappointing answer to your question is that **nobody knows what is or isn't legal yet.**\n\nTo further elaborate on each decision point:\n\n* The first point is asking whether the training process requires a license at all. There are two possible reasons to think that it does not:\n\t+ AI training is protected by fair use (see [17 USC 107](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107)). This is a case\\-by\\-case inquiry that would have to be decided by a judge.\n\t+ AI training is nothing more than the collection of statistical information relating to a work, and does not involve \"copying\" the work within the meaning of [17 USC 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) (except for a *de minimis* period which is similar to the caching done by a web browser, and therefore subject to a fair use defense).\n* The second point is, I think, asking whether the model is subject to copyright protection under [*Feist v. Rural*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990/89-1909) and related caselaw. Because the model is trained by a purely automated process, there's a case to be made that the model is not the product of human creativity, and is therefore unprotected by copyright altogether.\n\t+ Dicta in *Feist* suggest that the person or entity directing the training might be able to obtain a \"thin\" copyright in the \"selection or organization\" of training data, but no court has ever addressed this to my knowledge.\n\t+ This branch can also be read as asking whether the output of the model is copyrightable, when the model is run with some prompt or input. The Copyright Office [seems to think](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/16/2023-05321/copyright-registration-guidance-works-containing-material-generated-by-artificial-intelligence) the answer to that question is \"no, because a human didn't create it.\"\n* The third decision point is, uniquely, not a legal question, but a practical question: Do you intend to distribute anything, or are you just using it for your own private entertainment? This determines whether you need to consult the rest of the flowchart or not.\n* The final decision point is whether the \"output\" (i.e. either the model itself, or its output) is a derivative work of the training input.\n\t+ This would likely be decided on the basis of [substantial similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_similarity), which is a rather complicated area of law. To grossly oversimplify, the trier of fact would be shown both the training input and the allegedly infringing output, and asked to determine whether the two items have enough copyrightable elements in common that copying can reasonably be inferred."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company trains an AI model using a large corpus of text licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.

Key points of uncertainty include:\n\n1. Whether AI training requires a license at all or if it's protected under fair use.\n2. If the resulting AI model is subject to copyright protection.\n3. Whether the output of the AI model constitutes a derivative work of the training data.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there's no definitive ruling that such use is illegal.

It isn't clear if the question contemplates Russian intervention at the invitation of Assad's regime as part of \"Western states' actions in Syria\".\n4.

Many other intervening states similarly authorized action, at least, against ISIS.\n5.

Other formal requirements can have a similar effect (requirement for a contract to be in writing, in certain domains, for example).\n\nHe argues that the requirement for consideration provides a useful \"channelling\" function, in that it assists in carving out as a class those promises which people will be held to be bound to. Most of the article is devoted to explaining the ways in which this channelling function produces a worthwhile categorization.\n\nAs for your specific question about peppercorn or \"nominal\" consideration, Fuller writes:\n\n> The proper ground for upholding these decisions would seem to be that the desiderata underlying\n> the use of formalities are here satisfied by the fact that the parties have\n> taken the trouble to cast their transaction in the form of an exchange.\n> The promise supported by nominal consideration then becomes enforceable for reasons similar to those which justify the enforcement of the\n> promise under seal.\n\n---\n\nIn your example though, I actually don't see the contract issue. You ask, \"what's the point of not enforcing a contract where Alice gives Bob the plane with no consideration from Bob?\" But Alice can absolutely choose to gift an airplane to Bob. For a gift, there merely needs to be transfer, donative intent, and acceptance. That does not involve a contract law issue. The transfer would be complete and there would be no further obligation either side could be in breach of.

But, it wouldn't be unusual, for example, for one lawyer to question most of the witnesses and for a different lawyer who is more familiar with the specialized subject matter in question (e.g. electrical specifications), usually a junior lawyer, to question the expert witnesses in a case.\n\nAlso, if the usually designated lawyer is absent for some reason (stuck in traffic, sick, etc.), the \"second chair\" lawyer can (and is often required to) take over the case for the client until the \"first chair\" lawyer is available again.\n\nMostly, second chair lawyers (I've spent plenty of time over the years in this role) do the following (a non\\-exclusive list):\n\n* take notes,\n* pay attention to how the judge and jury are reacting to testimony,\n* provide input into jury selection decisions,\n* reminds the primary lawyer of points that still need to be covered in the examination of a witness,\n* reminds the primary lawyer of exhibits that still need to be formally offered into evidence,\n* scrambles to find rebuttal or impeachment evidence for unanticipated testimony,\n* prompts the primary lawyer to make objections if the primary lawyer was paying attention to something else,\n* identifies and has at the ready exhibits needs to present (or to follow the other side's examination),\n* looks up points of law that are relevant or will need to be referenced that come up during trial,\n* handles logistics for witnesses who are not on the stand (keeping them in the hallway if the witness is sequestered, trying to obtain the appearance of no show witnesses or reshuffling their order, saying thank you to witnesses who are no longer on the stand, etc.),\n* carries some of the litigation team's stuff into and out of the court room,\n* provides informed commentary and suggestions during breaks and working lunches, etc.\n\nAlso, in addition to the usual \"first chair\" and \"second chair\" roles, often supplemented by a paralegal or legal assistant, there is a different kind of arrangement in which different lawyers for the same person can fully participate. This far less common arrangement happens when the person showing up in court is wearing \"more than one hat\" and has a different lawyer in different capacities. \n\nFor example, suppose that someone is the President of a corporation and both the corporation and the President individually are both sued.

In most court proceedings, there is typically a primary \"first chair\" attorney who handles the majority of the speaking roles and direct interactions with the court. The \"second chair\" attorney, and any additional attorneys, play crucial supporting roles. They may take notes, monitor jury reactions, provide input during breaks, handle logistics, and even examine specific witnesses in their areas of expertise. While only one lawyer is usually in charge of speaking at any given stage of the trial, there is flexibility to allow different attorneys to participate in various aspects of the case as needed. This arrangement allows for the most effective use of each attorney's skills and knowledge while maintaining order in the courtroom.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests a chaotic scenario where all attorneys can interject at will, which is not typical courtroom practice.

To have a legitimate claim to use the neighboring property for emergency egress, the homeowner needs to have an easement. This easement could be formally registered on the property title, which would be the strongest case. Alternatively, if local laws allow, the homeowner might be able to claim an easement through adverse possession if they can prove consistent and notorious usage over many years (though the specific time frame of 21 years mentioned for prescriptive easements in Pennsylvania isn't met in this case).\n\nOption A is incorrect because filing a lawsuit without establishing a right to use the property (via an easement) would likely be unsuccessful. Option B is incorrect because while 21 years is the requirement for a prescriptive easement in Pennsylvania, the house is only 13 years old, so this condition isn't met.

The 14-day notice period establishes the termination date, but does not alter the terms of the contract during that period. Therefore, Sarah is expected to continue working on the project for those 14 days, and the client is required to pay for the work performed during this time, as the contract remains in full effect until the termination date. This interpretation aligns with the principle that notice of termination merely establishes the end date, not immediate cessation of contractual obligations."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/71017/reproducing-pieces-of-a-copyrighted-standard-is-it-fair-use", "docs_id": 71017, "title": "Reproducing pieces of a copyrighted standard, is it fair use?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As a company, we are looking to comply with a specific set of standards that are protected under copyright law (think ISO).\n\nBecause of transparency requirements, we have to publish our final reports on this publicly on our website.
