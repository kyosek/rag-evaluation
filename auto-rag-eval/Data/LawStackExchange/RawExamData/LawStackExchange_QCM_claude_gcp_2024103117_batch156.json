One once mentioned that a person found to have retaliated against a union member for contacting the union will basically be black listed from the industry (the union was international and had agreements with other unions). Is this legal? Would such a person need to be given warning or severance? I guess an employer who signs a union agreement could agree not to employee any person listed on a black list.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A union cannot fire an employee (except a person who is an employee of the union), but an employer can. Section 246\\.1(1\\) of the [Canada Labour Code](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/l-2/) prohibits a federally regulated employer from taking an adverse action against an employee, if they exercising specific rights granted under Part III. Those rights generally relate to wages, scheduling and leaves, for example 173\\.01(5\\):\n\n> (5\\) An employer shall not dismiss, suspend, lay off, demote or\n> discipline an employee because the employee has refused to work a work\n> period or shift under subsection (2\\) or take such a refusal into\n> account in any decision to promote or train the employee.\n\nSince there is no protected right to retaliate against another employee, the employer is not legally prohibited from retaliating against the retaliator, at least under Canadian law. There are also labo(u)r laws for [provinces and territories](https://www.adp.ca/en/resources/compliance-and-legislation/employment-standards-in-canada/provinces-and-territories.aspx), but it is unlikely that retaliation is a protected right in any part of Canada. The [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-12.html) asserts that freedom of association is a fundamental right, and [it is reported](https://www.ufcw.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32573&Itemid=2451&lang=en#can-you-be-fired-for-joining-a-union) that\nit violates provincial labor laws to retaliate against an employee for joining a union.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Canada, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding an employer's ability to take action against an employee who retaliates against a union member?\n\nA) The employer is legally prohibited from taking any action against the retaliating employee due to freedom of association laws.\n\nB) The employer can only take action if they provide a warning and severance package to the retaliating employee.\n\nC) The employer can take action against the retaliating employee without legal repercussions, as retaliation is not a protected right under Canadian labor laws.\n\nD) The employer can only take action if the union agreement explicitly allows for blacklisting of retaliating employees.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, Canadian labor laws do not protect an employee's right to retaliate against another employee, even in union-related matters. The Canada Labour Code prohibits employers from taking adverse actions against employees who exercise specific rights related to wages, scheduling, and leaves, but retaliation against union members is not one of these protected rights. Therefore, an employer can legally take action against an employee who retaliates against a union member without facing legal repercussions under Canadian law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while freedom of association is protected, this doesn't extend to protecting retaliatory actions.\n\nOption B is incorrect as there is no legal requirement for warning or severance in this specific situation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the employer's ability to take action against a retaliating employee is not dependent on the union agreement allowing blacklisting.

There are so many different sources of laws (federal, state, local, and others) that even just finding a relevant law is beyond the grasp of some people, and even if you can, many laws are written in \u201clegalese\u201d that can be difficult to interpret.\n\nYou can hire a lawyer to answer your questions, but there are two problems with this: One is that it limits legal knowledge to very wealthy people, and the other is that lawyers can be wrong, and if your lawyer gives you bad advice (e.g. you commit a crime because the lawyer said it was not a crime), this is not a defense.\n\nThe government doesn\u2019t offer any official channels for legal advice, and in fact even general discussions (like StackExchange) often specifically bar legal advice because it is so difficult and risky to provide.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t the government have any obligation to provide something like a hotline where you can just call and ask if something is legal?

The principle \"ignorance of the law is no excuse\" is maintained primarily because it allows for a more administrable legal system. While this approach may present challenges for individual citizens, it avoids the potential chaos that could result from a system where ignorance could be widely used as a defense.

Stating how you voted, by itself, is fine; however, taking a photo of your ballot instead of just saying how you voted is illegal in some states, especially if the photo was taken within a polling place. Laws banning these so\\-called \"ballot selfies\" may be unconstitutional, and have been successfully challenged under the first amendment in some cases.\n\n---\n\nThere is not a general ban on simply *saying* who you voted for. This is an extremely common practice, and it is the basis for \"exit polling,\" where voters leaving a polling place are asked whom they voted for in order to collect voting statistics to predict the winner of the election. This type of polling has been [upheld by courts](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1108/exit-polling), and it sounds like laws banning it were primarily concerned with voter intimidation rather than vote\\-buying.\n\nAs of 2016, [18 states banned sharing any photograph of a ballot, while an additional 6 ban photography in polling places](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/where-can-you-take-a-selfie-with-your-ballot/). The rationale for such laws is to prevent vote\\-buying, because if you can't take a photo of your ballot, you can't prove whom you voted for (whereas without the photo, you could simply vote however you like, then lie). However, at least one such law has been [challenged in federal court and invalidated as a violation of the first amendment](http://www.nhd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Opinions/15/15NH154P.pdf) (in Rideout v.

According to the information provided, simply stating how one voted is generally allowed and is the basis for practices like exit polling. However, laws regarding \"ballot selfies\" or photographs of ballots vary by state. As of 2016, 18 states banned sharing photographs of ballots, while 6 additional states banned photography in polling places. Some of these laws have been challenged in federal court as violations of the First Amendment, with at least one such law being invalidated. This creates a complex legal landscape where the legality of ballot photographs differs by state and is subject to ongoing legal challenges.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no universal ban on disclosing how one voted.

Displaying user videos is not exactly the same thing as a particular popular song, but they just might be close enough for some consumer confusion tom occur. Whether reasonable people are in fact confused into thinking that the app is in some way sponsored by the makers of the song is a question of fact. A trademark suit would probably need to present some sort of evidence that confusion had occurred or was likely.\n\nIt also may make a difference whether \"Tik Tok\" has been **registered** as a trademark. In the US, registration gets greater protection than mere use. (In some countries there is no protection without registration.) \n\nIt is also possible that the app has already licensed the rights to the term from the trademark owner for the song. This would avoid a potential suit.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the term \"Tik Tok\" is not original with the song. It dates back, in that spelling, to at least the [\"Oz\" books by L. Frank Baum and others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oz_books) *Tik\\-Tok of Oz* dates from 1914, and the character of the Tik\\-Tok from the book *Ozma of Oz* (1907\\). Terms that are not original coinages are less strongly protected in trademark law, and the app could claim to be alluding to the Oz character, not the more recent song.\n\nA comment by ub3rst4r says that: \n\n> the term \"Tik Tok\" is registered as a trademark in the USA by \"Bytedance Ltd\" (which is the company that operates the app).\n\nIf that is correct, the US Patent and Trademark office (PTO) came to at least a preliminary conclusion that this trademark did not infringe anyone else's trademark. That doesn't meant that an infringement suit is doomed, but it would make any such suit harder and less likely.\n\nIt seems that, as described in [this news story](https://fashionentlaw.com/music-law/music-law-keha-forgets-to-stop-tiktoks-her-way-into-law-suit/) a company selling watchs under the name \"Tic Tok\" was sent a cease and desist letter on behalf of the singer Kesha Sebert.

While the app and song share the same name, they operate in different but potentially related fields. The existence of prior uses of \"Tik Tok\" (like in the Oz books) could weaken exclusive claims, but doesn't automatically prevent trademark protection.

Uruguayan legal citizenship has special characteristics. A person who acquires it retains their nationality of origin, which is determined by Uruguayan law to be that of their country of birth and therefore, is immutable. Legal citizens acquire political rights but do not acquire Uruguayan nationality as natural citizens do. According to Uruguayan law, those born in Uruguay or whose parents or grandparents are Uruguayan natural citizens are considered to be Uruguayan nationals.\n\nThe Uruguayan State defined nationality in this way based on an interpretation of the Constitution made by the jurist Justino Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga in the mid\\-twentieth century. Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga's interpretation, found in one of Uruguay's fundamental academic interpretative texts, states: *\"In the first place, nationality is presented to us as a natural bond, derived from birth, from blood\"*. Likewise, this jurist believed that *\"nationality corresponds to a certain sociological or psychological reality\"*. Speaking on behalf of the drafters of the Constitution of 1830, this jurist concluded: *\"The quality of nationality thus depends on one fact: birth in the territory of the State\". Finally, \"nationality is irrevocable\"*.\n\nAccording to Uruguayan law, the concepts of nationality and citizenship are distinguishable, the first being of a real or sociological nature and the second of a legal nature.\n\nHe argued that nationality and citizenship are two completely different individual conditions. According to Ar\u00e9chaga's view nationality is a permanent state of the individual, which does not suffer any alteration whatever the point of the earth they inhabit, and citizenship is, on the contrary, variable and alters with the different domiciles that men acquire in the different societies into which mankind is divided.\n\nThe source of citizenship, he added, is in the actual domicile and not in nationality.\n\nTherefore, he says: *\"each state feels who its nationals are, and declares it by its law; on the other hand, each state decides who its citizens are, and it disposes of them by its law, for nationality corresponds to a certain sociological or psychological reality.\"* (JUSTINO JIM\u00c9NEZ DE ARECHAGA, La Constituci\u00f3n Nacional. Volume II pg. 186\\)\n\nAs a result of Uruguay's unusual distinction between citizenship and nationality (it's the only country in the world that recognizes the right to citizenship without being a national), legal citizens have encountered problems with their Uruguayan passports at airports around the world since 2015\\. This is due to recommendations in the seventh edition of Doc. 9303 of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which requires that travel documents issued by participating states include the \"Nationality\" field. The lack of a naturalization path means that the Nationality field in legal citizens' passports indicates their country of birth, which Uruguay assumes to be their nationality of origin. Many countries do not accept passports issued by a country that declares the holder to be a national of another country. As a consequence, it has severely curtailed legal citizens' exercise of the right to free movement, as their travel abroad is often difficult or downright impossible.\n\nDue to its current and narrow definition of nationality, Uruguay could be violating the sovereignty of other countries by assigning foreign nationalities in its official documents, thus overriding their powers. Some Uruguayan legal citizens may even, as a result of the application of a national law of a third nation and this Uruguayan interpretation, become de facto stateless.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This seems similar to a lot of other countries.

In nations that allow dual citizenship, people who have dual citizenships may own passports from both nations and nations may issue passports to non\\-citizens for numerous reasons (One famous example was [Canadian Caper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Caper), in which Canada issued valid Canadian passports to six American diplomats who managed to flee the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the Iranian Hostage Crisis and were being hidden within the residents of the Canadian Ambassador to Iran.

If Company B pays less than market value, the difference is considered a gift, but it's not tax-deductible unless B is a recognized charity.

As stated in the documentation, \"Governments enjoy sovereign immunity, and cannot be sued for their errors of judgment unless they specifically allow it.\" This means that citizens cannot sue the government for approving a substance that later turns out to be harmful, unless there's a specific provision allowing such lawsuits.\n\nOption A is incorrect because prior knowledge is not a factor that typically overrides sovereign immunity. \n\nOption B is false because the government's immunity generally extends to its decision-making processes, including safety testing procedures.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, as mentioned in the documentation, there is typically no jurisdiction that imposes a duty on the government to \"absolutely prevent all harm.\" While there are rare exceptions (like the education example in Washington state), these are not common and do not apply to food safety regulations in the manner described."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70208/i-used-a-3d-asset-in-my-game-that-was-distributed-under-cc-license-later-i-foun", "docs_id": 70208, "title": "I used a 3D asset in my game that was distributed under CC license.

Some players reported to the studio that I stole the model...\n\nI used the model pretty much everywhere in the game, and I replaced all instances immediately after finding the issue.\n\nI downloaded the model from sketchfab.com, a platform for indie game developers that want to use 3d models for their games.\n\nThe author of the model licensed the model under **CC Attribution license**, which means that all you have to do to use it in your commercial products is to credit the author \\- which I did. The model was uploaded 3 years ago and the game he stole it from is from 9 years ago.\n\nThe model was in my game for whole 2 days after release and it was also in all marketing materials. Now it's all replaced.\n\nI haven't received any legal letters yet, and the studio is not responding. I've told them about the issue via their online support form and described it in detail (similar to this post). They are not responding and I am not exactly panicked, but it's under my skin. The fear of a letter one day coming and telling me I will have to give them every profit I made with the game. Or being sued by the studio.\n\nWhat can they realistically do to me? Can they sue me? Should I find a direct email and contact their PR department directly? Or should I just wait for them to write or not (not good for my mental health).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since the person who posted the game component under the CC\\-BY license has no right to do so, no one who used it in reliance on that license had any rights either, and all such uses were at least technically infringement (unless they came under a copyright exception, which seems unlikely).\n\nThe holder of the copyright on the component could sue in any country where a game using it was published. The details of the law, including the rules on damages and other remidies, will vary from country to country.\n\nIn the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") those rules are contained in [Chapter 5 of title 17 USC](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html) particularly sections 502\\-505\\. Section 504 provides for possible money damages. Section 502 provides for a possible injunction (court order to stop infringing). Section 503 provides for for infringing works to be seized. Section 505 provides for possible awards of costs and legal fees to a successful plaintiff (copyright holder).\n\nSection 502 allows injunctions to \"prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright\" on \"reasonable\" terms. But when the infringement has already been stopped, no such injunction is needed and a court is not likely to impose one.\n\nSection 503 allows the court to order the impoundment of infringing copies and \"plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other articles by means of which such copies or phonorecords may be reproduced\". This is largely obsolete for digital content.\n\nSection 504 is the key. It offers the plaintiff a choice between actual damages plus profits and statutory damages. The rule for the first is:\n\n> The copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement, and any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.\n\nThis means money made by use of the unauthorized content, plus any loss of sales or other losses suffered by the owner. Money mad by the infringing work but not made by use of the infringing content is not included, if this can be proven. Income obtained after the infringing content was removed would probably not be included in the infringer's profits.\n\nStatutory damages can be any amount between $750 and $30,000 that the count thinks is just, but id the infringement is proved to be \"innocent\" the lower limit is $200\\. The exact provision reads:\n\n> In a case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200\\.\n\nAn award of costs and fees under section 505 is entirely up to the discretion of the court.\n\nIf the maximum possible award of infringer's profits is $10,000, and a defense of innocent infringement is plausible, a plaintiff might well find such a suit unprofitable, given the legal expenses involved in preparing an carrying through such a suit. But that is entirely up to the copyright owner. An owner may choose to file even an unprofitable suit in an effort to deter others.\n\nA person who has discovered that s/he has innocently infringed a copyright and made some money in the process would be wise to document the prompt removal of the infringing content form any publication, and efforts to notify the copyright owner. Ther is no way to be sure what actions the owner will take, if any, within those that the law allows.\n\nOften a owner in such a case will not bring suit if the infringement was apparently innocent, resulting profits were small, the infringement has been halted, and future infringement by that infringer seems unlikely. But different owners have different policies on such matters.\n\nAn owner can delay in deciding whether to file suit or not.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small indie game developer unknowingly uses a 3D model in their game that was stolen from a AAA game and uploaded to a sharing platform under a CC Attribution license. The developer credited the uploader as required by the license. After discovering the issue, they immediately removed the model from the game and marketing materials. What is the most accurate statement regarding potential legal consequences?\n\nA) The developer is completely protected from legal action because they followed the terms of the CC Attribution license.\nB) The AAA game studio can only sue for damages incurred during the 2 days the model was in the released game.\nC) The developer could potentially face legal action, including suits for damages, but has some mitigating factors in their favor.\nD) The developer is guaranteed to lose any potential lawsuit due to using copyrighted material without permission.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The developer could potentially face legal action, as using the stolen model was technically copyright infringement, regardless of the CC Attribution license (which was invalid). However, several factors work in the developer's favor:\n\n1. The infringement appears to be innocent, as they relied on the false CC Attribution license.\n2. They promptly removed the infringing content upon discovery.\n3. The infringement lasted only a short time (2 days after release).\n4. They attempted to contact the copyright owner to explain the situation.\n\nThese factors could potentially reduce damages if a lawsuit occurs, or even discourage the copyright owner from pursuing legal action.

If this happens and you default or fail to cooperate in the judicial process, you will probably have a judgment entered against you.\n\nIf you lost, the other party would get a judgment against you (an official declaration of a court that you owe another party money that authorizes various involuntary means of debt collection from your income and assets). This could be enforced against assets you have in the jurisdiction where the judgment was entered, or could be \"domesticated\" to a different jurisdiction where you had assets by bringing suit or exercising another process set forth by treaty or a law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign judgment holder seeks to domesticate the judgment.\n\nWhether the foreign judgment is conclusive against you or not, depends upon the domestic law of the place where they seek to enforce the foreign judgment, the nature of the underlying claims upon which the foreign judgment is based, and the legal process used to obtain the foreign judgment.\n\nMany countries will pretty much automatically enforce a judgment enforcing a breach of a contract between private sector parties obtained through the ordinary legal process in a country whose legal system is recognized by the U.S., but often will not give legal effect to legal procedures like a pre\\-dispute \"confessions of judgment\", an award of exemplary damages, an award of non\\-economic damages, or an award based upon a legal theory that is not recognized by the jurisdiction in which you seek to enforce the judgment. \n\nIn general, judgments of U.S. courts in tort cases are rarely recognized by other countries.\n\nSimilarly, a U.S. court, for example, would not enforce a foreign judgment, from say, ISIL controlled territory, for breach of a contract to deliver slaves to a buyer. Some Saudi Arabian money judgments are not enforced in the U.S. because the courts have held that their system does not protect basic principles of due process and the rule of law, which is why contracts with Saudi Arabia often have arbitration clauses instead of relying upon the royal courts in existence there.\n\nSome countries might enforce a judgment entered following a trial on the merits regarding a dispute, but not a default judgment, without essentially bringing the lawsuit all over again in the country where the assets are located, applying the general principles of legal concepts known as \"collateral estoppel\" and \"res judicata\".\n\nMost countries have special laws specifically governing when an arbitration award will be enforced with a money judgment in that jurisdiction and when it will not be enforced. This varies considerably from one country to another. The U.S. is unusually deferential to employment and consumer arbitration, but most countries will recognize express signed contractual arbitration agreements in a business to business situation that conforms to basic standards of due process.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An American company sues a former employee in a U.S. court for breach of employment contract after the employee has permanently moved to France.

However, it also emphasized that in non-custodial, voluntary interactions with law enforcement, individuals generally need to explicitly invoke their Fifth Amendment right to remain silent for it to apply. This ruling did not overturn or significantly alter Miranda, but rather clarified its application in different contexts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Salinas did not overturn Miranda; Miranda protections still apply to custodial interrogations.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Salinas did not expand Miranda rights to non-custodial situations. In fact, it clarified that in non-custodial, voluntary interactions, individuals typically need to explicitly invoke their right to remain silent.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the cases deal with different specific circumstances, they are related in that they both address aspects of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in interactions with law enforcement."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81116/can-a-restaurant-bypass-oregons-straw-law-by-also-selling-boxes-of-straws", "docs_id": 81116, "title": "Can a restaurant bypass Oregon&#39;s straw law by also selling boxes of straws?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It appears that a restaurant could very easily circumvent [Oregon's plastic straw law (2019 SB90\\)](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2019R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/SB90/Enrolled) by selling boxes of disposable plastic straws in addition to selling food and drink (with individual straws).\n\nSection 1(1\\)(b):\n\n> \u201cConvenience store\u201d means a business that, for compensation, offers or provides a range of commodities that includes food and beverages.\n\nSection 1(2\\):\n\n> (a) A food and beverage provider or convenience store may not provide a single\\-use\n> plastic straw to a consumer unless the consumer specifically requests the single\\-use plastic\n> straw.\n> ...\n> (c) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply to a convenience\n> store that:\n> (A) Sells or offers single\\-use plastic straws for sale in bulk or unconnected with a sale\n> or provision of food or a beverage...\n\nBy selling straws, food, and drink, I believe they are \"for compensation, offer\\[ing] or provid\\[ing] a range of commodities that includes food and beverages,\" and therefore are a \"convenience store.\" They are \"\\[s]ell\\[ing] or offer\\[ing] single\\-use plastic straws for sale in bulk or unconnected with a sale or provision of food or a beverage\", so the prohibition does not apply.

Lawyer 2 says, \"I knew that X was a priority for the client (and was legal, even \"standard\" practice), but I failed to include/downplayed it because I had other priorities.\"\n\nAre there any differences in a lawyer's potential negligence liability between these two sets of cases? How far can what i call the \"idiot\" defense protect a lawyer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In most jurisdictions of which I am aware, there is no such distinction. \n\nFor example, Colorado's jury instructions makes no such distinction, and the distinction you suggest is not one identified in most law school textbooks or the Restatements of Torts.\n\nIn most legal malpractice cases, an expert lawyer called a \"standard of care\" expert offers an opinion that particular elements of the lawyer's conduct did not live up to the level of a reasonable lawyer in the state. \n\nThere are a handful of very narrow cases where this is not required (e.g. missing a statute of limitations due to failure to properly calendar the deadline, or not showing up to court on the appointed day resulting a default judgment). But, this arises from the clarity of the violation and not from its active v. passive nature.\n\nIgnorance of the law is rarely an excuse, and even more rarely so for lawyers, although the law does not require lawyers to be prescient either.\n\nFor example, I recent had a case where I won on an issue of substantive probate law governed by California law at trial, because the other side argued a contrary position but had no legal authority to back up that argument. But, a few weeks before the appellate court issued its opinion, after all briefing in the appeal was complete and oral arguments had been waived by both parties, the California Supreme Court made a ruling that was contrary to my position in a case that was factually almost identical to my case and reversed prior case law in California on the subject. One of the judges in my case (or more likely, on the judge's clerk) found the new case. So, I lost on the appeal.\n\nBut, nobody would accuse me of legal malpractice for not knowing at trial that many months after the case was argued, and weeks after the case had been fully briefed on appeal, that the California Supreme Court would change the law of the state of California in a manner that was contrary to the position I had taken all along and prevailed with, until that point.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A lawyer is accused of legal malpractice for failing to include a specific clause in a contract that the client claims was important.

According to the documentation, most jurisdictions do not distinguish between \"active\" and \"passive\" negligence in legal malpractice cases. Instead, courts typically rely on expert witnesses, known as \"standard of care\" experts, to determine whether the lawyer's conduct met the level expected of a reasonable lawyer in that state. The expert would consider factors such as the lawyer's communication with the client, standard practices in contract drafting, and the overall handling of the case. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the distinction between \"active\" and \"passive\" negligence is not typically recognized in legal malpractice cases. \n\nAnswer B is overly simplistic and does not reflect the nuanced approach courts take in these cases.

Analogously, if you go into a restaurant and order a steak, you are obligated to pay for it, but you are not obligated to eat it. You can cancel the steak order within some reasonable short period of time (maybe a minute) \u2013 it depends on whether they have relied on your acceptance of their offer, and have done anything that puts them in a worse situation (such as \"started cooking it\"). You could have informed them that you decided that you didn't want the thing and they might have been able to cancel the order with no or minimum cost to you (depends on whether your job was simply \"in the queue\", or had they done something like ordered parts or detrimentally committed an employee to some schedule so that other customers could not be serviced). Once you accept their offer, you have an enforceable contract.\n\nThe additional information about lateness of delivery doesn't clearly change the situation. If there were an explicit \"time is of the essence\" clause in your contract, related to any delay causing harm, then failure to meet a deadline could constitute a breach of contract. For example, if you have a contract where you will be transported to a location by a specific deadline so that you can get on the boat, failure to meet that deadline causes material harm (if you miss the boat, you suffer a loss). You apparently do not have any such clause, and there's no indication that you suffered a loss because of the delay in delivery.

This arose in the context of a judicial review application, where procedural rules allow some claims to be rejected at an early stage, rather than proceeding to a full hearing.\n\nThe normal course is that the claimant (the person who objects to a decision the government has made) will file papers with the court describing their claim. If the judge deems their case \"arguable\", then it can carry on, ultimately with the judge deciding who is right. If not, then there can be a \"renewal hearing\", where the applicant can explain their case orally, in the hope of persuading the judge that their case is arguable after all. But if the judge says the case, on the basis of the written material, is \"totally without merit\", then there is no renewal hearing, and we are done. The claimant could file a fresh case, if the judge's reasons for denial gave them enough clues about what might be arguable instead, or can appeal the finding. Evidently, then, some points can be not arguable, but also not totally without merit.\n\nIn *Wasif*, the court differentiated between (paras 15ff):\n\n1. Cases where the judge \"can see no rational basis on which the claim could succeed\" are certainly bound to fail, and a hearing would be pointless; they are totally without merit.\n2. Cases which contain a rational argument, but the judge \"is confident that, even taking the case at its highest, it is wrong\". Notwithstanding the judge's confidence, it is possible that his mind could be changed if an oral hearing took place, so these should not be deemed to be totally without merit. They are described as \"not arguable\" at this stage, but the claimant gets to argue that they are arguable.\n\nThe decision is one involving, well, *judgement*, and is not totally precise, but the experienced judges in *Wasif* felt that it was a realistic distinction in practice.\n\nThe court points out (17(3\\) and (5\\)) that a hearing gives the claimant the chance to address specific issues the judge has noted, especially when they are self\\-represented and their documents are not well\\-prepared. In those instances, the judge might be able to spot an actual arguable claim lurking in the material, and \"the correct course\" could be to refuse permission but allow an oral hearing so that the real issue can be drawn out.\n\nWhat we can see from this is that a point might be \"not arguable\" (the judge thinks it is plainly wrong), but still have some level of merit at that stage (the judge is willing to let the claimant address his objections). When the judge comes to deliver his opinion at the very end, he might still say that a particular point is without merit (he has heard all about it and thinks it is completely wrong) even if he'd conceded earlier that the claimant deserved a chance to present it.\n\nNot all arguments that fail are described as \"without merit\". If Bob prevails in *Bob v Rob* it does not follow that all of Rob's points were hopeless. Judges can deploy colourful opprobrium but are just as likely to recognize that some arguments are strong, even when the opposing argument was stronger.

The injunction is a form of prospective relief, as it orders future conduct. It's also an executory decree, as it will be carried out over time.

On the other hand, I'm pretty sure that I've heard people being arrested (and convicted) for planning to do a crime. Usually it was something big like murder or terrorism or whatever. However, big or small shouldn't really be relevant, I think.\n\nSo, clearly, there is a line somewhere there between \"it's acceptable to think about committing this crime\" and \"it's not acceptable to think about it *this seriously*\". But what is it?\n\nSince this is a rather generic principle, I assume that most countries will have similar rules regarding this.

That being said, there is a difference between intent and a mere wish.\n\nIntent is inferred from statements or circumstances indicating that a person's actions were (or are) devised toward knowingly committing the underlying crime. The [Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) defines *intent* as \"*\\[D]esign, resolve, or determination with which \\[a] person acts. \\[...] \\[M]ental action at its most advanced point \\[...]. It is the exercise of intelligent will, the mind being fully aware of the nature and consequences of the act which is about to be done*\" (brackets added).\n\nBy contrast, a wish that goes no further than fantasizing or expressing \"*I want to do this*\" usually is inconsequential from a legal standpoint. One exception to that relates to promoting offenses such as terrorism, murder, and arguably pedophilia. Even if it is proved that the person making those expressions has no propensity or intent to indulge in the criminal conduct he depicts, the expressions themselves might encourage others to do so. That encouragement makes it more difficult for a government to prevent those crimes from being committed and to identify the perpetrator(s).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following scenarios is most likely to be considered criminal intent rather than a mere wish under the law?\n\nA) A person posts on social media: \"I wish I could rob a bank and get rich quick!\"\nB) An individual researches bank security systems and creates detailed floor plans of a local bank.\nC) Someone tells their friend, \"Wouldn't it be cool if we could steal a million dollars?\"\nD) A person daydreams about committing a perfect crime while watching a heist movie.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B demonstrates the clearest case of criminal intent. Researching bank security systems and creating detailed floor plans shows a level of planning and preparation that goes beyond mere wishing or fantasizing. This aligns with the definition of intent from Black's Law Dictionary as \"design, resolve, or determination with which a person acts\" and \"mental action at its most advanced point.\"\n\nOption A is likely considered a mere wish or fantasy, as it doesn't show any concrete steps towards committing a crime. \n\nOption C is similar to A, expressing a hypothetical desire without any actual planning or intent.\n\nOption D is clearly just imagination or fantasy sparked by watching a movie, with no indication of actual intent to commit a crime.\n\nThe key distinction is that B shows active steps towards potentially committing a crime, while the others remain in the realm of thoughts or casual expressions without any real-world preparation or planning."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/57914/is-it-possible-to-have-a-software-license-that-is-free-for-people-but-expensive", "docs_id": 57914, "title": "Is it possible to have a software license that is free for people, but expensive for mega corporations?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been searching for a software license that seems like it should exist.

What do you mean by \"corporation\"? Your license might not achieve what you intended it to achieve, if you don't think about ways to legally get around the restriction (can a mega\\-corporation have an employee incorporate your code into a product, as an individual, and then sell the rights to the product to the mega\\-corporation for $1, or for $1,000,000?

As explained in the documentation, one of the challenges for minority members of LLCs is that the LLC can post a profit without making any distributions.

Italian laws could have slight modifications.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under the ePrivacy directive in the EU, which of the following statements is true regarding an internet service provider's use of a customer's traffic data for profiling and advertising purposes?\n\nA) The provider can freely use traffic data for profiling and advertising without any restrictions.\n\nB) The provider can use traffic data for profiling and advertising only after anonymizing the data.\n\nC) The provider can use traffic data for profiling and advertising only if the customer gives explicit consent.\n\nD) The provider is strictly prohibited from using traffic data for profiling and advertising under any circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the ePrivacy directive, internet service providers can use traffic data for marketing electronic communication services or for providing value-added services (which would include profiling and advertising) only if the customer gives explicit consent. The directive allows usage of traffic data for performing transmission, after anonymizing the data, or for billing purposes without consent, but targeted advertising based on individual traffic data requires opt-in from the customer. Options A and D are incorrect as they misrepresent the directive's stipulations. Option B is incorrect because anonymized data cannot be used for targeted advertising to specific customers."}}
