Using deception to get someone to open the door so that you can execute a warrant is okay (United States v. Contreras\\-Ceballos, 999 F.2d 432\\). Leading a criminal to believe that you are a crime\\-customer (e.g. for purposes of a drug sale) and not a police officer is okay (Lewis v. United States, 385 U.S. 206\\), but must be limited to the purposes contemplated by the suspect and cannot turn into a general search. Lying about whether you have a warrant is not okay (Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, Hadley v. Williams, 368 F.3d 747\\), nor is it okay to lie about the scope of a warrant (United States v. Dichiarinte, 445 F.2d 126\\). Misrepresenting the true purpose of entry, even when the person is identified as a government agent, negates consent (US v. Bosse, 898 F. 2d 113; United States v. Phillips, 497 F.2d 1131; United States v. Tweel, 550 F.2d 297\\). However, there is no requirement to be fully forthright (US v. Briley, 726 F.2d 1301\\) so you can gain entry saying that you \"have a matter to discuss with X\" even when the intent is to arrest X.\n\nIn a case similar to what you describe, [United States v.

The officer, without a warrant, poses as an internet technician and tells John there have been reports of connectivity issues in the area. John allows the officer into his home to \"check the connection.\" While inside, the officer observes clear evidence of the gambling operation on John's computer screen. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the admissibility of this evidence in a criminal trial against John?\n\nA) The evidence is admissible because John voluntarily allowed the officer into his home.\nB) The evidence is inadmissible because the officer did not have a warrant to enter the home.\nC) The evidence is admissible because the officer did not physically search the computer, only observed what was in plain view.\nD) The evidence is inadmissible because the officer misrepresented the true purpose of his entry, negating any consent given.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Based on the case law provided, misrepresenting the true purpose of entry, even when the person is identified as a government agent, negates consent (US v. Bosse, 898 F. 2d 113; United States v. Phillips, 497 F.2d 1131; United States v. Tweel, 550 F.2d 297). In this scenario, the officer posed as an internet technician and lied about the reason for entering the home, which would likely be considered a misrepresentation of the true purpose of entry. This deception would negate any consent given by John Doe, making the evidence inadmissible as \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while John did allow the officer in, the consent was based on deception. Option B is incorrect because the lack of a warrant alone doesn't automatically make evidence inadmissible if there's valid consent, which isn't the case here due to the deception.

But the discredit bit seems odd to me. I already cannot falsely assert something to their discredit without it coming under tort law, as I understand it. On the other hand, if I say something true and demonstrated to their discredit \\- I don't see that the above clause should restrict me any further than I might already be. Indeed, its intention feels morally wrong (not that that is any part of my question).\n\nMy question is \\- does the existence of that part make any difference to their legal recourse to actions of my own.\n\nBtw: I actually like Amazon at this time and have no intention to attempt to disparage them. My question is purely about the legal status of this clause.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does this non disparagement clause have any legal standing?\n\nEnforcement of that clause has its limitations. The keywords in the clause are *disparage* and *discredit*, each of which warrants a separate analysis.\n\n[Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) defines *disparagement* \\[of goods] as:\n\n> A statement about a competitor's goods which is untrue or misleading\n> and is made to influence or tends to influence the public not to buy.\n\nThat excerpt from the legal definition is the relevant one insofar as the clause is in terms of suppliers' trademarks and the \"*product\\[s] or service\\[s]*\" they offer.\n\nFrom this legal definition, it follows that the non\\-disparagement portion of the clause is enforceable only if (1\\) the source of the statement is an Amazon's competitor, (2\\) the statement is about goods or services offered by Amazon, and (3\\) those statements are untrue or misleading *and* \\-\\-potentially or actually\\-\\- detrimental to Amazon's interests as competitor. Whether or not the publisher qualifies as Amazon's competitor will depend on the factual details. Other than that, competitors' statements about Amazon but *unrelated to* Amazon's products or services are beyond the scope of item (2\\).\n\nAs for *discrediting*, the clause is tantamount to stipulating to a [gag order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order) regardless of how nefarious Amazon's conduct could be. That overly broad portion of the clause can be stricken as null and void to the extent that it is contrary to public policy.

The analysis indicates that the non-disparagement portion of the clause is enforceable only under specific conditions: (1) the source of the statement is an Amazon competitor, (2) the statement is about goods or services offered by Amazon, and (3) those statements are untrue or misleading and potentially or actually detrimental to Amazon's interests as a competitor. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the clause is not fully enforceable in all circumstances. \n\nOption C is incorrect because while parts of the clause (particularly the \"discredit\" portion) may be unenforceable due to public policy concerns, the entire clause is not automatically void.\n\nOption D is incorrect as the clause's enforceability is limited to competitors and specific types of statements, not all individuals or all types of statements."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55355/can-a-dentist-charge-you-without-telling-you-the-price-in-advance-even-though-i", "docs_id": 55355, "title": "Can a dentist charge you without telling you the price in advance even though I asked for it?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just moved from Florida to California.

The fact that the dentist answered that he would tell you *in advance* the price, and yet you allowed him to do the job without him doing so reflects that you knowingly waived the opportunity to timely get that information.

The question is *what* made you think you were acquiring mouth wash when it appears that (1\\) there was little to no communication between you and the dentist, and (2\\) you made no actual attempt to inquire of him so as to make an informed decision. These circumstances weaken your ability to prove that you *reasonably relied* on whatever \\[mis\\-]representations (if any) the dentist might have made to you.\n\nIn a context of omission or concealment of information by the dentist, you would have to prove that the dentist failed his *duty* to make the pertinent disclosure(s). This is known as *silent fraud*. However, it is unclear from your description whether or not the matter amounts to some dentist's duty in this regard.\n\nIt *might* help to argue position from the standpoint of dentist's *unfair and deceptive practice(s)*, a matter which is legislated in pretty much every state in the U.S. But you need to be mindful of the aforementioned obstacles, and persuade that the dentist *de facto* misled you.\n\n> Also, hiring a lawyer would be more expensive.\n\nFor sure.

This dentist used only 15 minutes.\n\nThis comparison in and of itself is irrelevant because one goes to the dentist for a service to be performed, not for a requisite minimum of dentist's time.\n\nThe relevance of time spent on you lies mostly in proving that the dentist was negligent, careless, etc., and resulted in a service that was detrimental to you\\[r health].", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A patient visits a new dentist for a cleaning and is charged $118 for a fluoride treatment without prior notification of the cost.

According to the documentation, the patient bears the risk of the mistake by allowing the dentist to proceed with treatment without obtaining the promised pricing information in advance.

The university stands between the federal government and the professor: the federal government requires things of institutions, which in turn establishes policies that implement those government rules. The statutory link is a restriction on federal funding to violator institutions, via [20 USC 1232g](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1232g). This is fleshed out in [34 CFR 99](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr99_main_02.tpl), and starting with \u00a799\\.30, there is extensive regulation of disclosing information.

The regulations can't discriminate on their face on the basis of race or national origin, even though they can have a discriminatory effect that isn't the principal purpose of the regulations.\n3. The town's regulations can't leave property with no economically viable use whatsoever without paying compensation to the owner.\n4. The town must be able to articulate some basis for the zoning restriction, but pretty much any explanation whatsoever will do (which is to say that this kind of law is subject to the rational basis test).\n5. There are meaningful limitations arising under federal law regarding the extent to which manufactured housing can be treated differently than conventionally build housing under the regulations. In practice, it is easy to adopt neutral regulations that make manufactured housing (i.e. trailer parks) uneconomic.\n6. There are federal regulations that prohibit zoning laws from banning satellite dishes.\n7. Zoning laws can't be changed retroactively. In other words, once something is built that conforms to current zoning laws, it is \"grandfathered\" notwithstanding future changes in the zoning laws, until the building at the site is destroyed or substantially renovated, except in the case of some very extreme and urgent health and safety threats.\n\nSubstantive state regulation of zoning laws is pretty much non\\-existent, although state law may set forth a particular process that must be followed or require the regulations to fit a general template applicable in the state. Usually, however, states don't limit the authority of states to regulate land use at all. Where there is state regulation, this usually prevents regulation of something specific (e.g. political advertisements, a \"right to farm\" provision, prohibiting bans on xeriscaping, etc.).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A town has implemented a zoning ordinance requiring planning board approval for any home addition exceeding 500 square feet, regardless of property size or visibility from public roads. A homeowner with a 10-acre lot, whose house is not visible from any public road, wants to build a 600 square foot addition without seeking approval. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this zoning ordinance and the homeowner's options?\n\nA) The ordinance is illegal because it arbitrarily interferes with property rights, and the homeowner can successfully challenge it in court.\n\nB) The ordinance is legal, but the homeowner can claim an exception based on the size of their lot and the invisibility of their house from public roads.\n\nC) The ordinance is likely legal, and the homeowner would almost certainly lose if they contested it in court, as towns have broad authority to implement zoning restrictions.\n\nD) The ordinance is illegal because it leaves the property with no economically viable use, and the homeowner can seek compensation from the town.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the provided information, towns generally have the right to make arbitrary or pointless zoning restrictions at their whim, with only a few narrow exceptions. The given scenario does not fall under any of these exceptions. The ordinance doesn't completely ban a type of first amendment activity, discriminate based on race or national origin, leave the property with no economically viable use, or violate any of the other specific limitations mentioned. While the homeowner might find the ordinance unnecessary or burdensome, it would likely be considered legal if challenged in court. The town only needs to articulate some basis for the zoning restriction, and almost any explanation would suffice under the rational basis test."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55925/who-needs-to-implement-cookie-consent-for-embedded-content", "docs_id": 55925, "title": "Who needs to implement Cookie Consent for embedded content?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Given a page X that doesn't use cookies or only uses necessary cookies per GDRP and as such, doesn't need explicit Cookie Consent. The X is then modified to include a Youtube video using `<iframe>` element. (Youtube is used here as an example only. This question is about combining content from multiple different hosts in general.)\n\nIt seems that commonly *believed* solution is to require Cookie Consent on the host page. **Why?** The cookie is not set by the host document server. Its value cannot ever be seen by the server providing the host document for the `<iframe>` element even if the server administrator wanted to monitor their users.\n\nTo me, the obvious solution to the problem is that if *the embedded document* wants to save non\\-necessary cookies, *it* should provide the cookie consent before storing such cookies.\n\n**Are there any prior decisions in some jurisdiction that specify that *host document* should request the cookie consent instead?** And if so, how the host document is supposed to transfer information about this consent to embedded content hosting server? It doesn't sound reasonable to me that if your document is embbedded in a `<iframe>` element, you don't ever need the consent to set non\\-necessary cookies.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The **data controller** is responsible for GDPR compliance. For embedded content, case law such as the Fashion ID case indicates a **joint controllership** where both the controller of the embedding page and the controller of the embedded content are controllers. However, one can only be controller for processing activities where one has influence on the means and purposes of processing. So the controller of the embedding page is a controller with respect to the act of embedding (with purposes like *showing a video*), but they wouldn't be a controller for subsequent processing by that embedded content (with purposes like *tracking people across the web*).\n\nFor determining who is a controller, it is not too helpful to look at which servers sent which HTTP headers. Instead, look at which processing activities occur, for what purposes that processing is carried out, and who had input to determining these purposes. Those (natural or legal) persons are data controllers and are therefore responsible for compliance.\n\nWhat does this mean for the example of embedding a Youtube video, Tweet, or Like button?\n\nThe **controller of the embedding page** needs a legal basis for sharing visitor's personal data with the embed provider. Such a sharing is inevitable due to the embedding, regardless of whether cookies are involved. Typically, the legal basis used here would be consent: in place of the embed, a placeholder is shown that lets visitors opt in to loading the content. In some cases, a legitimate interest argument might also work.\n\nWhether the embedded content ends up using cookies is outside of the embedding page's control. Thus, I would think the **controller of the embedded content** would be the sole controller with respect to these cookies. Of course, no consent is required for the use of cookies when this use is strictly necessary to provide the service requested by the user, e.g. to add a video to a logged\\-in user's Youtube history.\n\nThe **joint controllers** can divide up compliance obligations among themselves. For example, the provider of the embed content could likely require embedders to collect necessary consents prior to embedding (Twitter has similar terms). However, this would be risky for the controller because controllers shall be able to demonstrate that valid consent was actually given.\n\nSo in **conclusion**, I largely agree with your analysis that the provider of the embedded content should consider cookie consent. With two caveats: the controllers might have an agreement that moves this responsibility to the embedder, and the embedding data controller might need consent to embed the content in the first place.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner wants to embed a YouTube video on their page, which previously didn't require cookie consent.

The website owner (embedder) is considered a controller for the act of embedding and sharing visitor data with YouTube, but not for YouTube's subsequent processing activities. The website owner needs a legal basis (typically consent) for sharing visitor data through embedding, while YouTube would be responsible for its own cookie usage and subsequent processing.

As the court says, there was a contract and \"the patron was not entitled to the bonus under those rules\", and plaintiff \"failed to prove the necessary elements of either promissory or equitable estoppel\". They did not \"represent to her that a bonus would be available if she played the \ngame\", and did not \"promise to pay the $41 million after the notice was displayed\".\n\nThe (very complex) rules of the game are easily available on the machine, and there is a prominent disclaimer that \"MALFUNCTION VOIDS ALL PAYS AND PLAYS\". Under the rules, the winning configuration stated that she was entitled to $1\\.85\\. The problem was that it also announced \"Bonus Award \\- $41797550\\.16\". This was due to an inexplicable software error which in communicating with the central computer awarded a \"legacy bonus\", which is no part of the game in question. The maximum legacy bonus is $99999\\.99; the manufacturer knows of the possibility of this kind of error and has implemented a fix that is thought to eliminate the problem.\n\nThe first point then is that the casino didn't just claim there was a malfunction, they proved that there was one. Second, the terms of the contract hold: she was entitled to $1\\.85, and the extraneous message was not part of the contract. That is, she did not actually win the large payout, the malfunction was in saying that she received a bonus.

So I am seeking a legal (\"if you violate, I can sue\") way to disallow these actions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Terms of service are contracts, where you grant a person a right in exchange for them doing something. If they have agreed but violate the terms, you may have legal recourse to sue them; or you can \"undo\" their action, e.g. you can delete porn that they uploaded. There are certain limitations on your recourse, for example you cannot fine a user $100 for posting a snarky comment, and this comes from contract law (no penalty clauses).\n\nRegardless of the copyright status of any code you have running on your machine, you can set legal limits on how a program on your web page can be uses, for example you can stipulate \"cannot be used for commercial purposes\". The legal challenge would be for the provider to prove that they were actually harmed by the user's breach of contract: usually, the violator is just banned, which doesn't take a lawsuit. An indemnification clause is useful because it can require the user to take responsibility for legal damages that the user causes to you (for example, if they post defamatory content, they can be forced to cover your losses arising from the defamation lawsuit). You might have a hard time suing a person for making a snarky comment online, although the damage could be that it causes your snark\\-free forum reputation and attendant customer base to evaporate.\n\nIf your program transfers money from a user account to a specified target account and the TOS requires the user to have money in the account but the software doesn't check the account, then \"writing a rubber e\\-check\" would be a violation of the TOS and would cause damage, so you could sue. (For the sake of keeping this maximally related to the question you ask, I ignore the probability that online financial transactions are highly likely to be subject to other specific laws).\n\nThe comments suggests a complication, that there are two TOS's involved. There can be a front\\-end server that has a TOS, and that server can \"silently\" call on a separate server with its other TOS. If your TOS and use of the third party server is consistent with the third party TOS, there is no problem. If you are using the third party server illegally, you bear the liability and your customers do not (unless you are clear about the nature of the third party TOS and that you disclaim responsibility for lawsuits arising from the customer's illegal use of the service). It is unlikely that the situation will arise, since the customer has no agreement with the third party that they breached.

While the developer cannot directly control the smart contract once it's deployed on a third-party platform, they can create Terms of Service (ToS) for its usage. These ToS act as a contract between the developer and users, potentially allowing for legal recourse if violated. However, the developer may face challenges in proving actual damages from ToS violations, which is crucial for successful legal action. Options A and D are incorrect because the open-source nature of the contract doesn't allow for direct code modifications or automatic restrictions. Option B is too extreme, as the developer does have some legal options through ToS, even if enforcement may be challenging."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1023/why-are-judges-allowed-to-read-news-and-media-opinions", "docs_id": 1023, "title": "Why are judges allowed to read news and media opinions?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I find it interesting that apparently judges are allowed to read news and opinions about the litigation in front of them, whereas juries would not be.\n\nWhy is there such a distinction, and are there any limitations to ensure fair rulings?\n\nFor example, this is regarding [Citing previous Malibu Media\u2019s sheer abuse of court process, New York judge denies early discovery](http://fightcopyrighttrolls.com/2015/07/06/citing-previous-malibu-medias-sheer-abuse-of-court-process-new-york-judge-denies-early-discovery/) (via [DSLR: King v.

What are the implications of spreading fake news legally?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on who the news is being spread about and how you do it. If the person or persons (including a company) are not publically known or not generally known to the general public prior to the news spread, Libel/Slander is easier to prove. However, if the targeted person is a \"public entity\" it can be harder to prove.\n\nEven then, the burden of proof is not on you to prove that the statement is true, but them to prove it is untrue. In addition, if you are a \"public entity\" you must prove that there was actual malice behind the reporting OR that you knew it was false and did not then stop reporting it. Additionally, you must prove that this false reporting lead to damages to you and associations (though this is the easy part).\n\nA good number of quality journalists will use attribution of potentially false statements (for an organization that has such a terrible relationship with the President, CNN has a lot of sources \"Close to the President\") or that some people are saying (on Wikipedia, this gets a great big \\[who?] if an editor sees this in an article.

This allows the defendant (respondant? It's a civil lawsuit) to challenge the entire suit on the grounds that the person suing is doing so to get you to shut up about an issue and not because of any meritorious libel or slander accusation. This requires the judge to decide if the case has merit and if it doesn't drop it entirely.\n\nAnd finally, in the United States, we also have Anti\\-Libel Tourism laws. This means that we will not extradite anyone (citizen or not) to a country on any Libel/Slander charges UNLESS those same charges can be won in a US court.

It would be common for the design firm to retain ownership of the web code, and license it to the client. ownership of the domain and the site would be more likely to go to the client, but the design firm could retain all or any of these, if that was the agreement.

But how does this absence of official *stare decisis* explain the grey sentence overhead? \n<https://imgur.com/ZEKyLhx> may help. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First off, let me confirm that this text accurately describes the reality.\n\nSecond, this is less far afield from the common law than you would think. If you are in a jurisdiction without any binding case law on a particular point, a so called \"question of first impression\", you then turn to persuasive authority.\n\nPersuasive authority includes case law that is binding in some other jurisdiction and legal scholarship, often in the form of a treatise or commentary. And, it is much easier to find an answer in a treatise which is carefully arranged on a subject matter basis, than to do case law research from other jurisdictions. This is particularly true when you have not devoted a lot of time to learning how to find the needle of the law you want in the haystack of the mountain of decided cases on all available subject. \n\nThe very difficult task of case law research was only possible on more than an isolated hit or miss basis at all in common law systems where case law matters in the years before the 1980s when computerized case law word searching started to become possible at an affordable to lawyers price, because a lot of full time institutional actors devote a great deal of time and money to developing and maintaining tools like digests, citation indexes, and annotations to statutes to allow practitioners to locate that case law.\n\nIf court decisions don't serve as binding precedents, those institutions aren't developed. For example, in common law countries, until very recently, there were no good resources for locating trial court decisions and rulings in state courts which handle the bulk of litigation, but whose rulings are not binding precedents. (Electronic record keeping in trial courts has changed the economics of this practice and made it much more common to publish trial court decisions and to index them appropriately.)\n\nSo, if persuasive authority in your legal system in the form of non\\-binding case law is hard to find because it wasn't worth the money for the legal system to collectively develop the resources to publish and index it on a systematic basis for an audience of pretty much the entire legal profession, the other form of persuasive authority, legal treatises, becomes much more influential by default.\n\nYou see something similar in very early legal opinion writing by American judges before the institutions necessary to systemically utilize case law precedents was developed. Judges were constantly citing treatises like Blackstone, which is something they rarely do now, because that was what was on their bookshelf.\n\nFurther, there are feedback effects. Smart people who wish to influence the law for society without going the legislative route in common law countries will often seek careers as judges. But, absent the psychic perk of influencing the law and making a difference in society, a lot of the most ambitious people in the judiciary in a common law system will choose instead to go the route of academia and seek to become law professors where they can have a similar influence, while earning similar pay and having more time off and freedom to pursue your own personal and professional interests.\n\nSo, in systems where legal precedents aren't binding, people who might otherwise be inclined to write probing legal opinions that develop legal concepts are less inclined to become judges, and the people who do become judges care more about getting the right result and less about explaining their decisions in a way that will influence future judges in the same circumstances.\n\nFinally, consider that many civil law legal systems involve countries with a lot less appellate litigation than the United States (currently 330 million people with more than 200 years of case law), or the UK (currently 60 million people with about 1000 years of case law), or India (more than 1 billion people with a couple of centuries of case law, since colonial precedents have relevance).\n\nSuppose that you live in Denmark or Belgium or Portugal or Costa Rica or South Korea, where your population is much lower and your time frame during which your legal system has been in place is not as long.\n\nIn a situation like that, half a dozen or a dozen leading legal scholars can publish treatises over ten or twenty years that are going to cover, somewhere, the lion's share of the pressing issues in the legal system, and there is probably only one law school in the entire country, so it is quite likely that most of the lawyers in the entire country took contracts or property or family law from the the same people in law school, which makes them predisposed to consider a treatise written by that professor a credible one in that area of law. And, all other sources are a comparative vacuum.\n\nIf you are a judge, why cite non\\-binding precedents from your fellow non\\-specialist judge in a country that simply has no precedents in many areas of law and has fewer carefully reasoned ones, when you could instead look for guidance from the person who taught you this area of law in the first place and literally \"wrote the book\" and who was probably consulted by the government in any recent amendments to relevant civil code or statute of broad general applicability. And, once you start out using those methods, it becomes habitual and legal treatises become very influential.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In civil law systems, legal scholars tend to have more influence on the interpretation of civil codes than judges do.

In civil law systems, the absence of binding precedent (stare decisis) leads to a greater reliance on academic legal treatises for guidance. This is because:\n\n1.

However, in this particular case you need to take a preliminary step regardless of your jurisdiction, which I assume is somewhere in the U.S. *Prior to* filing any complaint (and I will repeat this below), it is in your best interest that you demand a retraction *and* removal of the defamatory falsehood. Be sure to show the prospective defendant(s) some proof that supports your pre\\-suit demand.\n\nYou need to secure your ability to prove in court that you made that demand. For that reason, your requests should be in writing (email, and certified mail if practicable). If it is not by email, you should have the addressee at least sign a receipt copy of your demand letter.\n\nA demand of retraction is prerequisite in jurisdictions such as Texas and Florida. If you \\[or your lawyer] omit that step, the court will easily dismiss your complaint altogether. In other jurisdictions, such as Michigan, the request of retraction is a requirement only if you intend to pursue *exemplary and punitive damages*. See [MCL 600\\.2911(2\\)(b)](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(tk433kjllzeh4ksykna5zsqf))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-600-2911). Regardless of the jurisdiction, your request or demand to each prospective defendant needs to be made *prior to* filing the corresponding complaint/pleadings in court.\n\nEven if your jurisdiction does not have that prerequisite, failing to request a retraction and removal of the defamatory falsehoods would allow the defendant to justify itself and/or obtain leniency on the basis that it was not aware that the registry information turned out to be disproved/inaccurate.\n\nIn your complaint(s), you will pursue *injunctive relief* that consists of ordering the removal \\[from each website or post] of the defamatory falsehoods. It is also reasonable for you to also ask for monetary relief.\n\nYou certainly have a claim of *defamation per se*, but a ruling granting you an award of *substantive damages* is doubtful unless the defendant refuses \\-\\-or neglects\\-\\- to remove the inaccurate records. If the website owners/authors promptly remove the false records, it is going to be difficult or impossible to prove *actual malice*: that is, that they published the falsehoods (1\\) despite knowing them to be false, or (2\\) with reckless disregard of their truth.\n\nWithout the ability to prove *actual malice* or that you suffered *special damages* (whether it is a loss of employment or other economic damages), the court would only grant you *nominal damages*, which is the negligible amount of one dollar.\n\nLastly, beware that even the granting of injunctive relief might be ineffective. I \\[vaguely] recall a case where federal court ordered a removal from sex offender registry, but apparently the defendant ignored the order. I have no idea how much the plaintiff's lawyer charged him for the futile representation, but the last time I checked neither the problem was fixed nor did it appear that the attorney pushed any further to ensure compliance with the order.

But that would be it and would only be available if the company actually did suffer economic harm from being wrongfully bond by the contract.\n\nThe disqualified person could also be criminally prosecuted for entering into the contract.\n\nNow, some kinds of improperly entered into contracts aren't subject to a rule as unyielding or harsh as the apparent authority rule, and I wouldn't be shocked if Australian courts chose to deviate from the apparent authority rule in this particular case.\n\nFor example, another possible analogy would be a case where a minor enters into an executory contract (i.e. one that is not fully performed by both parties contemporaneously when it is entered into like a purchase of goods at a retail store), that is not for \"necessities\", rather than under the agent without authority to act under internal corporate allocation of responsibility to employees analogy.\n\nIn the contract by a minor case, the contract improperly entered into by the minor is not automatically void *ab initio*, but it is \"voidable\" by the minor. In other words, the contract could be undone, or there could be a defense to a lawsuit to enforce the contract, if the minor, properly represented by a guardian, wanted to do so.\n\nContracts entered into under duress, through fraud in the inducement, and as an abuse of a confidential relationship, for example, are similarly not \"void *ab intio*\", but are \"voidable\" in the same way as a contract entered into by a minor who did not have the capacity to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, if some random third\\-party in an act of outright fraud, who has no connection to the company, purports to sign a contract on behalf of the company, that contract is void *ab initio* and has absolutely no force or effect. This is treated legally as if the purported contract formation never happened and can't be enforced by either party to the contract.\n\nI don't have access to Australian legal authorities sufficient to determine definitively if this situation under this particular Australian statute is governed by the apparent authority rule of agency law, or by the voidable contract rule that applies to other contracts with legal subject\\-matters which are entered into improperly. But, the basic legal theories involved and the main possible legal conclusions are ubiquitous for how the common law of contracts and agency handles this situation in all common law countries where statutes don't expressly provide otherwise.\n\n> Does the answer depend on whether B \"allowed\" A to illegally act on\n> its behalf (for example, because A was the sole director and\n> shareholder)? Would it be different if there were other directors who\n> tried to stop A from purporting to act on behalf of B?\n\nSomewhat. If B allowed A to illegal act on its behalf, it would probably be governed by the apparent authority rule.

To illustrate the question I think it's best to use a specific example.\n\nA friend of mine responded to an ad on craiglists for shared housing. It was agreed upon, one of the roommates would be the acting landlord (rent would be paid to him and he would be responsible for the up keep of the house). No paper work was signed. A week after everyone moved in, the actual land lord (the owner of the house), has everyone co\\-sign a lease.\n\nIs it legal for the landlord to request the tenants sign a lease a week after moving in and if it is, could the landlord evict if a tenant refuses to sign? What if only the one tenant who had said he would be acting as the landlord had already signed it, but the actual owner wants everyone to sign now? If relevant, I'm talking about one lease with everyone's names on it (not individual leases). \n\nI understand if someone rents and moves in before signing the lease, the landlord can kick them out if they don't agree to the lease, but I'm wondering if different if they've already lived there a week? \n\nThis is assuming none except the \"acting landlord\" had signed any lease (though the verbal agreement was only the acting landlord would have to). \n\nThis is for B.C. Canada.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To begin, it is always legal to request the signing of a contractual arrangement in this type of circumstance; however, it is not your duty to assent to this so long as the original tenant had the right to sublet or take on roommates. Without having signed the new lease, you (all the new tenants not on the lease) would just be tenants\\-at\\-will. This occurs when an occupant has rented a premises without a lease but pays rent at a set interval (typically monthly). The agreement for a Tenancy\\-at\\-Will may be either written or verbal. Just because a rental agreement is in writing does not make it a lease. \n\nEither the landlord or tenant may terminate this arrangement by giving written notice 30 days or one full rental period in advance, whichever is longer. In a situation where you rented from a renter, I would want to have the assent of the landlord, as no reason is required to terminate by either party. This should be done in writing either by certified mail or have the landlord sign it, if you are presenting it in person. If rent is paid the first of each month, notice should be given prior to the first day of the month. \n\nMany landlords are fond of tenancies\\-at\\-will because they maintain the ability to terminate a rental at any time with only a month's notice, without needing a reason. This is their prerogative for even petty reasons (e.g., they don't like your friends, or the hours you keep). This is especially true with a roommate situation, where the original lessee has a lease and is subletting rooms, because the lessor has someone on the hook for a time certain (the original lessee), but if the roommates get annoying for whatever reason to either the landlord or the lessee, you can be given a 30 day notice for a great many reasons that a lease cannot control and are not viable reasons to evict. A lease is for a duration certain, after which, the renter would either move, sign another lease, or in the case where they stayed on past the end date and continued to pay (and landlord continued to accept) rent, it would just become a tenancy\\-at\\-will. \n\nIn many ways a lease protects the renter just as much as it does the landlord, because moving is expensive and (except in very limited circumstances) the renter is guaranteed being able to keep the rental until the lease ends, so long as they pay rent and do not violate the lease or local statute(s), which would subject them to eviction. This would be beneficial in a roommate situation as it takes the power to give notice or evict away from the original lessee who sublet the rooms. \n\nIt is important to understand that just because there is a writing does not necessarily mean it is a lease. Many landlords who don't want the time constraint of a lease still like to affirm in writing basic issues like date of rent due, pets, etc. It is just cleaner than a verbal agreement. \n\nSo, in your hypothetical, the landlord could ask the new renters to (co)sign a new lease, join the existing lease, or just sign a rental agreement as a Tenant\\-at\\-Will, even though the tenancy has already begun. The renter is not obligated to sign any writing at this point. However, if the renter refuses and if the landlord insists, the landlord would likely exercise their right to terminate by serving a 30 day notice to quit. Having already taken possession, you would also be in a good position to negotiate the terms, which could be to your benefit, so it is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nRegarding eviction, that would only be an option to the landlord if you failed to vacate *if* a 30 day notice to quit was issued and you didn't move (or of course, as with any renter, if actions that would always allow the landlord the right to seek eviction occur, like failure to pay rent). I would not be concerned about showing you have a right to be there as you likely had to pay rent to move in and your check is proof that the tenancy began, and other things like having a key, etc., support your position if it ever came to that and you had paid cash. If you do ever pay cash, get a receipt.\n\nIf, hypothetically, the new renters sign a lease, I would want to make sure it is for the room and not the whole so that liability (at least for rent) is limited if others default.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In British Columbia, Canada, a group of roommates moved into a shared house based on a verbal agreement with one roommate acting as the \"acting landlord\".

In this situation, the roommates who moved in without signing a lease are considered tenants-at-will. They have the right to stay in the property as long as they pay rent, even without a formal lease. However, in a tenancy-at-will arrangement, either the landlord or tenant can terminate the agreement by providing written notice 30 days or one full rental period in advance, whichever is longer.

I believe many US states also have related laws about harassment, menacing, etc.\n\nHowever, the job of security personnel seems to be primarily to discourage activities by being present as deterrent against such crimes. Their mere presence is not a threat or assault of course, but if they are attempting to deter someone from acting in negative manner the security personnel would likely have to get close to the person and make demands that they leave or stop whatever activity their engaged in in a manner that could be considered a threat of force if they don't comply.\n\nTo go with a particular difficult example think of a bouncer at a bar. More then most security personnel a bouncers job is practically defined by their ability to loom. My father owned a bar, and as he described it to me a good bouncer should be identifying someone who's likely to cause an incident and basically pre\\-emptively start looming nearby them to remind the inebriated fellow that the bouncer is ready to use physical force if necessary in hopes of preventing a situation from occurring. Likewise breaking up a minor fight often involves a good amount of getting between the two fighting and looking menacing enough that no one want's to try to go around you. Basically you *want* your bouncer to be able to menace people when a situation is escalating because it's a far safer way of preventing the escalation then allowing it to degreed to violence.\n\nIs a bouncer, or other security individual, guilty of assault or related crime when they do something like this? Does the fact that they are employed by a business with the explicit task of keeping the peace give them any extra leeway with such actions? Is the fact that they are trying to prevent/discourage other crimes give them more leeway?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The above is not quite accurate. \n\nFirst, assault. The correct [definition](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/assault_and_battery) is \"a threat or physical act that creates a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact.\" Therefore, no attempt at a battery is necessary. Rather, simply making someone subjectively believe that you are about to commit a battery against them is enough for an assault charge. Please note the following [two points](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/assault). One, that apprehension does not mean fear. Apprehension means that the victim has to believe that the actor's conduct will result in imminent harmful or offensive contact. Two, it's not necessary that the victim believes such conduct will actually be effective \\- rather, he only has to believe the conduct is \"capable\" of making the contact. \n\nI can't tell if by \"other security personnel\" you mean, in addition to bouncers, say, security at concerts or if you mean private security guards, such as ones who guard warehouses or other businesses. \n\nNonetheless, for the warehouse/business \"guards,\" they do not have a special privilege above or beyond what any random person may do. That is, you may use force to the extent you reasonably believe necessary to prevent a felony, riot, or serious breach of the peace. You may use deadly force only if it appears reasonably necessary to prevent a \"dangerous felony\" involving risk to human life, including, for example, robbery, arson, burglary. \n\n[However,](http://law.jrank.org/pages/1687/Police-Private-Police-Industrial-Security-Legal-authority.html) if the private security personnel are operating under authority vested to them by local ordinance or the state legislature, then their rights (and also any attendant restrictions, such as those provided to citizens under the Fourth Amendment) would apply instead. \n\nSo where's [the difference](https://nationalparalegal.edu/public_documents/courseware_asp_files/criminalLaw/defenses/UseofForce.asp)? It comes about at the standard a situation must meet to allow use of deadly force. A police officer can use deadly force to effectuate an arrest based on a reasonable belief that a suspect has committed a felony involving the risk of physical harm or death to others (murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, rape or burglary) or if there is substantial risk that the suspect was dangerous to the point that he may cause serious physical harm or death to someone if the arrest were delayed.\n\nOn the other hand, as a private citizen, you may only use deadly force when attempting to effectuate an arrest if the suspect did indeed commit such a felony. Police can base their action on a reasonable belief and even if that belief is wrong, they will be safe from prosecution. A private citizen actually must be right about the suspect having committed the requisite crime. No matter how reasonable the belief was of a private citizen regarding a suspect, if that suspect did not actually commit the crime, the private citizen who used such force will be subject to prosecution. \n\n[Bouncers](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/what-are-bouncers-legally-allowed-to-do.html) are afforded no more rights than private citizens. They can issue verbal warnings, ask a patron to leave the establishment, check identification, refuse entry, call the cops, protect bystanders from violence, break up fights, and respond with equal force if necessary.

Bouncers are not afforded any special legal privileges beyond those of private citizens. They can issue verbal warnings and ask patrons to leave the establishment, which is essentially what the bouncer is doing here. While the patron may feel intimidated, the bouncer has not made any specific threats or attempted physical contact, which would be required for an assault charge. The bouncer is acting to prevent a potential escalation of the situation, which is within his rights as long as he doesn't use excessive force or make specific threats. Option A is incorrect because the bouncer's actions don't quite meet the threshold for assault. Option B is wrong because bouncers don't have special legal privileges.

This decision was based on the First Amendment protection of an individual's right to hold a point of view different from the majority and to refuse to foster an idea they find objectionable. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Court explicitly stated that majority agreement is not the test for determining whether a slogan can be required. \n\nOption B is too narrow, as the ruling applies to anyone who disagrees with the slogan, not just those with religious objections. \n\nOption C goes too far, as the ruling doesn't prohibit states from putting slogans on plates, but rather protects an individual's right to cover them. \n\nOption D correctly captures the essence of the Court's decision, which protects the right of all citizens to cover up state slogans on their license plates if they choose to do so, regardless of their specific reasons for disagreement."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41538/what-is-the-best-way-to-proceed-with-a-legal-action-against-us-company-from-abro", "docs_id": 41538, "title": "What is the best way to proceed with a legal action against US company from abroad?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Some time ago I have signed a contract with Premiere (Premiere Event, Rise of the Phoenix Inc, NYS Corporation) with Michael D Palance as Director, US company which is looking for young talents through talent auditions while they were on their trip to Europe.

Since the laws defining the nature of harassment are different in east, west and middle east nations, how are these cases resolved assuming that both the states where the case has occurred and that to which the diplomat belongs are not permanent members of Security Council of UN nor any of them have nuclear capability. They also do not share any part of their respective state boundaries.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Diplomatic immunity is a privilege granted by the host or receiving country to an ambassador of another nation recognized diplomatic agents and their families. It exists under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, so there is a set of rules everyone has to play by. The idea is so that host countries do not legally harass people who are representing their country within that nation.\n\nTypically Diplomatic immunity comes up most often in traffic enforcement, as cars with Diplomatic plates tend to violate traffic and parking laws regularly. That said, the police of the host nation are allowed to ticket the offender. However, there's little they can do to enforce the fines against the ambassador after the ticket is written. That said, most police will still write them as some nation's foreign services offices do actually make the diplomats pay the tickets (in fact, an unofficial barometer of corruption in a nation's government is how likely diplomats are to pay their tickets.).\n\nThat said, committing a serious crime while under diplomatic immunity is a major international incident. The receiving country will perceive the crime as an endorsement of the sending nation. The most immediate remedy is the sending nation waives Diplomatic immunity, at which point the receiving nation can prosecute.\n\nThere are times where this doesn't happen (often the sending nation and recieving nation punish the crime differently) at which point one of three things will happen. Either the sending nation will recall the diplomat (effectively removing them from their job) and punish them based on their own laws, if any exist.\n\nIf that is not done, the receiving nation can declare the diplomat as *Persona non Grata* (lit. Unwelcomed Person) which is effectively a person specific ban on entry into the country (the sending nation can send whoever they want to be a diplomat... but that specific person cannot enter the receiving country.). As such, the diplomat who is named PNG is given some amount of time to leave the receiving country or have their diplomatic immunity revoked. It's the international equivalent of \"You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.\"\n\nIf neither of those work, than the receiving nation can cut off diplomatic ties, and in some cases has a good cause for war over the matter (A diplomat who Murders the citizen of a host nation and isn't recalled or has their immunity waived has just committed an assassination's sanctioned by the sending nation, which is a justification for war.).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A diplomat from Country A is accused of sexual harassment in Country B.

Which of the following is the most appropriate and likely course of action according to international diplomatic norms?\n\nA) Country B can immediately arrest and prosecute the diplomat, as sexual harassment is a serious crime that overrides diplomatic immunity.\n\nB) Country B should declare the diplomat persona non grata, forcing them to leave the country within a specified time frame.\n\nC) Country B should request Country A to waive the diplomat's immunity. If refused, Country B can then unilaterally revoke the immunity and prosecute.\n\nD) Country B has no recourse and must allow the diplomat to continue their duties without any consequences.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate action in this scenario is for Country B to declare the diplomat persona non grata (PNG). This is because:\n\n1. Diplomatic immunity is a privilege that protects diplomats from prosecution in the host country, even for serious crimes.\n\n2. The host country (Country B) cannot unilaterally revoke diplomatic immunity or immediately prosecute the diplomat.\n\n3. While requesting a waiver of immunity from Country A is an option, it's not guaranteed that Country A will agree.\n\n4. Declaring the diplomat persona non grata is within Country B's rights and doesn't require Country A's cooperation.\n\n5. This action effectively forces the diplomat to leave the country within a specified timeframe, addressing the immediate issue without violating international diplomatic norms.\n\n6. It also sends a strong diplomatic message without escalating the situation to a severe international incident.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they violate the principles of diplomatic immunity. Option D is incorrect because it suggests there are no consequences, which is not true given the available diplomatic tools like declaring PNG."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74573/clever-probate-fraud-uk-how-did-he-do-it", "docs_id": 74573, "title": "Clever Probate Fraud (UK) - How Did He Do It?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I\u2019m hoping someone can help me understand [this clever bit of probate fraud.](https://www.angliaresearch.co.uk/articles/fraudulent-wills-and-probate-fraud-clues/)\n\nIn summary:\n\n> Swindler made fake wills for sailors who had died intestate leaving\n> high value estates.

A bank had it. A former lawyer of the person had it. A military colleague had it. A landlord or storage unit company found it.\n\nNote also that the probate court sees only the will, and doesn't hear the whole story of how it was found, in the absence of a will contest or a will not executed with the usual formalities as these wills would have appeared on their face to have.\n\nAnd, if the notices to disinherited family members are not actually delivered (not mailed or mailed to bad addresses), the disinherited family doesn't show up to contest the matter until the finder's fee has been collected, the fraudster is nowhere to be found, and the charity has received the money and is being asked to refund it.\n\n> Would he have to have somehow had access to the deceased's property\n> after their death?\n\nNo. Often a will in not stored with someone's other property.

(doesn't\n> the administrator do research?)\n\nIf the witnesses signatures are notarized, the witnesses aren't interrogated unless there is a contest. Frequently, they are law office or bank employees who witness many wills and may not have a very specific recollection. The notary's authenticity wouldn't usually be checked unless there was a dispute as to the will's authenticity raised by some interested party.\n\n> Once he had convinced the right people/organisations, who would have\n> been responsible for selling the deceased\u2019s assets, and paying the\n> money to the charities in the will?\n\nThe executor of the estate appointed by the court.

A finder's fee recipient can be paid and gone by then. A recipient of the inheritance under a forged will can be forced to disgorge it to the rightful heirs. Money laundering of the finder's fees received would be a necessary component of the scheme if it is to be successful.\n\nThis was a pretty successful \"long con\".

Tenant rents out a house which comes with a washer\\+dryer.\n2. Lease specifically stipulates that Tenant is welcome to use washer/dryer but that Owner is not responsible for fixing them if they break.\n3. Tenant moves in and discovers that the washing machine is, in fact, broken (it never worked even before Tenant moved in)\n4. Conveniently, Owner recently purchased the property and has a seller's warranty available, which will cover repairs on the appliances (including washer/dryer)\n5. In an attempt to be helpful, Owner calls the company that provides the warranty. The washer is declared dead and a new washing machine is provided by said company.\n6. The warranty requires a deductible for this replacement. Since Owner declared that they would not be responsible for fixing the washer/dryer, they refuse to pay the deductible for the visit. Tenant pays for the deductible on Owner's Warranty.\n7. If it matters, the deductible is less than the cost of the replacement washing machine.\n\nIn short, the owner stated they would not pay for repairs or replacement on washer/dryer.

The tenant's payment does not transfer ownership rights, as the appliance is part of the rental property. The lease clause stating the landlord is not responsible for repairs may be unenforceable depending on local tenancy laws, but this doesn't change ownership.

But say you have a huge big rig or something. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the U.S., this almost certainly depends on jurisdiction. My understanding is that many places have laws that provide only basic default speed limits and require drivers drive at prudent and safe speeds. Violating posted limits constitutes prima facie evidence that your speed is not reasonable or safe, but the offense isn't that you were doing X in a Y. Given that, the exact placement of the sign might not even be meaningful. The real question is where the conditions which warrant a reduction in speed begin, and whether your speed was prudent and safe at the time the alleged violation occurs.\n\nUnder this theory, if the speed limit were changing for no good reason and you could prove it in court, you might beat the ticket. I wouldn't bet a large amount of money on such a venture being successful.\n\nPerhaps an interesting legal question is at what point the posted limit creates the conditions for recorded speed becoming prima facie evidence of imprudent or unsafe driving. Again, my gut says that the zone begins as soon as:\n\n* a reasonable man driving at a prudent and safe speed in the same situation would become aware of the posted limit; and\n* the conditions which justify the reduction in speed (a curve, intersection, construction, etc.) occur", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A driver is operating a large semi-truck on a highway where the speed limit changes from 65 mph to 55 mph.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The driver is definitely not in violation because the rear of the vehicle was at the new speed limit when passing the sign.\n\nB) The driver is definitely in violation because the front of the vehicle was above the new speed limit when passing the sign.\n\nC) The legality depends on the specific jurisdiction and whether the speed was prudent and safe for the existing conditions.\n\nD) The driver cannot be ticketed because there is a grace period for large vehicles to slow down after a speed limit change.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As discussed in the documentation, the legality of speed limit violations often depends on the specific jurisdiction and whether the driver's speed was prudent and safe for the existing conditions. Many places focus on whether the speed was reasonable and safe, rather than solely on the exact point where a vehicle crosses a speed limit sign. The placement of the sign might not be the determining factor; instead, courts may consider where the conditions warranting a speed reduction begin and whether the driver's speed was appropriate for those conditions. Additionally, posted speed limits often serve as prima facie evidence of the safe speed, but other factors may be considered in determining if a violation occurred."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83640/how-can-a-minor-own-and-operate-an-llc-with-as-little-adult-involvement-as-possi", "docs_id": 83640, "title": "How can a minor own and operate an LLC with as little adult involvement as possible?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Note: I am going to talk to a lawyer before I actually do this, but I would like to have some idea of the best option before I start.\n\nIf a minor wants to start a business selling things on eBay as an LLC, how can the LLC be set up so the minor does as much of the work as possible, receives as much of the money as possible, and pays as much of the taxes as possible, with a parent involved as needed for legal requirements?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your guardian (usually your parent) can practically override anything you do.

Minors generally cannot form LLCs or enter into binding contracts, and eBay refuses to contract with minors. However, parents can set up an LLC and contract with eBay while allowing the minor to do the work. This arrangement lets the minor operate the business, potentially receive profits (through a bank account in their name), and gain experience, all while the parents maintain legal responsibility.

What are the regulations for such products and how does one create documentation for such artefacts in family possession where no provenance has ever been needed ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The regulations are in [50 CFR Part 17](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=50:2.0.1.1.1&rgn=div5). This is about 300 pages long, and there is no single answer \u2013 you have to investigate in a case by case manner. African elephant ivory, as an example, is covered in \u00a717\\.40(e).

Assume that the item is an \"antique\", which is defined (regardless of species) in [16 USC 1539(h)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1539). The requirement is that the item\n\n> (A) is not less than 100 years of age; (B) is composed in whole or in\n>  part of any endangered species or threatened species listed under\n>  section 1533 of this title; (C) has not been repaired or modified with\n>  any part of any such species on or after December 28, 1973; and (D) is\n>  entered at a port designated under paragraph (3\\).\n\nParagraph (3\\) says that\n\n> The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary\n>  of the Interior, shall designate one port within each customs region\n>  at which articles described in paragraph (1\\)(A), (B), and (C) must be\n>  entered into the customs territory of the United States.\n\nSo it could be anywhere, subject to change. \n\nAs for documentation, [this document](https://www.fws.gov/international/pdf/final-rule-african-elephant-4d.pdf), which is the final rules for a change in rules pertaining to African elephant ivory, has a section *Comments on documentation requirements*.

An exemption is permitted for these vehicles because they are typically used for short journeys, in both time and distance, undertaken at moderate speeds on urban routes.

There are personal data. Company XYZ, which used this room earlier, claims that this data does not belong to it and that it is not the controller. Does ABC temporarily become their controller in the sense of the GDPR and is therefore obliged to take certain actions as described in GDPR to protect this data? Or maybe ABC is not the controller and the protection of these found data results from completely different legal acts?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A simple box full of documents might not be [in scope](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-2-gdpr/) of the GDPR, unless it can be considered (a part of) a filing system (for example because it is sorted). Just for the sake of argument, let's assume this box is in scope of the GDPR.\n\nIf the company decides to store the box for a while, it is basically processing personal data, because storing is included in the definition in [Art. 4(2\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/). So it looks to me at that moment the company becomes a controller.\n\nHowever, probably some exceptions would apply. In particular is the box contains personal data of many different people, [Art. 14](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/) does probably not apply, because it would involve a disproportionate effort to inform all data subjects.\n\nFinding such a box is a personal data breach. Although it is caused by the previous (unknown) controller, I think the company has to notify this personal data breach to a supervisory authority. \n\nIf the company would decide to destruct the box and it's content, it would not change anything, because destruction of personal data is also processing. The destruction itself might even be a personal data breach, for example if there is no other copy of the documents.\n\nNote that similar responsibilities arise if something valuable which is not personal data is found.

By finding the box, ABC has encountered a personal data breach.

They should also securely store the documents to prevent further unauthorized access.\n\nOption D is incorrect because XYZ has denied ownership, and returning the documents without verifying ownership could potentially expose the personal data to unauthorized parties.\n\nThis question tests understanding of GDPR controller responsibilities, data breach notification requirements, and the complexities of handling unexpectedly acquired personal data."}}
