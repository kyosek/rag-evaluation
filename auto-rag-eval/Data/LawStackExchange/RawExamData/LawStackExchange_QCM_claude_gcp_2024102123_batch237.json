In Finland where I'm from, the charge for causing a death in any way is always a criminal charge; you can't start a civil suit over it (as far as I know).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: They are two different courts, with different standards of proof. In a criminal court, the standard of proof is \"guilty beyond any reasonable doubt\". In a civil court, the standard of proof is \"more likely guilty than not guilty\". Actually, in a civil court it's not \"guilty\", it's often \"liable for damages\". \n\nIt's obvious that there will always be cases where the evidence lies somewhere between these two. \n\nConsider what the reasons for both court cases are: In the first case, it's the state against you. The state doesn't suffer any injustice if you are not convicted, and the state is very powerful, that's why the standard of proof is high. In a civil court, you have often two private persons fighting it out. If you are correctly accused of breaking my arm and I sue you for damages, then if you are not convicted, I am suffering a broken arm and all the associated pain and cost. A standard as high as in a criminal court would be entirely unfair towards the victim.",

Simpson case and the differences between criminal and civil proceedings, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The criminal trial found O.J. Simpson guilty, while the civil trial found him not liable.\n\nB) Both criminal and civil courts use the same standard of proof: \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nC) In a civil court, the plaintiff must prove their case \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" to win damages.\n\nD) A civil court can find a defendant liable for damages even if they were acquitted in a criminal trial.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the key difference between criminal and civil proceedings. In the O.J. Simpson case, he was acquitted in the criminal trial, where the standard of proof is \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" However, he was later found liable in a civil trial, where the standard of proof is lower: \"preponderance of evidence\" or \"more likely than not.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reverses the actual outcomes. Simpson was acquitted in the criminal trial but found liable in the civil trial.\n\nOption B is incorrect because criminal and civil courts use different standards of proof. Criminal courts use \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" while civil courts use \"preponderance of evidence.\"\n\nOption C is incorrect because it applies the criminal court standard to civil proceedings, which is not accurate. Civil courts use a lower standard of proof.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the different standards of proof in criminal and civil proceedings, as well as the possibility of different outcomes in these two types of legal processes."

This is for a research project lasting one year with the question to what extent does cognitive bias play a role in court/businesses?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The law doesn't directly address mental states, it addresses actions, and a law may (or may not) have a \"mental state\" requirement as part of the determination of liability. For example, abstractly hating a person for their race is not a crime and you cannot be sued for abstractly hating a person because of their race, but you can be punished or made to pay damages because of your actions \u2013 beating them or refusing to sell to them \u2013 and that mental state may figure into the determination of guilt. There are [hate crimes laws](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.36.080) in the US whereby criminal actions are given stiffer punishments, where in Washington the distinguishing element is motivation: \"because of his or her perception of the victim's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or mental, physical, or sensory handicap\". The government must prove that the victim was assaulted because of his race, and not because the assailant thought the victim was an easy mark. This is an instance of the popular concept of \"bias\".\n\nCognitive bias, however, is extremely broad, and there are literally hundreds of possible answers. For example, cognitive bias figures into visual perception (let's say of color), which means the law has to have a way to deal with eyewitness testimony. Expert testimony could introduce reasonable doubt as to the reliability of witness testimony based on scientific testimony to the effect that humans have a cognitive bias in a particular direction, which may show that the eyewitness testimony is unreliable. What the law has to deal with is whether such scientific testimony is pertinent (admissible). There is a body of law surrounding the [Daubert Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard) which answers that question. The key here is that the attorney has to know to call up an appropriate expert witness to impeach eyewitness testimony. Or circumstantial evidence, when the evidence is based on a subjective assessment by an expert (that is, when a lab tech makes a professional judgment as to fact, such as whether this voiceprint matches that voiceprint).\n\nCognitive bias is a fact of human psychology and is not punished. A very narrow subset of biases may enter into a judgment of liability, just in case the bias is considered to be under volitional control and is heinous.",

The law doesn't directly address cognitive bias or mental states, but rather focuses on actions. However, the effects of cognitive bias can be addressed in legal proceedings through various means. Expert testimony can be used to introduce doubt about the reliability of witness statements that may be affected by cognitive biases. The admissibility of such expert testimony is governed by standards like the Daubert Standard. This approach allows the legal system to indirectly deal with the effects of cognitive bias without directly punishing it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because unconscious bias is not directly punishable, and trials are not automatically redone due to its presence. Option C is wrong because hate crime laws focus on actions motivated by bias, not the abstract biases themselves. Option D is incorrect as the law does not explicitly require the elimination of all cognitive bias, nor does it outline specific punishments for exhibiting bias in court."

One idea to overcome this issue might be to have someone else read the documentation and write down the necessary API calls and then have someone else given only those notes figure out how to set everything up by just looking up the plain API calls like [CreateWindowEx](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowexa).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The example code explains a procedure or method of accomplishing a goal, in the process conveying certain ideas.\n\n[17 USC 102 (b)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102) provides:\n\n> (b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\n\nThe laws of other countries are similar on this point. Making use of the procedure or method is not copyright infringement. Under US law, making use of the example code would probably be a fair use, whatever the license may say.

The example code in Microsoft's documentation demonstrates a procedure for setting up a window, which is considered a method of operation. While the specific expression of the code may be copyrighted, the underlying ideas and procedures are not. Therefore, a developer can implement the same window setup procedure in their own code without infringing on copyright, even if the resulting code is similar to the example.

It was patented in US. I have few questions:\n\n1. *Basics* Although it is patented in US, is it \"working\" worldwide? Could two countries have the same patent from different inventors? When someone brings patent to patent service in his country, the patent service will check if there same patent anywhere in the world?\n2. *Basics* If last sentence is false, \\- if someone from country A stole patent from country B, then inventor from country B should go to country A court?\n3. How (US) law describes expiration of patent? What does it mean? Can it be repatented? Can anyone free use expired patent?\n4. In the page I provided the status of patent is `Expired - Fee Related` \\- was does it mean?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For the first question \\- **No, patents are territorial**. A US patent is not \"working\" anywhere else. Of course one can apply in multiple countries if the proper time frames and procedures are followed. There is a mechanism (PCT Treaty) that allows a straightforward way to *apply* in over a 140 countries simultaneously. Although it is frequently used, it is expensive to continue to prosecute the application in each place and even in high\\-value inventions only a handful of places are eventually chosen to actually pursue patents. Each country's/region's laws and processes are different and success in patenting can vary.\n\nNormally two countries would not have the same thing patented by different inventors. The patenting or publication of the first one would make it prior art to the second filed one. This should be found by the second examiner and stop a duplicate patent by a second inventor. However there can be subtle differences between similar inventions and mistakes do happen. In the case of true simultaneous invention this can happen.\n\nTo get a patent, the invention must be novel \\- that means no one has published or patented it anywhere in the world at any time in any language. Before the AIA law in the U.S. the law said \"or known in this country\". It could have made a loophole where something was known publicly elsewhere but did not constitute prior art in the U.S. That is now changed to be world\\-wide.\n\nEven if the examiner does a world wide search they might miss something and a patent might get issued even though the invention was not novel and a patent elsewhere is granted. To invalidate it the original patent owner would need to look into available procedures in country A. It might be court or it might be administrative.\n\nIn most places an annual \u201crenewal\u201d fee must be paid to keep a patent in\\-force. In the U.S. a \u201cmaintenance\u201d fee must be paid at the 3\\.5 year, 7\\.5 year and 7\\.5 year points in order to stay in\\-force.\n\nA patent who\u2019s renewal or maintenance fee hasn\u2019t been paid is expired for fee reasons. That can imply that it can be revived by the *patent owner* by paying the fees and usually a penalty. There may be a time limit or a small set of allowable circumstances to revive.\n\nA patent labeled expired for fee reasons might now be past its normal lifespan and therefore not revivable.\n\nIn general patents are given to inventors and those an inventor assigns their rights to. Someone else can\u2019t come along and revive a patent they had nothing to do with originally. There is no \u201cre\\-patenting\u201d.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) TechInnovate's US patent automatically protects their invention worldwide, preventing NipponTech from obtaining a patent in Japan.\n\nB) NipponTech can easily obtain a patent in Japan since patents are territorial and the US patent doesn't apply there.\n\nC) NipponTech's patent application in Japan will likely be rejected due to TechInnovate's earlier filing, which constitutes prior art.\n\nD) Both companies can maintain patents for the same invention in their respective countries without any conflict.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While patents are territorial (meaning a US patent only provides protection in the US), patent offices generally conduct worldwide searches for prior art when examining patent applications. TechInnovate's earlier filing and potential publication of their patent application would likely constitute prior art that would prevent NipponTech from obtaining a patent for the same invention in Japan. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because patents are not automatically worldwide. \nAnswer B is incorrect because even though patents are territorial, prior art is considered globally. \nAnswer D is incorrect because it's unlikely for two companies to maintain patents for the same invention in different countries if one was filed significantly earlier than the other."

While TPD can assert claims against P and counterclaims against D, the rule doesn't explicitly allow claims against co-defendants of D. The question of whether TPD can bring claims against co-defendants is not clearly addressed in FRCP 14.\n\nC) This is incorrect. It reverses the actual situation. TPD can assert claims against P, but only counterclaims against D, not direct claims.\n\nD) This is partially correct but ultimately incorrect. TPD can indeed assert claims against P and counterclaims against D. However, the statement about co-defendants is too definitive. While FRCP 14 doesn't explicitly allow claims against co-defendants, the document suggests that in practice, judges might find ways to permit this.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complex relationships in third-party practice under FRCP 14, particularly the asymmetry in how claims can be asserted by third-party defendants against plaintiffs versus defendants."

If the offer letter mentioned nothing about vehicle title status (ie clean vs salvage), and the insurance agency missed the fact the vehicle was salvage condition, what is the likelihood the insurance agency is able to cancel the settlement and revise the reimbursement value, if they notice the title is marked as salvage condition?

According to the legal expert's response, if there was no fraud on the vehicle owner's part (meaning they didn't lie about the title status) and there was a clear offer and acceptance of the settlement terms, the agreement should be considered binding. The salvage title status doesn't automatically negate the vehicle's value or invalidate the agreement. Option A is incorrect because the owner doesn't need to explicitly state the title is clean; they just need to not lie about it. Option C is possible but not necessary for the agreement to be binding; such a clause would actually make the agreement less binding. Option D is also not necessary; the salvage status doesn't need to be explicitly stated for the agreement to be valid if there was no deception involved."

For example, if the citizen wants a record, they can go before a judge and ask for a court order which compels the agency to produce the record.

If the agency complies with the one specific request made by the person and that person isn't a regular and repeat player in that kind of transaction, the agency can simply comply with your individual demand and have the balance of the relief requested denied as moot or deny you standing to assert a general rule change.\n\nYou typically need the right parties (either a class action or parties with regular dealings with the agency, like a newspaper) to obtain injunctive relief.\n\nThis contrasts, for example, with the way that public law questions are handled by the Council of State in France, where a systemic bureaucratic problem in the government will ordinarily and routinely be ordered to be fixed when a single complaint is raised, and the issues will typically be litigated by government paid lawyers or senior civil servants on both sides of the case with minimal litigation costs for the party affected.",

Each library is a collection of one or more text files of source code, plus a text file containing the license.\n\nRather than require the users of my \"library of libraries\" to download and import each individual library into their project, I'd prefer to put all the different libraries together into single massive text file.\n\nThis is not a modification of the source code, since the license covers the code, not the text file itself (and in most cases modification is allowed, but I'd like to avoid it altogether just in case.) I'm thinking I can just insert the licenses directly into the source code as a comment (a 'comment' is a section ignored by the programming language where you can write anything.)\n\nSo what would start as:\n\n```\nLibrary 1\n - file1A.cpp  \"1A code\"\n - file1B.cpp  \"1B code\"\n - license1.txt  \"1 license\"\nLibrary 2\n - file2A.cpp  \"2A code\"\n - file2B.cpp  \"2B code\"\n - license2.txt  \"2 license\"\n\n```\n\nBecomes\n\n```\n- library.cpp\n   /* Notice: the following is subject to license1 */\n   1A code\n   1B code\n   /* Notice: the following is subject to license2 */\n   2A code\n   2B code\n\n```\n\nAll I've done is changed the delivery format, so this should be acceptable.

If the other licenses are not compatible with the GPL license, then you can't publish with the different licenses. Say A is licensed under GPL, B is licensed under the B\\-license, GPL requires that A\\+B is licensed under GPL, the B\\-license requires that B is licensed under the B\\-license, and you cannot publish B both under GPL and under the B\\-license because the terms are contradicting, then you can't legally publish A\\+B.\n\nAs an extreme, assume the B\\-license explicitely says \"B cannot be published under the GPL license, and cannot be combined with another part that is published under the GPL license\". Then obviously you can't do what you are planning.\n\nHowever, you may get away with it if you don't actually create anything new based on the existing projects. A CD containing three separate individual open source licensed projects is most likely not a \"derived work\", just a container with three individual works. A zip file probably the same.

If the fight was interrupted by a person of authority, is that person of authority allowed to search everybody's phones and delete the video? Also, are the bystanders subject to punishment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming US public schools, schools may be able to confiscate cell phones, if they prohibit cell phone use during instruction hours (a common rule). The 4th Amendment may prohibit them from searching the phone: nothing authorizes a school to delete files from a phone. Whether they may search would primarily have to do with urgent safety concerns. Schools have broader authority over students because they are acting *in loco parentis*, but that is distinct from *carte blanche* (especially since the courts now recognise that school attendance is mandated by law, thus intrusions on constitutional rights receive narrower scrutiny). Warrantless searches are allowed, based on a \"balancing\" of the item searched, the infraction, and the quality of the suspicion ([New Jersey v. T.L.O](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1983/83-712)).\n\nOne of the problems is that there is a certain baseline of expectation of privacy against which searches are to be judged, but, frankly, teen\\-agers have highly variable privacy expectations ([Safford v. Redding](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-479)). Courts recognize a reasonable expectation of privacy in terms of content on cell phones ([Ohio v. Smith](https://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/docs/pdf/0/2009/2009-Ohio-6426.pdf)). [This article](http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&context=bjcl) is about the question of student cell phone privacy rights.\n\nThe general pattern, I have to say, is to start with the assumption that the school has a particular right, so they do something, and the student sues until the state or US Supreme Court articulates principle recognizing the student's constitutional right, at which point districts change their behavior. Based on existing case law, I would guess that this would be found to be an unconstitutional search, and is unlikely to actually happen (unless the district doesn't effectively communicate the law to staff).

According to the information provided, schools may have the authority to confiscate phones if they violate school policies. However, searching the phone would only be permissible if there were urgent safety concerns, based on the \"balancing\" principle established in New Jersey v. T.L.O.

Option A is incorrect because schools do not have complete authority over students' property. Option B is partially correct about not deleting the video, but overstates the need for a warrant in all search situations. Option D is incorrect because schools do have some authority to confiscate phones and potentially search them under specific circumstances."

Extradition treaties/agreements\n\nThe general principle of international law is that all countries are sovereign and have jurisdiction over all people within their borders; in this regard they are not required to render any persons within their borders to another country, not even to be prosecuted for a crime.\n\nHowever, if the country the person is in has an extradition treaty or agreement with the country seeking to extradite them (in your case India) then the government may, in some circumstances, apprehend and render the person.\n\n2. Bars to extradition\n\nCommonly, the crime for which the person is to be extradited may be a bar to extradition, either because it is not illegal in the country that would surrender the person, or because it is of certain natures (usually political crimes), or because of the penalty the crime attracts (death penalty, for instance).\n\nAs for this particular case, if I've read the news article correctly and that Mallya now resides in the UK, then there are extradition treaties between the UK and India and the subject could be extradited.",

While countries generally have sovereignty over individuals within their borders, extradition treaties between nations can create a framework for transferring accused individuals. India and the UK do have extradition treaties in place, which means there is a legal pathway for India to request Mallya's extradition. However, this process is subject to various conditions and legal procedures.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while sovereignty is a principle, it can be modified by international agreements like extradition treaties.\n\nAnswer B is inaccurate because Interpol cannot independently arrest and extradite individuals without the cooperation of national governments.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because financial crimes are generally not considered political offenses, and many extradition treaties specifically include provisions for economic crimes.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the complex nature of international extradition, acknowledging both the possibility of extradition due to existing treaties and the potential challenges and conditions that may apply to the process."

They came into the building we were in, found us, and we exchanged insurance and contact information.\n\nI called my insurance, which ultimately had me call their insurance to file this claim. Apparently, when I called their insurance, they were already notified and had a claim started. As we walked through the steps to get the damage taken care of, we got onto the subject of rental vehicles since they were going to provide one as I was entirely not at fault.\n\nThey stated that they'd only cover a mid\\-size four\\-door sedan unless there were accommodations that needed to be met. My immediate confusion/concern was that they damaged my full\\-size sedan, which is expected to be out for 3\\-4 days, but that they were essentially downgrading my daily transportation to save on costs.\n\n**Question**: \n\n* Would I have any ground to push back and request a full\\-size sedan since that's the type of car they damaged?\n\nThe only major thing that comes to my mind is an accommodation for my height. I'm 6'5\" (198cm\\~), so I'd expect that the vehicle should have a comfortable amount of room for me to sit up; and, even more important, not be so compact that my legs cannot drive comfortably. Even my car is already on the edge of my legs being comfortable on driving, so a smaller vehicle seems like a potential risk/downside.\n\n**Edit (Outcome):**  \n\nI did end up getting the rental upgraded to a full\\-size sedan. The adjuster mentioned it was \"approved to accommodate physical needs\". He did also mention that if I hauled/towed things for work, or had a large family, that they would have approved it for those reasons too.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a former rental car employee I can explain why this is. Cars that are rented to customers for insurance reasons (accidents, etc) are supposed to match the size of the car that was damaged as close as possible. I'm speaking for one rental car company in particular here but I'm assuming others have a similar policy but every 2 years old the car is it goes down a size in rental. So your 2014 would and could be considered a \"standard\" size or even \"compact depending\" on what is available on that rental lot or how that agent is feeling. \n\nWith that being said, I've seen customers complain to insurance companies to get bigger cars sizes or even pay out of pocket for larger vehicles. In most insurance rental situations, the company provides \"X\" amount of dollars per day, generally between $20\\-25\\. These insurance companies have deals with rental agencies to secure rates that align with these low daily costs \\- the same car they get for $20 a day would cost a walk in customer double or triple that. You could use that $20\\-25 a day towards the cost of your rental and then just pay the difference on the larger car if you'd like. \n\nSo to answer your question, yes you can push back all you want. Direct your concerns to their insurance company. In my experience, I've seen more often than not they agree to the larger vehicle. You can also petition the rental agent to let you get the larger car for the cheaper rate \\- however bear in mind these rental agents hear this 100 times a day and this can be your quick ride into that dusty PT Cruiser that nobody wants in the corner of the lot.",

Which of the following best explains why the judge cannot set aside the jury's verdict of acquittal?\n\nA) The principle of judicial restraint prevents judges from interfering with jury decisions in any circumstances.\n\nB) The Double Jeopardy Clause of the 5th Amendment prohibits a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.\n\nC) Judges are only allowed to make judgments of law, not findings of fact, in jury trials.\n\nD) The right to a trial by jury implicitly includes the right to have the jury's decision be final.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the 5th Amendment is the primary reason why a judge cannot set aside a jury's verdict of acquittal in a criminal case. This constitutional protection prevents the government from prosecuting an individual for the same crime twice, which would effectively occur if a judge could overturn a jury's acquittal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while judicial restraint is a principle in the legal system, it's not the specific reason preventing judges from overturning acquittals.\n\nOption C, while partially true (judges typically make judgments of law while juries determine facts), is not the fundamental reason preventing the overturning of acquittals.\n\nOption D touches on an important aspect of jury trials but doesn't capture the constitutional basis for protecting acquittals.\n\nThe question tests understanding of constitutional protections in criminal proceedings, the roles of judges and juries, and the finality of jury acquittals in the U.S. legal system."

I had been getting a strange feeling and today the recruiter basically told me that when I work for the company, they will rewrite my resume and I have to be ok with them lying on it (e.g. adding work experience where none actually exists). They asked me if I was ok with this, and they said I will be asked tomorrow in the interview to. The interview is by Skype. The company trains software developers and then gets them contracts with other companies.\n\n2 questions:\n\n1. Is it illegal to lie in the interview? E.g., is it illegal to tell them that I am ok with them embellishing my resume, when in fact I am not and have no intention.\n2. If I did allow them to embellish my resume, would I be breaking the law?\n\nAt this point I'm just curious to see where things go, but I'm wondering is it legal for me to say \"yes, you can fake information on my resume\" as it could be a verbal agreement? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no prohibition on lying in general.\n\n**Misrepresentation**\n\nIf you misrepresent a fact and that misrepresentation is a material inducement to someone entering into a contract with you then there are a number of problems that follow:\n\n* The (mis)representation may become a term of the contract and if not complied with can allow the aggrieved party to either sue for damages or rescind the contract.\n* If the misrepresentation led to the contract being entered into by mistake then the contract is void for mistake\n* The misrepresentation may have become a collateral contract\n* an innocent or negligent misstatement may give rise to the tort of negligent misstatement\n* misrepresentation may put you in breach of trade practices statutes.\n\n**Fraud**\n\nIf you knowingly tell a lie with the intention of receiving a benefit then this is both the tort and crime of fraud.\n\nYou receiving employment or your company securing a contract probably qualifies as intending to receive a benefit.",

You're considering saying yes, even though you don't actually agree, just to see how the interview progresses. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) There are no legal risks as long as you don't sign anything agreeing to the resume embellishment.\n\nB) Saying yes verbally could constitute a legally binding agreement, potentially exposing you to fraud charges.\n\nC) It's only illegal if you actually use the falsified resume to obtain employment with another company.\n\nD) Verbal agreements in interviews are never legally binding, so there's no risk in saying yes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Saying yes, even verbally, to allowing false information on your resume could be considered a misrepresentation or fraud, especially if it's done with the intention of receiving a benefit (in this case, potential employment). Verbal agreements can be legally binding, and knowingly participating in a scheme to deceive future employers could expose you to legal risks. Even if you don't intend to follow through, agreeing to such a proposal could be seen as entering into a fraudulent arrangement. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they underestimate the potential legal implications of verbal agreements and misrepresentations in professional contexts."

Do I need to register for Foreign Qualification in Delaware (or am I already?), or do I need to in Maryland?\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A corporation that is incorporated in Delaware is a foreign corporation in Maryland and not Delaware. Since it sounds from the question that this corporation regularly conducts business in Maryland (\"work day\\-to\\-day\" and \"official HQ\" in Maryland), it almost certainly is required to register for foreign qualification in Maryland.\n\nIn Maryland, \"a foreign corporation is doing business within a state when it transacts some substantial part of its ordinary business therein\", *Chesapeake, Etc. v.

According to the Maryland law cited, a corporation is considered to be \"doing business\" in a state when it \"transacts some substantial part of its ordinary business therein.\" The fact that the company has its headquarters and day-to-day operations in Maryland strongly suggests it is conducting substantial business there, regardless of whether it charges for its products.

The details depend on what state you are in, but generally they require the owner to sign the back of the title where it indicates title transfer, then you file that with the state DMV (and pay fees). There is often a cost assigned to new owners that can be reduced if the vehicle is a gift, and the plates may have to be returned to the state and new ones are issued (for money). The original owner may need to report the sale. There is a good chance that the executor of the estate will have to sign an affadavit (with notary) and a supply current \\& official letter of testamentary and death certificate, and also the state will not just say up front (online) what is required so yo may have to call them. Assuming the daughter is the executor, there is a fair amount of hassle for her but by following the specific steps for your state and calling the DMV, you could reduce the hassle.",

This typically requires the executor to sign the back of the title, and may also involve obtaining an affidavit with a notary, a current and official letter of testamentary, and a death certificate.

In movies, I only hear \"Sustained\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It doesn't really matter exactly what the judge says as long as it's clear whether the judge is sustaining or overruling the objection. With that said, in movies you'll rarely see the person asking the question get to respond to the objection, but you'll notice in the trial that happens in most cases. For example, if one party objects that a question calls for hearsay, the examiner may defend their question by pointing out that the statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, or that it falls into one of the hearsay exceptions. At that point the judge is responding to both parties and someone else or possibly multiple people have spoken since the objection was originally raised, so she might specify that she's \"overruling the objection\" as opposed to just saying overruled, so it just makes it clearer on the record what she's ruling about.\n\nIt's worth noting as well that she might need to specify which objection she's sustaining if more than one objection is raised. In this trial both hearsay and relevance objections have been raised at the same time, and the judge might specify that she's sustaining e.g. only relevance. This can tell the examiner whether they are free to keep going down the same line of questioning with different questions, if the objection sustained was hearsay, or to move to another line of questioning, if the objection sustained was relevance.",

The more verbose response \"I will sustain/overrule the objection\" is primarily used to clarify the ruling on the record, especially in situations where multiple objections have been raised or arguments have been presented. This clarity is important for several reasons:\n\n1. It specifies which objection is being ruled on if multiple objections were raised simultaneously (e.g., hearsay and relevance).\n2. It provides clarity after both parties have had a chance to argue their positions on the objection.\n3. It ensures a clear record for potential appeals or review.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while formality is important in court, this specific verbosity is not about impressing the jury but about clarity.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the judge's ruling is not intended to give attorneys more preparation time.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while legal language is important, there's no strict requirement for this specific phrasing.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live in a property which has a garage attached which is rented to a neighbour, these are on a peppercorn rent of \u00a31 per year. Now with a peppercorn rent I've read various descriptions which some saying you don't have to collect it, however my solicitor upon buying the property told me it was important to collect them. He did not at the time state the reason, but after doing some research it occurs to me that if the rent is not collected there could be repercussions. The property owner I rent to actually told me that he was told when buying the property that the garage would be his in ten years, this would be a terrible situation for me as the property owner.\n\nObviously these people are my neighbours and I don't want a dispute over this, but I don't want to potentially lose the value of my home, by not owning the garages and potentially making it unsaleable. My neighbours actually refuse to pay now, but I could be in the wrong on this one.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* Do I have to collect the peppercorn rent?\n* Is requesting the rent enough?\n* If the tenant tried to claim ownership of the garage in court, would it go in my favour?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you claim ownership of property but do nothing with it for 12 years (not even collecting a \u00a31 rent), then in due course ownership will pass to the tenants, under the doctrine of [adverse possession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_possession). Your solicitor is the only person who can advise you properly, since he knows all the details; but ultimately you will have to choose between being on bad terms with these neighbours (including suing them for possession) and losing the garages.\n\nTo deal with your edit: normally, just requesting the rent is enough, even if the tenants ignore every request. However, if they specifically refuse to pay anything, they are claiming that they own the garages not you, and if you do nothing you will lose possession eventually. If you sue them for possession now, you will probably win (assuming your question is accurate and complete), but every day weakens your case. Of course, suing will be expensive and damage your relationship; but it won't be any cheaper in the future.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner has a garage attached to their property that is rented to a neighbor for a peppercorn rent of \u00a31 per year. The neighbor has refused to pay the rent for several years and claims they were told the garage would be theirs after 10 years. What is the most appropriate course of action for the homeowner to protect their property rights?\n\nA) Do nothing, as peppercorn rent doesn't need to be collected\nB) Continue to request the rent annually without taking further action\nC) Immediately file a lawsuit to evict the neighbor from the garage\nD) Formally request the rent payment and, if refused, initiate legal proceedings to establish ownership\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most appropriate course of action. The homeowner should formally request the rent payment to establish a clear record of attempting to exercise their property rights. If the neighbor refuses, initiating legal proceedings is necessary to prevent the potential loss of ownership through adverse possession. \n\nOption A is incorrect because failing to collect rent or assert ownership for an extended period (12 years in this case) could lead to loss of ownership through adverse possession. \n\nOption B is insufficient, as merely requesting rent without further action when the neighbor refuses to pay and claims ownership could still result in losing the property over time. \n\nOption C is too aggressive as an immediate first step and could unnecessarily damage neighborly relations without first attempting a more amicable resolution.\n\nOption D balances the need to protect property rights with an attempt to maintain good relations by first requesting payment before escalating to legal action if necessary."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So in a situation where a person wins small claims court against a company, what are the steps in collecting judgement if the company doesn't want to pay? I've researched placing a lien or garnishing wages on the individual but can you do that against a company?\n\nJurisdiction: NV, US\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, you should simply **write them a letter demanding payment of the judgment**. You can keep sending them demand letters updating the interest on the judgment regularly (e.g. every month) and call them demanding to be paid on a regular basis so that your claim is annoying to them.\n\nSecond, you can **use legal tools at your disposal**. In the approximate order of the likelihood that you would resort to them and the ease of using them, these are:\n\n1. You can record a judgment lien against any real property it owns, if any. This must be cleared when the property is sold and hurts the credit record of the company. You can also foreclosed on the lien although doing so involve quite a bit of legal technicalities and process and may require you to assume or pay off mortgages and liens higher in priority than your own. Basically, this involves getting the right kind of proof that the judgment was entered (in Colorado one gets a \"transcript of judgment\" from the clerk, but Nevada process may vary) and recording it in the real property records of the county where the real estate owned by the company is located.\n2. You can garnish its bank accounts, if you know where the company banks, if not, you can learn this in the next step. This involves filling out a garnishment form (which may need a clerk of court's stamp) and then mailing it to the judgment\\-debtor and the bank (local practice might require a process server to deliver it).\n3. You can issue interrogatories or take depositions of corporate officials to have them disclose what assets and sources of income it has (pursuant to Rule of Civil Procedure 69\\). This is somewhat of an involved process with legal rules and forms involved but if you don't know where the company has assets, you have few other choices but to do this and it gets their attention as well. You could also hire a private investigator to try to locate the company's assets.\n4. You can obtain a writ of execution and attachment to have the sheriff seize tangible personal property belonging to the company. This involves multiple court form filings, fees, and coordination with the civil division of the sheriff's department that will often require you to post a liability bond, to hire people to carry away the property to a secure storage unit when it is seized for later auction, and for you to pay to publish notice of a sheriff's sale with a newspaper authorized to give legal notices. It may also require you to hire a locksmith and/or some to document the assets seized and to value them in real time during the seizure.\n5. You can garnish accounts payable to the company from individuals and businesses who owe it money. The paperwork is similar to a bank account garnishment but it often doesn't go as smoothly and has to be more actively litigated since non\\-bank persons aren't as familiar with the process.\n6. If you learn through Step 3 that the company has transferred assets to its owners or others while insolvent without receiving reasonably equivalent value in exchange, you can sue the recipient of the assets under the fraudulent transfers act in a separate lawsuit. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.\n7. In an extreme case (probably not justified by a small claims court judgment) you have force the judicial dissolution of the company and liquidation of its assets for failure to pay its debts in a separation lawsuit. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.\n8. In combination with other creditors of the company who are also unpaid, you can force the company into an involuntary bankruptcy. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.\n9. Wait for the company to go bankrupt (if this is likely) and file a claim in the bankruptcy. This involves filling out a one or two page form and filing it with the bankruptcy court.\n\nIn my experience in Colorado which has similar rules on this subject, companies with real estate usually pay upon demand (especially if they have a mortgage since an unsatisfied judgment is a condition of default on most business mortgages). But, if the company owns no real estate, commencing collections actions combination of 2, 3 and 4 is usually sufficient to get the company to simply pay the judgment without having to take the processes involved to completion.\n\nThis said, most of the options above involve fairly complicated paper work and procedural requirements. The average person who doesn't have a graduate degree or a business background would really struggle to do it right and there are sometimes significant fees involved.\n\nThird, you can use other methods that don't involve the legal process that involve **notifying people of their non\\-payment of a judgment**.\n\nOne trick is to learn who it has major contracts like leases and large loans with, and advise them that there is an outstanding judgment against the company, which is often a condition of default under those contract that must be cured quickly.\n\nSimilarly, complaining about the company's non\\-payment of the judgment on customer review sites and social media can work sometimes.\n\nFourth, you can **hire someone to do it for you**. Often lawyers and collection agencies are more willing to collect a true money judgment from a court than they are to take on a claim that hasn't yet been reduced to judgment and will have to be litigated.\n\nSo, because it is so technically difficult to enforce your legal rights without a lawyer, even if you obtained the small claims court judgment without a lawyer, it may be worth the money to hire a lawyer to collect the judgment obtained, or to turn the judgment over to a collection agency (which also hurts the company's credit record) and to pay what that costs.\n\nOn a contingent fee basis, a 33%\\-50% contingent fee would be customary. Hourly legal fees can run from $150 to $450 per hour in Nevada for this kind of work and it would take at least several hours of work.\n\nIf the judgment is too small, it may not be cost effective to hire anyone to collect it on an hourly basis, and even collection agencies may decline to take on the case on a contingent fee basis because the work required would cost them more than the fee they would obtain if they won.\n\nIn the case of a small claims court judgment that isn't very large it is often not cost effective or worth your time and effort to pursue it actively.",

Sue for fraudulent transfers\n\nD) 1. Obtain a writ of execution 2. Garnish accounts payable 3. File a claim in bankruptcy court 4. Hire a lawyer on contingency\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B represents the most practical and effective sequence of actions for collecting a small claims judgment. \n\n1. Sending a demand letter is always the first step and may resolve the issue without further action. \n2. Recording a judgment lien against any real property owned by the company is relatively easy and can pressure the company to pay. \n3. Garnishing bank accounts, if the banking information is known, is a direct way to collect funds. \n4. If these steps don't work, issuing interrogatories or taking depositions can help locate assets and put additional pressure on the company.\n\nOptions A, C, and D contain steps that are either too extreme for a small claims judgment (forcing dissolution, involuntary bankruptcy), potentially ineffective (waiting for bankruptcy, posting reviews), or more complicated and costly (obtaining writs of execution, hiring lawyers) as initial steps. The correct sequence balances effectiveness, practicality, and escalation of pressure on the company to pay."

The developer needs to consider both copyright and trademark issues:\n\n1. Copyright: While ancient Greek symbols are likely in the public domain, any symbols created in the last century might still be under copyright protection. The standard 70-year rule after the author's death applies in many countries, but this can vary.\n\n2. Trademark: Even if a symbol is not protected by copyright, it may be trademarked by another company, especially if used in a similar product or market. This is particularly important for a game sold globally, as trademark laws can vary by jurisdiction and market.\n\n3. Recent creations: The answer acknowledges that more recent creations or interpretations of Greek mythological symbols might have legal protections.\n\n4. Global considerations: The correct answer takes into account the global nature of online sales, which complicates both copyright and trademark issues.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the legal considerations or ignore important aspects of intellectual property law in the context of global digital sales."

The Court held that the state's interest in protecting the anonymity of juvenile offenders does not outweigh First Amendment rights. This principle extends beyond newspapers to other forms of media, including video, and would apply to educational use in a classroom setting.

That\u2019s not how GPL works.\n\nThe GPL license gives you two permissions without any obligation: You are allowed to use the software, and you are allowed to modify the software and use the modified software. If the software is a combination of GPL licensed and your own software, then your own software is not GPL licensed.\n\nThe GPL license only comes into play when you distribute it (hand a copy to someone else), with or without your software added.\n\nYou then have the choice: Either you ship the complete software under the GPL license and everything is legally fine, or you ship it without the GPL license which makes it copyright infringement. It\u2019s your choice. Changing the make file does nothing to the license, you have to do that yourself. Of course when I say \u201cchoice\u201d is like leaving a store with goods, you have the choice to pay or become a thief. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s legal, it isn\u2019t.",

They modify the Makefile and link their own error-handling function to replace an existing exit() function in the GPL code. Under what circumstances does this modification affect the licensing of the developer's own program?\n\nA) The developer's program automatically becomes GPL-licensed due to the Makefile modification.\nB) The developer's program becomes GPL-licensed only if they distribute the combined software.\nC) The developer's program remains unaffected by GPL, regardless of distribution.\nD) The developer's program becomes GPL-licensed if they use any part of the GPL code, even without distribution.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The key point from the documentation is that GPL obligations only come into play when the software is distributed. Modifying the Makefile or linking functions doesn't automatically change the license of the developer's own code. However, if the developer chooses to distribute the combined software (their code plus the GPL code), they must then decide to either license the entire combined work under GPL or risk copyright infringement. The developer's own program doesn't \"become GPL\" simply by using or modifying GPL code; it's the act of distribution that triggers the license obligations."

There are no laws against asking or various kinds of speech: laws restrict the doing. If you ask a person to shoot you and they do it, that person will probably be arrested for assault (or murder, depending on how it works out) \u2013 shooting a person is assault. A possible defense against an assault charge is consent, but that defense isn't freely available whenever a person says \"I give my consent for you to assault me\". You cannot consent to foreseeable serious bodily injury (more accurately, the law does not recognize such consent as valid consent). You can agree to be struck (in a boxing match) because such force is not serious bodily harm; and if unforeseeably serious bodily harm results, the consent defense is available. But if you ask a person to shoot you in the liver, they will be prosecuted for assault, because the resulting serious bodily harm is foreseeable.",

According to the information provided, even if Person A asks to be shot, Person B can still be charged with assault if they comply. This is because the law does not recognize consent as a valid defense in cases where foreseeable serious bodily harm is involved. Shooting someone, even non-lethally, falls under this category.

What about backups that go beyond the *subject* realm (e.g. database backups, disk backups, ...)? \n\nOne idea to solve a part of the problem would be to [crypto\\-shred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-shredding) data. So when a *subject* asks to erase him/her *personal data*, we simply **erase the encryption key**. That would render all data unusable. However, data encrypted with what is considered a strong encryption method might not be strong anymore in a not\\-so\\-distant future (e.g. quantum computing, new algorithms, or a weakness found in the encryption mechanism).\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n1. Is crypto\\-shredding considered a valid erasure method?\n2. What storage mediums are affected by the so\\-called **undue delay**?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In my opinion, this should be enough. The GDPR regulation is general \\- it does not attempt to address these issues directly, precisely for the reasons we see here: You can never predict how the technology will develop.\nWhen interpreting the GDPR, we must keep the intended goal in mind. What is the purpose of the \"right to erasure\"? To prevent anyone from further processing the personal data. If you \"crypto\\-shred\" it, it can't be processed anymore, not even theoretically. The encryptec file cannot be used to identify the subject, therefore it is not even personal data anymore.\n\nIn case it can be decrypted in the future... Well, that is just a speculation. The courts can go to great lengths in interpreting what personal data is (dynamic IP address is considered personal data, since it can be linked to a person by the police with a court order), but i am pretty sure that \"it can be theoretically possible in some distant future\" is beyond the limit.\n\nAs for the second question, I am not aware of any applicable case\\-law, but I guess that current security and technological standards will be used to assess the delay. You have a right to protect your data, the subject has a right to erase them. Those rights must be balanced, neither fully overrules the other.\nThe delay should be short enough so the right to erasure is effective, and it should not extremely long compared to other (economically viable) backup solutions available, in line with current industrial standards.",

'On the same occasion' is interpreted by the court. I'm not aware of any case law on this point, so a court will be able to apply its discretion. \n\nNote that this only applies to the penalty point aspect of the *sentence*: the convictions will all stand, and any fines awarded as a result are not subject to the same rule. \n\nOf course the police may use their own discretion and charge a subset of the offences actually detected. \n\n**A short glossary**\n\n* **endorsement** means that the offender's licence will be 'endorsed' with a number of penalty points.\n* **penalty points** are recorded on the driver's record at DVSA and expire after a number of years, depending on why they were awarded.

Ann. \u00a7 5723 (West).\n\nThe statement of the state attorney general is merely a suggestion. Although, in an entity with audited financial statements the audited financial reports must disclose that the organization lacks \"adequate internal financial controls\".\n\nBut, non\\-profit entities such as charitable trusts or \"corporations sole\" (such as most legally distinct entities in the Roman Catholic Church) have only a single person with full control over everything that a Board of Directors does.\n\nThe IRS likewise does not impose a minimum number of directors for a 501(c)(3\\) organization, or for any other kind of corporation. Nothing in the relevant statue requires that it have more than one, and many non\\-profits (e.g. probably a majority of churches) have only one director.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to Pennsylvania state law, what is the minimum number of members required for the board of directors of a nonprofit corporation?\n\nA) At least three members are always required\nB) One or more members, as specified in the bylaws or articles of incorporation\nC) Exactly three members if not specified otherwise\nD) A minimum of two members to avoid concentration of power\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to 15 Pa. Stat. and Consol. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5723, \"The board of directors of a nonprofit corporation shall consist of one or more members.\" The law allows for flexibility, with the number of directors to be fixed by the bylaws. If not specified in the bylaws, the number defaults to what's stated in the articles of incorporation, or three if no number is stated there.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law does not mandate a minimum of three members in all cases. \n\nOption C is partially correct but overly specific. While three members is the default if not otherwise specified, it's not a universal requirement.\n\nOption D, while it might be a good practice suggestion (as implied by the PA attorney general's handbook), is not a legal requirement according to the state law.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the specific legal requirements for nonprofit boards in Pennsylvania, distinguishing between legal mandates and best practice recommendations."

The NC (NonCommercial) clause restricts others from using the content for commercial purposes, which helps preserve the author's ability to commercialize the content in the future (e.g., publishing a book).\n\n3. It requires attribution (BY), ensuring the author is credited for their work.\n\n4. Unlike CC-BY-NC-SA, it doesn't require derivatives to be shared under the same terms, giving more flexibility to users.\n\n5. Unlike CC-BY-NC-ND, it allows for adaptations and remixes, which might be beneficial for the cycling community.\n\n6.

This question is intentionally on Law.SE instead of Politics.SE as the focus is intended to be on law rather than political viability.\n\nAs an example of a similar case, consider Roy Moore, who in 2001 was elected as Alabama's 27th Chief Justice, removed from office in 2003, was again elected chief justice in 2013, again forced out, then won a Republican primary for Senate in a heavily Republican state, earning Trump's endorsement, and is again a candidate for the US Senate. \n\nAs a closely related question, does impeachment by the House of Representatives, with or without subsequent removal from office by the Senate, actually disqualify one from being re\\-appointed as Vice President or elsewhere early in the line of succession, and re\\-reaching the same Presidential office by resignations or otherwise? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Impeachment of a president does not on conviction automatically disqualify the convicted party from becoming president again. However, after conviction, the Senate can vote to add to the punishment of removal from office \"disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.\" This requires only [a simple majority vote](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-2/49-judgment-removal-and-disqualification.html).\n\n> Does impeachment by the House of Representatives, with or without subsequent removal from office by the Senate, actually disqualify one from being re\\-elected to the same Presidential office?\n\nSee above. It requires impeachment by the House, conviction by the Senate, and a separate vote by the Senate to impose the punishment of disqualification.\n\nIt's conceivable that the Senate could disqualify the convicted party only from becoming president, though it looks like in the two prior instances where this punishment was imposed it was the broader disqualification. But if a person disqualified only from being president is in an office that would normally be in the line of succession, that person is simply omitted from the line of succession. This happens routinely with naturalized citizens, and there's no reason to think it would be any different for a former president who had been disqualified only from the office of the president after being convicted on articles of impeachment.",

Impeachment alone or even conviction alone does not automatically disqualify someone from future office. The Senate has the option to vote on disqualification as an additional step after conviction, and this disqualification can be broad (covering all federal offices) or potentially limited to specific offices.

Is the individual's ownership of the company considered \"real property\" or \"personal property\"? Or something else?\n\n**Edited for context**\n\nI'm named as executor in a will for a close relative who passed away suddenly. The decedent was sole proprietor of two closely held companies. One was a small business (\"INC\") doing actual work, with customers, suppliers, revenue, phones, and all. The other business (\"LLC\") owns the commercial building, in which the first business was one tenant, and just collects rents, and maintains the property. The property was heavily mortgaged but self\\-sustaining.\n\nOne doc the probate attorney sent me says I will bind myself (\"Bond of legal representative of surety\") to discharge faithfully the duties as executor. This bond amount is twice the market value of the property held by the LLC, ignoring mortgage and debt, so it's millions of dollars. Um, yikes?!? \n\nPer Google, the state says the bond must be 200% of the value of personal property, excluding real property.\n\nObviously, I'll get a real opinion from an attorney whom the estate pays, and who knows the details. \n\nBut in the meantime I'm curious \\-\\- if you own a company that's little but a shell around real property, is equity in the company itself real property or personal property? Or neither?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think it's personal property.\n\nHere's why.\n\nI think the purpose of the bond is to protect the estate from malfeasance of the executor. I.e., to deter an unscrupulous executor from transferring the personal property of the decedent out of the estate at below market value and, thus, inequitably damaging the value of the estate. The bond gives the estate equitable recourse. The estate's remedy is to enforce a potential judgment by collecting against the bond.\n\nSo, in this case, in theory, because the executor *might* have the power to transfer *ownership* of the LLC (or its *equitable interest*, hat tip: @Scott) to a third party at below market value (subject to the Operating Agreement; but then, who would complain anyway against an inappropriate sale of membership interest, if not the estate?), the state will require a bond to ensure the estate is protected against potential malfeasance by the executor.\n\nI believe the reason for excluding real property from the bond requirement is because in order to clear title, the probate judge must specifically approve the sale of any real estate. At which time s/he will withhold her approval if the sale price is out\\-of\\-line with market.\n\nOne can imagine this is done as a practical matter. In other words, it would be impractical to have the judge personally approve the sale of lots of low\\-value items (personal property). But more practical to have the judge approve the sale of a few high\\-value items (real property).\n\nBut, as above described, if the sale could circumvent the probate court (as in the case of an LLC membership interest) then the sale should be required to be covered by the bond.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not an attorney. Consult a real attorney to get real advice and don't rely on anything I write here.",

The individual passes away, and you are named as the executor of their estate. The probate court requires a bond from you as the executor. Based on the information provided, how would the ownership interest in the LLC likely be classified for the purpose of determining the bond amount?\n\nA) Real property, because the LLC's primary asset is real estate\nB) Personal property, because the ownership interest in the LLC can be transferred without court approval\nC) Neither real nor personal property, as it's a business entity\nD) Both real and personal property, split based on the LLC's asset composition\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The ownership interest in the LLC would likely be classified as personal property for the purpose of determining the executor's bond amount. This is because:\n\n1. The bond is intended to protect the estate from potential malfeasance by the executor.\n2. The executor could potentially transfer the ownership of the LLC or its equitable interest without direct court approval, unlike the sale of real property which requires specific approval from the probate judge.\n3. The state's requirement for a bond amount of 200% of the value of personal property, excluding real property, suggests that the LLC interest would be treated as personal property.\n4. Although the LLC's primary asset is real estate, the decedent's actual ownership is of the LLC itself, not the underlying real estate directly.\n5. The purpose of excluding real property from the bond calculation is that real property sales require specific court approval, which doesn't apply to the transfer of LLC ownership interests.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of how different types of property are treated in probate proceedings and the complexities involved when business entities hold real estate assets."

Can a law firm submit a corrected complaint and still have it be accepted even though time has run out?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Jurisdiction: England and Wales\n\nApplicability: Courts governed by the [Civil Procedure Rules](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules)\n\n> Suppose the complaint was rejected and the statute of limitations has\n> expired. Can a law firm submit a corrected complaint and still have it\n> be accepted even though time has run out?\n\nThis depends on what you mean by \"rejected\":\n\n1. If you mean that judgment was issued in favour of the defendant then under the principle of [res judicata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_judicata) you will not be able to file a \"corrected\" complaint relating to the same cause of action. This is the case regardless of whether or not the limitation period hass expired. You would need to use the usual remedies available to a losing party (e.g. appeal, setting aside, varying, etc.). You may find it challenging to introduce new arguments at appeal which could have been raised in the first instance case but were not.\n2. If you mean that you made some procedural error in relation to the claim, then it will depend on which [rule of court](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules) you contravened. Some rules permit the court to exercise its discretion while others do not. If the court has invalidated your claim without allowing you to fix the error then you will only be able to bring a fresh claim if you are still within the limitation period. A claim is \"brought\" when a request for the issue of a claim form is delivered to the correct court office during its opening hours (Barnes v St Helens MBC \\[2006] EWCA Civ 1372\\).\n3. If you mean that you have become aware that your statement of case contains errors or other content that you would like to change, then you can try to have it amended. If you have not yet served it on the other party then you can do so without the court's permission ([CPR 17\\.1(1\\)](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part17#17.1). If you have already served it then you will need either the other party's consent or the permission of the court ([CPR 17\\.1(2\\)](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part17#17.1)). [CPR 17\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part17#17.4) provides that where a party applies to amend a statement of case and a limitation period has expired, \"*the court may allow an amendment whose effect will be to add or substitute a new claim, but only if the new claim arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a claim in respect of which the party applying for permission has already claimed a remedy in the proceedings.*\" Other rules apply in the case of changing the name of a party or altering the capacity in which the party brings the claim (CPR 17\\.4(3\\) and (4\\), [19\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part19#19.4), and [19\\.5](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part19#19.5)).\n\nMore generally, bringing a claim at the last minute can have some disadvantages. If you are seeking interest on a money claim, the court may be reluctant to award it at the rate and for the period that you would have hoped for if it is not the defendant's fault that you delayed. There could also be cost implications based on your conduct before the proceedings ([CPR 44\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#rule44.4)).\n\nThe court will generally take a dim view of \"tactical\" use of a limitation period if doing so goes against the court's overriding objective and the duty of the parties to further that objective ([CPR 1\\.1](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part01#1.1) and [1\\.3](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part01#1.3)). There can also be cost implications if you have issued a last\\-minute claim without observing the [practice direction on pre\\-action conduct and protocols](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/pd_pre-action_conduct). However this last point can be fixed by issuing the claim in time and then applying to court for a stay of proceedings while you comply with the pre\\-action PD ([Pre\\-action PD paragraph 17](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/pd_pre-action_conduct#17.1)).\n\nAlso, for some causes of action, the speed at which you bring a claim may be a factor in your chances of success. For example, the governing law for that cause of action might provide that it is a factor. Physical evidence can become lost or unavailable. Witness evidence may be less credible given the passage of time. Etc.",

The juvenile court (or the juvenile division of some other court) would then have discretion to impose a variety of sentences if it found that the juvenile was guilty or if there was a plea bargain (plea bargains would typically resolve 85%\\+ of cases).\n\nThe default sentence would typically be a modest fine and/or a brief period of incarceration in a juvenile facility.\n\nBut, the juvenile court, often as part of a plea bargain proposed by the juvenile's counsel could call (sometimes with the required approval of the prosecutor) for a \"deferred judgment\" in which the case would be dismissed as if it had never happened if certain conditions were met, or probation subject to conditions including attendance at therapy, in lieu of a fine and/or period of incarceration. The resolution you describe in your question sounds more like a deferred judgment than a probation sentence, although the differences are subtle.\n\nInstead of therapy, another possibility would be community service, typically as a probation condition.\n\nTherapy or a deferred judgment, in general, wouldn't typically be limited as a matter of law to first offenses, and would be guaranteed as a remedy in any particular case. It would simply be a common resolution in some particular juvenile courts with a particular set of judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys.\n\nIn practice, often this kind of resolution (i.e. a deferred judgment conditioned on attending therapy or alcoholics anonymous or both) would be proposed by a private lawyer hired by the juvenile's parents who would offer to pay for the therapy at their own expense. \n\nA public defender for an indigent juvenile would often not have the time to arrange the therapy setup and would not have a client with the means to pay for it, so a fine and/or incarceration sentences and/or community service would be a more likely sentence for an indigent (i.e. poor) juvenile.\n\nStill, a lot depends upon the attitude of the prosecutor and judge. Some prosecutors and judges might be inclined to take a hard line (this is particularly common in minority neighborhoods and in a case where a juvenile had many prior offenses); others might be inclined towards leniency and seeing a prospect for rehabilitation (particularly for a white or Asian defendant from a middle class family without many prior offenses). Similarly, boys would be more likely to receive a more severe sentence, while girls would be more likely to receive some leniency. A younger child would also be more likely to receive leniency than an older one.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the U.S. juvenile court system, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the handling of a first-time Minor in Possession charge for a high school student?\n\nA) The court is legally required to mandate therapy sessions before making any judgment.\nB) A deferred judgment with conditions like therapy is guaranteed for first-time offenders.\nC) The outcome largely depends on factors such as the judge's discretion, the prosecutor's stance, and the defendant's background.\nD) Community service is the most common sentence for all juveniles, regardless of their socioeconomic status.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. The outcome of a juvenile case, even for a first-time offense like Minor in Possession, is not predetermined by law. Instead, it depends on various factors, including the judge's discretion, the prosecutor's willingness to negotiate, and the defendant's background (including race, gender, age, and socioeconomic status).\n\nA is incorrect because therapy sessions are not legally mandated in all cases. They may be part of a resolution, but it's not a requirement before judgment.\n\nB is incorrect because deferred judgments, while common, are not guaranteed for first-time offenders. They are often part of plea bargains but depend on the specific circumstances and parties involved.\n\nD is incorrect because while community service is a possible sentence, it's not universally the most common for all juveniles. The sentencing can vary greatly based on the offender's background and the court's approach.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the complexity and variability in juvenile court proceedings, where outcomes can differ significantly based on individual circumstances and the attitudes of the legal professionals involved."

A school district may not encourage classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in primary grade levels or in a manner that is not age\\-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.\n\nExactly what it means for \"A school district\" to \"encourage classroom discussion\" is less than clear. If such discussion is not on the syllabus, nor suggested by the administration, but a teacher starts it, would this law ban it? Note that no penalty is specified for violation, although parental suits against a school district are authorized by the new subsaection 1001\\.42 (8\\)(c)(4\\).\n\nOn its face the bill appears to prohibit the district from \"encouraging\" any such discussion in the primary grades (K\\-3 it seems), and from encouraging it if such discussion is not \"age\\-appropriate\" in other grades.\n\nAs to the question of whether this bill, if it becomes law (as seems likely) would violate anyone's constitutional rights, that is a bit tricky. Teachers and students both have First Admendment rights even during school (see [*Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District*, 393 U.S. 503 (1969\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District) for the key case) but this bill does not purport to prohibit a teacher from making any particular statement. The state does have considerable authority to regulate the curriculum of schools, particularly public schools, and what shall occur there.\n\nHow this provision would be enforced, and what sort of speech, if any, was actually prohibited under it would probably be important in any lawsuit over its constitutionality.\n\nA law that prohibited any mention of sexual identity in school would probably be unconstitutional, but this bill does not claim to do that. If it does that in practice, that would probably weigh against it.",

While the bill does impose restrictions on classroom discussions, it does not explicitly prohibit all mention of sexual orientation or gender identity. The state does have authority to regulate school curricula, but this authority is not unlimited. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the bill's constitutionality is not clearly determined and depends on its interpretation and enforcement. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because states do not have unlimited authority to regulate school curricula, especially when it comes to potential infringement on First Amendment rights. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because even though the bill directly addresses school districts, it could potentially affect individual rights of teachers and students depending on how it is enforced.\n\nThe key point is that the bill's constitutionality would likely be determined by how it is applied in practice and whether it results in prohibiting protected speech."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question concerns the timing of GDPR demands in regard to the \"right to be forgotten\", and data loss.\n\nI am considering creating a web app that allows users to play a game against one another in a play\\-by\\-email format. Users would register accounts, and having registered accounts they would be able to play the game in question against other registered users. They would also be able to post messages to each other.\n\nThis would be a free service and would be run by me as a hobby. It would not be a for\\-profit enterprise.\n\nIt is clear that such a web app would be subject to various provisions of the GDPR, as I would be gathering some identifying or personal information about users:\n\n* Users registering would be required to supply a pseudonymous username to identify themselves. This will typically be personally identifying information, since it is commonplace for people to consistently use a chosen pseudonym/handle across their online presence.\n* Users may post messages to one another. The contents of these messages cannot be guaranteed not to include personal information volunteered by the user, so pessimistically they must be presumed to all be (in their entirety) personally identifying information.\n\nThe GDPR provides that data subjects (in this case, the users of the web app) have a \"right to be forgotten\". This means that the user can contact the data controller (me) and demand that their data be deleted. It is my understanding that they can do this via any reasonable medium; for example, they could send me an email or they could post a message on the site itself, in a place where they could expect the demand to be seen and responded to. I daresay that the moment they make such a post, I am in receipt of the demand and legally required to act on it. \"Acting on it\" in this specific case would probably entail deleting all messages posted by the user, and anonymizing the user's username on the site.\n\nWhat happens if the following chain of events occurs:\n\n1. A user registers to the site, using the pseudonym \"Bob\".\n2. Bob engages in various activities on the site, causing personal information to be stored in the site's database.\n3. I make a routine backup of the site's database. This includes Bob's data from step 2\\.\n4. I go to bed.\n5. Bob posts on the site, demanding that their data be deleted under the terms of the GDPR's \"right to be forgotten\".\n6. The site's database fails catastrophically and all of the data in the live system is irrevocably lost (or it is in any case put beyond my technical capacity to repair it).\n7. I get up.\n8. I notice that the site is down and that the database has been trashed.\n9. I restore the site's database, allowing it to resume operation. Bob's activity from step 2 is restored, but his demand to be forgotten from step 5 is not restored, because it occurred after the database was backed up and I am not aware of it.\n10. Two months later, Bob notices that his data remains on the site, but that I appear to have deleted his demand that I delete that data.\n11. Bob complains about me to some statutory body or other that has a remit to handle such complaints.\n\nBob's action at step 5 creates an obligation on my part to delete all of Bob's data. Per other questions on this site (for example [this one](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/66794/the-scope-of-gdpr-and-the-right-to-be-forgotten)), I do not necessarily have an obligation to delete Bob's data from the backup that was created at step 3; however I do have an obligation to ensure that Bob's data is put beyond use should such a backup be restored to the live system. I have failed to act on that obligation. What potential consequences exist?\n\nI would like to reiterate at this point that I am a \"one\\-man band\", with some technical expertise but no legal expertise whatsoever.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> The GDPR provides that data subjects (in this case, the users of the web app) have a \"right to be forgotten\". This means that the user can contact the data controller (me) and demand that their data be deleted.\n\nMore or less, but there are some details. In my view the term \"right to be forgotten\" is unfortunate, because it raises expectations that the GDPR does not fulfill. What there is, is a right to have personal data (PD) deleted or anonymized, but there are a number of exceptions where the right does not apply.\n\nThe right to deletion is provided for in [GDPR Article 17](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/). (Recitals 65 and 66 are also relevant.) There are six points in Article 17(1\\), and only when at least one of them applies is deletion (erasure) requited. Probably the most common in the sort of situation described in the question is: 17(1\\)(b) which reads:\n\n> the data subject \\[user] withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1\\), or point (a) of Article 9(2\\), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;\n\nBut note that point (b) applies only when \"there is no other legal ground for the processing\". Points (a), (c), or (e) might well also be relevant in the situation described in the question.\n\nHowever, Article 17(3\\) lists five exceptions (points (a) to (e)). If any of these apply, the Data Controller (DC) is not required to delete the data as requested by the DS. Particularly relevant may be point (a) of Article 17(3\\), which reads:\n\n> for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;\n\nWhere a message posted to the site is part of a public exchange of messages, and removing it would render the messages of others unclear so that their expression is hindered, this point may apply and deletion may not be required.\n\nNow to come to the specific situation in the question.\n\nThe result of the chain of events is that Bob has made a request for erasure, but through no intent of anyone's that request was lost and the DC never received it. To Bob it may seem as if it was intentionally ignored.\n\nIf the DC posts an announcement on the site that posts between Time X and Time Y may have been lost, Bob may well see it and know that a re\\-send of the article 17 request would be needed.\n\nBob would in any case be well advised to send a follow\\-up request/demand. If Bob does this the DC will presumably comply, or if an exception applies, tell Bob of the exception, including any needed supporting information. Problem solved.\n\nBut Bob may not make a 2nd request. If Bob complains to a Data Protection Authority (DPA) the DPA may forward this to the DC. In which case the DC will presumably respond that there is no record of the request having been made, and treat it as a new request. If the DPA is at all reasonable, and there is no indication that this DC is in the habit of ignoring Article 17 requests, that may well end the matter. If Bob provides the exact timestamp of his article 7 request, the DC may be able to trace the DB crash and restoration, which should settle the matter.\n\n> Bob's action at step 5 creates an obligation on my part to delete all of Bob's data.\n\nThat is stating the matter overly strongly. My understanding ism that if Bob has included personal information in forum posts or other public posts to the site, and others have then quoted this, the DC has no obligation to edit other people's posts to remove info about Bob. Aside from that, various exceptions may apply, described in Article 17(3\\). If one does apply, the DC has no such obligation. But in any case the DC should acknowledge the request (once the DC learns of it) and if the DC thinks an exception applies, should notify Bob of the exception and why it applies.\n\nIt is not yet clear to what extent the DC is obliged to remove Bob's info from stored backups, or to somehow ensure that if a backup is restored, Bob's data is not restored with it, or else is promptly removed again. Bob's obligation does not extend to cases where unreasonable time and effort would be required, considering the nature of the data involved.\n\nI cannot speak to how reasonable or unreasonable the DPA might be. My understanding is that individual complaints against non\\-commercial sites are not usually a high priority at DPAs, but that may not always be correct. If things get to that point, the DC may well want to consult a lawyer with expertise in such matters.",

But then, the terms of the LGPLv3 allow recipients to remove the additional restrictions.\n\t+ Or, this is an entirely separate license. But then it would no longer be the LGPL, and no longer be an Open Source license.Whether such additional terms create a separate license or can be removed from the license is currently being litigated in the US in the context of the Neo4J database, which added the \"Commons Clause\" restrictions to the AGPLv3\\.

This is sometimes known as an \u201copen core\u201d business model.\n\nDue to the limited copyleft effect of the LGPL, you can still combine the proprietary parts and the LGPL\\-covered parts into a single program, but doing so may be confusing for users. It should be absolutely clear which parts are LGPL\\-covered, and which are your proprietary parts that cannot be modified. However, you would not be able to prevent recipients from using the LGPL\\-covered parts without your proprietary components, i.e. they would always be able to remove any licensing checks etc.\n\nMore generally, it could make sense to think about why you want to publish any part of the software as Open Source.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the scope and implications of this clause?\n\nA) The clause only applies to copyrightable work and does not affect patentable inventions created outside of work hours.\n\nB) The clause attempts to cover all intellectual property, including patents and trade secrets, regardless of their relation to the employee's work duties.\n\nC) The term \"work made for hire\" in the clause automatically includes all inventions created by the employee during their employment period.\n\nD) The clause is legally binding only for full-time employees and does not apply to seasonal workers.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The clause attempts to be a catch-all for all types of intellectual property, including those that may not fall under the \"work for hire\" doctrine, which is specific to copyright law. The phrase \"I hereby assign in perpetuity all of my rights in any such work product which may not be work for hire\" is an attempt to cover other forms of intellectual property such as patents and trade secrets, regardless of their direct relation to the employee's work duties. This broad language could potentially affect inventions or ideas developed outside of work hours or unrelated to the company's business. While the clause's wording may be circular or imperfect, its intent is to claim ownership over a wide range of intellectual property created by the employee during their employment period, regardless of the nature of employment (full-time or seasonal)."

Note that I'm based in the UK, but Microsoft (the parent company at least) is based in the US.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, it's not legal.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) apply given that you are in the UK (regardless of where the Data Processor is based). The [UK GDPR is slightly modified due to Brexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation#United_Kingdom_implementation), but the same principles apply.\n\nThe only plausible legal basis for this actions would be that you **consent** to it, and you're entitled to withdraw that consent at any time.\n\nSome may claim that [Article 6\\.1(b)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32016R0679#L_2016119EN.01000101-d-002) applies, i.e. that it's *necessary* to send marketing email in order to fulfil the contract, but GDPR is clear that bundling such consent into a contract for service simply to permit the data processor additional actions isn't allowed, as I'll demonstrate.\n\nUK GDPR requires that consent to use your personal information (in this case, your email address) for the stated purpose be *freely given*.\n\nConsent to use your information for direct marketing is not freely given if it's inseparable from the consent to use it for some other service, as per [para 43](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32016R0679#ntc10-L_2016119EN.01000101-E0010):\n\n> Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance.\n\nAnd [Article 7\\.4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32016R0679#L_2016119EN.01000101-d-002) backs this up with\n\n> When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, *inter alia*, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.\n\nThe intent of Article 6\\.1(b) is that only the processing *required* for the service you have bought is allowed (e.g. if you supply your address for delivery of stuff you've bought, the data processor can use that address to send you the stuff, but is not allowed to add a contract term that allows them to send you unwanted stuff).\n\nExamples of emails that Article 6\\.1(b) would allow (in my assessment) include things such as notification of upcoming downtime, or a reminder that subscriptions are due, but not unsolicited advertisements for other products. There's a grey area that's open to interpretation, where adverts are piggybacked onto actual service messages.",

Microsoft sends marketing emails for both the subscribed service and other products. The email footer states that to unsubscribe from emails, the user must unsubscribe from the entire service. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this practice under UK GDPR?\n\nA) This practice is legal because the user consented to receive emails by subscribing to the service.\n\nB) This practice is illegal because it violates the GDPR principle of freely given consent for marketing communications.\n\nC) This practice is legal because Microsoft is a US-based company and not subject to UK GDPR.\n\nD) This practice is legal under Article 6.1(b) of GDPR as the marketing emails are necessary to fulfill the service contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The practice is illegal because it violates the GDPR principle of freely given consent for marketing communications. UK GDPR requires that consent for using personal information (like email addresses) for direct marketing be freely given and separable from consent for other services. Bundling marketing consent with service provision and not allowing separate unsubscription from marketing emails while maintaining the service violates this principle. The location of the company (US-based Microsoft) doesn't exempt it from UK GDPR for UK users. Article 6.1(b) doesn't apply here as marketing emails are not necessary to fulfill the core service contract for software downloads."

No roommate agreement but plenty of proof of her paying bills etc. She gave 30 day notice to my property manager but not to me even though she was instructed, by my property manager, to do so since her deposit portion would be my responsibility since I will still be living here and whatever we paid when we first moved in there would remain to the landlord. When the thirty days were here, I received a notice stating she will come for deposit and turn in keys. When I advised I'd deduct utilities unpaid and unpaid rent. She stated she didn't owe any rent or bills due to leaving 10 days before 30 days and not being here for any usage of utilities or space. She did write up a letter releasing my landlord and property manager from contract and responsibility of them returning said deposit. Since they asked us to work something out when she was asking about leaving the contract. She also refused to return the keys.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the deposit was a deposit paid by the roommate to the landlord, it isn't intended to cover debts owed by one co\\-tenant to another, unless there is a provision in the lease that says it is. Who is entitled to the return of the deposit depends on who paid it, and what provisions there are on the subject in the lease.\n\nThe usual assumption, in the absence of a specific agreement, is that rent and utilities are shared equally by co\\-tenets (although specific agreements to some other arrangement are very common). Likewise, the usual default is that rent and utility payments are pro\\-rated when a tenant leaves between due dates. One tenet might have a claim against another who does not pay in such a case, which could possibly be brought in small claims court. Whether there is any right to deduct from the security deposit would depend on there being a specific agreement saying so.\n\nIf the roommate was not a co\\-tenant but was on a sub\\-lease, then the terms of that sub\\-lease would control. If it was oral, it might be hard to prove. If it was implicit with no specific agreement even by word of mouth, that might be even harder.",

Bob decides to move out and gives 30 days' notice to the property manager but not to Alice. Bob leaves 10 days before the end of the 30-day notice period. Alice wants to deduct unpaid utilities and rent from Bob's portion of the security deposit. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) Alice has the right to deduct unpaid utilities and rent from Bob's portion of the security deposit without any prior agreement.\n\nB) The property manager is obligated to return Bob's portion of the security deposit directly to him, regardless of any unpaid bills or rent.\n\nC) Bob is not responsible for any rent or utilities for the last 10 days of the notice period since he wasn't physically present in the apartment.\n\nD) In the absence of a specific agreement, Alice may have a claim against Bob for unpaid rent and utilities, but cannot automatically deduct it from the security deposit.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the documentation, the security deposit is typically intended to cover damages to the property, not debts between co-tenants. Without a specific agreement stating otherwise, Alice cannot automatically deduct unpaid bills or rent from Bob's portion of the security deposit. The usual assumption is that rent and utilities are shared equally and pro-rated when a tenant leaves between due dates. Alice may have a claim against Bob for unpaid rent and utilities, which could potentially be pursued in small claims court. However, deducting from the security deposit would require a specific agreement allowing for such action. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as they misrepresent the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved in this situation."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John wants to fly his new drone in a local public park. The drone weighs 300 grams and has a built-in camera. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the legal requirements for John to operate his drone in this scenario?\n\nA) John needs a flyer ID and can fly the drone in the park as long as he maintains a distance of 50 meters from uninvolved persons.\n\nB) John doesn't need any identification or registration, but must keep the drone below 400 feet and within his line of sight.\n\nC) John needs to register for an Operator ID with the CAA, but cannot legally fly the drone in the park due to its weight.\n\nD) John can fly the drone in the park without any registration as long as he doesn't use the camera function.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because:\n1. Since the drone has a camera, John needs to register for an Operator ID with the CAA.\n2. The drone weighs 300 grams, which is over the 250-gram limit. According to the regulations, drones weighing 250 grams or more must be operated at least 150 meters away from parks, residential zones, and other built-up locations.\n3. Therefore, John cannot legally fly this drone in the park due to its weight, regardless of registration.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misinterprets the distance rule for heavier drones.\nOption B is incorrect because it ignores the camera registration requirement and the weight restriction for parks.\nOption D is incorrect because registration is required for camera-equipped drones regardless of whether the camera is used, and the weight still prohibits use in the park."

I told them I cannot sign a general release as I have a claim to unpaid wages. \n\n**Original Post:**\n\nI asked a question over at Personal Finance and I was advised to ask for legal guidance here. A brief summary (please checkout [full question](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/108689/company-stopped-paying-salary-what-are-my-options) for details) is below:\n\n> My company, based in NYC, has not paid salary for the month of April\n>  2019\\. There is no update for when salary will be paid out, but it looks like it might happen until shortly after May 20, 2019\\. I'm\n>  optimistic, but also skeptical about this. I'm also expecting a bonus\n>  payment for 2018 that has not been paid yet either. It is a long\n>  story, but apparently the funds are currently frozen in another\n>  country due to the firm being a 3rd party in an ongoing investigation\n>  that is coming to a close.\n\nWhat legal options do I have here? Do I have a claim to salary if I quit? I'm nearly positive I would not have a claim to the 100% discretionary bonus. But I am thinking it is best if I quit, move back in with my parents, get a different job, and then await the payment of previously earned salary. This is unless of course I have no legal claim to accrued wages unpaid.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What legal options do I have here?\n\nIt depends on how much you are owed. If it is less than $5000 (in a city court) you can sue them in small claims. If it is more than that, you'll have to sue them in a different court. \n\n> Do I have a claim to salary if I quit?\n\nYes, absolutely. You quitting does not relieve the business of its obligation to pay you for work you have already performed. In some states, they may also be required to pay you for accrued leave (sick/vacation time). You should not have to work for a company that does not pay you, we got rid of slavery a long time ago.\n\n> I'm nearly positive I would not have a claim to the 100% discretionary bonus.\n\nMaybe, maybe not. This depends on your contract and what you've been told. If you were told (in writing) that you would be given $X amount for a bonus for work performed in 2018, the bonus may no longer be discretionary because the company obligated themselves to pay it via a promise. Bonuses may be harder to argue in court, but if you have sufficient documentation that you were promised this bonus then you may have a claim to it. \n\nIf you do decide to go to court with this, gather up as much documentation as you can before quitting, print it out and save it to bring to court or to your lawyer. Make sure to get as much as possible, for example if it is an email, get the whole chain, as much of the headers as possible, etc. If you have voicemails, see if you can save them or record them for later. \n\n**Do not wait too long**, have a lawyer draft up a demand letter the moment you quit outlining exactly everything you are owed, including the bonus, vacation, sick days, etc. Deliver this via certified mail. Don't let them say \"well we'll get you taken care of next week/month/pay day\". There are statutes of limitations (I don't know what they are for NYC) but you should be making an effort to collect, not waiting on them. After you quit, they don't have an incentive to pay you anymore (even though they are legally obligated to).",

The employee is considering quitting. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their legal options?\n\nA) The employee has no legal claim to unpaid wages if they quit the job.\nB) The employee can only claim unpaid wages through small claims court, regardless of the amount owed.\nC) The employee should wait for the company to pay before taking any legal action to avoid losing their claim.\nD) The employee should gather documentation, quit if desired, and promptly send a demand letter for all owed compensation.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate and comprehensive approach based on the given information. The employee has a legal right to their earned wages even if they quit. They should gather all relevant documentation before leaving the job. Upon quitting, they should have a lawyer draft a demand letter outlining all owed compensation (including salary, possible bonus, and any accrued leave) and send it via certified mail. This approach preserves their legal rights, provides a paper trail, and puts the company on notice. Options A and C are incorrect as the employee does have a claim to unpaid wages even after quitting, and waiting too long could potentially impact their ability to collect. Option B is partially true but oversimplified, as small claims court is only an option for amounts under $5000 in NYC."

You can't convert if from one format to another, you can't OCR it to a PDF or image\\-scan a print book into a big picture file. There is a gray tolerance or license area where you may have permission to install multiple copies on a personal device, but there is no exception that says \"you can freely distribute a copy to the public if you change it in such\\-and\\-such way\". Making an unreadable copy that can be accessed by the world is not allows: the fact of making a file unreadable does not negate the protections of copyright law.\n\nThere is a limited workaround in classroom settings, where instructors may make a part of a work available to enrolled students in the class, which involves an interaction between fair use and statutory library copying privileges, which observationally is a large escape hatch that has not been firmly slammed shut by the courts, where access to works so distributed is supposed to be strictly limited \u2013 it stands in for putting a physical copy \"on reserve\" which students can check out for a short period to make their own copies. That is not what you are describing.\n\nYou are liable for infringement that results from your posting of the work, so the main question is whether you engaged in willful infringement, which makes you subject to really big statutory damages (up to $150,000\\), What you describe (using weak encryption e.g. 8 bit encryption or '123' as the password) will almost certainly be found to be willful infringement. The more important question is whether you intended to put it where others could find it. For instance, if you put a link to it on your home page under \"free books\" then that was plainly an attempt to distribute.\n\nis will",

In fact, it applies only to them: The title of the section in question is \"Contributions and donations by foreign nationals,\" and the text of the section reflects that.\n\nA campaign contribution must be received by the campaign organization to be a campaign contribution, so there is the source of US jurisdiction: A foreign person, even one who has never [set foot in](https://archives.cjr.org/language_corner/missed_step.php) the US, can nonetheless be subject to US jurisdiction because of an act whose effects are felt in the US, regardless of where in the world the act was initiated.\n\nThe restrictions on \"electioneering communications\" are implicitly concerned with communications inside US territory, but (even ignoring that) they concern only \"broadcast, cable, or satellite\" communications, which implies that only audio and video communications are in scope.

Section 1(1\\) says that the only contracts concerning goods covered by the Act are those 'under which one person transfers or agrees to transfer to another the property in goods'. A lease doesn't transfer the cooker to you: it gives you exclusive possession of a dwelling containing the cooker. The cooker remains the property of the landlord.\n\nAssuming that your lease is for fewer than seven years, the statutory provision for a landlord's repair obligations is set out in [s11 Landlord and Tenant Act 1985](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/70/section/11). Unfortunately this does not help you: although the landlord is responsible for maintaining the gas and electricity supply equipment, the Act specifically excludes 'appliances for making use of the supply of ... gas or electricity'.\n\nThe text of your lease may have specific provisions for the repair and upkeep of the cooker, so you should read it carefully and seek advice if you are unsure.\n\nMost landlords will leave copies of the instruction manuals for installed appliances. You should ask for a copy of the manual if one was not provided and can't be found in the flat.\n\nIn practical terms, you should report the fault in writing to the landlord (or managing agent if you have one), saying that you are unable to use the cooker and that it is a potential danger given that you don't understand how it works. At the very least, you should ensure that the condition of the cooker is reflected correctly on your inventory.",

But in the state where these children claimed they were abused (Illinois) \\- which is back in 1998, TWENTY\\-ONE YEARS ago, is the claim even holdable in court?\n\nNote that in the episode they couldn't prosecute the molester on 151 counts (the amount of videos they found was 151\\), only two because two videos were the most recent.\n\nWhy are these charges being brought? Aren't they barred by the statute of limitations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In 2017 Illinois changed its law so that criminal charges for child abuse have no statute of limitations, and can be prosecuted as long as the accused is alive. This applies to all such crimes that occur after the new law was passed, and to all prior crimes on which the previous statute of limitations had not yet expired. See [this news story on the change](https://news.wttw.com/2017/08/14/illinois-eliminates-statutes-limitations-child-sex-abuse-crimes)\n\nPreviously, Illinois law allowed for prosecution for up to 20 years after the victim turned 18\\. Since the women Kelly is accused of having abused were 16 or younger in 1998 or later, the older statute of limitations would not have expired until at least 2020\\.\n\nMore than 35 states now have no statute of limitations for child abuse. \n\nBy the way, for civil actions, as opposed to criminal charges, the [Illinois law](https://corporate.findlaw.com/litigation-disputes/the-statute-of-limitations-for-childhood-sexual-abuse-in-illinois.html) now says:\n\n> an action for damages for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse must be commenced within 10 years of the date \\[a person turns 18] or within 5 years of the date the person abused discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover both (i) that the act of childhood sexual abuse occurred and (ii) that the injury was caused by the childhood sexual abuse. The fact that the person abused discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover that the act of childhood sexual abuse occurred is not, by itself, sufficient to start the discovery period under this subsection (b).

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In 2017, Illinois changed its law regarding the statute of limitations for child abuse cases. Which of the following statements accurately describes the current situation in Illinois for criminal charges related to child abuse?\n\nA) Criminal charges for child abuse must be brought within 5 years of the victim's 18th birthday.\n\nB) There is no statute of limitations for child abuse cases, but this only applies to crimes committed after 2017.\n\nC) Criminal charges for child abuse can be brought at any time, as long as the accused is alive, for all cases where the previous statute of limitations had not expired when the law changed.\n\nD) The statute of limitations for child abuse cases is 20 years after the victim turns 18.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In 2017, Illinois eliminated the statute of limitations for child abuse cases. This change applies to all new cases and to all prior cases where the previous statute of limitations had not yet expired. The new law allows for prosecution as long as the accused is alive, regardless of when the crime occurred, as long as the previous statute hadn't run out when the law changed. Option A is incorrect as it describes the old New York law mentioned in the Law and Order episode. Option B is partially correct but fails to account for cases prior to 2017 where the statute hadn't expired. Option D describes the previous Illinois law, which is no longer in effect."

In re Hennen (1839) established the principle that inferior officers appointed under the authority of law \"must hold their office at the discretion of the appointing power.\" This means that the power to remove an inferior officer rests with the specific individual or entity that appointed them, whether it's the President, courts of law, or heads of departments.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the case explicitly states that \"The President has certainly no power to remove\" in cases where the appointment is vested in other entities.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the case does not mention a \"for cause\" requirement. Instead, it suggests that inferior officers serve \"at the will and discretion\" of the appointing power.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while Congress can authorize certain entities to appoint inferior officers, the case doesn't give Congress the ultimate authority over the removal process. The removal power is tied to the appointing power.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the key principle established in In re Hennen regarding the relationship between appointment and removal powers for inferior officers."

While it mentions that dueling was legal in Uruguay until 1971, it doesn't explicitly state that Uruguay was the last country to outlaw the practice.\n\nOption D is clearly false based on the information provided, which shows that dueling was legal in at least one country (Uruguay) well into the 20th century.\n\nThe passage mentions that the law legalizing duels was passed in 1920 (although it says 1921 in one part, the source clarifies it was 1920). It also states that several politically motivated duels were fought in Uruguay in 1971, with at least one newspaper claiming them to be legal.

For the right to assemble, this was recognized in [*De Jonge v. Oregon*, 299 U.S. 353 (1937\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Jonge_v._Oregon).\n\nBut note that the right only protects **peaceable** assembly. When it is alleged that improper violence or other properly unlawful action has occurred, the state may make that criminal, and indeed laws against rioting have existed throughout the history of the US. Whether a law is criminalizing peaceful assembly or prohibiting unlawful violence is a question that depends on th wording of the law, and the way it is applied\n\nIn [the *De Jonge* opinion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/299/353/) the Court wrote:\n\n> The broad reach of the statute as thus applied is plain. While defendant was a member of the Communist Party, that membership was not necessary to conviction on such a charge. A like fate might have attended any speaker, although not a member, who \"assisted in the conduct\" of the meeting. However innocuous the object of the meeting, however lawful the subjects and tenor of the addresses, however reasonable and timely the discussion, all those assisting in the conduct of the meeting would be subject to imprisonment as felons if the meeting were held by the Communist Party.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> While the States are entitled to protect themselves from the abuse of the privileges of our institutions through an attempted substitution of force and violence in the place of peaceful political action in order to effect revolutionary changes in government, none of our decisions goes to the length of sustaining such a curtailment of the right of free speech and assembly as the Oregon statute demands in its present application. In Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, under the New York statute defining criminal anarchy, the defendant was found to be responsible for a \"manifesto\" advocating the overthrow of the government by violence and unlawful means. Id. pp. 268 U. S. 656, 268 U. S. 662, 268 U. S. 663\\. In Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, under the California statute relating to criminal syndicalism, the defendant was found guilty of willfully and deliberately assisting in the forming of an organization for the purpose of carrying on a revolutionary class struggle by criminal methods ...\n> \n> \n> Freedom of speech and of the press are fundamental rights which are safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. *Gitlow v. New York*, supra, p. 268 U. S. 666; *Stromberg v. California*, supra, p. 283 U. S. 368; *Near v. Minnesota*, 283 U. S. 697, 283 U. S. 707; *Grosjean v. American Press Co*., 297 U. S. 233, 297 U. S. 243, 297 U. S. 244\\. The right of peaceable assembly is a right cognate to those of free speech and free press, and is equally fundamental. As this Court said in *United States v. Cruikshan*k, 92 U. S. 542, 92 U. S. 552:\n> \n> \n> \n> > implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances.\n> \n> \n> The First Amendment of the Federal Constitution expressly guarantees that right against abridgment by Congress. But explicit mention there does not argue exclusion elsewhere. For the right is one that cannot be denied without violating those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all civil and political institutions \\-\\- principles which the Fourteenth Amendment embodies in the general terms of its due process clause. *Hebert v. Louisiana*, 272 U. S. 312, 272 U. S. 316; *Powell v. Alabama*, 287 U. S. 45, 287 U. S. 67; *Grosjean v. American Press Co*., supra.",

Oregon and the First Amendment's protection of peaceful assembly, which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered unconstitutional?\n\nA) A state law that criminalizes gatherings of 10 or more people who are peacefully protesting government policies, regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nB) A city ordinance that requires protesters to obtain a permit before assembling in public spaces, with reasonable time and place restrictions.\n\nC) A state law that imposes criminal penalties on individuals who engage in violent acts during a protest, even if they were not the primary instigators.\n\nD) A federal law that prohibits assemblies advocating for the overthrow of the government through violent means.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nA) This is the correct answer because it criminalizes peaceful assembly regardless of political affiliation or content, which directly contradicts the First Amendment's protection of peaceful assembly as applied to states through the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nB) This is incorrect because reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on assemblies have generally been upheld by courts as constitutional, provided they are content-neutral and narrowly tailored.\n\nC) This is incorrect because states have the authority to criminalize violent acts, even in the context of protests. The right to assembly protects only peaceful gatherings.\n\nD) This is incorrect because, as noted in De Jonge v. Oregon, the government can restrict assemblies that advocate for violent overthrow of the government, as this goes beyond the scope of peaceful assembly.\n\nThe key principle here is that while states can regulate certain aspects of assembly and criminalize violent behavior, they cannot broadly restrict peaceful assembly without violating the First and Fourteenth Amendments."
