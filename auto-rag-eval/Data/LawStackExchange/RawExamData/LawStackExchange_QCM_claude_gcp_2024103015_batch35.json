The crucial reasoning of this decision rests on the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\", and follows the reasoning in [Kyllo v United States, 533 US 27](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/533/27/) that there *is* a search when\n\n> \u201cthe individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the\n> object of the challenged search,\u201d and \u201csociety \\[is] willing to\n> recognize that expectation as reasonable.\u201d\n\n(citing [California v.

The opinion observes that in some cases there is a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\", and in some cases there is not \u2013 relevant parameters include whether the location is a home, whether or not the observation was from an airplane or helicopter, the altitude of the observation etc, and in ordinary aircraft suveillance cases, \"defendants could not have reasonably expected the activities and items on their property to be protected from public or official observation made by a human being from the publicly navigable airspace\". In this case, though, photographs \"taken from the ground seem to establish a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy against at least casual observation from a non\\-aerial vantage point\".

It is not that violating an FAA safety regulation violates the 4th Amendment, it is that such a violation bears on what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nThere is a [dissenting opinion](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/siteassets/case-documents/uploads/OPINIONS/FINAL/COA/20210318_C349230_48_349230D.OPN.PDF) in *Long Lake*, which does a reasonable job at picking at the majority opinion. As far as Michigan is concerned, the majority opinion is what counts, but we cannot conclude that the next time this issue comes up, another state will follow suit.

The case of Long Lake Township v.

I've heard (from the tenancy office) that a landlord cannot arbitrarily withhold the damage deposit, but what does this actually mean?\n\nI guess my first question is: When is a tenant held financially responsible for damage? For example, if a rock is thrown from outside and breaks the window, it wouldn't be the tenant's fault. But if the tenant spills something that stains the carpet, then it may be (though even this might be a gray area if the carpets were so old as to be due for replacement anyway).\n\nWhen a tenant moves out, what prevents the landlord from breaking something himself and claiming it was the tenant; or putting a bunch of garbage into the house, claiming the tenant left it, and charging for the delivery to the dump? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A tenant can only be held liable for any damage that is caused during the course of the tenancy if not pre\\-existing (marked by notation in your lease, or photos upon move\\-in). If *you* cause damage you must pay reasonable cost to rectify the damage. I feel comfortable saying that as a rule, landlords are not typically piling trash in the house or breaking things to get your deposit. Logically, they'd still have to have the trash removed and fix any damages, even if they use your deposit, so there is not a whole lot to gain by doing that. Landlords tend to not want their properties damaged; they want the unit re\\-rented. Typically, compared to the monthly value of the unit, your deposit is small in comparison. I have heard people argue this type of thing in court and they inevitably lose.\n\nLandlords, however, cannot act arbitrarily in keeping your deposit. This just means they must be reasonable in what they keep, if anything. If there is a hole or two from nails, they cannot charge to re\\-paint. However, if you trash the walls or if you paint a wall hot pink, they can. If a neignbor kid breaks the window, you'd need to notify the landlord before the day you move out, and take actions to mitigate the damage (ie. speak to the parents of the kid, file a police report, or whatever else supports you landlord in getting it paid for by a third\\-party).\"Reasonable\" generally means that unless you caused damage to the apartment and you abide(d) by the terms of your rental agreement/lease, your landlord must refund your deposit along with interest from the day you moved in. \n\nKeep in mind, if you have a contract, that instrument will direct the terms of what you must do to ensure your deposit is returned. If you don't have a writing, local housing laws will dictate the terms of a tenancy\\-at\\-will. With these, the same rules apply to your deposit, except there are not special conditions except those set by the law, and you can move anytime with 30 days notice from the last paid rent. Otherwise, your rental term will determine when you can leave with no loss of deposit or other financial damages.\n\nSo long as you proceed both during tenancy and upon departure, in keeping with your agreement (which is controlling so long as it is in keeping with the laws), you are entitled to a full refund \\- usually in at maximum of 30 days, or earlier if your lease/agreement sets it out as such. Many landlords will return the deposit after the move\\-out walk through if you've completed the entire term of your lease and owe no back rent or late fees. Walkthrough is integral to getting your deposit back; be sure to take photos. \n\nIf you do have a lease and regardless, you leave early, there will be an early abandonment/termination fee \\- even with prior notice. The fee for this will usually be either a lump sum, or the amount due under the lease had you stayed; if you owe early termination fees your deposit can be kept to help fulfill this amount potentially due. If you have a pet, there may be a non\\-refundable pet deposit; some leases have a non\\-refundable cleaning fee regardless of pets; some require you leave the apartment broom\\-swept and generally clean; some leases charge storage or trash removal for anything left behind. No matter what happens, when your tenancy ends, you should walk through the apartment with your landlord, whereby he he goes through it with you and afterward he signs a statement that you walked through together and there were either no damages\\-or if there are, that they're determined and agreed to at that time. If there is one that you disagree on, mark it as such and try to negotiate how much you'll be charged for it, or if you can fix it yourself. If you cannot agree, he can keep the cost of fixing it, and then your only recourse is to sue to have it returned.\n\nIf your landlord keeps any portion of your deposit, he *must* send an itemized record of what what kept and *why*, and the costs for *each damage* individually itemized. With that, he must return any reminder.\nhere are things that a landlord can never do. Your deposit cannot be kept \"unreasonably\". It would be *unreasonable* to withhold any portion of your deposit if you've not damaged anything and owe no financial reparations. It would be unreasonable if you owe no money. \n\nThere are things that a landlord can never do so as not to keep your deposit \"unreasonably\". It would be *unreasonable* to withhold any portion of your deposit if you've not damaged anything and owe no financial reparations. It would be unreasonable if you owe no money on the lease. A landlord cannot use your deposit to refresh the apartment or for normal wear and tear that occurs under normal use and care. So, for example, if you live there for 5 years you cannot be charged for carpet or paint because it would've been worn with normal careful use \\- whereas, if those items are in bad shape and you moved in only only one year prior (assuming both were new or in great condition), well then your deposit could be used for those damages. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, if you can prove it (or any portion of it) was kept intentionally wrongfully (even if they just couldn't afford it) you can get treble damages (3x what is owed). But, you must show that you ou were due the money back and notice either wasn't given to keep it, or it misrepresented the damages \\- either way, that your money was not returned. The notice to keep any portion must come within the timeframe set out by agreement or housing law in your area.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant has just moved out of an apartment after living there for 3 years.

The broken window, which was reported by the tenant and caused by a third party, is not the tenant's responsibility, especially if the tenant took appropriate steps to report it.

If it is possible, what would such a contract look like (note, I won't be the one to test this, just curious...)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Absolutely not.\n\n### Lack of authority\n\nLaw enforcement officers do not have the authority to grant immunity from prosecution. The decision to prosecute lies with the district attorney's office. Courts have sometimes held that a promise of immunity by a police officer can make resulting statements inadmissible, but that's it \\-\\- the state is not bound by the police officer's promise to not prosecute, except in *exceptional* cases. They can gather other evidence and prosecute anyway.\n\n### Prospective immunity\n\nThe contract claims to provide immunity against prosecution for *future* crimes. Contracts against public policy are void, and I'm having trouble thinking of something which is more against public policy than a license to commit crimes. *No one* can offer that immunity through contract. In a recent trial of a Boston mob boss, he attempted to claim that a federal prosecutor had given him immunity for any and all future crimes for some time period; the court did not accept that, because a license to break the law is not a valid contract.\n\n### Public authority\n\nThere is a situation in which certain officers can grant authority to break certain laws: to catch bigger criminals. However, for fairly obvious reasons, there are *extremely* strict rules on when this is valid, both on the government procedure side and the claiming\\-the\\-defense side. The defense can only work if the defendant *honestly* believed the government had authorized his actions, if the government actually *had* authorized them, or if he followed official government legal advice. In this case, the defendant has no idea if government officials have agreed to the terms; he would have approximately no chance of convincing anyone he legitimately thought that the government approved of his actions. They certainly wouldn't be actually properly authorized, and he hasn't sought advice from the government.\n\n### Other issues\n\nPolice aren't the only people on this site. An investigation tends to involve one or more non\\-government agents who provide testimony in court. No contract with a private party can stop them from testifying in a criminal trial; certain *relationships* mean testimony isn't allowed (e.g. a lawyer can't testify about dealings with their client without client permission), but regular users could be required to testify against the site operator (possibly on the basis of *actual* immunity).\n\n### Sources\n\nPublic authority stuff: [this Justice Department page](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-2055-public-authority-defense), plus some discussion in [this order](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371/pdf/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371-7.pdf). \n\nProspective immunity: [that same order](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371/pdf/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371-7.pdf).\n\nLack of authority: myriad readings.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A dark web site operator includes the following clause in their Terms of Service:\n\n\"By accessing this site, any law enforcement agent agrees to grant the site operator immunity from prosecution for all past and future illegal activities associated with this site.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal validity and implications of this clause?\n\nA) The clause is legally binding and would prevent law enforcement from prosecuting the site operator for any crimes committed through the site.\n\nB) The clause is only valid if a high-ranking law enforcement official, such as the head of the FBI, personally agrees to it.\n\nC) The clause could be used as a defense in court, similar to cases where law enforcement has encouraged crimes to catch bigger criminals.\n\nD) The clause has no legal validity and cannot prevent prosecution of the site operator for any crimes committed.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The clause has no legal validity for several reasons:\n\n1. Law enforcement officers do not have the authority to grant immunity from prosecution. This power typically lies with prosecutors and courts.\n\n2.

This distinction exists because \u00a7 1983 is restricted to acts by agents of US states, while Bivens was added by the Supreme Court to cover analogous actions by federal agents. Neither Bivens actions nor \u00a7 1983 claims require racial discrimination to be alleged, as they can cover various constitutional violations.

And if I have, should I?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US Fifth Amendment right to silence has multiple consequences, one being that the police cannot beat a confession out of you, you cannot be compelled to testify against yourself, and if you refuse to testify, your refusal cannot be considered as evidence of your guilt. There is a related right (the Miranda right), that when arrested, police must inform you of your right to silence and an attorney.\nOn the topic of silence being held against you, that aspect of 5th Amendment rights does not exist in England and Wales, but it remains in Scotland. In fact, in the US there is a kind of \"exception\" to the rule that silence cannot be held against you, in the form of \"adoptive admissions\", where your failure to deny an accusation can be introduced as evidence against you in trial (you can overcome this exception by explicitly invoking your right to silence). The right to silence is generally recognized in common law jurisdictions, but is not historically part of inquisitorial systems (but has spread to such systems in the modern era). Even within common law jurisdictions, the foundation of this right varies. It is encoded in the US Constitution, but is not a constitutional right in Australia. Under French law, a suspect being questioned by a judge during an investigation must be informed of his right to silence, and at trial he can be compelled to testify, but he is free to say whatever he wants, including telling lies.\n\nAs for Indonesia, Ch. VI of the [Law of Criminal Procedure](http://defensewiki.ibj.org/images/6/62/Indonesia_Law_of_Criminal_Procedure.pdf) covers any supposed right to silence: Art 66 says that \"A suspect or an accused shall not bear the burden of proof\". However, Article 175 says \"If the accused declines to answer or refuses to answer a question addressed to him, the head judge at trial shall suggest that he answer and thereafter the examination shall be continued\". See also [this article](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/72000/asa210052006en.pdf) by Amnesty International which concludes that there is no formal right to silence in Indonesian law, and there is an obligation to answer questions.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the right to silence in Indonesia compared to the United States?\n\nA) Indonesia has a constitutional right to silence similar to the US Fifth Amendment, including protection against self-incrimination and the right to remain silent during police questioning.\n\nB) Indonesia has no formal right to silence, and suspects are obligated to answer questions during criminal proceedings, unlike in the United States.\n\nC) Both Indonesia and the United States have identical rights to silence, including Miranda warnings and protection against self-incrimination in court.\n\nD) Indonesia's right to silence is stronger than the US, as suspects in Indonesia can never be compelled to testify or answer questions in any legal proceeding.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, Indonesia does not have a formal right to silence equivalent to the US Fifth Amendment. The Law of Criminal Procedure in Indonesia states that while a suspect or accused does not bear the burden of proof (Article 66), they are expected to answer questions during trial proceedings (Article 175). The Amnesty International report confirms that there is no formal right to silence in Indonesian law and that there is an obligation to answer questions. \n\nIn contrast, the United States has a strong constitutional protection against self-incrimination through the Fifth Amendment, which includes the right to remain silent during police questioning and court proceedings.

The determination of liability then reduces to general principles of liability and negligence, which are very fact\\-centric. An example of a scenario where the driver is not at fault is when the driver is driving down the lane at an appropriate speed and a pedestrian leaps into the lane from behind a parked car (is obscured by the car) right in front of the car. The question that the courts would ask is whether the driver was using ordinary caution (watching for pedestrians or cars backing out), and could have reasonably stopped. See [People v.

In [Washington v. Glucksberg](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/702/) (one of the states that subsequently made such suicides legal), SCOTUS affirms that such a law does not violate the Due Process Clause. Given a historical analysis, the court concludes that an \"asserted 'right' to assistance in committing suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause\". O'Connor in her concurring opinion further states that \"There is no dispute that dying patients in Washington and New York can obtain palliative care, even when doing so would hasten their deaths\", but this falls short of a ruling that a person has a protected liberty interest in seeking medical care.\n\n[Cruzan v. Director](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/497/261/) affirms that \"\\[a] competent person has a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in refusing unwanted medical treatment\" (also noting that \"informed consent\" may derive from common law or specific state constitutions). Reciting prior reasoning on Due Process and medical treatment and referring to Jacobson v. Massachusetts (smallpox case), they note that \"the Court balanced an individual's liberty interest in declining an unwanted smallpox vaccine against the State's interest in preventing disease\". There seems to be a dearth of cases affirming a protected liberty interest in *seeking* a particular medical procedure.\n\nWere the court to announce a fundamental right to seek some medical treatment, that right could still be subordinated to the states compelling interest in preventing some harm associated with a medical procedure, with legal review being carried out under a strict scrutiny standard.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that Congress *does* limit access to drugs and devices, hence there is no constitutionally\\-protected right to take LSD as a treatment for mental problems.

The passage indicates that while there is established precedent for a person's right to refuse medical treatment (as in Cruzan v. Director), there is \"a dearth of cases affirming a protected liberty interest in seeking a particular medical procedure.\" The Supreme Court has upheld state bans on certain medical practices (such as physician-assisted suicide in Washington v. Glucksberg) and has not established a broad fundamental right to seek any desired medical treatment. While abortion has been protected in some cases, this doesn't extend to all medical procedures.

They vary from one jurisdiction to the next, but most of them run largely parallel.\n\nOne important consideration is [Model Rule 3\\.5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/ethics/aba/current/ABA_CODE.HTM#Rule_3.5), which prohibits a lawyer from contacting a juror if:\n\n> (1\\) the communication is prohibited by law or court order;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the juror has made known to the lawyer a desire not to communicate; or\n> \n> \n> (3\\) the communication involves misrepresentation, coercion, duress or harassment.\n\nAssuming there is contact, [Evidence Rule 606(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_606) says that testimony from a juror is generally not admissible when it's about the jury's deliberations. There are some exceptions:\n\n> A juror may testify about whether:\n> \n> \n> (A) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention;\n> \n> \n> (B) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or\n> \n> \n> (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.\n\nGenerally speaking, courts seem to be very reluctant to entertain a losing party's attempt to revive litigation based on what happened in the jury room, so they seem to take a very narrow view of what it takes to meet one of those exceptions:\n\n* \"Extraneous prejudicial information\" is more likely to refer to a juror knowing that the defendant in a car crash case was a child molester, rather than a juror previously owning the same kind of car and knowing that it has a weird blind spot that could cause the accident.\n* \"An outside influence\" is more likely to refer to someone trying to bribe or threaten a juror, rather than a juror's husband pressuring him to wrap up deliberations and get home.\n* \"A mistake in entering the verdict on the verdict form,\" for instance, is more likely to involve circling \"yes\" instead of \"no,\" rather than a mathematical error in calculating the damages awarded to a plaintiff.\n\nSo unless something went seriously wrong, it seems unlikely that a juror would be called back into court to discuss anything that happened behind closed doors.\n\nThese rules, though, govern only whether the attorney may reach out and whether the juror's testimony may be admitted into court; they don't really say anything about whether a juror should be talking to the lawyer in the first place. On that question, the decision is the juror's. Generally speaking, the juror is not required to keep deliberations secret, but the juror is not required to answer questions about deliberations, either. A juror who believes that some injustice occurred in the deliberations may very well want to answer questions from the lawyer, or even reach out to the lawyer or the court herself.\n\nBut a juror who is confident that everything went right, or who thinks the losing party is just trying to escape liability, or who just wants to be left alone, may refuse to answer questions, sign statements, or otherwise reveal anything that happened.

In the County Court, High Court, and Court of Appeal (Civil Division), the governing law is found in the [Civil Procedure Rules](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules). A good starting point is [Part 44](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs) (general rules about costs) and in particular Rule 44\\.2 which provides:\n\n> (1\\) The court has discretion as to \u2013\n> \n> \n> (a) whether costs are payable by one party to another;\n> \n> \n> (b) the amount of those costs; and\n> \n> \n> (c) when they are to be paid.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) If the court decides to make an order about costs \u2013\n> \n> \n> (a) the general rule is that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to\n> pay the costs of the successful party; but\n> \n> \n> (b) the court may make a different order.\n\nWhether or not you can recover costs (and how much) depends on many factors. See for example [Rule 44\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#rule44.4) which lists (among others) the following factors:\n\n* Whether the costs are proportionate.\n* Whether the costs are reasonably incurred.\n* Whether the costs are reasonable in amount.\n* The conduct of the parties including efforts made to settle.\n* The value of the case.\n* The importance of the matter to the parties.\n* The complexity of the case.\n* Time spent on the case.\n\nSettlement negotiations can also have specific cost implications, particularly if the formal [Part 36](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part36) procedure is followed:\n\n* [Rule 36\\.13](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part36#36.13) provides that a claimant can generally recover costs up to the point at which a Part 36 offer is accepted.\n* [Rule 36\\.17](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part36#36.17) provides for cost consequences for a party who refuses a Part 36 offer and subsequently fails to achieve a better outcome in the proceedings.\n\nNote that it is fairly common to be unable to recover *all* your costs even if you obtain a costs order in your favour.\n\nFor some types of case, you will generally be unable to recover costs at all, or only very limited costs. This applies to e.g. a case allocated to the Small Claims Track, pursuant to [Rule 27\\.14](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part27#27.14) and also to many types of Tribunal cases.\n\nQuestions asking for specific legal advice are off\\-topic on this site.

According to the Civil Procedure Rules, particularly Rule 44.2 and 44.4, the court has discretion in awarding costs and considers multiple factors. These include the conduct of the parties, efforts to settle, case complexity, proportionality of costs, and whether the costs were reasonably incurred.

In a nutshell,\n\n> The VCS came into existence as a sovereign nation in 1929 with the signing of the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy. The signing effectively ended the \u201cRoman Question,\u201d the decades old tension between the Catholic Church and the nation of Italy. Prior to the treaty, the relationship between the Church and the country was governed by the Law of Papal Guarantees, an Italian law that allowed the Pope a certain amount of autonomy within the borders of Italy.\n> \n> \n> The Lateran Treaty consisted of three separate documents spread over twenty\\-seven articles and four annexes: an agreement acknowledging the Vatican as an independent state, also known as the Treaty of Conciliation; a concordat on church state relations between the city state and Italy; and a financial convention liquidating the financial claims of the Holy See against Italy. In signing the treaty, Italy ceded 108\\.7 acres of Rome to the Holy See, thus creating the world\u2019s smallest sovereign nation. At the signing, Pope Pius XI was represented by Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, papal secretary of state, while King Emanuel III was represented by Benito Mussolini, prime minister of Italy. The Lateran Treaty was incorporated into the Italian Constitution sixteen years later in 1947\\.\n> \n> \n> . . .\n> \n> \n> On the same day that the Lateran Treaty was signed, the VCS adopted a constitution in the form of six constitutional (or fundamental) laws: Fundamental Law of the City of the Vatican; Law of the Source of Laws; Law on the Rights of Citizenship and Sojourn; Law on Administrative Organization; Law on Economic, Commercial, and Professional Organization; and Law of Public Security. Under the second of these laws, the sources of VCS law were comprised of the Codex Iuris Canonici (Canon Law Code), and \u201c\\[t]he laws promulgated for the City of the Vatican by the Sovereign Pontiff or by any other authority delegated by him, as well as the regulations lawfully issued by the competent authority.\u201d Article 3 of this law also allowed for the use of Italian law as well as provincial and municipal Roman law when they did not conflict with canon law, the rules of the Lateran Treaty (and, later, the 1984 Concordat), or divine law.\n\n**The role of the Pope**\n\n> The VCS is a unique entity in that the state\u2019s monarch is also the spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic Church throughout the world. As the elected absolute temporal monarch of the state, the Pope has full legislative, executive, and judicial authority over the jurisdiction. The Pope delegates most of this authority to a variety of organs within the Vatican City, all of whose members may be appointed or removed at the discretion of the Pope. The powers and duties of these various organs are described in detail later in this article.\n\nIn other words, everybody answers to the Pope. He may not oversee this particular case, but he theoretically could. More specifically, though,\n\n> The judicial system of the VCS is organized as follows: a sole judge (Giudice Unico) presiding over a court of limited jurisdiction; a three\\-judge Tribunal (Tribunale); a four\\-member Court of Appeals (Corte d\u2019Appello); and, finally, the Supreme Court of Appeals (Corte di Cassazione). It is important to distinguish these judicial organs from those of the Roman Curia, which is the administrative arm of the Holy See. Cases from temporal VCS courts are not generally reported, but a listing of the types of cases tried before each of the courts is published in L\u2019Attivita della Santa Sede, the annual yearbook.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: What is the highest judicial authority in the Vatican City State (VCS)?\n\nA) The Giudice Unico (sole judge)\nB) The Tribunale (three-judge Tribunal)\nC) The Corte di Cassazione (Supreme Court of Appeals)\nD) The Pope\n\nCorrect Answer: D) The Pope\n\nExplanation: While the Vatican City State has a judicial system with various courts, including a Supreme Court of Appeals (Corte di Cassazione), the highest authority in the VCS is actually the Pope.

This finding was made although no prosecutions under such a law had been carried out in some years, and the policy of the Attorney\\-General of Cyprus was that there should be no such prosecutions.\n\nNote at the time of this case Mr Modinos held the position of 'President of the \"Liberation Movement of Homosexuals in Cyprus\"', so his sexual preferences were not exactly secret \\-\\- this being one reason he was fearful of future prosecution under the Cyprus law.\n\nThis publicity did not deprive him of he protection of ECHR article 8 or of the Cyprus Constitution article 15, both of which protect \"private life\".

It follows from the nature of the reasonable man, as a means of describing a standard applied by the court, that it would be misconceived for a party to seek to lead evidence from actual passengers on the Clapham omnibus as to how they would have acted in a given situation or what they would have foreseen, to establish how the reasonable man would have acted or what he would have foreseen. **Even if the party offered to prove that his witnesses were reasonable men, the evidence would be beside the point.** **The behaviour of the reasonable man is not established by the evidence of witnesses, but by the application of a legal standard by the court.** The court may require to be informed by evidence of circumstances which bear on its application of the standard of the reasonable man in any particular case; but it is then for the court to determine the outcome, in those circumstances, of applying that impersonal standard.\n> 4.

What they have going for them is a very wealthy benefactor, extensive physical trauma to the brain, and following their getting an identity this character will be comming into money due to the benefactor.\n\nSo far, I've looked at applying for asylum and outright buying citizenship in a country.\n\nEdit: To clarify the situation and add an alternate question. This character is a stateless person, would citizenship be needed to do business, have a bank account, etc?\n\nFor the first, this would stem from her feigning amnesia, knowing her name and how to do things but little else. It is enough for a search to be made and not find anyone matching her. To assist this she would have two gunshot wounds to the head that on a CT would confirm that she suffered extensive brain damage and survived it. So her claim isn't unreasonable. There are however issues assosciated with the plot that I would have to work around.\n\nThe second option I looked at is approaching countries where citizenship could be bought, such as in the case of Malta and others. However, I believe that the conventional \"buy citizenship in X country with an investment\" would require prior documentation, a background check, and you wouldnt just be allowed to get creative while filling in your information. For this I am entirely uncertain if a larger \"investment\" into said country would be sufficient for them to overlook the character having no prior documentation.\n\nUltimately this is Fiction, so there can be flexability and suspension of disbelief can be stretched a bit or the details left a bit ambiguous, however, I believe being grounded in realism is important to the immersion of the story.

They would stop at particular locations, and hold court together with the local judge of a district court as a two\\-judge court. Appeals from district court decisions were heard. Some were passed along to the full Supreme Court, particularly ones in which the Justice did not agree with the judge.\n\nEach Justice had a route, or \"circuit\" which that Justice covered once or twice a year on horseback (or by carriage) spending half or more of his time \"riding circuit\". The process was quite onerous, and was by far the larger part of the work of a Justice. It allowed decisions to be reviewed by a Supreme Court member at places physically closer to the original trials, and served as a filter on cases to be decided by the full court.\n\nThis practice was derived from the older English practice of having ***Justices in Iter*** (later known as circuit judges) who traveled through the country, judging cases that had been held awaiting their arrival. (The word \"Iter\" is related to \"Itinerary\", the list of places one is scheduled to visit.)\n\n*The Marshall Court and Cultural Change, 1815\\-1835* by G. Edward White (ISBN 978\\-0195070590\\) includes a detailed description of the process of circuit riding during the period of 1815\\-1835, and the way in which proceeding in the circuit courts influenced constitutional jurisprudence and how cases came to the Supreme Court. I recommend this extensive book for better understanding of the origins of many features of the US Judicial system.\n\nSome years after the US Civil war the Circuit Courts officially became the Courts of Appeals and Supreme Court justices stopped \"riding circuit\", but the geographical divisions continued to be called \"circuits\", and each circuit is still supervised by a single Justice, who rules on \"emergency\" applications, often for stays of judgement, or for injunctions.\n\nThe division of the US court system into circuits thus is due as much to historical inertia as to careful design, although an alternate design that was an improvement would not be easy to create.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: The system of circuit courts in the United States judicial system can be primarily attributed to:\n\nA) A deliberate design to create regional variations in law interpretation\nB) The historical practice of Supreme Court Justices \"riding circuit\"\nC) An attempt to reduce the workload of the Supreme Court\nD) A constitutional mandate for decentralized federal courts\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The circuit court system in the U.S. is primarily a result of historical practices, specifically the tradition of Supreme Court Justices \"riding circuit.\" This involved Justices traveling to different regions to hear cases alongside local judges, creating geographical divisions that eventually became the modern circuit courts. While options A, C, and D touch on aspects that may have some relevance to the current function of circuit courts, they do not accurately represent the primary historical reason for their establishment.

G.F.*, [2021 SCC 20](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18884/index.do)) and\n* administering a stupefying substance.\n\nIf someone were to use a \"substance such as everyday alcohol\" (I would reject the premise that this is \"benign\") for the purpose of facilitating sexual assault, this would be an offence under [s. 246 of the *Criminal Code*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-35.html#docCont). Section 246 makes it an offence for a person, \"with intent to enable or assist himself or another person to commit an indictable offence\" to administer or cause any person to take a \"stupefying or overpowering drug, matter, or thing.\"\n\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario has accepted that the element of administering a stupefying thing could be established by oversupply of alcohol.

I have tried discussing it with them on several occasions, but my protests seem to be falling on deaf ears.\n\nSo, I am wondering if I have any legal options to prevent them from unilaterally making modifications to the house? For example, could I apply for a court injunction to prevent them making modifications without my express consent?\n\n**Edit:** Of course, they are my family and I'm not saying I would like to see them dragged off and put in jail/punished. But, if push comes to shove and the 'diplomatic' approach fails, I am thinking that a court summons or some type of official court order might have a 'wake up and smell the coffee' effect of showing them that I am dead serious about asserting and defending any legal rights that I (may) have, as a joint owner.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I jointly own a house, along with my wife and her parents\n> \n> \n> could I apply for a court injunction to prevent them making modifications without my express consent?\n\nImagine you were the only owner of the house but had split personality. Once in a while something would switch in your mind making you try to modify/sell/demolish the house. When it happens, a close friend would talk you back into your normal state. Scared of what you could have done, you apply for a court injunction to prevent *yourself* making modifications etc. to the house. Unless the court decides you are no longer in legal capacity, it rejects your application.\n\nLegally, *join ownership* is no different in this context. You have to deal with your joint co\\-owners like you would have to deal with your other personality in the example above.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a joint ownership situation of a house, what is the most accurate legal perspective on making modifications without all owners' consent?\n\nA) Any co-owner can seek a court injunction to prevent others from making modifications without unanimous consent.\n\nB) Joint ownership legally requires all owners to agree on any modifications before they can be made.\n\nC) The law treats joint owners as a single legal entity, similar to how an individual would make decisions about their own property.\n\nD) Co-owners can make unilateral decisions about modifications as long as they inform the other owners afterward.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the legal perspective treats joint ownership as a single entity, similar to an individual making decisions about their own property. The documentation compares this situation to someone with a split personality, emphasizing that the court would not grant an injunction against oneself. This analogy illustrates that in joint ownership, co-owners must resolve issues among themselves rather than seeking legal intervention to restrict each other's actions.

Do 'No Trespassing' signs protect us (the private property owners) from liability if individuals were to get injured on our property?\n2. If yes, would an 'Enter at Your Own Risk' or similar sign provide the private property owners with the same liability protections?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Overview\n--------\n\nThis is a somewhat complex issue. The presence of \"No Trespassing\" signs would make anyone who enters the property without a specific invitation a trespasser. So would the presence of a fence, even if there was a closed but unlocked gate. An \"Enter at your own risk\" sign probably would not make such people legally trespassers.\n\nIn West Virginia, a landowner or lessee or other lawful occupant owes a duty of \"reasonable care\" to invitees and other non\\-trespassers. No such duty is owed to trespassers. However, the owner or lawful occupant is expected to avoid dangerous conditions and reckless hazards, as well as intentional causes of harm (such as booby\\-traps). If through recklessness or serious negligance a dangerous condition exists and a person, even a trespasser, is injured or killed because of such a condition, the owner or lawful occupant is likely to be liable. However, if the danger is \"open and obvious\" or is as well known to the injured person as to the owner or occupant, there is no liability. A warning sign **might** make a danger \"open and obvious\".\n\nI do not see that video cameras will be relevant to the matter at all. Cameras do not warn a pedestrian not to enter, nor do they warn of any danger, nor do they prevent a pedestrian from being injured. They may help in detecting or even preventing crime, but will not affect liability for injury to a pedestrian.\n\nSources\n-------\n\n### West Virginia Code Code Sections\n\n[\u00a761\\-3B\\-3\\.

(a) to restore the exception.\n\nThe article also reads:\n\n> West Virginia state law requires property owners remove hazards from their property to reduce the risk of these injuries. The expectation is dependent on the type of person that is on the property. Previously, visitors were broken into one of four categories: invitee, licensee, social guest or trespasser. The duty of care owed to the visitor depended on the category under which the visitor qualified. Today, there are only two categories: trespasser and non\\-trespasser.

They may also be held liable if the condition of their properties could cause serious bodily harm or death. Further, landowners can also potentially face legal consequences if they fail to warn potential trespassers that there are hazards on their properties.\n\nThe article [\"Determining Duty in West Virginia Premises Liability Cases\"](https://www.colombolaw.com/west-virginia-blog/determining-duty-in-west-virginia-premises-liability-cases/) from Colombo Law reads:\n\n> Most states use three categories to determine whether a duty is owed to individuals who enter the property of another. These three categories are business invitee, licensee, and trespasser. In the past, West Virginia was one of the many states that followed this standard. However, in 1999 West Virginia abolished and replaced the three specific classifications with a new, more general standard of determining whether the individual is a trespasser or a nnon\\-trespasser\n> \n> \n> * Trespasser. A trespasser is an individual who enters the property of another without the permission of a landowner. An individual will be deemed a trespasser if they do not have either express or implied permission from the owner. In West Virginia, the courts offer little protection to those who are trespassers. As a trespasser, a landowner must only refrain from intentional or reckless conduct.\n> * Non\\-Trespassers. Contrary to trespassers, landowners owe a duty to anyone that is permitted to be on the property. If an individual enters private property with the express or implied permission of a landowner, the landowner must ensure that the premises are reasonably safe for those on the premises. To ensure you are meeting the standard of care, the landowner must inspect the premises to determine whether there are any dangerous conditions present on the property and repair and/or warn individuals of the danger.\n> \n> \n> Premises liability is the legal premise for which landowners are responsible for harm caused by unsafe conditions existing on the landowner\u2019s premises. Premises liability is a broad concept that may be raised for a variety of harms present. One main reason for personal injury actions stemming from premises liability include slip and fall accidents as a result of:\n> \n> \n> * Slippery floors\n> * Uneven sidewalks or pavement\n> * Objects protruding from carpeting , floorboards, or store shelves", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In West Virginia, a property owner has allowed pedestrians to use a shortcut through their vacant property for years to avoid a dangerous road.

Which of the following actions would best protect the owner from liability while still allowing pedestrians to use the shortcut?\n\nA) Post \"No Trespassing\" signs around the property\nB) Install security cameras to monitor the property\nC) Post \"Enter at Your Own Risk\" signs and maintain the path in a reasonably safe condition\nD) Do nothing, as years of allowing access has created an implied right-of-way\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) While \"No Trespassing\" signs would make pedestrians legal trespassers and reduce the owner's duty of care, it doesn't align with the owner's desire to allow continued use of the shortcut.\n\nB) Security cameras don't affect liability for injuries and don't warn pedestrians of potential dangers.\n\nC) This is the best option because:\n   - It maintains the owner's intent to allow pedestrians to use the shortcut\n   - \"Enter at Your Own Risk\" signs may make dangers \"open and obvious,\" reducing liability\n   - Maintaining the path in a reasonably safe condition fulfills the duty of care owed to non-trespassers\n   - It balances safety concerns with allowing continued access\n\nD) Doing nothing doesn't address the liability concerns and may not be sufficient protection if a dangerous condition exists on the property.\n\nOption C provides the best balance of allowing access while taking reasonable steps to reduce liability."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25534/can-customers-be-kicked-out-because-a-store-employee-personally-dislikes-them", "docs_id": 25534, "title": "Can customers be kicked out because a store employee personally dislikes them?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: An ex\\-friend works at a store.

Are Congressionally imposed deadlines in resolutions proposing an amendment to the States for ratification binding?\n2. Does a state withdrawal of its ratification of an amendment annul its ratification of the amendment?\n3. Who decides when an amendment is ratified?\n\nFor the first question this is perhaps the most unresolved question. Clearly if the deadline is imposed in the text of the amendment it is binding. For example, see the text of the 18th amendment, Section 3\\.\n\nWhat is not clear is what if any binding effect a deadline in the text of the resolution proposing an amendment has as to the validity of the proposed amendment. Article V makes no provision on such deadlines. In fact the most recent amendment ratified was submitted for ratification on September 25, 1789, but ratified May 5, 1992\\. In this instance the Archivist of the United States declared the amendment ratified, but Congress also acted to do so and several members scolded the Archivist for doing so before Congress acted. However, there was no resolution of who had to actually approve the ratification.\n\nFor the second question there is absolutely no answer to this question except Coleman v. Miller which suggests this is a political question. This essentially means that the question should be resolved by Congress, not the courts.\n\nLastly, for the third question see also my response to the first question. If Congress is indeed the ratifier, what happens if one Congress decides the amendment was not ratified, but a future one decides it was?\n\nHonestly, ratification of the ERA would open a whole can of worms and make it difficult to really resolve this issue.

In this case, it is when the purchaser has consumed or otherwise dealt with the banana to their satisfaction. The vendor has ongoing obligations under the contract until this happens. For example, obligations that the banana is of merchantable quality and fit for purpose. If the purchaser peels the banana and discovers that it is \"off\" or eats the banana and develops food poisoning then the vendor still has obligations and can be sued under the contract.\n\nYes, I realize that no one is going to sue anyone over a rotten banana but let's assume that \"banana\" is code for 54km of motorway construction and \u00a31 is actually \u00a31 billion.\n\nWhen is the contract *formed*?\n------------------------------\n\nThis is not a trivial determination and there are literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of lawsuits that have turned on this exact question.
