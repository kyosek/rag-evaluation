The client, who is a professional in the same field as the opposing party's expert witness, suggests asking technical questions during cross-examination. Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate and legally sound for the attorney to take?\n\nA) Allow the client to directly question the expert witness, as this would lead to the most thorough examination\nB) Have the client whisper questions to the attorney during the cross-examination for immediate relay\nC) Prepare extensively with the client beforehand, incorporating their technical knowledge into a structured line of questioning\nD) Request a recess during cross-examination to consult with the client on follow-up questions\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of legal principles and courtroom procedures. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, a party represented by an attorney is not allowed to directly examine witnesses, even if they are more qualified. This eliminates option A.\n\n2. Option B, while creative, would likely be seen as inappropriate in court and could be objected to as coaching the attorney or indirect examination by the client.\n\n3. Option D, while not entirely incorrect, is less efficient and could disrupt the flow of cross-examination. Frequent recesses might also be viewed unfavorably by the judge.\n\n4. Option C is the most appropriate because it allows the attorney to leverage the client's expertise while adhering to proper legal procedures. By preparing extensively beforehand, the attorney can incorporate the client's technical knowledge into a structured line of questioning. This approach respects the rules of court, maintains the attorney's role as the examiner, and still utilizes the client's expertise effectively.\n\nThis solution balances the need for technical accuracy in questioning with the legal requirements of courtroom procedure, demonstrating a high-level application of both legal and professional concepts."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30808/can-a-website-that-passively-promotes-illegal-activities-be-legally-shutdown", "docs_id": 30808, "title": "Can a website that passively promotes illegal activities be legally shutdown?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've seen a couple of clearnet websites that have been around for years that, although not directly, do create and promote a type of community where most of its members sell and buy stuff such as stolen/cracked online accounts, stolen databases, hacking tools such as bruteforcers, blackhat methods, perhaps a user may offer services for social engineering or a service for doxing for someone's financial or SSN information. \n\nSo although the website itself claims to be \"neutral\" and have a ToS that states that it does not promote such activities, pretty much half the userbase does it anyway, and half of the threads on the forums relate to doing something illegal or selling something stolen like a cracked game account.\n\nCan such a website can be legally shut down?

Writing software that breaks a law or a TOS is not itself always illegal.

Word searches work well for some kinds of case law issues, but poorly for statutes and regulations. Some issues, however, are hard to research with word searches, even if they involve case law.\n\nWestlaw codes the important legal holdings of every published case in categories based upon their \"key\" system which has a subject\\-matter based digest of all case law. If you find one case with a key code that is on point, you can search all 50 states for that.\n\nThe \"Restatements of Law\" (e.g. Restatement of Contracts, Restatement of Torts) purports to be a summary of the majority common law rules in the named subject area, although it often reflects the lead author and supporting drafting committee's view on the \"better rule\" rather than the majority rule. These are very influential and often cited by courts in states where there is no case law on point. Some have been updated several times to reflect changes in the common law over time in different subject areas (e.g. the original Restatement of Contracts favored form over substances in a way that the later version do not). The American Bar Association signs off on these before they are published.\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures promulgates \"Uniform\" and \"Model\" acts that states may adopt with or without amendment and tracks which states have adopted them and with what modifications.\n\nMost areas of law are the subject of legal treatises that make comprehensive 50 state summaries of relevant case law, one or two of which are typically the \"leading treaties\" and widely used and relied upon.\n\nMany law review articles will do summaries of as many states' laws as possible on a given issue.\n\nMany lobbying and special interest groups and also nolo.com prepare 50 state summaries. A good, reasonably up to date and accurate source on many topics is Wikipedia.\n\nUltimately, all secondary sources rely on somebody digging through state statutes in every state, analyzing them and coding them accurately, usually with citations to the source material.

If your business has goods or services sold in more than one category using the same mark, you can protect it in every category that applies.\n\nWith respect to each category, if a good or service in a category sold with a mark just like yours would harm your sales of goods and services that you currently provide, then it makes sense to seek a mark in that category. If your product line expands, you can also add categories later if someone else using the same mark or a confusingly similar one hasn't moved into that market in the meantime.\n\nIn the case of a medical manufacturing company, the cost of obtaining a trademark in an additional category after the first category (several thousand dollars or less), relative to the economic importance of the company's trademarks and the economic scale of your operations (which should be in the multiple millions of dollars), is so small that cost should be a non\\-issue. So, you should apply for a trademark in every category that you could plausibly and truthfully be said to do business in.\n\nIf you can't afford a few thousand dollars to perfect a trademark in a few additional categories, you should think twice about whether investing in trademark registration at all makes any sense, because enforcing a trademark in the face of potential infringement is far more expensive (tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars for each infringer who doesn't go away with a mere cease and desist letter and thousands of dollars a year monitoring the market for infringement) and if you fail to enforce your trademark in the face of clear evidence of infringement, you risk your trademark losing its validity entirely.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A tech startup, MediTech, has developed a suite of innovative medical devices along with companion software applications.

The correct answer, C, aligns with the expert's advice to \"apply for a trademark in every category that you could plausibly and truthfully be said to do business in.\" \n\nMediTech's business spans both medical devices (class 010) and services related to producing and designing these devices (class 044).

The broadest is the non\\-legal \"in order to avoid all negative consequences\", in which case probably any and all. From the legal POV, you can distinguish two varieties of compulsion, one being ordinary tort or contractual liability. Theoretically, I could try to sue anybody that uses color distinctions to convey information on a web page. As an out\\-of\\-the\\-blue web surfer (no pun intended) I would probably have no luck. However, I might have a contractual relationship with a website, where I pay big money and they provide me information, only they do it via virtually imperceptable color differences like 123456 vs 123459\\. It is possible (but certainly not a foregone conclusion) that they would be in breach of the agreement. One would have to look at the contract. That then leaves the possibility that there is a federal or state regulation that obligates some/all web pages to comply with certain standards (which could lead to a discrimination suit). The short answer is, there aren't any across\\-the\\-board requirements. There are very many specific requirements.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the two relevant pieces of law are the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990) and the [Rehabilitation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973). Whether or not you have to do something to comply with these acts depends on what you are doing. One reason would be in connection with employment: as an employer, I have some legal obligation to comply. Regarding 42 USC 12111, an employer is\n\n> a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more\n>  employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in\n>  the current or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such person,\n>  except that, for two years following the effective date of this\n>  subchapter, an employer means a person engaged in an industry\n>  affecting commerce who has 25 or more employees for each working day\n>  in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding year,\n>  and any agent of such person\n\nand then it mentions exclusions, such as an Indian tribe, or the US, or a corporation owned entirely by the US government, etc. As an employer, I would have to make reasonable accommodations for a qualified individual (these are terms defined in the statute). The latter *may* include \"making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities\". If the web page (which the employee has to use on the job) employs the color scheme \"light greenish yellow vs. light yellowish green\" for conveying important information, and if that could be trivially re\\-coded to black and white by changing two constants, then that would be a reasonable accommodation (probably), where if it required massive and expensive reprogramming, that would not be reasonable. Even then, it would depend on the disability in question. There is a federal agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has jurisdiction over that and can decide what is a disability for their purposes. As far as I know, color blindness is not a protected disability, and the [EEOC Q\\&A on vision impairment](http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/qa_vision.cfm) and ADA does not suggest that this is a protected disability. That page has extensive examples that you can work through to get a feel for who might be covered, and what accommodations are reasonable.\n\nPursuant to [section 508](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973) of the (amended) Rehabilitation Act, the Federal government has to provide access to information for disabled persons that is comparable to that available to others. An obvious example of that would be web pages that could be listened to rather than only being read. This doesn't per se apply to private web pages, as long as you are not receiving federal funds. Also, this is not an absolute requirement, so if it would impose an undue burden on the agency to comply, then they can be in less than full compliance.

It does, however, not grant the same right to aunts and nephews etc. (including those by adoption), which could engender competing claims about legislative intent. It would then be relevant to look at the Washington analog of this statute, [RCW 26\\.04\\.020](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.04.020), which prohibits marriage:\n\n> (1\\)(b) When the spouses are nearer of kin to each other than second\n>  cousins, whether of the whole or half blood computing by the rules of\n>  the civil law.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) It is unlawful for any person to marry his or her sibling, child,\n>  grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew.\n\nHere, the blood\\-relation rule applies to (second) cousins and is absolute for aunts and sibling. It would seem that various legislatures had different intents, in forming these statutes.\n\nIn Oregon, [ORS 106\\.020](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/106.020) prohibits marriage\n\n> When the parties thereto are first cousins or any nearer of kin to\n>  each other, whether of the whole or half blood, whether by blood or\n>  adoption, computing by the rules of the civil law, except that when\n>  the parties are first cousins by adoption only, the marriage is not\n>  prohibited or void\n\nIn this case, the Oregon law explicitly equates blood and adoption, and then could cast doubt on the concept of \"whole or half blood\" as actually referring to blood relationship (although, Oregon is not Idaho, or Washington). \n\nGiven the literal reading of the Idaho statutes (and without there being any clarifying case pertaining to relationship by adoption), it may take a court order to compel the county clerk to obey the law, especially if the clerk is dispensing life choice recommendations. That is especially so if the law is not clearly established.\n\nMontana likewise restricts [(40\\-1\\-401\\)](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/40/1/40-1-401.htm)\n\n> a marriage between an ancestor and a descendant or between a brother\n>  and a sister, whether the relationship is by the half or the whole\n>  blood, or between first cousins\n\nThat statute also says\n\n> Parties to a marriage prohibited under this section who cohabit after\n>  removal of the impediment are lawfully married as of the date of the\n>  removal of the impediment.\n\nHowever, there is no obvious way to get legally unadopted, especially when the parties are adults.\n\nAn additional wrinkle is that in Idaho under [32\\-209](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title32/T32CH2/SECT32-209/), valid marriages entered into elsewhere are valid in that state\n\n> unless they violate the public policy of this state.

The bold section is *clearly* unconstitutional; the question then is whether if you took this to SCOTUS, they would strike down the entire statute (a number of states still have such language on their statute books, e.g. Montana still declares that marriage is between a man and a woman).

Option A is problematic because there's no clear legal mechanism for adult adoptees to annul their adoption in Idaho. Option B seems promising due to Oregon's explicit language about adoption, but their law still prohibits marriage between adopted siblings. Option D is high-risk and could take years with no guaranteed outcome.\n\nOption C is the most strategic approach. Washington's laws are less explicit about adopted siblings, potentially allowing the marriage. Idaho's statute 32-209 recognizes out-of-state marriages unless they violate public policy. While this statute mentions same-sex marriages as against public policy, this part is clearly unconstitutional following federal rulings. The couple could argue their out-of-state marriage doesn't violate Idaho's public policy, as the state's incest statute focuses on blood relations. This approach balances legal compliance with minimizing personal disruption, though it still carries some legal risk and may require legal counsel."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38802/ambiguous-legislation-and-government-advice", "docs_id": 38802, "title": "Ambiguous legislation and government advice", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When legislation wording is ambiguous enough to potentially conflict with government advice interpreting that legislation elsewhere, how do the courts resolve the ambiguity?\n\nFor example, in New Zealand, holiday pay is dealt with under the [Holidays Act 2003](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0129/latest/DLM236886.html), and as an example, the legislation has this clause in it:\n\n> An employer must pay the employee 8% of the employee\u2019s gross earnings\n>  since the commencement of employment, less any amount\u2014 \n> \n> \n> (a) paid to the employee for annual holidays taken in advance; or \n> \n> \n> (b) paid in accordance with section 28\\. \n> \n> \n> Section 23(2\\): amended, on 1 April 2007, by section 42\\.\n\nHowever, the [New Zealand governments employment website](https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/calculating-payments-for-leave-and-holidays/calculating-payment-for-leave-and-holidays-in-final-pay/) offers the following interpretation of that legislation:\n\n> These employees get an annual holiday payment of 8% of their gross\n>  earnings.

(gross pay \\- advance leave) \\* 0\\.08\n2. (gross pay \\* 0\\.08\\) \\- advance leave\n\nThese two approaches differ wildly in the outcome \\- the first is in the employee's favour, the second in the employer's favour. On gross earnings of $100k, the difference can be several thousand dollars.\n\nWhen the advice given is a government website specifically intended to give advice in this area, how are differences in interpretation generally handled?\n\nThe second website does contain a disclaimer about not being legal advice, but that seems pretty weak when the entire website is intended to guide employers and employees in their requirements and obligations.\n\nThe examples are from NZ, so an NZ specific answer would be nice, but I'd also like to hear what other countries and jurisdictions do as well.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In interpreting a statute, New Zealand courts must conform to the [Legislation Act 2019](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2019/0058/latest/DLM7298193.html), which says that\n\n> The meaning of legislation must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose and its context.\n\nThis carries forward a provision from the [Interpretation Act 1924](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2019/0058/latest/DLM7298193.html) at 5(j) that interpretation must \"best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act \\[...] according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\" In discovering what this purpose is, the entire text of the Act is available, including in this case the Holidays Act s. 15(c),\n\n> The purpose of this subpart is to \\[...] require employers to pay employees at the end of their employment for annual holidays not taken or paid out\n\nWhen they do this, the courts must be cautious not to make up their own laws; in the *Northern Milk* case, this was summarized as\n\n> The Courts must try to make the Act work while taking care not themselves to usurp the policy\\-making function, which rightly belongs to Parliament. The Courts can in a sense fill gaps in an Act\n> but only in order to make the Act work as Parliament must have intended.\n\n(This case, *Northland Milk Vendors Association Inc v Northern Milk Ltd \\[1988]* 1 NZLR 537 (CA), is a major authority for how far the courts can go. There, they were dealing with a gap in time between one statutory regime ending and the next one beginning, where Parliament had neglected to say what would happen in between. The Court of Appeal had to decide on the purpose of the Milk Act 1988 by looking at such textual matters as its long title, which said that it was meant \"to provide for the continuing home delivery of milk\", and so the status quo had to be maintained in the interim.)\n\nBut this exercise is focused on the statute itself. It excludes, for example, even such tempting targets as an *amendment* to that statute which was made subsequent to the case at hand, and which might clarify what was intended. (See [Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Databank Systems Ltd Co (New Zealand) \\[1990] UKPC 37](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1990/1990_37.html).) In some cases, reference might be made to the Parliamentary circumstances when the statute was passed. New Zealand, compared to other similar jurisdictions, is reluctant to bring in other kinds of non\\-statutory material to explain a statute. They also do not generally defer to government agency interpretations unless the matter is very technical, or the primary statute tells them they must.\n\nFor the Holidays Act, recent cases concerning some *different* ambiguities have been resolved without having to look beyond the text itself, and its broad purpose. (For example, *Postal Workers Union v NZ Post* \\[2012] NZCA 481, on whether unrostered overtime is part of \"relevant daily pay\", or *Tourism Holdings Ltd v Labour Inspector* \\[2021] NZSC 157, on holiday pay for somebody with a very irregular work pattern.) I would expect that in your example, government websites would *not* be used by the courts to determine what the law means.

I am asking what lawyers do when one of their own clients owes them money and shows no signs of paying voluntarily.\n\nThe reason why I ask is that I trying to determine to what extent demand letters are just efforts to generate billable hours, or whether they have a legitimate purpose. If lawyers never bother to send demand letters when they collect their own debts, then obviously the letters are just a revenue\\-generation method.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Demand letters are often used to collect debts from one's own clients, most prominently, because filing a lawsuit against a client often triggers a counterclaim for malpractice or an ethical grievance, even if it is not justified on the merits. Demanding payment without suing rarely has these consequences and often isn't even enough to trigger an urge to post an unjustified (or justified) bad review of the lawyer online.\n\nDemand letters are not just efforts to generate billable hours. Lawyers want to generate billable hours for clients who pay them reliably, rather than devoting time to work collecting from a client who has a significant likelihood of not paying.\n\nOne reason to send demand letters is that sometimes, the reason that clients don't pay is not that they are unwilling to pay, or dispute the bill, but that they are currently unable to pay. A demand letter keeps the debt fresh in the client's mind when an ability to pay is restored. Quite a bit of hourly charge legal work is *de facto* contingent fee work because the client almost by definition won't have the ability to pay for it promptly if the outcome is a bad one (often for reasons beyond the lawyer's control).\n\nDemand letters are cheap, can often be drafted by administrative staff for attorney review, and because they are cheap, don't have to have a high success rate to be worth the effort. Even a 5%\\-10% payment rate for unpaid fees that are sought in demand letters makes them worth it.\n\nA second reason to send a demand letter can also trigger a written response acknowledging that the debt is owed and apologizing for not paying, and/or paying a token amount like $25, each of which extends the statute of limitations to collect the entire amount of the debt for unpaid fees.\n\nA third reason to send a demand letter is that it helps the lawyer to keep current on the client's address, if the client moves, while a mail forwarding order is still in place.\n\nA fourth reason to send a demand letter is that it discourages the client from trying to get the lawyer to do additional work on existing or new matters that the client can't afford to pay for (especially in non\\-litigation representations) because it reminds them that they already owe money to the firm.\n\nTypically, a lawyer sues when (1\\) the client is known to be collectible now, (2\\) there is not credible basis for a malpractice lawsuit and there was not a bad outcome, and (3\\) the statute of limitations is approaching or the client has a serious chance of not being collectible later.\n\n**The Business Model Context**\n\nIn a typical small and medium sized practice with a mix of litigation work done on an hourly basis and transactional work involving negotiations that are not flat fee, maybe 10% of unpaid bills are ever the subject of a collection lawsuit brought by the law firm that wasn't paid.\n\nA firm like that often ultimately writes off as much as 20%\\-30% or more of all the fees it bills to its clients on an hourly basis (with substantial variation from year to year), and typically receives maybe a third of all the fees that it is ultimately paid more than 90 days after the due date for the invoiced fees. A pattern of a client not paying for several months and then making a big lump sum payment for reasons that may or may not be related to the representation is fairly common. For reasons like this (and the timing of contingency fee payouts) solo practice and small firm lawyers with non\\-criminal practices typically have incomes that vary wildly from year to year, even though the amount of work actually done each year as measured by billable hours is quite consistent.\n\nLarge law firms are actually quite similar to this business model as well, although they charge higher rates and bill more hours on cases, and the law of averages keeps their monthly fee collections a little more consistent. Many large firms pay all of their expenses from a line of credit so that they don't have to worry about the timing of their collections to pay their monthly expenses, and then settle up with their bank at the end of the year.\n\nCertain kinds of firms (e.g. criminal defense) require all anticipated fees to be in a retainer before work is started. Other kinds of work (e.g. probate administration and flat fee transactional work and contingent fee work) usually is paid promptly and reliably when due.\n\nIn the insurance defense counsel business model, invoices are almost always paid so demand letters aren't needed, but are usually paid very slowly (90\\-180 days from invoice), the hourly rates are below average, and the insurance company routinely nitpicks bills to reduce hourly charges in any given month by 5%\\-10% or so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A small law firm is facing a situation where multiple clients have outstanding unpaid bills. The managing partner is considering different approaches to recover these debts. Which of the following strategies would likely be the most effective and least risky for the firm's long-term interests?\n\nA) Immediately file lawsuits against all clients with unpaid bills to demonstrate the firm's seriousness about collections\nB) Send a series of escalating demand letters, followed by lawsuits only for clients known to be collectible and without potential malpractice claims\nC) Offer a significant discount (e.g., 50% off) to all clients with outstanding bills to encourage immediate payment\nD) Write off all unpaid bills as bad debt and implement a strict upfront retainer policy for all future clients\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer, B, is the most effective and least risky strategy for several reasons:\n\n1. Demand letters are often used and have multiple benefits:\n   - They're cheap to produce and can be drafted by administrative staff.\n   - Even a low success rate (5-10%) makes them worth the effort.\n   - They can trigger written responses that extend the statute of limitations.\n   - They help keep client contact information current.\n   - They discourage clients from requesting additional work while in debt.\n\n2. Lawsuits are reserved for specific situations:\n   - When the client is known to be collectible.\n   - There's no credible basis for a malpractice lawsuit.\n   - The statute of limitations is approaching.\n\n3. Immediate lawsuits (option A) are risky because they often trigger malpractice counterclaims or ethical grievances, even if unjustified.\n\n4. Offering significant discounts (option C) could unnecessarily reduce the firm's income, as some clients may eventually pay in full.\n\n5. Writing off all unpaid bills (option D) is an extreme measure that ignores the potential to recover some debts and doesn't address the underlying issue.\n\nThe correct strategy balances the benefits of demand letters with selective use of lawsuits, aligning with the typical practice described in the documentation where only about 10% of unpaid bills result in collection lawsuits. This approach also considers the business model context, where law firms often write off 20-30% of billed fees and receive a significant portion of payments after 90 days."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41952/can-a-registered-user-of-a-word-mark-which-was-registered-as-whole-break-the-wo", "docs_id": 41952, "title": "Can a registered user of a word mark which was registered as whole, break the word into parts and use it in the products sold?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As the question says if a user of a particular wordmark breaks his word into 2 and uses it on goods sold(tm is engraved on goods) then can he seek protection in case of potential infringement.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The person could seek protection, but could well be unsuccessful.

In any case, trade of Nintendo products in Europe was greatly altered in late 1997\\.\n\n*Please take my summary with a grain of salt, I'm not very well versed in the field of commerce and I've already misunderstood the decision at least once; check the cited decision for proper details.*", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A video game retailer in Sweden notices a sudden change in their ability to sell imported Nintendo 64 games in late 1997.

This directly relates to the legal grounds for contesting a will in Texas.\n\nOption A, the daughter's residency in Canada, may create practical difficulties but doesn't directly impact the legal validity of the will. Option B, the mother's history of inconsistent behavior, actually works against contesting the will as it establishes a pattern of behavior consistent with the final will change. Option C, the brother's disposal of heirlooms, occurred after the mother's death and doesn't affect the will's validity.\n\nOption D is the most relevant because it focuses on the legal requirements for a valid will. In Texas, as in most jurisdictions, a will can be contested if it can be proven that the testator (the mother) lacked testamentary capacity or was under undue influence when the will was changed. This would require evidence that at the time of the will modification, the mother was either not of sound mind or was being manipulated by someone else (possibly the adopted brother) to change her will.\n\nThe question requires analysis of multiple concepts (grounds for contesting wills, relevance of different factors) and application to a real-world scenario.

The underlying political premise has been that disagreement is to be dealt with rationally and not through force, such as where opinions contrary to those articulated by the government are squashed (in order to eliminate divisions).\n\nThere have been numerous laws passed in the US to outlaw \"contrary\" speech including \"disrespectful\" speech, and they are constantly being overturned by the Supreme Court. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 and U.S. v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 are two recent reaffirmations that such laws are unconstitutional. The only way such a law can work is if the Constitution is amended to in some way re\\-write the First Amendment, like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Desecration_Amendment).\n\nOutlawing indirect insults towards political figures (\"not *my* Speaker of the House\", \"not *my* FBI director\") would require an even more extensive suspension of the First Amendment. It is possible that at some time, a bill was introduced to outlaw saying disparaging things about POTUS, but I would be surprised if it got out of committee, because it would fail challenge in court.\n\nThe most\\-likely retrenchment on our freedom of expression is likely to be a flag\\-burning law, which has relatively wide support in the US. There are a number of interpretive problems associated with the key concept \"physical desecration\". Even more interpretive problems would arise if Congress were given the power (via an anti\\-disparagement amendment) to outlaw \"disparagement of public officials\". Can one simultaneously \"respect the Office of the President\" and \"disrespect the holder of the office\"?\n\nAs for specifically restricting the military, that's a challenging issue. It *is* a court\\-martial offense for a commissioned military officer to use contemptuous words against the President and Congress ([10 USC 888](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/888)), and by directive from the Department of Defense this also applies to enlisted personnel. SCOTUS in Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 articulated the Military Necessity doctrine, that \"The fundamental necessity for obedience, and the consequent necessity for imposition of discipline, may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it\". So \"not my President\" probably *is* illegal for soldiers.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The chanting of \"Not my President\" is clearly protected free speech under the First Amendment for civilians. The documentation states that outlawing such indirect insults towards political figures would require an extensive suspension of the First Amendment.\n\n2. Flag burning, contrary to what some might assume, is also currently protected under the First Amendment for civilians. The documentation cites Texas v. Johnson and U.S. v. Eichman as recent reaffirmations that laws prohibiting flag desecration are unconstitutional.\n\n3. However, the documentation mentions that there is relatively wide support for a flag-burning law, and that the \"most-likely retrenchment on our freedom of expression is likely to be a flag-burning law.\" It specifically states that this would require a constitutional amendment, referencing the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment.\n\n4. For active-duty military personnel, the situation is different. The documentation cites 10 USC 888 and the Military Necessity doctrine, suggesting that such expressions might be illegal for soldiers.

The key concept here is that copyright protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves.

It\u2018s just a thought that randomly came to mind.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The game *Five Nights at Freddy's* and the other elements in the [large media franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s) of the same name are surely protected by copyright. In addition the name of the fictional restaurant in the game may well be protected as a trademark, and I would be astounded if \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" was not protected as a trademark. Other names and phrases may well be trademarked also.\n\nIf the suggested actual restaurant was at all closely based on the images and descriptions from the games or the novels, it would be a derivative work. Unless one had permission from the copyright owner, creating such a restaurant would be an act of wilful copyright infringement. The owner could sue, and quite likely win. In the US the owner could get up to $150,000 in statutory damages for *each work* that was infringed, which in this case might well mean several of the games and novels, depending on just what images and descriptions were imitated or used. Or the owner could elect to receive damages and profits, meaning all damage provably done to the owner, plus all profits made by the infringer. In addition to either, the owner might well obtain an injunction against further operations of the restaurant.\n\nBeyond that, if the imitation used any of the trademarked names, slogans, or other protected trademarks, there could be a suit for trademark infringement. There could be no question that the marks were being used in commerce, and were not instances of nominative use. A restaurant is a very different thing from a video game, a novel, or a film, of course. No doubt it falls into a different trademark category. Normally trademark protection extends only to the category for which the mark is protected. But in the case of a \"well\\-known\" or \"famous\" mark, protection under US law is wider. Also, when the infringement might lead reasonable people to falsely belie that the infringing product or service has been endorsed, approved, or sponsored by the trademark owner, it may be a violation even in a significantly different category. This a successful suit for trademark infringement might well be possible also.\n\nOf course, if the new restaurant only vaguely resembled the one in the games and novels, and did not use the phrase \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" or the name \"Freddy Fazbear\u2019s\" or any other distinctive names from the media franchise, That might not be copyright or trademark infringement. But that would not seem to achieve the effect suggested by the question.\n\nIf the creator of the restaurant obtained **permission** from the copyright and trademark owner(s) then there would be no legal issue. But the owners might well not grant such permission, or might charge a high fee for it.\n\nI doubt that the idea is workable.\n\nAs a side note, many years ago I regularly patronized a restaurant named [\"Bilbo's Pizza\"](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/life/2017/01/27/archives-pizza-joints-we-miss/97081968/) It was decorated with murals obviously based on descriptions for *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. The intended reference was clear. They may have gotten permission from the Tolkien estate; I understand that Tolkien was rather free about granting such permissions.

However, there appears to be no actual law that supports this. For instance, the [Animals Act 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/22) makes no mention of cats at all. As far as I can tell, the law is incredibly vague on this issue.\n\nWhy, then, is there apparently widespread belief that cats have a right to roam? Is there legal precedent establishing this? If a cat owner were found liable in a county court for their cat having committed damages during their roaming, would there be any legal basis to challenge this decision?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statement that cats cannot commit trespass is technically true, but is also a misreading of ss.4 and 4A of the Animals Act. Those sections replace a common\\-law doctrine called \"cattle trespass\", which was a specific tort (a civil wrong) concerning what happens when my cattle stray onto your land. Both old and new rules apply only to livestock, so not just cows but other kinds of farm animals as well \\- but *not* to dogs or cats. Horses are a special case (s.4A). Since cats are not livestock, they cannot be the subject of cattle trespass and are not covered by section 4\\.\n\nFurther, since they are animals, they cannot commit the tort of trespass at all. Animals themselves are not liable at law. As the *keeper* of cows, it would be *me* who was liable in a case of cattle trespass, not the cow. The point of s.4, and its predecessor in common law, is to make me liable for damage done to your property by my cows, regardless of whether I was negligent in the way I looked after them (it is a \"strict liability\"). The mere fact that they've strayed onto your land and done damage is enough.\n\nBecause cats are not cows, this particular rule does not apply. That does not mean that cats can't be the subject of other torts. In particular, cats could be involved in the tort of nuisance, which covers all sorts of potential scenarios \\- noise, smells, etc. This has typically happened when there are lots and lots of cats. And under the Animals Act, the keeper of *any* animal may be liable for damage that it does, including physical injury or damage to property.\n\nSection 2 of the Act establishes a statutory distinction between whether I am *liable* for the damage, or *strictly liable*. In a scenario where I am strictly liable, you do not have to prove that I was negligent in my management of the animal. Broadly, that applies if the animal belongs to a dangerous species, or is unusually dangerous in itself. (There has been very complex litigation on this point which I am not discussing here.) If my cat is not a real vicious bastard of a cat, but just a regular cat, then I can still be liable for damage that he does: it's just not automatic.\n\nFollowing Rachael Mulheron's *Principles of Tort Law* (CUP, 2nd ed., 2016\\), for an action in negligence there are several key points \\-\n\n> Proving that D, the owner/keeper of an animal, owed C a duty of care, where C was injured by that animal, has been a straightforward task.\n> \n> \n> The court must be satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of D, the keeper of the animal, would foresee a real risk of injury to C arising from D's particular acts or omissions in dealing with the animal. Otherwise, in the absence of that foreseeability, a reasonable D would have done nothing different in response to the risk posed by his animal.\n> \n> \n> To fall below the standard of reasonable care as a keeper of an animal, D must have failed to do that which a reasonable keeper would have done (to supervise/fence/control, etc, the animal), or have done something which a reasonable keeper would not have done.\n> \n> \n> In damage\\-by\\-animals cases, C must prove that, as in the usual negligence action, D's failure to supervise/handle/care for the animals caused C's injury on the balance of probabilities.\n\nAs in other negligence cases, there are various defences; if you hassled my cat and it scratched you, then that's your fault and not mine.\n\nFrom the material quoted above, we can see that for a normal cat in the UK, where the owner is not doing anything unusual by letting it roam freely outdoors (as is typical for UK cats), it is going to be hard to meet the tests. Things may be different if D knows that C is allergic to cats, or that the cat has been eyeing up C's delicious prize goldfish, or has a bone to pick with D's own cat and is likely to attack her, or something. Most of the big cases under the Animals Act have involved animals who are more likely to cause damage, such as dogs, horses and cows; a cat is only legally different because (1\\) unlike for dogs, horses and cows, there are no special rules applying to cats, and (2\\) factually, most cats don't do much harm.\n\nTo that point, even if D is liable in the way described, C may not get very much out of them by way of damages.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Contrary to popular belief, there is no specific law granting cats a \"right to roam\" in the UK. This misconception likely stems from the fact that cats are not subject to the same strict liability rules as livestock under the Animals Act 1971.\n\n2. Cats cannot commit trespass themselves as they are animals and not legally liable. However, this doesn't automatically absolve their owners of all responsibility.\n\n3. The Animals Act 1971 does not provide blanket immunity for cat owners. Section 2 of the Act establishes that owners can be liable for damage caused by their animals, including cats, but it's not strict liability unless the animal is of a dangerous species or unusually dangerous itself.\n\n4. For regular cats, liability falls under general negligence principles. The neighbor would need to prove that:\n   a) The cat owner owed a duty of care\n   b) There was a foreseeable risk of injury or damage\n   c) The owner failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the damage\n   d) This failure caused the damage\n\n5. Given the repeated nature of the incidents and the specific damages described, the neighbor might be able to argue that the cat owner was negligent in not taking steps to prevent the cat from causing ongoing damage after being made aware of the issue.\n\nOption A is incorrect because strict liability doesn't apply to regular cats. Option B is a common misconception with no legal basis. Option D is incorrect as cattle trespass laws don't apply to cats.

That said, copying a single ad in order to criticism the ad, or comment on it, is very likely to be found to be fair use.

You would have received a letter giving you you the lawful grounds for your visa refusal. \n\nYour questions...\n\n> Do i still h ave chance of getting a visa?\n\nYes. But given what's happened so far, it's likely you will need your next application to be represented by a practitioner with a practice area in work permit refusals. \n\n> Are there any kind of appeal i can make?\n\nYes, it is mandatory that the member state issuing a refusal provide appeals information whenever an appeal pathway is available to an applicant. It would be in your refusal notice. If you did not receive your refusal notice, or you misplaced it, you should submit a [freedom of information request](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/individuals/rights/index_en.htm) (or let your practitioner handle it).\n\n---\n\nIf you have a question about a specific work permit, you can use the [Expats site](http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A software engineer from Mauritius, who was offered a job in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, was denied entry at the border and subsequently had their visa application rejected.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states, \"given what's happened so far, it's likely you will need your next application to be represented by a practitioner with a practice area in work permit refusals.\"\n\n2. The situation is complex, involving a refusal of entry, a subsequent visa rejection, and potential misunderstandings about visa requirements. This complexity necessitates expert legal assistance to navigate.\n\n3. An immigration lawyer specializing in German work permit refusals would have the expertise to address both the entry refusal and the visa rejection, which are interconnected issues.\n\n4. The lawyer could help obtain the full refusal notice through a freedom of information request if necessary, and properly interpret the grounds for refusal.\n\n5.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. Reckless homicide occurs when a person \"knows of and disregards a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur.\" X's actions fit this definition better than negligent homicide, which involves failing to be aware of a substantial risk.\n\n2. The law considers what a \"reasonable person\" would know, not just the perpetrator's personal beliefs. A reasonable person would know that stabbing someone is likely to cause death, regardless of X's spiritual beliefs about resurrection.\n\n3. The fact that X had never successfully performed this \"healing\" before actually strengthens the case for recklessness. X was taking an enormous risk with Y's life without any evidence that the \"healing\" could work.\n\n4. Y's consent and terminal illness do not negate X's culpability. The law generally does not recognize consent as a defense to homicide.\n\n5.

The company's responsibilities extend beyond the tenure of any single CEO.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the legal concept of corporate personhood, integration of information about Uber's statements and actions, and application to a real-world scenario involving potential corporate misconduct and liability."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1835/windows-10-eula-privacy-rights", "docs_id": 1835, "title": "Windows 10 Eula Privacy Rights", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many are claiming that Windows 10's data collection is [much more invasive than previous Microsoft products](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/even-when-told-not-to-windows-10-just-cant-stop-talking-to-microsoft/), even claiming that [Windows 10 ships with a keylogger](http://www.geek.com/microsoft/microsoft-clears-the-air-on-windows-10-keylogger-1606160/) and reports every keystroke back to Microsoft.

This answer is just a broad picture. It's a simple explanation of Microsoft's own words, as they were at the time of originally writing this (just after the final release of Windows 10\\).\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* **Microsoft does *not* recognize users' privacy rights.** The [Microsoft Privacy document](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/) does not say *anything* positive about privacy in this document that isn't contradicted by their own words elsewhere in the same document.\n* **Microsoft *does* explicitly reserve rights to share users' private data** with just about anyone and everyone.\n* **Microsoft explicitly disallows legal recourse regarding privacy.** The [Windows 10 EULA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm) comprehensively denies legal recourse related to privacy (and indeed anything other than IP disputes).\n\n---\n\nIt's Microsoft's offerings as a whole, not (just) Windows 10\n============================================================\n\nThe key document to focus on is [Microsoft's Privacy policy document](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/).\n\nThis policy applies to many Microsoft products and services, including, but definitely not limited to, Windows 10\\.\n\nMicrosoft reserve the right to share your private data\n======================================================\n\nQuoting the \"Privacy\" document, Microsoft reserves the right to share users' private data:\n\n> among Microsoft\\-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries\n> \n> \n> with vendors or agents working on our behalf\n> \n> \n> as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets\n> \n> \n> \\[to] comply with applicable law\n> \n> \n> \\[to] respond to valid legal process\n> \n> \n> \\[to] protect our customers, for example to prevent spam\n> \n> \n> \\[to] operate and maintain the security of our services\n> \n> \n> \\[to] protect the rights or property of Microsoft\n> \n> \n> as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized\n\nDo users have any privacy rights?\n=================================\n\nOne can presumably fight for one's (perceived) rights even if Microsoft attempts to deny them.\n\nHowever, from the [English Windows 10 EULA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm):\n\n> you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve \\[a dispute] informally.

But I think it's worth recognizing that, with Windows 10, Microsoft have made the most popular install option collect and send to their cloud all data collected from your local device (\"Full\" collection) and have effectively made it a breach of contract to reduce it below a minimal level (\"Basic\" collection) that they get to determine and change as they see fit.

Microsoft states that they may disable updates for systems that block data transmission, which could compromise security and functionality.\n\nOption B, modifying system files, would likely breach the EULA and could lead to system instability or loss of functionality.\n\nOption D, downgrading, doesn't solve the issue as Microsoft's privacy policies apply broadly to their services, not just Windows 10.\n\nOption C is the most effective and compliant approach.

For example, my current employer has offices in multiple states and we leave it up to the candidate to pick the location they like best. That happens fairly late in the game and sometimes only after the offer has been signed, so any salary negotiation would happen before that.\n\nAnother example: if it's a Work Remotely gig: Is it the candidate's resident state or the nearest company location, where you need to show up once a month?\n\nRelated: [Will New York City's new law prohibiting questions about salary history protect residents who are applying for jobs outside the city?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18797/will-new-york-citys-new-law-prohibiting-questions-about-salary-history-protect) gives a partial answer but is less comprehensive.\n\nAlso related: [Statutory Rape: Which State's Laws Apply?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19559/statutory-rape-which-states-laws-apply).

Which court has jurisdiction? When a case is brought the first thing a court does is look at the facts and the relevant law (both the law relating to the facts and the law that empowers the court itself) and make a decision if it has jurisdiction to hear the case. In most cases, this is not an issue so the decision is tacit. A court may not have jurisdiction for all sorts of reasons: there is a money value limit, there is a geographical limit, the parties do not have standing etc. Note that multiple courts can have jurisdiction at the same time allowing the plaintiff to 'forum shop' their case: for example, it is much better to bring a defamation case almost anywhere in the world over the USA.\n2. Which law applies? A court, having decided it does have jurisdiction, needs to decide which law applies. Again, multiple laws may be applicable at the same time depending on the wording of the laws and precedent. So, New York courts can have jurisdiction to decide a case under Texas law.\n\nAny of your suggestions may or may not engage jurisdiction or legal system of none, any or all of the relevant states \\- it depends on the circumstances of the particular case and the wording of the particular statute.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The question is definitely illegal because New York law applies to the interviewer's location.\nB) The question is legal because Texas law applies based on the candidate's residence.\nC) The legality depends on the state where the company will ultimately employ the candidate.\nD) The situation involves complex jurisdictional issues, and multiple state laws may potentially apply.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This scenario highlights the complexity of determining which laws apply in multi-state employment situations. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Multiple jurisdictions are potentially involved: the interviewer's location (NY), the candidate's location (TX), the company's headquarters (CA), and the undetermined future work location.\n\n2. As stated in the documentation, \"Any of your suggestions may or may not engage jurisdiction or legal system of none, any or all of the relevant states - it depends on the circumstances of the particular case and the wording of the particular statute.\"\n\n3. The question of jurisdiction is separate from which law applies. A court must first determine if it has jurisdiction, and then decide which law(s) to apply.\n\n4. The documentation mentions that multiple laws may be applicable simultaneously, depending on the wording of the laws and legal precedent.\n\n5. The scenario doesn't provide enough information to definitively state which law(s) would apply, as it would depend on the specific wording of each state's statutes and how courts have interpreted them in similar cross-state situations.\n\n6.

This is because oil and gas leases typically have specific terms that determine their validity and duration. As mentioned in the documentation, \"Oil and gas leases expire after a certain time period if production is not obtained in paying quantities.\" Without knowing the terms of the original lease, it's impossible to determine if the assignment still holds any value.\n\nOption A is premature, as contacting the original owners without understanding the lease terms may not yield useful information. Option B is speculative and unlikely, as there's no indication of an existing bank account. Option D is also premature, as filing a claim without first establishing the validity of the lease could be unproductive.\n\nReviewing the lease terms will reveal if the lease was ever \"held by production,\" which is crucial for understanding its current status.

Does the 4th amendment requiring searches / seizures to be reasonable no longer apply at border checkpoints?\n\nWhat are the contours of expecting privacy in this scenario?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a long\\-standing border search exception to the usual 4th Amendment no\\-search protections, but there still are limits. As you know, warrantless searches are allowed when an arrest occurs in public and is based on probable cause, and searches and seizures of limited duration and intrusiveness may be allowed given reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The [border search exception](https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep473/usrep473531/usrep473531.pdf#page=8) (US v. de Hernandez) means that limited searches are allowed at border crossing without any suspicion at all. This happens to also hold of the \"extended border\" that reaches in to the US by 100 miles, but only in connection with immigration issues. In the case of [Riley v. California](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-132_8l9c.pdf), SCOTUS held that searching digital information on a cell phone requires a warrant, with certain exceptions pertaining to officer safety or destruction of evidence. No risk is posed by data on a cell phone, so no compelling government interest is posed by requiring a warrant to search a cell phone. The *seizure* of a cell phone, in aid of obtaining a warrant or in connection to officer\\-safety issues on the other hand could be reasonable.\n\nThe question of just how intrusive a search is allowed in the border crossing context is not clearly resolved: a cursory search is reasonable, an intrusive search is not. Full\\-scale forensic searches are unreasonable. In [Alasaad v. Nielsen](https://casetext.com/case/alasaad-v-nielsen-1) (Nov 12, 2019\\), the district court in Massachussetts ruled against a warrantless search which was \"non\\-cursory\", which gives you a state of the art view of what is allowed. In this case,\n\n> an advanced search is defined as \"any search in which an officer\n>  connects external equipment, through a wired or wireless connection,\n>  to an electronic device, not merely to gain access to the device, but\n>  to review, copy and/or analyze its contents\"\n\nThe alternative, under CBP policy is\n\n> a basic search, which is merely defined as \"any border search that is\n>  not an advanced search.\"\n\nPolicy requires reasonable suspicion for an advanced search. In this case, a number of individuals (US citizens and one LPR) were subjected to an advanced search of their cell phones. In connection with these searches, data was copied and retained for an extended period of time.\n\nThe court points out that the border search exception applies to \"routine inspections and searches of individuals or conveyances seeking to cross our borders\", where \"routine search\" is defined in terms of cursoriness \u2013 the court concludes that forensic searches are by nature non\\-routine (get a warrant). This seems to kick the can down the road (what is a forensic search) \u2013 the court has some suggestions:\n\n> Basic searches, defined only as any search of an electronic device\n>  that is not an advanced search, can access content from space\n>  physically resident on a device using the devices' native operating\n>  system.\n\nSo,\n\n> Using a device's native operating system, a basic search can access\n>  content from the allocated space physically present on the device, it\n>  can extend to any allocated file or information on the devices and,\n>  for devices that contain metadata, it can reveal \"the date/time\n>  associated with the content, usage history, sender and receiver\n>  information or location data.\"\n>  Even in a basic search, agents can peruse and search the contents of\n>  the device, using the native search functions on the device,\n>  including, if available, a keyword search.

In case the sole custodial parent dies, the court will appoint a guardian for a minor child, and will take into consideration the wishes of the deceased parent, however their primary duty is to protect the interest of the child. It follows from this that objections to nomination of Smith as guardian are more easily sustained, since the requirements for being a guardian (e.g. [in Washington](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=11.130&full=true)) are stricter than the requirements for receiving $100,000\\.

The court's primary duty is to protect the interests of the child, not simply to follow the deceased parent's wishes or prioritize financial resources. This rules out options A and B.\n\n3.

In particular, they might decide to hear the case based on the \"Rule of Necessity\", which says roughly that a biased judge is better than none at all: a judge can hear a case, even in the presence of a conflict of interest, if there is no other way for it to be heard. See [*United States v. Will*, 449 U.S. 200 (1980\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/449/200/), in which the Supreme Court ruled 8\\-0 that federal courts could try a case related to the salaries of federal judges.\n\nAnother possibility is that the case could be brought in a lower federal court, say District Court.

However, if a lower court did have jurisdiction, it could rule on the constitutionality of the question, since a District Court judge would not have a significant conflict of interest. The relevant Circuit Court of Appeals could presumably hear an appeal. If the Circuit Court's ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court felt that they all had conflicts of interest (and decided not to invoke the Rule of Necessity), then they could simply not vote to grant certiorari, in which case the Circuit Court's ruling would stand.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A newly elected President proposes a plan to \"rotate\" Supreme Court justices to lower federal courts after 10 years of service, replacing them with federal judges elevated to the Supreme Court.

The correct answer, C, reflects the complexity of the situation:\n\n1. The Constitution doesn't explicitly forbid rotation of justices, but it does specify that judges \"shall hold their offices during good behaviour,\" which has been interpreted as lifetime appointments.\n\n2. The President's power to appoint judges (with Senate confirmation) doesn't explicitly include the power to reassign them, making option A incorrect.\n\n3. While the proposal seems to conflict with the traditional understanding of lifetime appointments, it doesn't necessarily require a constitutional amendment (eliminating option B) if it could be argued that \"rotation\" still maintains the judge's office, just in a different court.\n\n4. Option D is incorrect because the Supreme Court doesn't have the power to approve constitutional changes on its own.\n\n5. The most likely scenario (C) is that such a plan would be attempted through legislation, arguing that it doesn't violate the Constitution. This would almost certainly face a legal challenge.\n\n6.

Most countries are signatories to the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention), which provides a common framework, but there are still variations, generally in the duration of copyright or the definition of copyrightable material.\n\nAccording to the [Hirtle chart](http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm), a *video game* that was first published *in Europe* in the year *2000* and subsequently published in the United States is still copyrighted in both the United States and whichever European countries it was published in. It is likely to be a work of corporate authorship, so the US copyright will expire on January 1, 2096 (unless a law extending the duration is passed).\n\nIn the United States, the requirement to register a copyright was eliminated in 1989 as part of the [Berne Convention Implementation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_Implementation_Act_of_1988); registration still provides benefits when filing a copyright\\-infringement lawsuit. Most European countries eliminated their registration requirements much earlier, if they had them at all: the Berne Convention dates from 1887\\.\n\nCopyright does not simply cease to exist when the owner does, or if the owner cannot be determined. The difficulty of tracking down copyright holders for old or little\\-known works is the driving force behind [orphaned works legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_works). There are no orphaned works laws in the United States, and since copyright is country\\-by\\-country, European laws won't help you if you're interested in publishing in the US.\n\nIn order to track down the copyright holder, you'll need to figure out who originally held the copyright (probably the publisher, but it could be either development company, or both, or the game might be a collective work of the individuals who worked on it).

The phrase \"notwithstanding that the Landlord's consent for the same may have been obtained or given\" is crucial, as it overrides any prior agreements or permissions. Furthermore, the clause specifies that this decision is at the \"sole discretion of the Landlord.\"\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the lease agreement, including the nature of tenant alterations, the impact of landlord consent, and the conditions for returning the premises at the end of the lease.

The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. Uber's Terms and Conditions, which the user agreed to, specify that disputes must be settled first by mediation and then by binding arbitration under the International Chamber of Commerce Rules. This contractual obligation prevents the user from directly suing Uber in ACAT (eliminating option A).\n\n2.

Suing the driver directly (option C) is possible, as there's no direct contract between the user and the driver. However, this may be less effective than pursuing Uber, which has greater resources and is ultimately responsible for the service.\n\n4. Filing a complaint with the ACCC (option D) about unfair contract terms might be possible, but it's not the most direct or likely successful approach for recovering damages in this specific case.\n\n5.

Consider, for example, that the terms related to the security deposit, maximum occupancy, pets, and who pays for which utilities would remain in force.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The lease's \"Renewal\" section explicitly states that the lease continues as a month-to-month tenancy after the initial term. This suggests that the original lease terms, including the arbitration agreement, remain in effect.\n\n2. Courts generally favor enforcing arbitration agreements when there's a plausible contractual connection. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) supports this approach nationally.\n\n3.

You cannot ask a person a question about their sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation (gender identity and employment are established law in Washington, and possibly the law at the federal level), but at least under present legal standards, a question about preferred pronouns is not necessarily in violation of that restriction. However, it is implausible that such a question would be asked in a interview for the purpose of not offending the candidate, since pronouns are sex\\-uniform for first and second person, so you would simply address the candidate as \"you\". Asking for preferred pronouns in an interview is tantamount to asking for prohibited information on sex and sexual orientation.\n\nVery many questions that can lead to bias, and are perfectly legal, for example \"Have you ever operated a fork lift?\" creates a bias against a person who gives a negative answer, when the job is operating a fork lift. There are protected categories such as sex and religion, and asking questions about those categories can lead to legal action against the company. [This](https://www.hum.wa.gov/employment) is the state's list of prohibited categories, which includes\n\n> Opposition to a discriminatory practice; Presence of any sensory,\n>  mental, or physical disability; Use of a trained dog guide or service\n>  animal; HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C Status; Race/Color; Creed; National\n>  Origin;Sex (including pregnancy); Marital Status; Age (40\\+); Sexual\n>  Orientation, including Gender Identity; Honorably discharged Veteran\n>  or Military Status; State Employee or Health Care Whistleblower Status\n\nSince you refer to the hiring entity as a \"company\", I assume the entity is a private business. A private business may mandate that an employee express a particular viewpoint in the course of employment, or prohibit them from doing so. So if the boss tells you to use or not use a particular word, that is legal.\n\nAn exception would be if there is a religious basis for your resistance to complying with the employer's rule. An employer cannot mandate that you act contrary to the principles of your religion, and they must make reasonable accommodations in case there is some conflict. Thus if your religion prohibits you from eating lettuce or working on Saturday, they cannot force you to do these things. I am not aware of any religion that actually dictates that it is forbidden to address a biological female who identifies as male as \"he\", but that doesn't matter, since the law also does not make determinations as to what are \"legitimate religious beliefs\". If a person purports that they must, according to their religion, use the pronouns \"she\" (etc.) when speaking of a biological female, then that is the end of the matter: the employer must make a reasonable accommodation. In other words, it depends on why the interviewer doesn't want to.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly!

The correct answer is B because asking about preferred pronouns, while seemingly inclusive, could be interpreted as indirectly inquiring about a candidate's gender identity or sexual orientation. The documentation explicitly states that \"Asking for preferred pronouns in an interview is tantamount to asking for prohibited information on sex and sexual orientation.\" This falls under protected categories that cannot be asked about during interviews in Washington State.\n\nOption A is legal as it directly relates to job qualifications.

He is convicted of third degree rape and that's it. What exactly that he did that the jury think truly happen that cause his conviction? We'd never know.\n\nFor example, some argue that all penetrative acts, or all prostitution, as non consensual, for example. In US, for example, you can't hire a girl to be both personal assistant and sugar baby. So saying that third degree rape happens if the sex is not consensual don't really add much.\n\nIt'll be pretty helpful if anyone can have a sample, like in Harvey's case, of what exactly he did that results in his conviction? Did he offer money? Fame? Promotion? Does that count as non consensual?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: He was indicted on many charges including 1st degree rape. So your question is why the jury returned the specific verdict, and did not convict on all charges. There is no record of the jury deliberations, so the best we can conjecture is that they didn't find the other charges to have been proven, and in lieu of a tell\\-tale juror, we can't know what evidence persuaded the jury. He was convicted on counts of criminal sexual assault in the first degree and rape in the third degree, but acquitted of two counts of predatory sexual assault, and it is suggested by media who make suggestions that this is because the jury did not believe the testimony of Annabella Sciorra.\n\nThe crime of third degree rape (the charge involving Jessica Mann) is when a person engages in nonconsensual sex with another person. The crime of first degree rape, a charge that he was acquitted on, is when a person\nsubjects a victim to nonconsensual intercourse through forcible compulsion, or when they are incapable of consent by reason of being physically helpless.\nA person is guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree if they engage in oral or anal sex with someone who is incapable of consent, or if they use forcible compulsion.

If the claimant shares their believe that X is the reason for dismissal, with friends or colleagues, can they later face defamation charges?\n\nI understand Defamation in the terms of [this HSE page](https://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/enforcementguide/court/reporting-defamation.htm).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Typically in defamation law, claims made persuiant to litigation are not defamatory, since they are going to be tested for validity if the case goes to trial. I'm not familiar with any differences in what is generally done in settlements between the U.K. and the U.S., but since both are Common Law countries, and Settlements are very common in civil proceedings in the U.S., it's a good start.\n\nGenerally a settlemant can occur anytime before the verdict of the case is rendered, although usually it will happen after preliminary hearings during the Discovery phase. In the U.S., Discovery is very broad and one need not prove that the requested items contain evidence but might contain evidence. This means that, for example, you could request a substantial amount of e\\-mail records from the opposing party because somewhere on the company e\\-mail server, there might be something to help your case. And even if after you sift through the emails and find no smoking guns related to your case, you could find some dirty laundry that's unrelated but still damning... if not more so than the initial case. Many people, especially big compainies, would rather just give the ex\\-employee some what he/she wants, if it means they don't get to see the proverbial man behind the curtain.\n\nAdditionally the practice might fall into a legally gray area of the law that, if it reaches trial, could hurt the company or even the industry if a judge rules against the company, effectively saying that this gray area is now definately illegal. Better to eat the loss of capital with the settling out of court than to take the much larger hit of the buisness practice being illegalized all together.\n\nTypically in settlements, both parties agree to terms and sign a contract. While the whole of the terms are never discussed, almost all include that the plaintiff will drop the case and never bring the matter to court again and that both parties will sign a non\\-disclosure agreement (NDA) meaning that they won't discuss the rest of the settlement terms with anyone not party to them.\n\nIf the plaintiff does break the NDA, the defendant can sue for breech of contract and recover at the least the monitary compensation they awarded in the settlement. Conversely, if the respondent breaks the NDA, the plaintiff can refile their initial suit with the addition of breech of contract (and this time it will get to court... and all the dirty laundry sees the harsh light of day.).\n\nWhile the respondent in a settled case can possibly sue for defamation if the plaintiff said the respondent did what the initial suit claimed they did (legally, it was never proven or disproven), or they were guilty (again, since no verdict was reached at trial, no guilt was established), the breech of contract is a much more airtight case and doesn't open up discovery to the respondent's cupability in the settled case (since the breech is about discussing the settled case at all, not the validity of the accusations of the settled case).

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. COT3 agreements typically include non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), as mentioned in the documentation: \"almost all include that the plaintiff will drop the case and never bring the matter to court again and that both parties will sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).\"\n\n2.

Option B is also incorrect, as level progression systems are typically considered game mechanics or ideas, which are not copyrightable. Option D is incorrect because while characters can be protected by copyright, this protection doesn't extend to general abilities or gameplay functions, especially if the appearances and backstories are different.\n\nThe key here is that recreating a unique puzzle-solving mechanic that was central to the original game could potentially be seen as copying a particular expression of an idea, rather than the idea itself. If this mechanic is sufficiently original and integral to the game's identity, it might be considered a copyrightable element of the original game's expression.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the copyright law principles presented in the documentation, application to a specific scenario, and understanding of the nuances between protected and unprotected elements in game design."}, "79": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16115/copyright-expiration-and-public-domain-of-books", "docs_id": 16115, "title": "Copyright expiration and public domain of books", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been looking that many books published with copyright notice like:\n\n> Copyright \u00a9 by \\[abc] publication.  \n>  All rights reserved.

One can drive, slowly, to a nearby police station, or to a well\\-lighted, public place where others are likely to be about.

They say pretty much what you would expect, and, they are *non\\-binding:* they explicitly say they \"*not intended*\" to provide grounds for \"professional discipline.\" Second, there are articles by lawyers indicating there are no state bar standards. Taken together, the weak ABA standards and the articles should give you enough evidence to prove your case in the \"court of buddy opinion.\"\n\nThe [ABA](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/criminal_justice/standards/crimjust_standards_fairtrial_blk/) rules on legal commentators were issued in 2013 as part of a *Fair Trial and Public Discourse Black Letter*. The letter covered public comments on cases by lawyers involved in the case, lawyers not involved (ie, commentators) and judicial and judicial employees.\n\nAccording to the ABA, the standards are:\n\n> intended to provide a *guide to best practices* for lawyers who provide public commentary or consult on criminal cases in which they are not personally involved; (Standard 8\\-1\\.1(a)(ii))\n\nTo explain what it meant by a \"guide to best practices,\" the ABA included the following caveat about the applicability of the standards:\n\n> While these Standards are intended to provide a basis for the formulation of internal guidelines within lawyers\u2019 offices...**they are not intended to serve as the basis in and of themselves for the imposition of professional discipline...**(Standard 8\\-1\\.1(c))\n\nIn other words, the ABA's rules truly are just a *guide* to best practices.\n\nAs for the guidance itself, it does not come close to requiring \"due\\-diligence.\"\n\n> A lawyer who is serving as a legal commentator **should strive** to ensure that the lawyer\u2019s commentary **enhances** the public\u2019s understanding of the criminal matter and of the criminal justice system generally, **promotes respect** for the judicial system, and **does not materially prejudice** the fair administration of justice, in the particular case or in general.

It appears that what is \"over reached\" is an *occupier's* (e.g. a tenant) overriding interest. Also to explain in the context of overriding interest:\n\n1. Normally, when one purchases land \"unencumbered\", one has all the property rights associated with that land.\n2. It is possible to distribute interests in the land to other parties (e.g. tenancy, or granting a right to use a portion of a stream on a given property for fishing).\n3. It is possible to register such interests in the Land Registry; if such interests are not registered, they \"die with the grantor\" or at least with their interest.\n4. There are certain interests that do not need to be registered with parcel in the Land Registry. These are the \"overriding\" interests, that \"override\" the rule that interests need to be registered to survive transference.\n5. The overreaching doctrine allows distributions or sales from trusts to \"overreach\" certain overriding interests into the real property. The overreaching doctrine therefore is a means of \"quieting\" a title to real property.\n\nWith that in mind:\n\n1. \"trustee lawfully distributes trust property to beneficiaries of the trust\"\n\nImagine scenario \\#1, a trust exclusively of money. The trustee\ndivides the money appropriately, and gives (distributes) it to the\nbeneficiaries. Straightforward.\n\nNow, imagine scenario \\#2, a trust exclusively of property (clothes,\njewelry, automobiles, other goods and yes, real estate). It is quite\npossibly for a trustee to sell such goods on the open market, and\ndistribute the proceeds to the beneficiaries of the trust. Likewise,\nscenario \\#3, in which the trust contains property (it need not be of\nexclusive composition). It is possible, rather than to sell property\nand distribute money, to distribute other property directly to\nbeneficiaries, e.g. one's parents die, and one inherits their house\n(generally that would be through a will not a trust, but the two instruments are similar).\n\nThus, \"The overreaching doctrine is not confined to sale of trust property; it will also apply where the trustee lawfully distributes trust property to beneficiaries of the trust.\" can be read as \"regardless of whether the trustee sells the property to a third party, or distributes it to the beneficiary, the overreaching doctrine applies\".\n\n2. Those beneficiaries will receive the property absolutely and, since there is no exchange product, there will be no replacement property in which the remaining beneficiaries have an equitable proprietary interest \\[emphasis mine].\n\nImagine a scenario where a trust grants 3 beneficiaries (let's call them Alice, Bob and Charlie) equal stakes in say, a house. One beneficiary wishes to own the house outright ( Alice), and so a fair price for the house is determined (3 pounds, or 3 million pounds) and the first beneficiary pays it to the trust, as in scenario\\#2 above. However, generally what what happens is that the first beneficiary would only actually pay only a fraction of the price, divided proportionally among the other (\"remaining\") beneficiaries. E.g. the house is determined to be valued at 3/3million pounds, so Alice pays 2/2million pounds to be split between Bob and Charlie. The money is the \"replacement property\".\n\nMy reading of the bolded section is that it is clarifying that in the case where the real property is distributed, rather than sold. E.g. Imagine a trust with a 1 million pound house, and 2 million pounds in \"cash\" money; the trust could distribute the house to Alice, and a million pounds each to Bob and Charlie.\n\n\\#3\\.

As @Trish noted, you are legally required to register your new residence within two weeks [\u00a7 17 BMG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bmg/__17.html). In some (most?) German states you can just walk into a B\u00fcrgeramt and register your new residence so it is perfectly straightforward to do that within two weeks and that is expected.\n\nThis is not the case in Berlin, you need to get an appointment to register and these are hard to get. I just searched online for B\u00fcrgeramt in Berlin, picked [one](https://service.berlin.de/standort/122231/) and then you can choose the service your want (register new residence) and look at the available appointments. Right now on July 7th there were appointments available on exactly one date, September 1st. Note that this is nowhere near within two weeks.\n\nTo my knowledge, if you have an appointment at the B\u00fcrgeramt to register your new residence than current legal opinion is that you did fullfill the two weeks requirement regardless of when the appointment actually is. After all it is not your fault if the city doesn't offer a faster registration.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A German resident has recently applied for naturalization in Bayern but is planning to move to Berlin in two months. Given the complexities of the situation and the legal requirements, which of the following approaches is most likely to be both legal and effective in preventing delays in the naturalization process?\n\nA) Maintain a Zweitwohnsitz (secondary residence) in Bayern while primarily living in Berlin\nB) Delay the Anmeldung (registration) in Berlin beyond the legally required two-week period\nC) Schedule an appointment for Anmeldung in Berlin as soon as possible, even if the actual appointment date is months away\nD) Attempt to convince a Bayern landlord to falsely register the applicant as still living there\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of German residency law and bureaucratic processes. The correct answer, C, is the most legally compliant and practical solution. According to the documentation, residents are legally required to register their new address within two weeks (\u00a7 17 BMG). However, Berlin's bureaucracy is notoriously inefficient, with long wait times for appointments. The legal interpretation mentioned in the answer suggests that fulfilling the requirement is based on when you attempt to make the appointment, not when the actual appointment takes place. \n\nOption A (maintaining a Zweitwohnsitz) could be seen as an attempt to circumvent the system and might raise legal issues. Option B (delaying Anmeldung) is explicitly illegal according to the cited law. Option D (false registration) would be fraudulent and illegal.\n\nBy choosing C, the applicant complies with the legal requirement to attempt registration within two weeks, while also potentially delaying the transfer of their naturalization application to Berlin's overburdened system. This approach balances legal compliance with practical considerations, demonstrating an understanding of both the letter of the law and the realities of bureaucratic processes in different German jurisdictions."}, "86": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44962/can-a-soldier-enforce-federal-law", "docs_id": 44962, "title": "Can a soldier enforce federal law?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was reading a book(fiction) recently and a kidnapping happened.

For example, California's statutes of limitations are enacted by the California legislature; a sample of them can be found [here](https://www.findlaw.com/state/california-law/california-civil-statute-of-limitations-laws.html).\n\nMunicipalities (cities) in the US often don't have the power to establish criminal offenses. If they do, their power is governed by state law, so their state legislatures might have already established applicable statutes of limitations. In Colorado, for example, the City of Denver has the power to establish municipal offenses, which are misdemeanors, which it does in [Chapter 38, Denver Code of Ordinances](https://library.municode.com/co/denver/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITIIREMUCO_CH38OFMIPR), but Colorado law establishes an 18 month statute of limitations for all misdemeanors ([Colorado R.S. \u00a7 16\\-5\\-401](https://codes.findlaw.com/co/title-16-criminal-proceedings/co-rev-st-sect-16-5-401.html)).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A small city in Colorado has recently passed a municipal ordinance criminalizing public intoxication.

The key points are:\n\n1. Colorado allows cities like Denver to establish municipal offenses, which are classified as misdemeanors.\n2. However, Colorado state law establishes an 18-month statute of limitations for all misdemeanors (Colorado R.S. \u00a7 16-5-401).\n3. The question states that 20 months have passed since the alleged offense.\n\nOption A is incorrect because municipal ordinances are indeed subject to statutes of limitations, often set by state law. Option C is incorrect because, in this case, Colorado state law preempts any potential city-specific statute of limitations for misdemeanors. Option D is incorrect because the city cannot override the state's statute of limitations for misdemeanors.\n\nThe correct answer is B because Colorado's state law sets an 18-month statute of limitations for all misdemeanors, which would include municipal offenses. Since 20 months have passed, the prosecution is indeed time-barred and the case should be dismissed.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the hierarchical nature of laws and statutes of limitations, requiring the integration of concepts related to state preemption of municipal law and the application of statutes of limitations to specific scenarios."}, "89": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31247/in-what-circumstances-can-a-missing-person-be-replaced-in-business-deals", "docs_id": 31247, "title": "In what circumstances can a missing person be replaced in business deals?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose there's two people who found a startup company as associates in the USA. In case one goes temporarily missing, is it possible for the other to take over decisions for both of them (e.g. agree to an acquisition)? Is there some kind of deal stipulated when establishing the society that covers these situations, and is it imaginable that they agreed on terms such as \"if Person A can not be contacted successfully for 24 hours, then Person B is allowed full decisional power\" (regardless of how poorly thought through such an agreement might be)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is absolutely possible. Much depends on the type of business, and the type of decision. I'll assume for purposes of this answer that normally the particular type of business decision requires the assent of both of the people involved, like a decision to sell out the business. I'll also assume that both of the people involved actually own the business. There are several different ways that this could happen.\n\nMost business decisions require the assent of people involved in the business, but not the owners. The corporation's board of directors can often authorize things, for instance. Most boards can meet and vote whether or not all of the directors are present, provided proper notice of the meeting is sent to all of the directors. So if Person A goes missing, Person B can still call a meeting, send out notice, meet, and vote. If Person B's presence at the meeting is enough for quorum, then Person B can still vote. That vote will then be the decision of the full Board, even though Person A was not present.\n\nIf the decision requires the assent of the owners, that can usually be handled the same way: notice of a shareholder meeting, attendance by Person B after proper notice to Person A, a vote and it is the action of the shareholders.\n\nIt is also possible that such dramatic steps are unnecessary. For instance, say the business is a partnership between Person A and Person B. In that case, Person B can usually speak for the partnership in all affairs (so can Person A). Person B may ultimately have to answer to Person A for what was done, if it violated some agreement or something, but the decision will stick. For many decisions, the law permits a forward agreement that Person A's assent is unnecessary. For instance, in a Limited Partnership, if Person B is the General Partner and Person A is a Limited Partner, most of the decision\\-making is in Person B's hands. Similarly if Person B is the Manager of a Manager\\-Managed LLC.\n\nSome decisions absolutely require the assent of Person A. For instance, if there are only two owners and a decision is being made to take the company through bankruptcy, both owners may have to assent. In that circumstance, it is still possible for Person B to go ahead. For instance, if Person A delivered a proxy to Person B in advance, then Person B can vote for Person A. If the proxy was discretionary, then Person B can vote however Person B wants for Person A.\n\nIn the most extreme circumstance, Person A can voluntarily make Person B an \"attorney\\-in\\-fact\" by signing and delivering a Power of Attorney to Person B, or else Person B can force the issue by causing Person A to be declared dead or incompetent. Powers of attorney are uncommon, but not so uncommon as you might think \\- I have seen them used for precisely this circumstance, where one coventurer delivers to the other (or more commonly, each to the other) a limited, durable power of attorney to make certain business decisions in the event of incompetence or unavailability.\n\nBottom line, in answer to your question it is absolutely possible, and could certainly be done (depending on circumstance) through some kind of advance agreement.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: Two entrepreneurs, Alex and Blake, co-founded a startup as equal partners.

The correct answer, D, is the most legally robust and practical solution for several reasons:\n\n1. Mutual powers of attorney protect both partners' interests, unlike option A which could be easily abused or option B which gives one partner significantly more power.\n\n2. Limited durable powers of attorney are specifically mentioned in the documentation as being used \"for precisely this circumstance, where one coventurer delivers to the other (or more commonly, each to the other) a limited, durable power of attorney to make certain business decisions in the event of incompetence or unavailability.\"\n\n3. This option allows for more nuanced decision-making capabilities compared to the broad, potentially problematic clause in option A.\n\n4. Unlike options B and C, which change the fundamental structure of the business, this solution maintains the equal partnership while adding a safeguard for unexpected absences.\n\n5. The \"durable\" nature of the power of attorney ensures it remains valid even if one partner becomes incapacitated, which is not addressed by the other options.\n\nOption A, while directly addressing the scenario, is poorly thought out and could lead to abuse or hasty decisions.

The correct answer, D, represents the most balanced and effective approach. \n\nAccording to the GDPR guidelines, subject access requests can be made verbally and to any employee of the organization. However, the top answer also notes that Article 12(1) allows organizations to take \"appropriate measures\" in handling these requests.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't address the discrepancy between the hospital's policy and GDPR guidelines. Option B, while technically aligned with GDPR, doesn't consider the practical realities of hospital operations and could lead to unnecessary conflict. Option C is an overreaction that doesn't attempt to resolve the situation constructively.\n\nOption D strikes a balance by acknowledging the hospital's policy (showing respect for their procedures) while also informing them of the GDPR guidelines. This approach opens a dialogue that could lead to a resolution, either by the nurse reconsidering the verbal request or by explaining any legitimate reasons for their current policy. It also demonstrates the patient's awareness of their rights without being confrontational.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal guidelines in a practical scenario, considering both the letter of the law and the nuances of real-world interactions."}, "93": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8289/how-much-of-this-image-do-i-need-to-modify-in-order-to-avoid-copyright-violation", "docs_id": 8289, "title": "How much of this image do I need to modify in order to avoid copyright violation?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is a browser game that I want to port the Android.

I have this chapter wherein the protagonist, a 21 y.o. normal human male is transformed into a Superman\\-like being, the **only** such \u201csuper\u201d in the world. Powers include flight and invulnerability.\n\nJust a few hours after this freakish transformation, he goes riding on his Harley\\-Davidson Sportster motorcycle, to think (this takes place in Florida). While he is riding along, he runs over a pit in the road, blows a front tire, and pancakes, eating pavement in the process. He slides into the opposite lane into the path of an 18\\-wheeler and gets run over. In the following, he suffers *no* harm whatsoever as he is invulnerable.\n\n![EIGHTEEN WHEELER SEMI](https://i.stack.imgur.com/chB0D.png)\n\nHis path is in purple (*under* the truck). The front tire of the truck hits him and blows as well, causing the truck driver to lose control.\n\nLong story short, he rises to his hands and knees at **X**, in effect becoming an roughly 30 inch tall, immovable, indestructible object. Then he\u2019s struck by the trailer rear tires *(red squares)*. They shear off, all 8 tires and two axles as a unit, go airborne and land across the road in a parking lot on top of a car. A woman inside that car is killed immediately. The truck itself jack\\-knifes and wrecks, turning over.\n\nThe protagonist doesn\u2019t notice crushed car across the road, checks out the truck driver (who\u2019s the sole occupant), sees that he\u2019s belted up, unharmed, and coming to. He looks around; there are no other witnesses\\-\\-it\u2019s a Sunday morning, and leaps over to his slightly damaged bike. Handlebars in hand he rises straight up a thousand feet or so, surveys the scene, hears sirens, and leaves the scene. Why? He\u2019s a physical freak, and he\u2019s nervous about revealing himself so early. Read too many comics ;).\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know about the *fatality* until weeks later when it\u2019s revealed to him. Now he decides to turn himself in, even though the authorities are unaware of him (the truck driver was blamed, even though he swears a motorcyclist caused him to wreck). The protag, remorseful, does turn himself in, although he mentions nothing of his abilities, the super powers that is. Just a clear\\-cut case, he lost control of his bike, the wreck and fatality occurred. He miraculously escaped injury, he claims, and panicked (which I doubt the investigators would buy), not noticing the crushed car across the street.\n\n**First question:** what would he be charged with, since I assume he caused the wreck and he did leave the scene? Maybe involuntary manslaughter?\n\n**Next question:** if found guilty, could he face incarceration? I should add he has *no* record.\n\nWorking toward my next question; during the wait for trial an alphabet agency in DC discovers (long story) that this guy is a freak, a superhuman of *unknown* abilities. They approach the judge in the case and ask him to make the defendant an *offer* when he announces the sentence. *Jail or join the military*. The Feds wants the man\u2019s real abilities investigated and possibly have him utilized in say, special forces. So...\n\n**Last question:** This offer seem possible in today\u2019s courts? I think the actor Steve McQueen was offered this (before fame), IIRC.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not sure what jurisdiction you're referring to, but here are the [state involuntary manslaughter](http://statelaws.findlaw.com/criminal-laws/involuntary-manslaughter.html) laws. Broad brush, the elements tend to be:\n\n1. Someone was killed as a result of act by the defendant.\n2. The act either was inherently dangerous to others or done with reckless disregard for human life.\n3. The defendant knew or should have known his or her conduct was a threat to the lives of others.\n\nHowever, you're really backwards planning from a jail vs. army decision, so you might actually be after something like **felony hit and run**, which can most certainly result in incarceration. The elements of felony hit and run generally include leaving the scene of an accident regardless of fault (hit and run typically becomes a felony when someone was injured in the accident). Since the elements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it makes sense to look them up wherever the accident will take place in the book. If it takes place in the U.S. [this](http://traffic.findlaw.com/traffic-tickets/leaving-the-scene-of-an-accident-hit-and-run-state-laws.html) is a state\\-by\\-state compendium.\n\nThen you can tweak the story to satisfy the applicable elements and induce the jail vs. army decision (even if army policy prohibits it, it's still pretty common fiction!).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: In the speculative fiction scenario described, the protagonist causes a severe accident and leaves the scene.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. Felony hit-and-run is applicable as the protagonist left the scene of an accident involving a fatality, which typically elevates the offense to a felony level in most jurisdictions.\n\n2. Involuntary manslaughter charges are likely because the elements are satisfied: a death resulted from the protagonist's actions, his behavior (riding recklessly) was inherently dangerous, and he should have known his conduct posed a threat to others.\n\n3. The likelihood of incarceration is high due to the severity of the offense (involving a fatality) and the act of leaving the scene, even though he has no prior record.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it understates the severity of the charges given the fatality. Option C is incomplete as it doesn't account for the involuntary manslaughter aspect. Option D overstates the charges (obstruction of justice) and doesn't allow for the potential military service alternative mentioned in the scenario.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the examinee to analyze the legal implications of the complex scenario, consider multiple factors (including the fatality, leaving the scene, and later surrender), and apply legal concepts to a unique situation involving superhuman abilities."}, "95": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13367/how-can-libel-laws-be-consistent-with-the-1st-amendment", "docs_id": 13367, "title": "How can libel laws be consistent with the 1st Amendment?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The 1st Amendment states\n\n> Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\n\nSo how can libel law be constitutional?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's an interesting philosophical debate you can have. By the plain text of the First Amendment, it protects libel.\n\n---\n\nAside: Yes, the First Amendment does apply to libel cases. A libel case, like all lawsuits, involves the government's judicial branch using its coercive power to make you pay money as a result of your speech, based on a law requiring you to pay money for certain kinds of speech. Tort law is not optional; a libel case isn't \"you promised not to say bad things and then said bad things,\" it's the government saying \"what you did is bad, now pay the person you hurt because of your speech.\" \n\nThe idea that \"you can say it, you just have to face the consequences\" isn't enough and hasn't been for quite a while now. Traditionally, the main point of freedom of speech was that a court couldn't stop you from saying something, but could only seek to punish you after the fact (and for that you get a jury, a public hearing, etc.) But more recently, courts realized that subsequent punishment had similar effects to prior restraint. If you're going to be punished for some kind of speech, you're going to steer clear of saying anything a jury *might* think is that kind of speech.\n\nLibel law is *heavily* influenced by the First Amendment, and has been for over 40 years.\n\n---\n\nThe First Amendment looks like it protects libel, but it also looks like it should protect your right to reprint any book you want. It also looks like it should protect your right to tell someone \"go and murder this person.\" It also looks like it should protect your right to say whatever you want in court, whether or not it's true. It also looks like it should protect your right to falsely shout \"fire\" in a crowded hall, with the intent to cause a stampede (this isn't just a turn of phrase, there was an actual incident in which 73 people were killed which is believed to have started when someone falsely shouted that there was a fire). It also looks like it should protect your right to post a sign saying \"There is a bomb at this elementary school.\"\n\nYet the Constitution explicitly sanctions copyright, and no one would seriously conclude that Congress may not protect the integrity of the judicial process by punishing perjury. Ordering a hit, making bomb threats, intentionally causing panics \\-\\- the fact that speech is a key part of these can't mean that the government isn't allowed to criminalize them. You cannot run a civilized society in which death threats are legal.\n\nSo, the courts interpret. Language in the Constitution that appears absolute is understood to have implied exceptions. The people writing the document were well aware that perjury was generally a crime. The same Congress that proposed the First Amendment passed a law criminalizing perjury. Sure, you're punishing someone based on their speech, but it's clearly not *meant* to be protected. You can't run a court system without perjury laws, and its absence from the First Amendment doesn't mean that the First Amendment thereby upended this basic principle.\n\nThe courts have identified a number of kinds of speech that, by longstanding practice, are not protected. Intellectual property violations are one. Obscenity is another. So are threats. So is \"speech integral to criminal conduct\" (e.g. \"what'll it be, your money or your life?\") And so is defamation. The text of the First Amendment may not exclude it, but courts have uniformly held that it's not something the amendment was ever meant to protect. \n\nThe First Amendment does still pose constraints, which are some of the most defendant\\-friendly in the world (interestingly enough, US law is descended from English law, and English libel law used to be among the most plaintiff\\-friendly in the world). It's not libel if it's true. It's not libel if it's an opinion (unless it's a statement of fact dressed up as opinion). It's not libel unless you were at *least* negligent; if it was about a public figure, you have to have known it was false or seriously doubted its truth.

As far as the fraud issue, suppose we assume for the sake of argument that the claim is false.

However, actions taken by the user \\- such as creating an account, accepting the Terms, contributing content \\- are likely to affirm this view.\n\n### Does changing the logo imply that the site/organisation supports a particular political view?\n\nAgain, it is likely, not definite, that changing the logo will imply that the site/organisation supports a particular political view.\n\nDoes changing the logo impute support of a political view to the user?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this case, however, it is ***highly unlikely*** that the change of logo would impute to the user support of the political view.\n\nIn a case such as this, onus of proof is on the plaintiff \\- were this claim brought in court, it would need to be proven on the balance of probability (or, less likely, on the preponderance of evidence) that a reasonable person would impute support of the marriage equality (and perhaps some other) agenda to the user. *Reasonable* person does not mean any *particular* person, nor does it mean, *all* people.\n\nPart of the imputation must come from the purpose that the user subscribes to the site. Perhaps if StackOverflow were a site that promoted marriage equality or judicial activism, this could support an opinion that the user supports this view. However, StackOverflow is about programming, and programming doesn't imply that kind of agenda. Perhaps if the icon had been changed to something that suggested support for object\\-oriented programming, the icon *could* be taken to suggest that the user supports this agenda. Neither does the user's content suggest support for this cause \\- if they constantly made off\\-hand remarks about it in their posts, then perhaps, again, a reasonable person may make that imputation.\n\nIn any case, the damages awarded to the user would likely be compensatory rather than punitive \\- the user would need to therefore demonstrate actual suffering or loss as a result of the change of icon. If there were actual damages or loss, the way in which the user contributed to them \\- perhaps by posting a thread that would be likely to be inflammatory and attract attention to the user \\- may reduce an award of damages. In the case of no actual suffering or loss, the user could be awarded nominal damages.\n\nInjunctions that could be awarded would need to be proportionate to the breach of license \\- the court could require references to this user to be anonymised. This is easily done. It is unlikely that the court would require all contribution by the user to be removed \\- this is unlikely to pass a public interest test.\n\nIn relation to placing a disclaimer in the footer, US courts have generally accepted disclaimers if they are positioned such that a reasonable user is likely to see it... In the footer? It's not a great place, and easily missed. It could be better than nothing, though, and may help with the likelihood of someone imputing such opinions to a user. \n\n---\n\nEssentially \\- it's extremely unlikely that a reasonable person would impute support of the marriage equality agenda on a user based on a logo change, because the support is not sufficiently connected to the primary purpose of the site, or the user's activities on the site.\n\nEven ***if*** the user were successful in showing that this is the likely conclusion of a reasonable person, the remedies available to them would be limited to damages (which limited to actual losses, including suffering), and an injunction (which is likely to be anonymisation).\n\nA disclaimer may not, on its own, actually preserve the validity of the license, but it may be useful on determining the likelihood of a reasonable person imputing opinions to a user. \n\n---\n\n1\\.

A user claims this violates the CC BY-SA 3.0 license under which they contributed content. Which of the following best represents the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The website has likely violated the license terms, as the logo change implies a political endorsement by all contributors without their express permission.\n\nB) The license violation claim is valid only if the website fails to include a disclaimer stating that contributors are not associated with the site's political views.\n\nC) The logo change is unlikely to violate the license, as it would be difficult to prove that a reasonable person would impute support for the cause to individual contributors.\n\nD) The website is in clear violation of the license, and contributors can demand immediate removal of all their content.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the CC BY-SA 3.0 license terms in the context of a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation emphasizes that it's \"highly unlikely\" that changing the logo would impute support of a political view to individual users.\n\n2. The burden of proof would be on the plaintiff to demonstrate that a reasonable person would attribute the political view to contributors, which is a high bar to clear given that the site's primary purpose (programming Q&A) is unrelated to the political cause.\n\n3. The site's purpose and users' activities are not sufficiently connected to the political message to suggest endorsement.\n\n4. Even if a violation were found, remedies would likely be limited to damages for actual losses or anonymization, not content removal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the likelihood of a license violation. Option B is misleading; while a disclaimer might help, it's not a determining factor in license compliance. Option D is too extreme given the nuanced legal analysis provided in the documentation.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and evaluate the most likely outcome based on the provided expert opinion."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86482/does-an-act-of-perfidy-excuse-no-quarter", "docs_id": 86482, "title": "Does an act of Perfidy excuse no quarter?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Yesterday, Evilstan declared war on Ruritania. One of the Ruritanian units, let's call them the 1st Chasseurs manages to encircle a splinter troop of Evilstanian troops from the 2nd Armored Rifle Brigade. Encircled and rounded up, the commander of this group from the 2nd ARB pops a white flag and his troops leave their vehicles, arms raised to surrender. However, it's a trap and they gun down a couple of the 1st Chasseurs in their act of **[Perfidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidy)**. In response, the rest of this group from the 2nd ARB is wiped out. Clearly, the commander from the 2nd ARB had committed a war crime, and the unit was free game, their protection of the white flag removed by the perfidy.\n\nThe survivors of the 1st Chasseurs manage to encircle *another* group of tanks from the 2nd ARB today morning. Apparently, they are just that good. When the commander of this unit pops the white flag after comparable resistance, instead of stopping the fire to receive the POWs in a similar fashion, the soldiers of the 1st Chasseurs only pause long enough to top up their guns with fresh ammunition and then mow down the possibly surrendering soldiers, assuming this too was an act of Perfidy.\n\nHowever, having not honored the white flag in the second instance and by giving [no quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_quarter), have the Ruritanian 1st Chasseurs troops committed a war crime by eliminating the 2nd unit from the Evilstanian 2nd ARB?\n\n#### notes\n\nDeclaring no quarter will be given in itself would breach the rules of war under *Article 23 (d) of the 1907 Hague Convention IV \\- The Laws and Customs of War on Land.* Assume no such declaration was given.\n\nEvilstan (Evil \\+ the Slavic end for a country) and [Ruritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruritania) are **fictional countries**.

Certainly, there is a point at which if perfidy reaches a sufficient level of frequency, then the side committing it will lose the ability to \"clearly communicate\" an intention to surrender, but it isn't clear just where that point is.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: Following the events described in the documentation, a third group from the Evilstanian 2nd ARB encounters the Ruritanian 1st Chasseurs. This time, when the Evilstanian commander raises a white flag, the Ruritanian unit hesitates. What is the most ethically and legally appropriate action for the Ruritanian commander to take in this situation?\n\nA) Immediately open fire, assuming another act of perfidy\nB) Accept the surrender but keep weapons trained on the Evilstanians\nC) Request additional verification of surrender intent before proceeding\nD) Retreat and avoid engagement with the potentially surrendering force\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the laws of war, the impact of previous perfidy, and the ethical considerations in combat situations. \n\nThe correct answer, C, represents the most balanced approach that adheres to international law while accounting for the recent history of perfidy. By requesting additional verification, the Ruritanian commander is:\n\n1. Upholding the Geneva Conventions' prohibition on attacking those who have clearly communicated an intent to surrender.\n2. Acknowledging the impact of the previous perfidious act without assuming all future surrenders are false.\n3. Demonstrating a good-faith effort to distinguish between genuine surrenders and potential acts of perfidy.\n4. Balancing the safety of their troops with the legal and ethical obligation to accept surrenders when offered.\n\nOption A would likely constitute a war crime, as it assumes perfidy without evidence and violates the prohibition on attacking surrendering forces. Option B, while cautious, doesn't fully address the uncertainty created by the previous perfidious act. Option D avoids the immediate ethical dilemma but fails to uphold the military objective and doesn't resolve the surrender situation.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of legal principles, ethical considerations, and tactical decision-making in a complex, real-world scenario. It also addresses the ambiguity noted in the documentation regarding the frequency of perfidy required to negate the ability to \"clearly communicate\" an intention to surrender."}}
