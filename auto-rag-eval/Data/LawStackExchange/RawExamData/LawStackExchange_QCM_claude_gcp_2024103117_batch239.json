Option A is incorrect because while there is a 2-year statute of limitations for fraud cases, it begins from the discovery of the fraud, not the purchase date. Option B is correct because there is a 6-year statute of limitations for contract cases in Oregon, which has not expired in this scenario.

The best evidence that he is legally required to wear a mask is [this](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx) recent mandate from the Department of Public Health.

There are various persuasive avenues that you could pursue, such as asking CDPH to come talk to him (unlikely, but you could try), complaining to the property owner, appealing to local social media to apply pressure (possibly putting yourself at legal risk for defamation, if you make a false statement).\n\nThere are two more involved legal actions to contemplate. One is to terminate the lease and move elsewhere. This would likely result in an action to collect the remainder of the rent, but the strategy would be to argue that the manager has interfered with your private enjoyment of the premise. A second, highly improbable, is to sue the manager and get an enforceable court order requiring him to wear a mask. Courts have a prejudice against ordering people to take actions when other options exist (terminating the lease, monetary compensation). It could be an interesting but expensive test case to see if you could get a judge to order the manager to wear a mask.\n\nSo yes they are obligated to wear masks, but legal enforcement is going to be difficult at best.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Oakland, a tenant with chronic health conditions is concerned about their property manager not wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Of course, \u201cunder investigation\u201d just means that someone told the FBI about it, whether the FBI does anything is up to them. As the TV show [Yes, Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister) put it \u201cunder consideration\u201d means we\u2019ve lost the file, \u201cunder active consideration\u201d means we\u2019re looking for it.\n\nThe most relevant Federal law is the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act) (CFAA) under which there are a number of crimes but the most applicable is:\n\n> (2\\) intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains\u2014\n> \n> \n> (C) information from any protected computer;\n\nThe person in the article:\n\n* intentionally \\- check\n* accessed a computer \\- check\n* without or exceeding authorisation \\- we\u2019ll get back to this\n* obtained information \\- check\n* from a protected computer \\- check.

And if I don't want to keep them, do I have that option?\n\n*Your Rights With Respect To The Tenants*\n\nIf the agency is telling the truth and the agreement made with the agent was for four tenants but their records and document only listed three by accident, you probably can't insist on additional rent or evicting the fourth tenant because if your agent does something on your behalf, that is binding on you just as much as if you had signed them up personally in that manner. This is true even if the agent didn't actually have the authority to rent the place to four people based upon your communications with the agent, because the agent has \"apparent authority\" to bind you in your agent's dealings with the prospective tenants.\n\nYou probably have the right to insist that the fourth tenant sign the lease to conform to the actual agreement that was reached (four tenants in exchange for the rent stated in the lease). If the fourth tenant refuses to do so, that would be a repudiation of the lease/contract and would prevent him from claiming that he is a valid tenant of the property pursuant to the agreement reached with landlord through his agent. If the fourth tenant refused to sign, you could therefore insist that the fourth tenant pay additional rent or be evicted if you wanted to.\n\nOn the other hand, if the agent is not accurately relating the facts, and there was never any agreement to have more than three tenants (as your communications with them and the written lease suggest), then you would have the right to evict the fourth tenant or insist on additional rent from that tenant. But, it might be hard to prove that the agent is not being accurate because it sounds like the agent and the tenants will testify consistently with each other and there were probably no other witnesses to the discussions between them.\n\n*The Fourth Tenant Might Have Liability Anyway*\n\nAlso, at common law, you could sue the fourth person for unpaid rent during the period that the tenant was actually there anyway, since the fourth tenant was in \"privity of estate\" with you. (If someone actually signs the lease then they are in \"privity of contract\" with you.)\n\nEngland abolished the doctrine of privity of estate in most circumstances for residential tenancies [in 1995](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-107-7057?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true&comp=pluk&bhcp=1). But, it is possible that this fact pattern is one of the situations in which the privity of estate doctrine remains in force since the 1995 reforms largely apply to assignments of leases by people who are tenants on the original lease, rather than occupants of a rented property who never signed a lease and never received a formal assignment. I don't have the legal research tools to confirm that accurately. But, none of the U.K. Landlord and Tenant Acts currently in force that I could locate addressed that issue, so the common law rule may still apply in this situation. \n\nIf the doctrine of privity of estate does allow a suit against the fourth tenant based on occupancy without signing a lease, the incentive to even try to get the fourth tenant to sign a lease is very small indeed \\- you get no benefit at all from it other than slightly easier proof in an unpaid rent collection lawsuit if the agent's story is believed. If it doesn't the considerations earlier in this answer still apply.\n\n*Practical Considerations*\n\nAll of this being said, there is also a practical consideration to consider. It you try to kick out the fourth tenant or impose additional rent on the fourth tenant, if the fourth tenant refuses to sign the lease, or if you believe that the original agreement did not include the fourth tenant, you still have to weigh the pros and cons of bringing an eviction or unpaid rent lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit will cost you money (requiring you to advance money even if you are awarded attorneys' fees which may be impossible to collect from the tenants). You won't get your attorneys' fees for the lawsuit if you lose and will also have to pay their attorneys' fees if you lose. Tenants whom you are suing are unlikely to be cooperative on any other matter upon which you want their cooperation, and may bad mouth you, for example, in online consumer reviews. Unlike a typical eviction where the rent is not paid, it is very likely that the eviction will be contested, and if it is, the court could order the fourth tenant to sign the lease, but provide you with no other remedy if the court believes the story put forward by the tenant and the agent.\n\nIf you don't sue, you won't incur attorneys' fees, you can still evict everyone if the rent isn't paid, you can still try to collect unpaid rent from three other people, and you are much less likely to have a dispute with or non\\-cooperation from the tenants. The only benefit you get from having a fourth person on the lease if that was the original deal (or if you can't prove that it wasn't the original deal) is that you have one more person you can sue for back rent if the rent isn't paid.\n\n> If I decide to break my agreement with the agency, do I have grounds\n>  to do that?\n\n*Terminating The Agent*\n\nOften you can terminate an agreement with an agency without cause. If the agency agreement says that you can, you are free to do so and probably should because at a minimum they are sloppy and poor communicators.\n\nGenerally speaking, even if you can't terminate the agreement without cause, you can terminate the agreement for cause, and the contradiction between their prior communications with you and their current communications with you probably constitute good cause to terminate the agreement both if they are telling the truth not, and if they are not accurately recounting the facts now.\n\nBut, to be clear, terminating the agent won't affect the rights of the tenant.\n\n*Suing The Agent*\n\nIf you clearly do lose money because the three tenants on the lease don't pay rent and for example, you get a judgment against them which can't be collected due to bankruptcy or them moving abroad to a place where it is not economical to collect a money judgment from them, or just not having any assets or income (or some combination thereof), and it turns out that the law does not allow you to sue the fourth tenant, and the fourth tenant was not judgment proof, you would probably have a right to sue the agent for the lost rent caused by the agent's negligence in failing to get all four tenants to sign the lease. \n\nBut, the cost of proving that in a typical case would not be worth the money since this would be much harder to prove than simply proving that someone signed a lease agreeing to pay rent and didn't pay rent as agreed. If the agent didn't agree to pay for your losses voluntarily it might not be worth the time, trouble and risk of not prevailing in that lawsuit to pursue, even if you could get attorneys' fees for your suit against the agent if you won (which you probably could in England). The risks of doing that include paying the agent's attorneys' fees is you lose.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A landlord in London discovers that their rental agency has allowed a fourth tenant to live in their flat without informing them or adding them to the lease.

The landlord's legal position and options are contingent on whether the agency's claim about the original agreement for four tenants is truthful. If the agency is telling the truth, the landlord may have limited options due to the agent's apparent authority. If the agency is not being truthful, the landlord may have more grounds for action against the fourth tenant. However, the landlord should carefully weigh the practical considerations, such as legal costs, potential difficulty in proving their case, and the impact on tenant relations, before pursuing any legal action. The other options oversimplify the situation or make incorrect assumptions about the landlord's rights and the applicable law."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25988/is-profanity-a-form-of-protected-speech-on-college-campuses", "docs_id": 25988, "title": "Is profanity a form of protected speech on college campuses?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am currently attending college in Oklahoma and have run into a confusing policy.

They cannot prohibit expression of religious or irreligious viewpoints, they cannot prohibit expression of racist or anti\\-racist viewpoints, and so on. That said, there may be some murk pertaining to anti\\-discrimination legislation and the concept of a hostile environment. See for example [this statement from U. Michigan](https://hr.umich.edu/working-u-m/workplace-improvement/campus-commitment/what-hostile-environment): the underpinnings of any such restrictions are pretty broad (see the [USC statement](https://policy.usc.edu/student-misconduct/), including titles VI and VII of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and so on \u2013 those sorts of concerns apply to private schools as well).\n\nSWOSU has a long [list of prohibited activities](http://www.swosu.edu/resources/policies/students/affairs-activities/coc-proh-activ-defined.aspx). The only rule that marginally looks like it could cover bad language is the ban on\n\n> General misconduct that adversely affects the student's suitability as\n>  a member of the university community such as immorality, commission of\n>  major crimes, inciting disorders, association with known criminals,\n>  peace disturbances, disorderly conduct, and all acts that recklessly\n>  endanger the students or others.\n\nAnd that would be an incredible stretch.\n\nThe [residence handbook](http://www.swosu.edu/resources/pubforms/DisplayMedia.aspx?pid=403) states, pertaining to the rooms, that\n\n> Obscene material, including, but not limited to, pornographic\n>  literature, X\\-rated movies, and displays of profanity or language that\n>  is offensive to others may not be displayed.\n\nI assume that someone would be offended by the B word, so you can't display that on a poster in your room. This does not apply to verbal profanity or profanity in the lobby. Since they don't make the residency agreement publicly accessible, I can't see what they might have said there that implies a no\\-profanity rule. I should mention that university employees often over\\-interpret their authority, so it is not guaranteed that this is actual university policy (even is distributed by the front desk in a dorm). It may, however, be necessary to sue the university in order to get a clear indication that this is official policy, and that the policy is not a violation of the First Amendment. I would expect that the rationale has to do with \"hostile environment\". A second runner\\-up would be that it's about \"disorderly conduct\", which is where [Florida A\\&M](http://www.famu.edu/regulations/2.012%20Student%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20%20%20%20%20%20%204-14-14.pdf) places their anti\\-profanity rule.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A state university in Oklahoma has implemented a policy prohibiting the use of profanity in dormitory lobbies.

As a practical matter, you potentially have various forms of recourse.\n\nThe first thing to do is to write the the CEO of the chain, with a long detailed letter describing the incidents, and naming names. Most CEO's don't want to deal with this kind of bad publicity, and will at least order an investigation, and make amends, if the internal investigation is in your favor. This would apply even to the late Sam Walton, if the chain is WalMart, or whoever the current CEO is.\n\nIf you are a member of a protected minority, or even have dark skin, you can sue the chain on those grounds. There will be a presumption that they barred you on grounds of race or color. Then the burden of proof will be on them to show that they didn't bar you for those causes. \n\nAs a form of \"entrapment,\" you should take a witness, basically the most influential person you can get hold of that's not a family member, to the store with you to ask them why you were barred. The mayor of your town would be ideal, more llkely it would be a boss, teacher, or clergyman, but in any event, someone who knows you well. If you can get them to accuse you of stealing in front of this third party, you have the makings of a defamation case.\n\nAnd even if you aren't a minority, you can sue them anyway. You can demand \"discovery\" of all internal documents, videos, etc. relating to your case. Your lawyer will also the right to \"depose\" (cross examine) all offending managers.There's a good chance that something embarrassing will turn up in the process. (Many defendants settle in connection with discovery.) You might want to hire a second (libel) lawyer to teach you how to publicize the case without running into libel laws.\n\nIf all this fails, the store can probably bar you, but you want to make it prohibitively expensive for them to do so, meaning that most rational people wouldn't bar you after the above.

But the judge keeps allowing them to do it. Is there a rule or law that dictates how a judge can allow a legal team to use hearsays?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a quite complicated area of evidence law in the U.S. as there are many statements which are inadmissible under the hearsay rule, but there are also many statements that would otherwise be hearsay that fall within exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n\nIn U.S. federal court practice, hearsay is governed mostly by [Federal Rules of Evidence](https://www.rulesofevidence.org/table-of-contents/) 103, 104(a), 201, 801\\-807, and 1101\\.\n\nMost state court rules of evidence in the U.S. with regard to hearsay closely track the Federal Rules of Evidence. Some states do not follow this pattern but are substantively very similar as the Federal Rules of Evidence largely track of the common law rules of evidence before they were codified.\n\nRule 801 provides two exclusions from the definition of hearsay and a foundational definition. Rule 802 prohibits the introduction of hearsay into evidence unless an exception applies. Rule 803 provides 23 exceptions to the rule. Rule 804 provides five more exception to the rule. Rule 807 provides a final residual exception. So, in proceedings where the hearsay rule applies there are 31 main exceptions to the general rule, in addition to the argument that the general rule does not apply, but this still excludes lots of statements. Rule 201 (judicial notice) is another exception.\n\nSome of the main reasons to admit hearsay are that:\n\n1. It is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted (e.g. to prove the someone was present and talking at a place not that what they said was true, or to prove that someone said something defamatory or fraudulent, or to prove the someone made a \"verbal act\" with legal significance like agreeing to a contract or ordering someone to do something).\n2. It is a statement of a party opponent or someone affiliated with a party opponent (i.e. someone affiliated with the other side in the lawsuit or criminal case).\n3. It is a prior statement of a person made under oath and subject to cross\\-examination.\n4. It is a business record or public record or an \"ancient document\" (currently ancient means before 1998 in the federal courts, and typically more than twenty\\-years old in the state courts).\n5. It is a market quotation.\n6. It is a statement made describing things \"in the moment\", for medical diagnosis, or when the facts were fresh in the \"declarant's\" mind.\n7. It pertains to rights in real property, or to family relationships.\n8. It is a statement contrary to the interests of the person making it.\n9. It is a statement made when the declarant's death was believed to be imminent (i.e. a dying declaration).\n10. It is a statement made against someone who caused the witness to be unavailable.\n11. There are reasons that the statement is reliable and the intent to provide the statement is cleared with the court in advance.\n12. The matter upon which a statement is made is of general public knowledge not reasonably subject to dispute, is easily confirmed without doubt by a court, or is from a learned treatise.\n\nHearsay objections are also waived if a timely objection isn't made to them. See Federal Rule of Evidence 103\\. And, courts have some discretion to allow hearsay testimony on immaterial matters or matters that are not seriously disputed in the case for expediency's sake.\n\nRules 104(a) (excluding preliminary matters) and 1101 set forth when the hearsay rule applies and when it does not. Rule 1101 excludes from the rule a variety of preliminary matters, mostly in criminal cases such as:\n\n* grand\\-jury proceedings\n* extradition or rendition;\n* issuing an arrest warrant, criminal summons, or search warrant;\n* a preliminary examination in a criminal case;\n* sentencing;\n* granting or revoking probation or supervised release; and\n* considering whether to release on bail or otherwise.\n\nRule 805 governs the complicated situation of hearsay within hearsay. Rule 806 coordinates the hearsay rule with rules on how it is proper to introduce evidence about the credibility of a witness.\n\nThere is also a constitutional rule of criminal procedure, called the \"confrontation right\" that established minimum standards for the exclusion of hearsay evidence in criminal trials even when a court's procedural rules do not exclude it.\n\nMost states also have a hearsay rule pertaining to oral promises made by dead people called the dead man's statute, and limitations on introducing oral statements related to written agreements called respectively, the parole evidence rule and the statute of frauds.\n\nIn contrast, in the U.K. courts, roughly speaking, hearsay is generally admissible when the person making the underlying hearsay statement is available to testify, or is unavailable, which subsumes a large share of the U.S. hearsay rule, and makes much more hearsay admissible. U.K. practice would also allow admission of almost anything without a U.S. hearsay exception since they are derived from British common law evidence rules related to hearsay.\n\nThe main purpose of the hearsay rule is to prevent a defendant in a criminal case or lawsuit from being denied an ability to cross\\-examine witnesses in court because they would like to present evidence by affidavit or letter instead, effectively placing that burden on the prosecution in criminal cases, or on a plaintiff in simple civil cases, rather than forcing the defendant to pro\\-actively subpoena witnesses for the other side in the case. The rule has a broader sweep than that, but that is its core purpose.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a U.S. federal court trial, an attorney wants to introduce a statement made by a witness who is now deceased.

Under which exception to the hearsay rule would this statement most likely be admissible?\n\nA) The dying declaration exception\nB) The statement against interest exception\nC) The residual exception\nD) The present sense impression exception\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because the dying declaration exception typically requires that the declarant actually die from the condition they believed was about to cause their death. In this case, the witness recovered and died later from unrelated causes.\n\nB) is incorrect because there's no information suggesting that the statement was against the witness's interest. This exception usually applies when someone makes a statement that could harm them legally or financially.\n\nC) is correct. The residual exception (Rule 807) allows for the admission of hearsay statements that don't fit into other exceptions but have equivalent guarantees of trustworthiness. Given the unique circumstances of this case \u2013 where the statement doesn't perfectly fit the dying declaration exception but was made under the belief of imminent death \u2013 a judge might find it sufficiently reliable to admit under the residual exception.\n\nD) is incorrect because a present sense impression must be made while the declarant was perceiving an event or immediately thereafter. This statement was made about a condition (believing death was imminent), not an external event being perceived.\n\nThis question tests understanding of hearsay exceptions, particularly the nuances between similar-sounding exceptions and the flexibility provided by the residual exception."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90456/what-happens-with-seized-money", "docs_id": 90456, "title": "What happens with seized money?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Daniel the drug dealer was caught with 20\\.000\u20ac of illegaly earned money while crossing the border into Switzerland.

Why doesn't the law ensure that jurors, laymen and experts alike, are given clear and concise instructions? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While it is true that jury instructions are typically less than optimal, it is ideological hyperbole or cynicism to claim that instructions are *purposely* confusing. The ultimate source of the confusion is that the legal system has to assume (pretend) that it has clear\\-cut rules that any reasonable person can easily understand and automatically apply. In order to maintain uniformity of the law, there is an externally\\-defined instruction that a judge may read (rather than giving *his* personal spin on what \"reasonable doubt\" means or what the relationship is between \"reasonable doubt\" and convicting a defendant). Once the relevant body of government (committee of judges and lawyers) has established the apparently correct formula for expressing the applicable legal concept, they don't mess with it, until SCOTUS overturns decisions enough times based on crappy instructions.\n\nLegal professionals are trained to carefully scrutinze language so as to achieve a single interpretation of a given clause (never mind the fact that there turn out to be many such interpretations). Since they can apply these interpretive rules, it is assumed that anyone can apply them. But in fact, we know that people *don't* just use literal semantic principles to reach conclusions \u2013 but the law resist pandering to that imperfection in human behavior.\n\nThere is a huge literature on problems of jury instructions, some of the better of which relies on psycholinguistic experimentation to establish that a given instruction is confusing or gives the wrong result. See for example Solan's \"[Refocusing the burden of proof..](http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1293&context=faculty)\" (and references therein) that addresses the problem of the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" instruction, which has the unintended consequence of implying that the defense has an obligation to create a doubt (which is not the case, and allows conviction if there is the weakest imaginable evidence which hasn't been refuted). But who gets to decide what the improved instructions should say? The instructions have to correctly state what the law holds (where \"the law\" means not just statutes, but the trillions of relevant court decisions and applicable regulations). Thus there is massive inertia, and improved jury instructions will not come about quickly.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation provided, why are jury instructions often considered confusing or difficult to understand?\n\nA) Lawyers intentionally make them confusing to manipulate jurors\nB) The legal system assumes rules can be easily understood and applied by any reasonable person\nC) Judges create personal interpretations of legal concepts for each case\nD) Jurors lack the necessary education to comprehend legal terminology\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

It depends in whether you have a property interest in the protected information / relation.

If you were a partner and were bought out, there will surely be some written statement of the division of company property.

I'm wondering at what point not reporting a crime is itself a crime.\n\nI know that if someone happens to witness a bar fight and doesn't immediately call the cops they are not guilty of a crime (or I assume they aren't, unless they're technically guilty and simply never prosecuted for it). This implies that the refusal to report a crime is not, by itself, a crime.\n\nHowever, I'm also pretty sure if, for example, a women knows her boyfriend is sexually assaulting their child and turns a blind eye to it she can be convicted as an accomplice to the crime. Likewise, I think if you're riding in the car with someone who does a hit and run you are required to report it or be an accomplice.\n\nSo I'm wondering where this line is drawn. At what point does one's involvement become such that they are guilty simply for failing to report another individual, assuming they have not actively done anything to directly support the crime otherwise?\n\nFurthermore, if someone is indirectly benefiting from a crime they do not encourage or facilitate \u2013 for instance a wife getting a new fur coat after her husband robs a bank despite her not approving of the husband's actions \u2013 does this make her an accomplice? Is there a line here to draw, presumably a bar serving a drink to someone they know is a bookie doesn't make them guilty, even if the bookie presumably earned the money he is using to buy the drink via an illegal job?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL;DR\n-----\n\n**Never**; unless there is a specific law in the jurisdiction that requires it, however, that is a separate crime, it doesn't make you an accomplice to the first crime.\n\nThere is no general obligation to report a crime; some jurisdictions may have legislated to make reporting mandatory, either generally or for specific professions.\n\n[Accomplice](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Accomplice)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom the link, an accomplice is:\n\n> One who knowingly, voluntarily, and with common intent unites with the principal offender in the commission of a crime. One who is in some way concerned or associated in commission of crime; partaker of guilt; one who aids or assists, or is an Accessory. One who is guilty of complicity in crime charged, either by being present and aiding or abetting in it, or having advised and encouraged it, though absent from place when it was committed, though mere presence, **Acquiescence, or silence, in the absence of a duty to act, is not enough, no matter how reprehensible it may be, to constitute one an accomplice.** One is liable as an accomplice to the crime of another if he or she gave assistance or encouragement or failed to perform a legal duty to prevent it with the intent thereby to promote or facilitate commission of the crime.\n\nMandatory Reporting\n-------------------\n\nMany jurisdictions impose an obligation on certain professions to report suspected crimes. The most common and obvious being a police officer who generally has an obligation to report all suspected crimes. Other professions include doctors, teachers, nurses etc. in the case of suspected child abuse; sometimes this extends to elder abuse but usually doesn't include an obligation to report spousal abuse.\n\nIf a person with such an obligation fails to report, they have not become an accomplice to the original crime or any future crime; they have broken a different law on their own.\n\nGeneral consequences\n--------------------\n\nIn general, a witness to a crime is not required to report it. They could be asked to give a statement but are not obliged to and would not be subject to arrest. If they were subpoenaed to appear in court as a witness then they would be obliged to do so and give evidence; failure to do either would be contempt of court.\n\nTo be clear, a perpetrator of a crime is also not obliged to report it and is protected from contempt by rules about self\\-incrimination like the US Fifth Amendment. As an aside, NSW, Australia has recently passed a law that while maintaining the accused's right not to testify has allowed juries and judges to draw inference from the silence in their deliberations.\n\nSpecific Laws\n-------------\n\nSome jurisdictions have specific laws that make it a crime not to report. For example, in New South Wales, Australia Section [316](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s316.html) of the Crimes Act makes it an offence to conceal a serious indictable offence (i.e. one with a maximum penalty or 5 or more years gaol) that a person \"knows or believes\" has occurred without \"reasonable excuse\". The punishment is up to 2 years; if you solicit or accept any benefit for concealing it, the punishment is 5 years. Prosecution for people who came by the information as a result of practicing certain [professions](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/cr2015173/s4.html) requires permission of the Attorney General.\n\nPrivilege\n---------\n\nA person may become aware of a crime through disclosure as part of a professional\\-client relationship. Such disclosures may be subject to privilege.\n\nAt common law, only the lawyer\\-client relationship is legally privileged meaning that a lawyer cannot disclose what their client has said to them. This does not cover advice on committing or covering up a crime \\- if a lawyer does this there is no privilege and the lawyer may become an accomplice.\n\nClosely related is the litigation privilege where communications prepared as part of litigation (including criminal prosecutions) are protected even if they are not between the lawyer and the client.\n\nSome jurisdictions have statutorily extended this privilege to other relationships: doctor\\-patient, priest\\-confessor, pastor\\-parishioner, accountant\\-client, psychologist\\-patient etc. Check your local guides.\n\nYour examples\n-------------\n\n1. The bar fight witness has no obligation to report and is not an accomplice. In NSW, this is the crime of [affray](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s93c.html), a serious indictable offence, and must be reported.\n2. The mother of the child has no obligation to report and, unless she is assisting or encouraging the commission of the sexual assault, is not an accomplice. Further, spousal testimonial privilege does not apply; i.e. the mother could be compelled to give evidence against the boyfriend or face contempt. In NSW, this is the crime of [Sexual intercourse\\-child under 10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s66a.html), a serious indictable offence, and must be reported.\n3. The passenger has no obligation to report and is not an accomplice. In NSW, this is the crime of [failing to stop and assist after vehicle impact causing death or grievous bodily harm](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s52ab.html), a serious indictable offence, and must be reported.\n\nSub\\-questions\n--------------\n\n> At what point does one's involvement become such that they are guilty simply for failing to report another individual, assuming they have not actively done anything to directly support the crime otherwise?\n\nAt the point where the person moves from being a witness to a participant by assisting or encouraging the perpetrator.\n\n> ... if someone is indirectly benefiting from a crime they do not encourage or facilitate, ..., does this make them an accomplice?\n\nNo, however, if the person knows that the benefit are the proceeds of crime then they could be charged with receiving stolen property and would not have good title in the property even if they didn't know.\n\n> presumably a bar serving a drink to someone they know is a bookie doesn't make them guilty, even if the bookie presumably earned the money he is using to buy the drink via an illegal job?\n\nIt depends if they know the money is the proceeds of crime; if they do then receiving it is a crime in its own right but it doesn't make them an accomplice.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A woman named Sarah discovers that her husband John has been embezzling money from his company.

Further, he attached several Exhibits to the contract that don't clearly relate to either Asset X or Y, and only confuse the picture.\n\nCompany A failed to perform, but won't hand over Asset X, and my friend doesn't have the indemnity that he envisioned because of the way the contract was drafted. (A first year law student could probably have done better.) That's the causation. The harm comes from the fact that my friend now has to sue Company A, which might not be necessary if the contract was solid. The breach of duty comes from the disregard of instructions to \"securitize\" Asset X.\n\nDoes this constitute legal malpractice, and if so, what are the remedies? These questions relate to New York State.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Legal malpractice varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In many you'd need to show that there existed an: \n\n* Attorney\\-client relationship\n* Breach of duty\n* Causation\n* Harm\n\n[This](https://www.justia.com/injury/legal-malpractice/) is a more in depth summary of each of the elements. Each jurisdiction is going to put tests in place to determine whether the elements are actually met. So your firend's locality matters a good deal.\n\nThe ABA also has some aggregate statistics on the incidence of the various types of malpractice [here](http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_webonly_webonly07101.html). For example, it helps one to distinguish between clerical errors and failure to follow a client's instructions.\n\nEdit: for the state of NY (which applies the above rules), see:\n\n[NY State Bar Assoc.

Which of the following statements best describes the situation in terms of potential legal malpractice?\n\nA) The lawyer cannot be held liable for malpractice because drafting errors are common and expected in legal practice.\n\nB) To prove legal malpractice, the client must demonstrate an attorney-client relationship, breach of duty, causation, and harm, as well as show that the outcome of the underlying matter would have been more favorable with proper representation.\n\nC) The client can immediately file a malpractice suit without attempting to resolve the issue with Company A first, as the lawyer's error is clearly evident.\n\nD) Legal malpractice in New York is solely determined by the ABA Model Code, regardless of state-specific regulations.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately reflects the elements required to prove legal malpractice in New York State, which aligns with many other jurisdictions. To establish a legal malpractice claim, the client must show:\n\n1. An attorney-client relationship existed\n2. The lawyer breached their duty of care\n3. The breach caused harm to the client\n4. The client suffered actual damages\n\nAdditionally, in New York, the client typically must show that \"but for\" the attorney's negligence, the outcome of the underlying matter would have been more favorable.

The act enumerates allowed terminations of a lease for cause, and while damaging a unit is a cause, violating the requirement to keep things clean is not, that is, it does not say that you can evict them for having a dirty place (assuming it is not an actual health or safety hazard). There is a [form (N\\-5\\)](http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/ltb/forms/#landlord-forms) which you would fill out to officially give notice to the tenant, indicating an intent to evict, but \"the place is dirty\" is not in the list of causes, and you are required to explain in detail the \"damage\" caused by the tenant.

While Form N-5 exists for giving notice to tenants, uncleanliness alone is not a valid reason for eviction listed on this form (eliminating option C). However, the landlord is allowed to enter the unit with 24 hours notice \"to carry out a repair or replacement or do work in the rental unit,\" which can include cleaning.

Then, title changes not when you check out at the register, but when the cabinet is moved from the loading dock at the furniture store to your pickup truck ten minutes later.\n\nAlso, the philosophy of the Uniform Commercial Code is to make many legal obligations that historically hinged upon title to the goods (i.e. ownership) instead have a statutory basis that doesn't refer to title. For example, the Uniform Commercial Code recognizes that risk of loss, or risk of insolvency, don't always coincide exactly with change in title. In the Uniform Commercial Code, title is a residual catchall that applies to the rights of the parties only in the absence of another express provision of the UCC.\n\nThe Uniform Commercial Code also has a number of exceptions to the general rule.\n\nOne is for identification as special property. For example, suppose that there are lots of granite slabs on a warehouse floor none of which is exactly the same. Then, title is transferred when someone slaps a \"sold\" sign on that slab or in the records of the store. (Something similar applies in the case of a layaway sale.)\n\nWhen goods are in a warehouse, title can change by transferring a warehouse receipt without physically moving the goods. For example, this is how most transaction in gold bars and grain are handled.\n\nA car changes title when the certificate of title is signed by the seller.\n\nWhen goods are shipped, the parties can decide where along the way title transfers by saying **F.O.B. \"location\"** which is an acronym for \"free on board\" and means that title shifts when the goods reach that location.\n\nThe CISG\n========\n\nWhat if you are a Canadian business and you've driven across the border to Detroit to buy some inventory for your business? What law applies then?\n\nIn that case, the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods applies, and not the Uniform Commercial Code and Articles 66\\-69 of the CISG apply.\n\nIn the simple situation you describe, the UCC rule and and CISG default rule under Article 66 are the same. Title passes when the \"the goods are handed over\" to the buyer or to the first person in the delivery change if the buyer is taking delivery of the goods through a courier or delivery service.\n\nCanada\n======\n\nI don't know what authority applies in Canada, although I suspect that the outcome in common law provinces would be the same in the simple scenario you pose.\n\nTraditionally, civil law jurisdictions, like Quebec and Germany, make more of a distinction between \"title\" and \"possession\" than common law jurisdictions did historically.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A customer purchases a large cabinet from a furniture store in Colorado.

Given that the singer was famous, people came from other countries, including buses from the UK. Naturally the driver seat on an UK registered bus is on the right side, but when it entered France and then Belgium the driving lane was on the right side (and not in the left, as in UK). It seemed to me very accident\\-prone to drive on the *wrong* side of the road, but there were a lot of buses and also smaller vehicles.\n\nMy question is: was any traffic law infringed? Is it legal to drive a vehicle with the driver seat on the opposite side? I specifficaly mentioned France and Belgium, but I would be interested as well in other countries where this type of situation might happen due to proximity with neighbouring countries where the drive lane is on the opposite side.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: People can take their personal cars through the [Channel Tunnel](http://gouk.about.com/od/gettingtotheuk/p/ChannelTunnel.htm) from Great Britain to France. They don't actually drive their cars through the tunnel, but going by car is a perfectly normal way to travel between those two countries. That's probably the most well\\-known place where drivers will switch from driving on one side of the road to the other, but there are [many more](http://basementgeographer.com/crossing-from-right-hand-drive-countries-to-left-hand-drive-countries-and-vice-versa/) .\n\nIf driving with a car with the wheel on the \"wrong\" side were forbidden, these options would not exist, because at least one direction of travel would not work. Now, of course, that doesn't mean a country like Belgium, which does not have to direct way to Britain, couldn't forbid cars with the steering wheel on the right. But at least for EU states, that seems to be forbidden, as Poland and Lithuania learned when they tried to require cars that were to be registered there to have the steering wheel [repositioned to the left](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_CJE-14-37_en.htm)\n\n> Consequently, the Court holds that the position of the driver\u2019s seat, an integral part of the steering equipment of a vehicle, comes within the harmonisation established by Directives 2007/46 and 70/311, so that, in the context of the registration of a new vehicle in their territory, the Member States may not require, for reasons of safety, that the driver\u2019s seat of that vehicle be moved to the side opposite the direction of the traffic.\n> \n> \n> It notes in that regard that the legislation at issue provides for exceptions with regard to the use of vehicles equipped with a steering\\-wheel on the right by people who reside in other Member States, and travel to Poland and Lithuania for a limited period (for example, tourists). That fact shows, according to the Court, that the contested legislation tolerates the risk involved in such use.\n\nSo even those countries that tried to ensure that registered cars had the steering wheel on the \"right\" side made provisions for cars that were just traveling through.

According to the information provided, EU regulations protect the right to drive cars with steering wheels on either side throughout member states. The European Court of Justice ruled against attempts by countries like Poland and Lithuania to require repositioning of steering wheels for vehicle registration. This ruling extends to all EU member states, including France and Belgium. The court noted that even countries attempting to restrict right-hand drive vehicles made exceptions for tourists, indicating that temporary use was generally tolerated. Furthermore, the existence of cross-channel travel options like the Channel Tunnel supports the legality of driving right-hand drive vehicles in left-hand traffic countries within the EU.

Multiple cases brought under the Alien Tort Claims Act have involved claims that U.S. corporations, through their agents carrying out company policy, tortured people outside the U.S., or were complicit in conduct that caused someone to be tortured by a government.\n\nOne example is the case of *[Wang Xiaoning v. Yahoo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Tort_Statute)*\n\n> In 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights USA filed a lawsuit\n> against Yahoo! on behalf of Chinese dissidents Wang Xiaoning and Shi\n> Tao (Guao Quingsheng), claiming jurisdiction under the ATS.

The fines were largely waived in subsequent bankruptcy proceedings with the permission of the prosecution, in order to free up funds to pay compensatory damages to parties prevailing in civil lawsuits and funds to comply with orders from utility industry regulators in the state.\n\n*Arthur Anderson*, then one of the \"Big Six\" accounting firms in the United States was [convicted of fraud related criminal charges](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/31/business/justices-unanimously-overturn-conviction-of-arthur-andersen.html) in relation to the collapse of *Enron*, an oil company for which it was an accountant, that resulted in the demise of the firm, even though the conviction was ultimately reversed on appeal by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nI am not aware of a case in which a U.S. corporation has been prosecuted criminally for authorizing its agents to torture someone or being complicit in torture, but it certainly could be done (and probably has been done).\n\nThe federal [Racketeering and Corrupt Organizations Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act) (RICO) and parallel state statutes, are specifically designed to authorize both criminal and civil actions against corporation or *de facto* entities engaged in criminal activity. The statute was designed to target organized crime activities, particularly those involving corporations used as fronts for criminal activity, and in the criminal context, the focus of prosecutions has largely continued to be on old school mafia type organized crime gangs and cartels. But private civil actions authorized by RICO against companies engaged in a pattern of criminal activity usually involve allegations of a pattern of fraud and other forms of white collar crime. This would be a likely statute to invoke in a criminal case alleging that a company had engaged in a pattern and practice of torturing people.\n\nIn practice, the difference between a civil lawsuit in which compensatory and punitive damages may be imposed, and a criminal prosecution of a corporation, in which fines and restitution may be imposed, is subtle indeed when it comes to the remedies available in each case, even though procedurally, the two kinds of legal proceedings are very different, which is why usually a civil lawsuit, rather than a criminal conviction, would be the legal tool of choice when a corporation engaged in conduct, through its agents, which is criminal in nature.\n\nAlso, it is possible, but harder, to prosecute officers, employees and agents of corporations in addition to the corporations themselves, for criminal conduct. Indeed, this is the usual approach. But it is harder to convict an individual because you have to show that the individual had the requisite intent and was personally involved in the criminal conduct. This typically requires access to internal communications in a firm which can be difficult to obtain in a criminal proceeding that doesn't have as much pre\\-trial discovery, and can be difficult to establish because responsibility within a large corporation is often diffuse.\n\nGenerally speaking, prosecutors have seen the *Arthur Anderson* case as an unjust one and a cautionary tale that encourages them to think twice before prosecuting a major U.S. corporation criminally, rather than merely bringing a civil lawsuit against it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A multinational corporation based in the United States is accused of complicity in torture conducted by a foreign government against political dissidents.

Criminal prosecution of corporations is also less common and faces higher burdens of proof.\n\nB) This is the correct answer. The Alien Tort Claims Act is specifically designed to allow foreign nationals to sue in U.S. federal courts for human rights violations, including torture, committed abroad. The example of Wang Xiaoning v. Yahoo! demonstrates its use against corporations complicit in torture.\n\nC) Manslaughter charges would not be applicable in a case of torture that didn't result in death. Additionally, this would be a criminal charge, which is less common and more difficult to prove against corporations in such cases.\n\nD) While state tort law could potentially be used, it would likely be less effective than federal law for an international case.

The matter was remitted to trial. But the trial court was not satisfied with the legislature's attempted improvements, so it substituted its own \"judicially crafted\" map. This is the map that would be used in electing members of the federal House of Representatives.\n\n### Issue\n\nThe issue is whether the Elections Clause of the United States Constitution (which says that the manner of federal elections shall \"be prescribed in each State *by the Legislature thereof*\") limits the role that a state judiciary can play in determining the boundaries of federal congressional districts.\n\n### Basic argument of the petitioner\n\nThe petitioner's argument is roughly that *only* the state legislature may play a role in federal districting and not any other state entity or the state as a whole. They also argue that the state constitution cannot impose additional constraints on federal districting by the state legislature: only federal constitutional limits apply.\n\n### Basic argument of the respondent\n\nThe respondents' argument is that legislated election regulations, including those that establish the district boundaries *are not immune from judicial review*. They argue that the legislated *process* chosen by the North Carolina General Assembly, *includes* a provision for judicial review. They also argue that state constitutions can provide standards and guidance for courts to apply.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of Moore v.

Harper revolves around the interpretation of the Elections Clause in the U.S. Constitution and the extent of state courts' authority in the redistricting process. Option C correctly captures this debate by highlighting the question of whether state courts can invalidate legislative redistricting maps based on state constitutional violations.\n\nOption A is close but overstates the petitioners' argument by suggesting complete immunity from any oversight, which is not precisely their position. Option B is incorrect as the case does not involve the U.S. Supreme Court drawing maps. Option D is unrelated to the case, which focuses on state-level authority rather than federal takeover of redistricting.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the tension between state legislative authority and judicial review in the context of federal election regulations, which is at the heart of the Moore v.

T.L.O](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/469/325/case.html), they have a reasonable suspicion that the student has done something wrong (not necessarily a crime). However, students do have a reasonable expectation of privacy. The court ruled that schools do not have the same complete right to invade their child's privacy (likewise, schools do not have the same right to suppress speech of children). If the counselor has a reasonable suspicious of wrong\\-doing, a warrantless search would be legal.\n\nIt does not follow, though, that a student may resist such an order without consequences. The courts, and not the student, will determine whether the suspicion is reasonable. There does not appear to be case law establishing one way or the other whether the official must even articulate a reason for the search (students relent and sue later). A student can \"legally\" refuse the search (the official cannot batter the student to perform the search); but there probably is a rule that if you refuse a search request, you will be suspended (such a suspension was upheld in [DesRoches v. Caprio](https://openjurist.org/156/f3d/571/ii-v-caprio)). Picking [Portland](https://www.pps.net/cms/lib/OR01913224/Centricity/Domain/44/2017.18_SRR_MASTER_English.pdf) as a random district in Oregon, they do state that \"The school may search a student if the school has a reasonable suspicion that a prohibited or dangerous item will be found\". They also articulate disciplinary procedures for student violating the rules, and on p. 12 include a broad form of prohibited misbehavior, \"refusing to follow directions\".

If the passwords are encrypted instead of hashed (which still qualifies as \"plain\\-text\" once they email it to you), the hacker would have to figure out how to decrypt the passwords. (Which a good hacker could probably do.)\n3. The hacker would have to take those passwords and do something with them that causes damage to their owners.\n\nEven if all of those things happened, you would still also have to prove negligence on their part which would be pretty difficult to do because the flaw that was hacked would be the focus of negligence discussions moreso than what was stolen.\n\nThat being said, if your goal is simply to get them to fix the problem, rather than receive monetary damages, then you could still sue for an action to be taken. You'd have to pay by the hour for the attorney since they wouldn't have a chance of winning monetary damages. But in all likelihood the website owner, upon seeing the lawsuit, would fix the problem before it gets to court, so I could see that having the desired effect. That is if you think it's worth the cost of filing the lawsuit in the first place. Perhaps you could save yourself the cost of an attorney and just threaten to sue if they don't fix the problem.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company stores user passwords in plain text and sends them via email for password recovery. If a user discovers this practice, which of the following actions is most likely to result in a successful lawsuit against the company?\n\nA) Suing the company immediately for \"voluntarily making the information system weak\"\nB) Suing the company after their database is hacked and the user's personal information is compromised, resulting in financial damages\nC) Threatening to sue the company unless they remove the user's account from their database\nD) Suing the company for violating international data protection laws, regardless of the country where the database is hosted\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because simply storing passwords in plain text, while poor practice, is not typically grounds for a successful lawsuit without actual damages occurring.\n\nB) is correct because it fulfills the key requirements for a successful lawsuit: actual damages have occurred as a result of the company's actions, and there's a stronger case for negligence in data protection.\n\nC) is incorrect because threatening to sue without actual damages is unlikely to be effective, and removing a single user's account doesn't address the broader security issue.\n\nD) is incorrect because data protection laws vary by country, and the success of a lawsuit would depend on the specific laws of the countries involved, not international laws in general.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the documentation, which states that to win a lawsuit, you need to have damages as a result of an action and prove negligence or intent to harm.

It is quite easy for a lawyer to accidentally create a lawyer\\-client relationship.

Copyright is automatic (in most places), but there is a formal process if you want. Copyright happens the moment that the work is created. In the US, if you want to sue somebody for copyright infringement, you have to register your copyright, but you still have one regardless of registration. \n\nModifying the video is a derivative work and must be licensed/released from the original author/copyright holder.\n\nFrom [copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#register):\n\n> **When is my work protected?**  \n> \n>  Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\n> \n> \n> **Do I have to register with your office to be protected?**  \n> \n>  No. In general, registration is voluntary. Copyright exists from the moment the work is created. You will have to register, however, if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work.

In this case, the real estate video is protected by copyright as soon as it's recorded, even without formal registration or displaying a copyright symbol. However, in the United States, while copyright exists automatically, registration with the US Copyright Office is required before the copyright holder can file a lawsuit for copyright infringement. This makes option B the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because copyright protection is automatic and doesn't require formal registration to exist. Option C is wrong because public availability doesn't negate copyright protection. Option D is incorrect because displaying a copyright symbol is not required for copyright protection in the US, although it can serve as a useful notice to others."}}
