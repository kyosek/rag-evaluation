There is a trade\\-off between different aspects of security, and the data controller could reasonably arrive at an unusual conclusion. However:\n\n* The data controller would still have to implement appropriate measures to protect these plaintext passwords, for example by storing them in an encrypted manner, keeping unforgeable access logs, and limiting access to plaintext passwords to specially trained staff. Encryption is one of the few things that are explicitly required whenever appropriate.\n* The data controller better have a good analysis that shows that this unusual approach to security is appropriate.

In unusual circumstances, a company might justify plain text storage if it's crucial for their security processes and they can demonstrate that this approach is appropriate given their specific context.\n\nTo be potentially compliant, the company would need to:\n1. Implement strong security measures to protect the plain text passwords (e.g., encryption, access logs, limited access).\n2. Conduct a thorough data protection impact assessment.\n3.

You're correct that there is a federal law against murder, [18 USC 1111](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111). However it applies only to a murder committed in the [special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/7). This covers situations like crimes committed on federal lands such as national parks or federal buildings, or crimes on US\\-flagged ships at sea, aircraft in flight, or in space. It does not apply to \"ordinary\" crimes committed at most locations within the US.\n\n[18 USC Chapter 51](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-51) covers a few other situations, such as murder of a federal officer, foreign diplomat, by incarcerated or escaped federal prisoners, US nationals murdering each other while abroad, and so forth.\n\nThe idea is that these restrictions keep the laws within the enumerated powers of Congress as stated in Article I Section 8 of the US Constitution. A federal statute covering all murders throughout the US would probably be unconstitutional for this reason.\n\nSo while what he says is not strictly correct, it is true that in the vast majority of cases, murders are covered by state laws and not by federal laws.

Since the U.S. Postal Service is part of the federal government, rather than part of the state government, your New York State Assemblyman has absolutely no input or clout on this issue at all. The people you would need to contact would be your local member of the House of Representatives, and secondarily the two U.S. Senators for New York State.\n\nEach elected official in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate has staff members who are devoted to what is called \"constituent service\" which basically means helping ordinary people navigate the federal bureaucracy to meet their needs. If you were to contact one of these offices, you would be put in the touch with a constituent services staff member of that elected official who would help you figure out a solution to your problem, or would tell you that either as a matter of practical reality, or as a matter of that elected official's position on that particular issue, that the office won't be able to help you.\n\nConstituent services staff members contact the right person in the federal bureaucracy (in this case the right person in the U.S. Postal Service) to inquire, in what is known by employees within those federal government agencies as \"a Congressional\" which receives very high priority in the agency relative to ordinary citizen complaints and communications.\n\nAgencies that disregard Congressional inquiries routinely find their funding interrupted, appointments to their agency frozen, riders to legislation related to their agency specifically addressing the issue, and related follow up communications from the President at the request of a member of Congress when the President needs support from that member of Congress, none of which is something that the top officials in the agency want to deal with if it can be avoided in any way.\n\nContacting your local U.S. House member's office should probably be your first step.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to U.S. law, who has the authority to make decisions about mail delivery to specific houses, and what is the recommended course of action for a village seeking to expand mail delivery routes?\n\nA) The local New York State Assembly member has the authority, and they should be contacted first to secure funding and pressure the USPS.\n\nB) The U.S. Postmaster General has sole authority, and citizens should write directly to USPS headquarters in Washington D.C. to request changes.\n\nC) The local post office Postmaster decides, based on regulations approved by the Board of Governors, and citizens should contact their U.S. House Representative for assistance.\n\nD) The New York State government controls local mail delivery, and residents should petition the state legislature for expanded service.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Co. v. Stout*, 84 U.S. 657\\. As I understand it, In general, if a person is injured while trespassing on someone\u2019s property then, unless the injury is due to some specific fault of the landowner, the landowner isn\u2019t liable. After all, if someone trespasses on your property, you shouldn\u2019t be liable for poor judgment exercised by the trespasser, especially since he shouldn\u2019t have been trespassing in the first place. But *Stout* created an exception to this, initially termed the \u201cturntable doctrine\u201d (named after the piece of railroad machinery that that the child Stout was playing on when injured). The idea was that young children are a special case requiring a higher duty of care.\n\n*Stout* was cited soon after in a similar turntable case, *Keffe v. Milwaukee \\& St. Paul Railroad Co.*, 21 Minn. 207 (1875\\). The term \u201cattractive nuisance doctrine\u201d originated in *Keffe*, which explained the attractiveness concept thus:\n\n> To treat the plaintiff as a voluntary trespasser is to ignore the\n>  averments of the complaint, that the turn\\-table, which was situate\\[d]\n>  in a public (by which we understand an open, frequented) place, was,\n>  when left unfastened, very attractive, and, when put in motion by\n>  them, was dangerous to young children, by whom it could be easily put\n>  in motion, and many of whom were in the habit of going upon it to\n>  play. The turn\\-table, being thus attractive, presented to the natural\n>  instincts of young children a strong temptation; and such children,\n>  following, as they must be expected to follow, those natural\n>  instincts, were thus allured into a danger whose nature and extent\n>  they, being without judgment or discretion, could neither apprehend\n>  nor appreciate, and against which they could not protect themselves.\n>  The difference between the plaintiff's position and that of a\n>  voluntary trespasser, capable of using care, consists in this, that\n>  the plaintiff was induced to come upon the defendant's turn\\-table by\n>  the defendant's own conduct, and that, as to him, the turntable was a\n>  hidden danger, a trap.\n\nTwenty years later, the New York Court of Appeals discussed the turntable doctrine in *[Walsh v. F.R.R. Co.](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5914cf45add7b049348205c4)*, 39 N.E. 1068 (NY 1895\\) and said *Stout* didn't apply in that case. Maybe I'm reading *Walsh* wrong, but it seems to me to be saying that *Stout* might apply in some cases, but it doesn't in that specific case.\n\nBut then *[Morse v. Buffalo Tank Corp](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3614924/morse-v-buffalo-tank-corp/)*., 19 N.E.2d 981, 280 N.Y. comes along in 1939 and says\n\n> The general rule which has prevailed since the well\\-known turntable\n>  case (*Walsh v. Fitchburg R.R. Co.*, 145 N.Y. 301\\) is that the so\\-called\n>  doctrine of attractive nuisance does not apply in New York, and that\n>  the only duty which an owner of land owes to a trespasser or bare\n>  licensee is to abstain from affirmative acts of negligence or not to\n>  injure intentionally such person.\n\nAnd from there to the present, supposedly New York doesn't follow the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine.\n\nHow can some states follow it and some others not? I've heard of circuit splits, but they can be resolved by a Supreme Court decision. In this situation, a Supreme Court decision already exists, so I don't see how there can be a circuit split on this.\n\n*(Reason for question: I am taking a paralegal class and one of the exercises asks the student to determine whether the attractive nuisance doctrine holds in the state where the student lives.)*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US Supreme Court only has jurisdiction in federal matters. So if someone is suing under federal law, or there is a constitutional question, the Supreme Court is the place to go for a definitive answer. \n\nHowever, states have their own laws. The Supreme Court cannot tell New York that it *must* apply the attractive nuisance doctrine, as it is neither a matter of federal law nor a constitutional matter. New York is free to make its own laws on the subject, and the New York courts are free to interpret those laws as they see fit. In fact, federal courts are required to defer to New York's interpretation if New York's laws apply to the case, even if the case is in federal court for some reason (like diversity of parties.)

States have the authority to create and interpret their own laws in areas not governed by federal law or the Constitution. The Attractive Nuisance Doctrine, established in a Supreme Court case, is not a federal mandate that states must follow. Instead, it's a principle that states can choose to adopt or reject in their own tort law. New York, for example, has chosen not to apply this doctrine, which is within its rights as a state. This situation doesn't represent a circuit split (C) because it's not a matter of federal law interpretation.

Sweet*, [2018 BCSC 1696](https://canlii.ca/t/hvc04#par129), citing *R. v. J.A.*, [2011 SCC 28](https://canlii.ca/t/flkm1). \"The definition of consent for sexual assault requires the complainant to provide actual active consent throughout every phase of the sexual activity. It is not possible for an unconscious person to satisfy this requirement, even if she expresses her consent in advance.\" *R. v. J.A.*, [para. 66](https://canlii.ca/t/flkm1#par66).\n\nThe Supreme Court has explicitly declined to decide \"whether or in which circumstances individuals may consent to bodily harm during sexual activity\" (*R. v. J.A.*, [para. 21](https://canlii.ca/t/flkm1#par21)). However, in the context of a non\\-sport fist fight or brawl, one cannot consent to another intentionally applying force that causes serious hurt or non\\-trivial bodily harm: *R. v. Jobidon*, [\\[1991] 2 S.C.R. 714](https://canlii.ca/t/1fskj).1 And at the provincial appellate level, it has been held that \"consent is not a defence to a charge of sexual assault causing bodily harm in circumstances where the accused has deliberately inflicted pain or injury upon a person that gave rise to bodily harm\" (*R. v. Quashie* (2005\\), [198 C.C.C. (3d) 337](https://canlii.ca/t/1l3dd) (Ont. C.A.)).\n\nConsent would be irrelevant in a charge of criminal negligence or manslaughter, if the activities were to escalate this far (*R. c. Deschatelets*, [2013 QCCQ 1948, para. 175\\-77](https://canlii.ca/t/fwk0p#par175)).\n\nThe content of advance negotiations is not relevant to whether the complainant was consenting to the impugned conduct, however, it may be relevant as evidence of expectations about *how* consent would be communicated between the parties throughout the conduct. See *R. v. Barton*, [2019 SCC 33, para. 93](https://canlii.ca/t/j0fqj#par93) (citations omitted):\n\n> For example, in some cases, prior sexual activities may establish legitimate expectations about how consent is communicated between the parties, thereby shaping the accused\u2019s perception of communicated consent to the sexual activity in question at the time it occurred. American scholar Michelle Anderson puts it this way: \u201c\u2026 prior negotiations between the complainant and the defendant regarding the specific acts at issue or customs and practices about those acts should be admissible. These negotiations, customs, and practices between the parties reveal their legitimate expectations on the incident in question.\u201d These \u201cnegotiations\u201d would not, however, include an agreement involving broad advance consent to any and all manner of sexual activity. As I will explain, a belief that the complainant gave broad advance consent to sexual activity of an undefined scope will afford the accused no defence, as that belief is premised on a mistake of law, not fact.\n\nSee also *R. v. Sweet*, 2018 BCSC 1696, [para. 141](https://canlii.ca/t/hvc04#par141):\n\n> ... consenting adults may enjoy the personal autonomy to establish rules such as \u201cno means yes\u201d. If so, in my view, this passage suggests a corollary requirement to establish an alternative \u201csafe word\u201d or other mechanism to ensure that each party is also able to maintain their personal autonomy to put an end to unwanted sexual activity.\n\n### Application\n\nA contract cannot provide advance consent, therefore it is irrelevant as to proof of consent during the acts. However, advance agreements can (and several courts suggests *should*) set out the expectations about *how* consent will be communicated. Any evidence of such agreements would be relevant to establishing the defence of \"mistaken belief in communicated consent.\"\n\nNone of this would assist an accused in the circumstance where a court finds that any consent was vitiated because the accused deliberately inflicted pain or injury that gave rise to bodily harm (this position has not been confirmed by the Supreme Court).\n\nIf you are simply asking how to prove a fact in litigation, see [this Q\\&A](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/86826/46948).\n\n---\n\n1\\.

I would suggest that you make it very clear that starting in early September the laws will be enforced \\- that gives people fair warning. Then, each weekend in September you bring in enough police (State Troopers?) to enforce the law.

Instead, it suggests providing clear warning that laws will be enforced starting in September, then bringing in enough police (such as State Troopers) to consistently enforce existing laws over several weekends. This approach of fair warning followed by consistent enforcement is presented as more likely to change behavior than just increasing penalties or creating new criminal offenses.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Supreme Court has ruled that \"foreign citizens outside U.S. territory do not possess rights under the U.S. Constitution,\" which suggests that the organization's status as a foreign entity is relevant.\n\n2. However, the Court also indicated that the U.S. government cannot suppress speech by foreign persons within the U.S., even if they are government agents.\n\n3. This creates a situation where the subsidiary, being physically present in the U.S., would have some First Amendment protections, but its status as a foreign government affiliate might allow for greater restrictions than would be permissible for U.S. entities.\n\n4. Answer A is incorrect because full protections are not guaranteed for foreign entities, even on U.S. soil.\n\n5. Answer B is too absolute, as some protections would likely apply within U.S. territory.\n\n6.

We are in the alpha implementation/testing phase for google play, and discovered the name we chose for the app is the same as a drilling rig parts manufacturing company located in Texas. Aside from the domain name also being owned by that company (doesn't really matter to us), we are concerned with Trade Mark law.\n\nThe mobile app we are developing already has a large marketing channel with a certain amount of anticipated downloads immediate. We could change the name slightly (adding even one letter). Is this even necessary (or effective?) given that this company has no reason to develop a mobile app for public use, and is in a completely different state and industry?\n\nMore specifically, the scenario we are concerned with: Our app quickly gains popularity, google search results for the name bring up our app primarily (not the manufacturing company) \\- this WILL likely happen immediately.

State trademarks are only protected in the state where they're registered. They are cheaper than Federal Trademarks, but you probably wouldn't want to use on if you want your app to be on a larger scale.\n\nWhat you want is the Federal Trademark. Federal Trademarks give you protection across the nation, and allow you more overall legal protection. The Federal Trademark is also divided by class number which specify the category the trademark is in (i.e. \\#162 Paper Making).

If they hold a state trademark, you are good to go. If not, you need to cross reference the class number you want, and the class numbers held by the Texans. If they don't overlap, you should be good. \n\n\\-You can find a list class numbers [HERE](https://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/selectnumwithtitle.htm)\n\n\\-You can check the on other company's trademarks [HERE](http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=tess&state=4808:36ee50.1.1)\n\nI helped found a company that had the same name as 3\\+ companies across the US.

Federal Trademarks provide nationwide protection and are divided into specific class numbers for different categories of goods and services. If the manufacturing company has a Federal Trademark in a class number that doesn't overlap with the app's category, the app developer may be able to proceed. This approach addresses the core issue of potential trademark infringement and provides a clear path for the app developer to assess their risk. Options A and B are incorrect because operating in a different state or slightly modifying the name doesn't necessarily prevent trademark infringement if a Federal Trademark exists.

Corresponding legislation has been enacted covering Scotland and Northern Ireland. Battery is the application of unlawful force, and as well as spitting, covers incidents of pushing and slapping. Spitting, if done deliberately, is seen as an assault. Common assault carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison and/or a fine or community order. A prison sentence is generally reserved for cases where serious mental or physical injury was caused, and higher culpability is present. In other cases, a fine and community order is the more likely outcome. The offender will have higher culpability if they have previous convictions or there are aggravating factors, such as the attack being racially motivated, the assault was premeditated, or the victim was vulnerable. Increased penalties are being considered for offences aggravated by the intention to cause serious harm, such as disease transmission or the fear of it.\n\nEmergency workers, and public transport staff (e.g. bus drivers), are issued with 'spit kits' so they can take a sample if they are spat on (or spat at, and it lands elsewhere and can be collected), and this has secured arrests and convictions by use of DNA analysis.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7N01S.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7N01S.png)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QNhsQ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QNhsQ.png)\n\nEven [threatening to spit at police officers](https://www.gazetteherald.co.uk/news/18384920.man-jailed-coronavirus-threats-spit-cough-police-officers/) can get you six months chokey at the moment.\n\n> Common Assault \u2013 s.39 Criminal Justice Act 1988\n> \n> \n> Assault, as distinct from battery, can be committed by an act\n> indicating an intention to use unlawful violence against the person of\n> another \u2013 for example, an aimed punch that fails to connect.

It did this by passing the [Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/17-18/4/contents).\n\nSection 1 of that Act also authorised the King to change his title by proclamation but it was understood (see [Hansard](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1927/mar/23/royal-and-parliamentary-titles-bill)) that he would not use the words *United Kingdom* in his title which became\n\n> George V. by the Grace of God of Great Britain, Ireland and the\n> British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith,\n> Emperor of India\n\nSubsequent British monarchs used a similar title and it was not until 1953 that the Queen changed her title to:\n\n> Elizabeth II. By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great\n> Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories\n> Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\n\nso that her title contained *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*\n\nBefore 1953 sometimes treaties were entered into in the name of *Great Britain and Northern Ireland* ([example](http://foto.archivalware.co.uk/data/Library2/pdf/1937-TS0033.pdf)) sometimes in the name of the *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland* ([example](http://foto.archivalware.co.uk/data/Library2/pdf/1931-TS0012.pdf)) but as far as I can see *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland* is used consistently after 1953\\.\n\nSo my question is by what means and when did the title of the country itself change to *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*? Was it a precise event or did the country gradually come to be called that by frequently using that name in international relations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The change in the *royal* title came about following the Imperial Conference of 1926, when the various governments of the Empire agreed that \"the group of self\\-governing communities composed of Great Britain and the Dominions\" were \"autonomous Communities ... equal in status\". The Conference declined to pursue developing any kind of Imperial Constitution, preferring instead to draw out a few specific consequences of that agreement. In [the Balfour Declaration](https://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/cth11_doc_1926.pdf), section IV(a) asks for legislation to change the King's title. There is also a longer discussion in V(a) about treaties, which affects the examples that you give in the question.\n\nBoth of your 1930 examples follow the recommendations in this Declaration.\n\n1. The convention on conflict of nationality laws is entered into by the King, with the governments of his realms separately represented and enumerated. It lists two plenipotentiaries \"For Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". The omission of \"the United Kingdom of\" is not material, much like talking about \"the Kingdom of Sweden\" versus just \"Sweden\".\n2. The agreement on Bulgarian financial obligations is between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and various other governments.\n\nThey both refer to Northern Ireland rather than Ireland but differ in form because they use the different structures of a treaty between sovereigns and an agreement between governments. As noted in the Declaration, prior usage was not always obvious to interpret, because of confusion about whether (say) Canada was meant to be bound by a treaty entered into in the name of the King of Great Britain. Likewise, [R v. Jameson \\[1896] 2 QB 425](http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs5/18962QB425.html) is an important case on extent of legislation to British possessions \\- in the past, it was not always explicit whether an Act was for the UK only, and this had to be deduced from context.\n\nIn debate on the 1927 Act in the Commons, the Home Secretary Sir William Joynson\\-Hicks (as he then was) [said](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1927/mar/09/royal-and-parliamentary-titles-bill):\n\n> It is clear that it is a misnomer to continue to talk of \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\" Quite obviously, since Southern Ireland has been granted Dominion Home Rule, there is no such thing as \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,\" but there is still \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\" Consequently, after full consultation and interviews with the representatives of Northern Ireland, with the Government of Northern Ireland, it has been decided to ask the House to alter the title of Parliament\\- and to make it \"The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\"\n\n[and](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1927/mar/15/clause-2-alteration-of-the-style-of):\n\n> Certain portions of Ireland have, as it were, slipped out of the United Kingdom, and we now call it the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but it is still the United Kingdom, and this is still the Thirty\\-fourth Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nIt is clear that he \\- on behalf of the government \\- saw the Act as sufficient to change anything *already defined in statute* which needed to be changed. (It was also debated whether the Great Seal needed to be renamed as well, etc.) The change to the name of the country did not need statutory authorization in contexts where the old name was not required by statute.\n\n* Diplomatic formulae are not statutory and so aren't mentioned here; the royal prerogative is already enough for the treaty language to be as envisaged going forward.\n* British passports also changed in 1927 to using \"United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland\" in place of \"and Ireland\". At the time, passport issuing was entirely on the basis of the royal prerogative, without any legislative regime.\n* Various other official publications, like statistical reports, used the new name going forward.\n\nSome other provisions in the Declaration were given effect in the Statute of Westminster 1931\\. This should be seen as part of a continuing effort to let the legal situation follow the policy (Commonwealth nations are equal autonomous peers) which itself followed the facts on the ground (the UK government could no longer expect to rule them directly). So there was not precisely a \"flag day\" when the UK's name changed, but there was a process of recognizing that the name *ought* to change, some wrangling over *how*, and the fairly rapid *implementation* of the change in 1927, at least on the part of the UK government itself.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the process by which the United Kingdom changed its official name to include \"Northern Ireland\" instead of \"Ireland\"?\n\nA) The name change occurred instantly and uniformly across all official documents and treaties following the passage of the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927.\n\nB) The name change was a gradual process that began with the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 and was fully implemented by 1953 when Queen Elizabeth II adopted the new title.\n\nC) The name change was officially enacted by the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, but its implementation varied across different contexts and documents, with some immediate changes and others occurring over time.\n\nD) The name change was solely dependent on the monarch's title and only became official when Queen Elizabeth II changed her title in 1953 to include \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 officially changed the name of the Parliament to include \"Northern Ireland\" instead of \"Ireland.\" However, the implementation of this change varied across different contexts. Some immediate changes occurred, such as in British passports and certain official publications. Treaties and diplomatic communications showed inconsistent usage for some time, with both old and new forms being used. The process was not instant across all domains, nor did it wait until 1953 for full implementation.

Wrongful death is a civil matter, so removing the statute of limitations retroactively would likely be considered a retrospective law, which is generally allowable. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply to civil cases. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because while this might seem logical, the legal precedent allows for retroactive changes to civil statutes of limitations. \n\nAnswer D, while plausible, is not the most accurate.

Something easy to prove and in fact I invited them to check in internet, were you find that we don\u2019t receive more than 30 pounds a year. So, I said I would paid something, from my own pocket. \n\nThey haven\u2019t reply yet, but I have been doing a research and talking to colleagues and press associations. And there is a consensus: Copyrigth is a legal company but doesn\u2019t act ethically, they act as scam and there are many complains. Plus I found this: \u201cIn view of German copyright law and the respective jurisdiction of the German courts, the amount that Copytrack claims is far too high\u201d. \n\nThe amounts they usually charge are absurd. For instance, if a photo cost 30 Euros or 100 Euros, Copytrack asks for 500, 600, 1000 euros and more. We think this is because they don\u2019t charge for their services to their clients, so the way to get their fees is by doing this. \n\nI am are aware copyright infringement is something serious and we respect other people\u2019s work, but I want all this managed in a fair, ethical and reasonable manner from both sides. \n\nI have been asking for advice and my colleagues say, I must ignore it.

(The number of electors that the district gets is the number of Senators and Representatives it would have if it were a state, but no more than the number of electors of the least populous state, so effectively the number will always be 3 electors, since each state has 2 senators and at least 1 representative, and there are some states with only 1 representative.)\n\n> Section 1\\.

Is at least one purpose of the judge's background investigation to determine if there is a drinking issue (that would be in\\-scope **any** DoD investigation)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Kavanaugh has had two of the DoD background investigations at least, as they are required to get Yankee White clearance, which allows routine access to the President (He had two such investigations during George W. Bush's presidency). So the issue would have come up then at least, if not sooner. The reasons they look at alcohol abuse is that, as the DoD says, Loose Lips Sink Ships, and as the Romans observed *In Vino Veritas* (In wine, there is truth). They also look into it for matters as an substance abuse issue could be exploited by an adversary or could lead to poor choices.\n\nTypically, these investigations are lenient on youthful indiscretion during college and high school, as it would be near impossible to find a new recruit who hasn't drank under\\-age during college. It's quite common. Additionally, the scope of these investigations is 10 years or to your 18th birthday, which ever is sooner. If Kavanaugh was 17 in 1982, than it would not be covered in a 2001 investigation. They also require that you list six separate non\\-familial witnesses, with four of them being able to vouch for you during the entire portion of the scope's time AND they cannot be family members. Kavanaugh's first background check was when he clerked for the Solicitor General of the United States, in 1990 or 1991 (cannot remember the specific date, but it was early) so his college years could have been investigated during that time, though I do not know what the DOJ process is.\n\nDrinking is not in and of itself enough to get you disqualified, but does need to be assessed with other issues to make a determination on if the subject of an investigation could be trusted to handle classified materials. As it's not an illegal substance, they are looking for a problematic pattern, not if the subject drank underage, even if it was a glass of wine at Christmas Dinner.\n\nIt should be stressed, that this is a very, very, through screening. As one DoD hiring manager I know personally has told me, the general rule for hiring for hiring for a position is that for one billet that needs to be filled, give a conditional job offer to 4 people.

Is there implicit or explicit ways to relate Responsibilities to Rights?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, rights are independent of \"responsibilities\". But, responsibilities is a very broad concept: some aspects of responsibility are encoded in law, others are not. You have an absolute legal obligation to not murder or steal, as defined by the law. Some people say you have a social responsibility to put others before your own interest: this may be legally true in certain contexts, especially fiduciary contexts where your broker is supposed to make decisions on your behalf that benefit you (regardless of personal effect on the broker).\n\nContracts are another source of obligations \u2013 you gain a right (access to someone else's property) in exchange for something, which may include standards of behavior. You thus have a legal obligation on SE to not be hurtful in your postings (enforcement is via suspension, in the worst case).\n\nThe rights spelled out in the Bill of Rights are about the government \u2013 it says what the government may not do, it isn't a source of permission for you to exercise your rights.

When power is delegated by Congress to a civil servant with civil service protections, the President's authority to direct how that power is exercised is even weaker.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court and conservative legal scholars have toyed with invalidating those laws as unconstitutional if applied in a manner contrary to the Unitary Executive theory, but has certainly not adopted that doctrine wholesale. The non\\-delegation doctrine has been applied inconstantly to limit Congressional delegation of legislative power to independent agencies, and at one high water mark, the Supreme Court invalidated the process of the legislative veto over regulatory action which nonetheless remains on the books in a great many statutes and is honored notwithstanding clear case law disallowing it.

People's signatures change over time for a variety of reasons, sometimes dramatically in a short period of time, for example, in the case of a stroke or a hand injury.\n\nWhen signatures differ over time and there are allegations of forgery, then it is a question of proof for a finder of fact (i.e. a judge or jury) to decide if the alleged forgery is really a forgery.\n\nMany businesses that routinely accept small dollar value personal checks, for example, also take a thumb\\-print of the person signing the check in order to make it cheap and easy to litigate the question of whether a signature on a check is forged, and to discourage litigants from falsely claiming that a check was forged in the first place.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of their signature?\n\nA) The employee must use the exact same signature style (e.g., typed name in the same font) for all future company documents to ensure legal validity.\n\nB) Any significant variation in the employee's signature on future documents could potentially invalidate the original offer letter agreement.\n\nC) The employee's signature is primarily a demonstration of intent to agree, and reasonable variations in future signatures would not typically impact the validity of the agreement.\n\nD) Electronic signatures are not legally binding for international employment contracts, so the employee will need to provide a physical signature later.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As explained in the documentation, a signature is primarily a ritualized way of showing legal agreement. The content or style of the signature does not impact its legal validity as long as it was made by the intended person with the intent to legally agree to the document's contents. Reasonable variations in signature style or method (electronic vs. physical) over time are common and accepted. What matters most is that the signature represents the signer's intent to be bound by the agreement, not the consistent appearance of the signature itself.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no legal requirement to maintain the exact same signature style across documents. Option B overstates the impact of signature variations. Option D is false, as electronic signatures can be legally binding for international contracts in many jurisdictions."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52951/does-violating-an-international-treaty-have-any-legal-consequence-in-united-stat", "docs_id": 52951, "title": "Does violating an international treaty have any legal consequence in United States?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm asking in general and also specifically in the example I'm going to show. In my country, international treaties have constitutional level since 1994, which means a violation of an international treaty is a violation of the constitution. For example, Argentina signed the declaration of human rights, so if a law violates a human right here, it's violating the constitution. How is this in United States? Does violating an international treaty have any legal consequence in United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For the US, violating the obligations of a treaty (for the purposes of international law) is not the same as a violation of the US constitution (for the purposes of domestic US law). The US Constitution is higher than treaties, and if a treaty is in conflict with the constitution, courts will rule the treaty null and void for the purposes of US law. See the Supreme Court decision in Reid v. Covert (1957\\). In addition, treaties do not have a privileged position over regular federal law, and simple acts of Congress can amend or repeal treaties for the purposes of US law. See the Supreme Court decision in the Head Money Cases (1884\\). In these cases, other countries may still regard the US to still be bound by the obligations of the treaty, even though the US may no longer be following the domestic law obligations, and thus the US may be \"violating\" the treaty from the perspective of international law.\n\nEven if a treaty has not been ruled unconstitutional and has not been amended by Congress, a violation of it might still not be a violation of US law. For example, Article 33 of the Refugee Convention (which is binding on the US because it's a party to the Refugee Protocol) prevents countries from returning refugees to a country where they are persecuted. But the US government has taken the [position](https://www.justice.gov/file/23326/download) that this treaty provision is \"not self\\-executing\" and does not by itself impose domestic legal obligations without separate domestic legislation (though others [disagree](https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1281&context=facpubs)). [This](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32528.pdf) Congressional Research Service report goes into detail about the issues surrounding the impact of treaties on US law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal status and consequences of international treaties?\n\nA) International treaties automatically have constitutional-level status and violating them is equivalent to violating the U.S. Constitution.\n\nB) Treaties have a privileged position over regular federal law and cannot be amended or repealed by simple acts of Congress.\n\nC) The U.S. Constitution is superior to treaties, and if a treaty conflicts with the Constitution, courts will rule the treaty null and void for domestic law purposes.\n\nD) All provisions of ratified treaties are considered \"self-executing\" and automatically impose domestic legal obligations without separate legislation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In the United States, the Constitution is considered the supreme law of the land, and it takes precedence over international treaties. This principle was established in the Supreme Court decision Reid v. Covert (1957). If a treaty conflicts with the Constitution, U.S. courts will rule the treaty null and void for domestic law purposes.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because unlike some countries (like Argentina, as mentioned in the example), international treaties do not automatically have constitutional-level status in the U.S.\n\nAnswer B is false because treaties do not have a privileged position over regular federal law in the U.S. In fact, as stated in the Head Money Cases (1884), simple acts of Congress can amend or repeal treaties for the purposes of U.S. law.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because not all treaty provisions are considered \"self-executing\" in the U.S. As exemplified by the U.S. government's position on Article 33 of the Refugee Convention, some treaty provisions require separate domestic legislation to impose legal obligations within the U.S."}}
