        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Akron, Ohio, a homeowner has been mowing the lawn of a neighboring condemned property for three years to prevent pest infestations. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal situation regarding compensation for this action?\n\nA) The homeowner can bill the city for lawn maintenance services, as the property is condemned and awaiting demolition.\nB) The homeowner has no legal right to compensation, as the decision to mow the neighboring lawn was voluntary.\nC) The homeowner can file a lien against the condemned property for the value of lawn care services provided.\nD) The homeowner can sue the original property owner for unjust enrichment due to the maintenance of their abandoned property.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, the homeowner's decision to mow the neighboring lawn was voluntary and not requested by the city. Despite the property being condemned and scheduled for demolition, the city is not obligated to compensate individuals for maintenance they choose to perform on properties they do not own. The homeowner's actions, while potentially beneficial for pest control, do not create a legal obligation for the city to provide compensation. Options A, C, and D suggest various forms of seeking compensation, but none of these are supported by the given information or general principles of property law in this context."

Being allowed to **say** anything doesn't force anyone (judge/juror) to believe that it's **true** and obviously there're good reasons for example to force witnesses to only say the truth, because their freedom of speech quickly conflicts with the defendant's right for a fair trial should they be allowed to lie.\n\nI'd like to know the explanation for this as I'm sure there is one, though it's not obvious for an \"outsider\" like me. Besides that, I wonder if this has ever been challenged in court.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A courtroom is not a podium\n---------------------------\n\nA court is a forum for resolving a specific dispute. Testimony is restricted for a number of reasons the most all encompassing of which is relevance.\n\nFor testimony to be admitted it has to go to the issue in dispute. For a person charged under the laws of, say, India, it cannot be in any way relevant what the laws of, say, China have to say about the issue. Similarly, for a person charged with a Federal crime, state law is irrelevant (and vice\\-versa).\n\nThere is no free speech issue here because testimony is given only for the purpose of resolving the case. If it\u2019s not relevant to that you can\u2019t introduce it and, if you persist in trying the court can hold you in contempt.",

The judge prevents this testimony. Which of the following best explains the legal reasoning behind the judge's decision?\n\nA) The defendant's right to free speech is superseded by the court's need for efficient proceedings.\nB) State laws are always irrelevant in federal criminal cases due to the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\nC) The testimony is likely inadmissible because it is not relevant to the federal charges being tried.\nD) The judge is improperly limiting the defendant's Constitutional right to present a defense.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In a federal criminal trial, testimony about state law is generally not relevant to the federal charges being tried. Courts restrict testimony based on relevance to the specific dispute at hand. State laws typically do not impact federal criminal charges, so such testimony would be considered irrelevant and inadmissible.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while courts do aim for efficiency, this is not the primary reason for excluding irrelevant testimony.\n\nAnswer B goes too far - while state laws are often irrelevant in federal cases, this is not always true and is not due to the Supremacy Clause.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because judges have wide discretion to limit testimony based on relevance, and preventing irrelevant testimony does not improperly limit a defendant's rights.\n\nThis question tests understanding of relevance in testimony, the relationship between state and federal law, and the limits of free speech in courtroom settings."

Do American states have the power to close their borders from other states in a health emergency, is there a workaround to apply this, or can even the federal government give this power temporarily to states or something?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: US Constitutional law generally recognizes the right of [freedom of movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law), e.g. in Corfield v. Coryell, 6 Fed. Cas. 546, Crandall v. Nevada, 73 U.S. 35, Paul v. Virginia, 75 U.S. 168\\. \nThe more recent case [Saenz v. Roe](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/526/489/), 526 U.S. 489 affirms the position that restricting the \"right to travel violates the Equal Protection Clause absent a compelling governmental interest\", and one of the specific rights subsumed under the right to travel is \"the right to enter and leave another State\".\n\nThe \"compelling governmental interest\" is a reference to standard of judicial review known as [strict scrutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny), where a law that restricts a fundamental right (the right to travel) is required for a \"compelling state interest\", is \"narrowly tailored\" to that purpose, and is the \"least restrictive means\".\n\nIt is highly likely that each state has a statute that grants broad powers to the governor in case of a state of emergency. Such an order would then have to be scrutinized strictly, with respect to the narrow tailoring and least restrictive aspects of the question.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the constitutionality of this order?\n\nA) The order is unconstitutional because states have no power to restrict interstate travel under any circumstances.\n\nB) The order is likely constitutional because states have absolute authority to protect public health within their borders.\n\nC) The order may be constitutional if it can pass strict scrutiny, demonstrating a compelling state interest, narrow tailoring, and being the least restrictive means to achieve the goal.\n\nD) The order is automatically constitutional if approved by the federal government, regardless of its specific provisions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the right to travel between states is a fundamental right protected by the U.S. Constitution, it can be restricted if the restriction passes strict scrutiny. This means the state must show:\n1) A compelling governmental interest (which public health during a severe outbreak could potentially be)\n2) The order is narrowly tailored to address that interest\n3) It is the least restrictive means to achieve the goal\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they present absolute positions that don't account for the nuanced approach of strict scrutiny. Option D is incorrect because federal approval alone doesn't guarantee constitutionality; the order would still need to meet constitutional standards."

The information provided states that in Germany, non-compete agreements require the employer to pay reasonable compensation to be valid. It also mentions that half of the last regular salary may not be considered \"reasonable\" by courts, especially if it would endanger the employee's right to work in Germany. While answer C contains a true statement about EU citizens, it doesn't apply to all cases and isn't the most comprehensive answer. Answers A and B are incorrect based on the information provided."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How are debts and loans recovered by the lenders after a borrower passes away? A debt can be as small as 100 bucks for the credit card bill. It can be as big as millions of bucks for mortgage (or other fat) loans. \n\nAre the relatives or heirs of the deceased person legally bound to repay all or part of those debts, irrespective of whether they were actively involved in those debts?\n\nWhat legal channels can the lenders go through to recover their money?\n\nI am assuming such laws may not differ vastly across the countries. But still it will help a great deal if you mention the country whose laws you are explaining in the answer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [Civil law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)) jurisdictions, the heir of a deceased person will generally inherit all the **possessions, rights and obligations** \\- this **may include debts**.\n\nSo if a borrower passes away, the lender will typicall find out who is the heir, and ask them to pay. The heir will be required to pay, and the creditor can use the usual channels (reminders, collection agencies, court judgements) to make them pay.\n\nHowever, if the inheritance is \"under water\" (has more debts than assets), there are ways to avoid having to pay the debts:\n\n* In Civil law jurisdictions, acceptance of an inheritance usually means being liable for all the debts, too. Details vary between jurisdictions \\- in Germany, for example, acceptance of an inheritance is automatic, and a heir must file a document to refuse it (this is called **disclaiming the inheritance**). In France, in contrast, the default is to disclaim the heritage, but certain interested parties (such as creditors) can require a heir to formally make a choice, then the default is acceptance ([https://www.service\\-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1199](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1199)).\n* In contrast, in the United States (which generally uses [Common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law)), creditors are paid first, and the heirs only inherit what is left, in a process called [probate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probate). In that case, a heir need not explicitly disclaim an inheritance that is \"under water\" \\- they will simply not inherit anything. Note that the heir may choose to inherit certain debts in exchange for keeping certain assets \\- for example, if a home with a mortage is part of the inheritance, the heir may either choose to sell the home and pay the mortage, or keep the home and accept the mortage as debt.\n\nNotes:\n\nEven if inheritance is not automatic, the system usually allows a heir to disclaim it. There are other reasons for disclaiming an inheritance apart from debts, for example tax advantages, or the desire to grant the inheritance to a different relative.\n\nIf a heir disclaims the inheritance, no matter the reason, the inheritance automatically passes to the next heir in line. If all potential heirs disclaim in turn (as would typically happen if the inheritance has more debt than assets), the inheritance will usually fall to the state. Then, the assets will be divided up among the creditors (similar to insolvency proceedings). As an exception to the rule above, the state does not have to pay outstanding debts \\- so that money would be lost for the creditors.",

What is John's best course of action to avoid personal liability for the debts?\n\nA) Accept the inheritance and negotiate with creditors to reduce the debt amount\nB) Refuse to communicate with the creditors, as he is not personally liable for the debts\nC) Formally disclaim the inheritance within the legally specified timeframe\nD) Accept the inheritance but only pay debts up to the value of the inherited assets\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In civil law jurisdictions, heirs typically inherit both assets and debts of the deceased. However, when debts exceed assets (as in this case), the heir can avoid liability by disclaiming the inheritance. Option C is correct because formally disclaiming the inheritance within the legally specified timeframe is the best way for John to avoid personal liability for the debts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because accepting the inheritance would make John personally liable for all debts, even if they exceed the value of inherited assets.\n\nOption B is incorrect because in civil law jurisdictions, heirs are typically considered liable for inherited debts unless they formally disclaim the inheritance.\n\nOption D is incorrect because in civil law systems, accepting the inheritance generally means accepting full liability for debts, not just up to the value of inherited assets (which is more typical in common law systems like the United States)."

A year and a half later, which statement most accurately reflects the legal status of the police's order?\n\nA) The police order remains legally binding and enforceable indefinitely.\nB) The order is no longer valid, as freedom of travel and association are constitutional rights that can only be restricted by court order.\nC) The order is still in effect, but only within the city limits of American Canyon.\nD) The police order was never legally enforceable and was merely a strong recommendation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation emphasizes that freedom of travel and association are fundamental constitutional rights. Police do not have the authority to indefinitely restrict these rights without a court order. Their power to give orders is generally limited to immediate situations involving arrests, traffic control, or crowd management. Any long-term restrictions on movement or association must be encoded in law and pass strict scrutiny, typically requiring a court order. Therefore, without a court-issued injunction or other legal action, the police order given in this scenario would not be legally enforceable after the fact, especially considering no charges were filed and significant time has passed."

They told you you'd have to license the whole show, but they seem to have forgotten to tell you that if you do that you also have to *peform* the whole show. From their FAQ:\n\n> Can I change or cut language in the script?\n> \n> \n> In order to change or remove any language, you must receive prior permission from Broadway Licensing. If you cannot perform the musical without such changes, you should not hold auditions until such permissions have been granted. Please send an email to info@broadwaylicensing.com with the details of the changes you are interested in making. We will respond as quickly as possible.\n\nIt sounds as though whoever you spoke with didn't really know what they were talking about. The folks over at Music Theatre International seem to have a much better handle on the situation. [Their website describes](https://www.mtishows.com/about-licensing) the difference between the licensing model for a theatrical production and that for a single song:\n\n> Grand Rights vs. Small Rights:\n> \n> \n> The rights that MTI is able to grant under our contracts with the authors are limited to \"Grand Rights.\" Grand Rights cover the right to present the show, in its entirety, on stage. These rights do not include performance of a single song or medleys (\"Small Rights\"), videotaping, use of a logo or merchandising. In some instances, MTI has separately negotiated representation of additional rights, but those are administered on a show\\-by\\-show basis.\n> \n> \n> \"Small Rights\" is a term used to cover performances of individual songs in a concert or cabaret\\-type setting. There are three major agencies that control these rights in the U.S.: SESAC (Society of European Stage Authors and Composers), ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Author and Publishers) and BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc.) Depending upon the songs that are being performed, licenses may be required from one, two or all three of these organizations for a single presentation. Most schools, churches, restaurants and clubs pay an annual fee to obtain a \"blanket license\" from these licensing agencies that covers the \"small rights\" use of all music in their respective catalogues for the year. Note that these blanket licenses DO NOT permit dramatic performances of songs. The songs can be performed only in cabaret style. While it is sometimes difficult to draw a distinction between dramatic and non\\-dramatic performances, a dramatic performance usually involves using a song to tell a story or as part of a story or plot. A blanket license permits neither the use of dialogue from the show nor sets, costumes and/or choreography that invoke the original show.\n\nIn general, you need permission to make an arrangement and you need permission to perform it. Whether you're making money or not may affect the likelihood of being given permission, and it may affect the amount of the license fee, or it may not. Copyright does not exist to prevent you from making money with other people's compositions; it exists to ensure that the composers get to make money \\-\\- or decide for themselves not to \\-\\- when you perform their music.\n\nYour school may already have a blanket license with for example ASCAP that would cover a public performance of the song. At least now you should have a better idea of where to look for it.",

That is, TV channels that you get into your TV through having a once\\-ordinary (not sure people still have such things at all) antenna, either inside on the TV or outside on top of your house, which picks up \"normal radio signals\".\n\nBasically, these TV channels seem to be much more regulated and a much bigger \"deal\" in most places compared to \"satellite TV\" and \"cable TV\".\n\nWhy?\n\nAs I understand it, \"satellite TV\" is just like an antenna except the signal comes from a satellite in space rather than a tower standing on the ground. So *maybe* I can understand that, but still, you need a decoder to decode the signal, and that decoder has to be sold and owned by the person viewing satellite TV, so why not include that in the law?\n\nWhy specifically \"over the air\" TV? Is it because it's always unencrypted/unscrambled? (I'm not even sure that's always the case...)\n\nIn the case of cable TV, I assume that this means that you physically have a cable going under the ground all the way from the broadcasting station to your TV. Why is *this* less \"regulated\" than over\\-the\\-air TV? Seems to me as if cable TV is even *worse* than over\\-the\\-air TV in terms of requiring the local authorities' blessing, since you need to dig down cables and still use a decoder (maybe). Whereas over\\-the\\-air TV is literally invisible radio signals requiring no digging of any cables whatsoever.\n\nThis has always confused me both on a legislative and philosophical level. Please explain.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Over\\-The\\-Air\" or \"Broadcast\" television refers to Television that is propogated from a broadcast television over Radio Waves between 52 and 600 MHZ which puts this in the very high frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) spectrums and are line of sight propagation (typically placing the signal at 40\\-60 miles from the broadcast tower.\n\nLegally speaking, radio frequencies are \"public commons\" and are thus owned buy the government, similar to territorial waters vs. international waters (because no one lives Under The Sea but the law of the government encompasses them, it's a common trust managed by the government). Since there are only so many radio frequencies at any one time, and it's line of site the government will licenses corporations to use specific channels (granting them a \"right of way\"). However, because it's the government's radio station and you're just using it, in order to get those licenses, you had to meet some rules requirements and regulations.\n\nTypically, this is what is permissible to broadcast (You must have so much time devoted to news, so much time to educational programming, and cannot say certain things before a certain point in time called \"Watershed\" in the U.K. From 2100 to 0530 and \"Safe Harbor\" in the U.S. from 2200 to 0600\\. All times are military time.). Other restrictions (at least in the U.S.) include rules that limit some channels so they don't accidentally overpower each other. Typically this is achieved by alternating broadcast areas over even number channels and neighbor regions will be given odd number. In addition to changing which of the 10s you use and blocking out the 30s completely (in North America, the 30\\-40 range signals are reserved for radio telescopes).\n\nFor example, when I was growing up I was in the Baltimore Broadcast area, and because of station location, was able to get signals from Baltimore affilates and some D.C. affiliates as both were within the 40\\-60 mile range (it's 40 miles as the crow flies) as a kid, ABC was 02 for Baltimore and 07 for DC, so neither signal covered each other. (other double affiliates were Fox (05 in DC and 45 in Baltimroe) and PBS (26 DC and 67 Baltimore (and because of placement, 22 in Annapolis.) This lead to the weird thing where if you wanted something different on PBS and it was a clear night, 22 and 67 would have the same show, but 26 might give you an option. Unfortunately Pledge week was pledge week.).\n\nThis problem does not exist in cable or satellite (Dish) because the way the signals are sent are over infrastructure that is not publicly owned or in the \"commons\". The cable company may contract with a city or municipal government to lay down their lines, but the city doesn't own the line, the cable company does. Satellite will own the satellites that beam the signals down to the receiving dish.\n\nNow the question becomes why Cable or Dish programing aren't more naughty or risque and, well, back when it was new, it was a major selling point for the consumers. You could put all the swearing and nudity on that as well as movies where you might have to cut the naughtier scenes. But when you're making a television show, up until relatively recently, your goal was to get onto a Broadcast network that wasn't PBS (traditionally, the big three are ABC, CBS, and NBC. Fox (not Fox News) was the \"fourth\" with WB (now CW) being the 5th. A sixth in the form of UPN did exist, but it was folded into WB to make the CW and no longer exists and even in its heyday, was really a dumping ground for syndication shows that wasn't cable.\n\nGetting your pilot picked up by the \"Big 3\" networks (Or Fox, once X\\-Files was a hit and later WB/CW) was the goal for all TV productions so while you could make seedier content for cable, until very recently (the late 00s or early 10s) cable wasn't where you wanted to be. That said Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad could not exist on Broadcast.\n\nNow again, there was \"Safe Harbor\" but there were two problems... You had one hour before each network went to the Nightly News (2300\\) so you had 7 hours a week to get it in (and nobody wants their show on Friday or Saturday). From 2330 until about 0130 it was late night talk shows (With a \"late show\" followed by a \"late late show\") and after that was normally the sign off for a few hours until the morning, usually 5, which is when the farmers got up and they needed some market and weather info, so it was the AM news... though these days, there's more profit in infomercials selling the wee hour viewers miracle knives and exercise equipment they won't us.\n\nSuffice to say, you had a very narrow window... what's more, unlike the UK, which has earlier \"Watershed\" and uses it, the U.S. also has 6 time zones to the U.K.'s one, and Safe Harbor is based on local time (otherwise it would be 2200 in New York, 1900 in L.A. and 1700 in Hawaii, 1800 and (if you want to get technical about it) 1400 tomorrow afternoon in Alaska (Technically the part of Alaska west of the dateline are still Russian and nobody lives there, but Alaska time is so wibbly\\-wobbley that even Dr. Who won't go near it.). So the rule is broadcast is according to local time so. NYPD Blue famously got it's network into trouble for showing naughty content in Safe Harbor on the East Coast... but U.S. TV normally gives the time at 10/9 Central (and Pacific) which means it wasn't Safe Harbor the next time zone over and thus net some hefty fines. Cable/Dish only recently broke through this by writing shows that were sold only to channels that would air the naughtiness on cable and just happened to net that network a lot of attention, but it's too little too late as most viewers are \"cutting the cord\" and ditching cable/dish for streaming services which they pick up ala carte for specific shows and ditch if there is nothing on until the next season of favorite shows can come on.\n\nAll this stacks that even on cable and dish, and even on Cable, the big shows that get talked about are still keeping in relatively tame taboos because most writers are still just now branching out of comfort zones to put some more adult material in their shows... And some shows (especially legacy shows that survive a jump from safe TV standards to no rules) will still have the expectation of lacking some obscenities from fans (Don't expect Patrick Stewart to swear like a sailor in Star Trek: Picard, one of the few naval traditions that didn't make it to Starfleet).",

Over-the-air television uses radio frequencies that are considered public commons and are managed by the government. This is why it's more heavily regulated than cable or satellite TV. The government licenses corporations to use specific channels, granting them a \"right of way,\" but in return, these companies must adhere to certain rules and regulations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because encryption is not the primary factor in regulation. Option C, while true, doesn't directly explain the heavier regulation of over-the-air TV. Option D is incorrect because audience size isn't the determining factor for regulation in this case.\n\nThe key difference is that over-the-air TV uses public airwaves, while cable and satellite TV use privately owned infrastructure, which is why they are subject to different levels of regulation."

[A quick Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=do+kids+need+a+permit+to+sell+stuff%3F) leads me to believe that minors do actually need a permit to sell stuff. However, the kid and her mother didn't get into any trouble.\n\nWas it a situation where calling the police was the proper legal action?

But not everyone who sells has a permit, and not everyone who is confronted about not having a permit is arrested and prosecuted. There are simply too many potential cases to prosecute. And, the police officer has the discretion to ticket or not. When you get pulled over while driving or riding a bike, you don't always get a ticket, since the officer has the option of discretion.\n\nWhen the officer responded and found an eight year\\-old selling water, he obviously was aware of the fact that it was a violation.

Legally speaking, permits are required for street vending in Oakland, regardless of age. Therefore, Ettel was technically correct in reporting a violation. However, the response to her actions by both law enforcement and the public highlights the importance of discretion and social context in applying the law.\n\nLaw enforcement officers have discretion in how they respond to minor infractions, especially involving children. In this case, the potential negative public perception of arresting a child likely influenced their decision not to take action. \n\nFurthermore, the public reaction to Ettel's call demonstrates how actions can be judged not just on their legal merits, but also on their perceived social appropriateness. This case illustrates how the \"court of public opinion\" can sometimes be as impactful as the legal system itself.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they misstate the legal situation. Option B is wrong because it ignores the concept of police discretion in enforcement."

Representative Jeff Duncan introduced a bill that would strip all federal funds from any locality that allows non\\-citizens to vote. From his [webpage](https://jeffduncan.house.gov/press-release/duncan-bill-defunds-localities-allow-noncitizen-voting),\n\n> The Eliminating Foreign Intervention in Elections Act has two key components:\n> \n> \n> * Empowers the U.S. Census Bureau to collect and publish information on which States or localities have noncitizen voting policies in place.\n> * Defunds localities that allow noncitizens to vote in elections for State or local office.\n\nIs this constitutionally allowed?\n\n---\n\n**My research**\n\nThe constitution has several prohibitions against denying certain people the right to vote. For example the fifteenth amendment \"prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's 'race, color, or previous condition of servitude'.\" [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\n\nHowever I can't find any positive statements of who gets the right to vote, or any mention of who decides that. I assume that because the tenth amendment gives the powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people, that this is up to the states to decide.\n\nTechnically, Duncan's bill doesn't actually prohibit San Francisco from making this law, it just imposes very coercive penalties for doing so. The case of [South Dakota v. Dole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_v._Dole) lays out five criteria for considering if withdrawal of federal funds is unconstitutionally coercive. The last criteria is \"The condition must not be coercive.\" The debate around this fifth criteria seems to center on how much money is being withdrawn. This question might hinge on whether San Francisco gets enough money to count as \"irresistable pressure.\"\n\nI have a somewhat tenuous chain of logic laid out here. Any one of the links could be flat out wrong, or I could be just completely missing the point.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [National Federation Of Independent Business v. Sebelius](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf), the court addressed the matter of withholding funding, with respect to obligatory expansion of Medicaid, where ACA required states to expand Medicaid coverage, or lose all federal Medicaid funds. The effect, as described in the ruling was \"\\[t]he threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State\u2019s overall budget\", which constitutes \"economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion\", and \"The Medicaid expansion thus violates the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their existing Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion\". A law which withholds *more* than Medicaid funding would therefore clearly be at least as coercive as ACA.\n\nIt is some interest that the ACA ruling put specific comparative numbers on the effect of the highway funding law underlying SD v. Dole, which they decided was \"less than a half a percent\" of the state budget. In contrast, in the case of Medicaid funding, their estimate was that Medicaid costs are about 20% of a state's budget, and the federal government pays 50%\\-80% of that. That means, picking low numbers, the effect of withholding Medicaid funding would be about 10% of a state's budget. The line between persuasion and coercion then seems to lie between .5% and 10%.\n\nThe presumably introduced bill is [here](https://jeffduncan.house.gov/sites/jeffduncan.house.gov/files/documents/Eliminating%20Foreign%20Intervention%20in%20Elections%20Act.pdf), for reference. The core paragraph is \n\n> (a) None of the funds made available in any Act may be used to \n>  make payments to any unit of local government that permits \n>  individuals who are not citizens of the United States to \n>  vote in elections for State or local office.\n\nHowever, the introductory clause identifies the purpose as being \n\n> To prohibit Federal payments to a unit of local government  \n> \n>  that allows individuals who are not citizens of the United  \n> \n>  States to vote in elections for State or local office, and  \n> \n>  for other purposes.\n\nThe substantial difference is that propositions are not offices: the bill introduces ambiguity in legislative intent (the words of the statute say one thing, the potentially enforceable sections introduced into US Code say something else). The bill does not define \"unit of local government\", so we could search for existing definitions of that term. [31 USC 6701](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/6701): primarily \"a county, township, city, or political subdivision of a county, township, or city, that is a unit of general local government as determined by the Secretary of Commerce for general statistical purposes\" (I don't think school, fire, hospital and water districts count). Alternatively [42 USC 12746](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12746): \n\n> a city, town, township, county, parish, village, or other general\n>  purpose political subdivision of a State; the Federated States of\n>  Micronesia and Palau, the Marshall Islands, or a general purpose\n>  political subdivision thereof; a consortium of such political\n>  subdivisions recognized by the Secretary \\[HUD] in accordance with\n>  section 12746(2\\) of this title; and any agency or instrumentality\n>  thereof that is established pursuant to legislation and designated by\n>  the chief executive to act on behalf of the jurisdiction with regard\n>  to provisions of this Act.\n\nTo get the desired effect, the sponsor wants the definition in [2 CFR 200\\.64](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/2/200.64), which includes school districts (and that chunk is about federal grants, thus apt for the bill). The statutory authority for this interpretation is [31 USC 503](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/503).",

Sebelius provided some guidance on when withholding federal funding becomes coercive. The Court noted that in South Dakota v. Dole, withholding less than 0.5% of the state's budget was not coercive. However, in the Medicaid expansion case, withholding over 10% of a state's budget was deemed coercive. This suggests that the threshold for coercion lies somewhere between 0.5% and 10% of a state's budget. Option A is too low, as it's explicitly stated as non-coercive. Option B is too specific and high, as it's above the threshold where coercion was found. Option D is clearly coercive based on the Court's ruling. Therefore, option C best describes the range where the threshold for coercion likely exists."

Further, there is no right of either spouse to be cashed out in circumstances where the property is not sold.\n\nPartition Actions\n=================\n\nEither spouse could bring a \"[partition action](http://www.lonestarlandlaw.com/Partitions-of-Texas.html)\", however. The right of either spouse to do this is essentially absolute in the absence of an express (probably written) agreement to the contrary. An waiver of a right to partition would occasionally be contained in a mortgage, although most mortgages don't contain a waiver of partition rights.\n\nFor some kinds of real property, a partition action is accomplished by the in kind division of real property between joint owners. But, that option is not generally available for a single family home.\n\nInstead, if either party demanded a partition of the residence, the house would be sold pursuant to court order and the net proceeds would be distributed to the parties according to their interests in the property, which would ordinarily be 50\\-50, but might entail an unequal distribution if, for example, one spouse used separate property to make significant improvements or renovations to the property.\n\nA court ordered partition sale, when it happens, is a transfer that would constitute a default under the mortgage, making it immediately due and payable out of the proceeds from the sale.\n\nIn practice, this almost never happens and instead, couples with disagreements so great that it would push them to bring a partition action would instead get divorced and have the residence handled as one asset among many in a divorce.\n\nBut, in principle, it could happen, for example, in the case of an estranged couple that has a shared moral objection to getting divorce (e.g. they are devout Catholics) who also don't want to get a full blown legal separation that is not a divorce. Or, it might happen if a guardian and conservator of an incapacitated and institutionalized spouse needed funds for medical treatment and had no other options and didn't want to seek an actual divorce or legal separation.\n\nAlternatives To Partition Actions\n=================================\n\nIn lieu of a partition action there could be a legal separation or divorce, but this seems to be precluded by the intent of the OP.\n\nThis said, nothing prevents spouses from voluntarily partitioning property or cashing out a spouse's interest in property by a mutual agreement which is suitably documented.\n\nOne spouse could also probably sell their undivided one\\-half interest in the property to a third\\-party, if they could find one (in reality an unrelated third\\-party would almost never agree to such a sale). But, this would also violate the terms of the mortgage making it immediately due and payable in full. How the mortgage payment would be satisfied would be tricky \\- the selling party might have to satisfy the entire mortgage out of the proceeds of the sale of their one\\-half interest at closing, subject to some sort of obligation upon subsequent partition or sale of the property for the other spouse to take a charge against the proceeds of a later sale.",

A partition action is a legal option available to either spouse, which can force the sale of the property and division of proceeds. While rare in practice for married couples, it is a possible legal avenue when other options (like divorce) are not desired.\n\nC) is technically possible but highly impractical.

To come or go into: The train entered the tunnel. 2\\. To penetrate, pierce: The bullet entered the victim's skull \u201d \\[italics original] ). *Cf. id.* at 1908 (\u201ctrespass ... To commit an unlawful injury to the ... property ... of another ... especially to enter onto another's land wrongfully\u201d).\n\n[*Com. v. Santos*, 792 N.E.2d 702, 705 (Mass. App. 2003\\).](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ma-court-of-appeals/1376224.html)\n\n### Does part of the person have to enter the dwelling, like sticking their arm inside a window?\n\nFrom what I can see, there is no specific guidance on this issue in Massachusetts. Whether or not this would violate the criminal statute you state is going to be a fact specific inquiry.\n\nIn the case I cited above, the court held that a crane moving something over someone\u2019s land was not *criminal* trespass. I think one could argue that sticking an arm in the window of a house, would be trespass. This is assuming you had a right to be on in the area in front of a window. Common areas in an apartment/housing complex come to mind.\n\n### Or are they trespassing if they insert a tool into the dwelling, like if they stick a hose in the window?\n\nAgain, no clear guidance in Mass., but given the dictionary definition used above where entry \u201cpresupposes actual, physical presence in or on property, \u201d it is not criminal trespass; however this might meet the elements of another crime depending on what that person is doing with the hose.\n\nAlso, take a look at the elements of [civil trespass (tort of trespass to land)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass#Trespass_to_land). It\u2019s outside the scope of your question but seems to describe the situation you\u2019ve describe.\n\n### What if they stick a tool against the dwelling, with the design and intent that the tool disrupt something inside the dwelling, such as placing that same hose against the window and blowing high pressure air through at sufficient force to knock books over?\n\nAgain, probably not criminal trespass, but might meet the elements of another crime depending on the facts/circumstances. Definitely an actionable civil trespass claim with the possibility of other torts.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Massachusetts, John is standing on a public sidewalk next to an apartment building. He extends a long pole through an open first-floor window and uses it to knock over a vase inside the apartment. Under Massachusetts law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's actions?\n\nA) John has committed criminal trespass because he caused an object to enter the dwelling without right.\n\nB) John has not committed criminal trespass, but may be liable for civil trespass.\n\nC) John has committed criminal trespass because his actions disrupted property inside the dwelling.\n\nD) John has committed criminal trespass because the pole is an extension of his person.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Based on the Massachusetts court's interpretation of \"enter\" in the context of criminal trespass, John's actions likely do not constitute criminal trespass. The court defined entry as requiring \"actual, physical presence in or on property.\" John himself did not physically enter the apartment, and extending a pole through a window likely doesn't meet this threshold.\n\nHowever, John's actions could be considered civil trespass, which has a broader definition and doesn't require physical entry of the person. Civil trespass can occur when someone causes an object to enter another's property without permission.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they misinterpret the requirements for criminal trespass under Massachusetts law. The mere act of causing an object to enter, disrupting property inside, or using an extension of one's person does not meet the \"actual, physical presence\" standard set by the court for criminal trespass."

Once you are charged with a crime, your criminal defense expenses are your problem, economically, unless you are indigent, in which case, after you are arrested and arraigned you would have a public defender appointed for you.

This is unusual: these days, large launchers execute a planned \"safe\" re\\-entry, and crash into a defined area in the ocean. Last year, a launcher of the same type crashed in West Africa, having overflown New York. It's all over the news \\- where will it crash? ([More details](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/world-waits-to-see-where-a-chinese-booster-will-come-down/)). Several decades ago, the US Skylab came down into Western Australia, which was, and is, sparsely inhabited so no damage was caused.\n\nHypothetically, space junk could crash in my garden and kill my dog. If it did, I would be expecting to instruct my solicitor to seek *maximum damages*!\n\nBut seriously, what are the implications of this? Does the fact that it's specifically a spacecraft make any difference? It's pretty reckless \\- does that element play a part?\n\n(I'm in the UK. Does that make any difference? Actually the UK isn't under the flight path, so this is even more hypothetical in this case than you probably thought.)\n\nMy suspicion is that it would be considered a minor international incident, and China might pay some compensation if it seemed in their interests, and wouldn't if it didn't. It might be considered a more major incident if it hit, say, the Pentagon...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Article VII of the [Outer Space Treaty of 1967](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty_of_1967#Article_VII) (of which both China and the UK are signatories) provides that all states are liable for damages caused by the objects they launch into space:\n\n> Each State Party to the Treaty that launches or procures the launching of an object into outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, and each State Party from whose territory or facility an object is launched, is internationally liable for damage to another State Party to the Treaty or to its natural or juridical persons by such object or its component parts on the Earth, in air space or in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies.\n\nThis was further elaborated upon in the [Space Liability treaty of 1972](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20961/volume-961-I-13810-English.pdf) (of which, again, China and the UK are signatories.) In particular, it lays out a procedure under which one state can bring claim against another for any space junk that lands on its territory. So if a rocket lands in your back garden \\& crushes your schnauzer, it would be up to the Foreign Office to take it up with the PRC.\n\nIf Wikipedia is to be believed, the only time such a claim has been filed under this treaty is when the Soviet satellite [Kosmos 954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954) crashed in the Canadian Arctic in 1978\\. In that instance, the location was remote and the satellite was nuclear\\-powered, resulting in substantial cleanup costs.\n\nYour options to bring suit on your own, without the assistance of Dominic Raab, are limited. As a general rule, governments have [state immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_immunity) from suit in the courts of other countries (i.e., if you tried to sue the goverment of China in a UK court), and [sovereign immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity) in their own courts (i.e., if you tried to sue the government of China in a Chinese court.) In particular, in the UK other countries are immune from suit according to the [State Immunity Act of 1978](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/33), except for commercial transactions (which this would not qualify as.)",

According to the Space Liability Treaty of 1972, claims for damages caused by space objects must be pursued through diplomatic channels between states. The UK citizen cannot directly sue China in a UK court due to state immunity (option A is incorrect). Suing in a Chinese court is not feasible due to sovereign immunity (option C is incorrect). The incident is covered by international space law, so it's not considered a force majeure event without recourse (option D is incorrect). The proper procedure is for the UK government, through its Foreign Office, to file a claim against China on behalf of its citizen under the provisions of the Space Liability Treaty."

Fair Use deals with (among other things) the *amount of a copyrighted work you can legally use without violating copyright.* This is the aspect of Fair Use is what you need to be concerned with.

Target prices, being individual numbers, cannot be copyrighted and can be freely republished. However, descriptions are more complex. Their use without permission may fall under fair use in the US or fair dealing in other countries, but this depends on various factors such as the amount quoted, the purpose of use, and the potential impact on the original source. The answer also acknowledges that legal considerations can vary by jurisdiction, which is an important point raised in the documentation. Options A and B are oversimplifications, while D is overly restrictive and doesn't account for the possibility of using information under fair use or fair dealing principles."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company is interested in trademarking the term 'XYZ', which was previously registered but expired under 'Section 8/9' in 2010. Under what circumstances would it be legally permissible for the company to proceed with trademarking 'XYZ'?\n\nA) The company can immediately trademark 'XYZ' without any restrictions since it has been expired for over 10 years.\n\nB) The company can trademark 'XYZ' only if the original owner provides written permission, regardless of current usage.\n\nC) The company can trademark 'XYZ' if it's not currently being used in trade by the original owner and is outside the 6-month grace period for renewal.\n\nD) The company can trademark 'XYZ' as long as they pay a fee to the original owner, even if it's still in use.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, a company can proceed with trademarking an expired trademark if two key conditions are met:\n\n1. The trademark is not currently being used in trade by the original owner. Even if a trademark has expired in the USPTO registry, if the original owner is actively using it on products or services, they can renew it by filing a new application.\n\n2. The trademark is outside the 6-month grace period after expiration. During this period, the original owner still has the right to renew the trademark.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that the burden of proof lies with the new applicant to demonstrate that the original owner had no intent to continue using the trademark. This can be subjective and potentially problematic if challenged in court.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the process or introduce elements (like mandatory written permission or fees to the original owner) that are not required by trademark law in this scenario."

Finally, recipients of\n> congressional subpoenas retain their constitutional rights and various\n> privileges throughout the course of an investigation.\n\nThe lower court found \"that the subpoena issued by the\nOversight Committee served a valid legislative purpose because the\nrequested information was relevant to reforming financial disclosure\nrequirements\", but SCOTUS does not agree in that case that there is such a legislative purpose.\n\n[This](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R44247.pdf) is a summary of house and senate rules for issuing a subpoena, and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress) is a summary of the House procedure and legal framework for a resolution of contempt. It is not clear that a subpoena has been issued (per House rules), let us assume that at some point a subpoena *is* issued. Then Mr. Bragg might argue in court that the members of the House are not acting within a legitimate legislative sphere. The letter does not purport to intervening in a New York state criminal investigation, and the non\\-existence of an indictment is irrelevant.\n\nWhereas in Trump v. Mazars there was a real separation of powers issue regarding the executive vs. legislative branch, the letter spells out the legitimate congressional interest at stake, which is that the investigation:\n\n> requires congressional scrutiny about how public safety funds\n> appropriated by Congress are implemented by local law\\-enforcement\n> agencies.

According to the SCOTUS ruling, Congressional subpoena power is limited and must serve a \"valid legislative purpose.\" The House Judiciary Committee's letter attempts to establish such a purpose by citing potential oversight of federal funds usage and possible legislative reforms regarding prosecutorial authority between federal and local officials. While this doesn't guarantee enforceability, it provides a basis for arguing that the subpoena serves a legitimate legislative function rather than interfering with law enforcement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Congressional investigative power is not unlimited. Option B overstates the likely unenforceability, as the letter carefully frames the request in terms of legislative purposes rather than direct intervention. Option D is incorrect because the existence of an indictment is not a determining factor in the validity of a Congressional subpoena."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've heard some fellow geeks (who are always obsessed with computer privacy) talk about how 'amazing' a hidden partition is for privacy. I don't really see the point of all the trouble if I'm not actively engaging in illegal activities on my machine, but for now I'm more interested in rather or not such a hidden partition is as foolproof as these individuals claim; specifically would it really render any law enforcement powerless to do anything.\n\nWithout going too deep into the technical factors involved the idea is to have another partition (ie part of the computer reserved to install and run software on) where the partition is both encrypted and not listed in the boot sector, where partitions are usually stored. The net result is a hidden partition, no one can see or access it without using some special boot technique, such as using a CD or thumb drive to change how the computer boots up, to connect to it. if you don't plug in your magic thumb drive before you start your computer then in theory it would be impossible to tell you have another hidden partition or connect to it.\n\nI know enough about computers to know this hidden partition isn't quite as foolproof as claimed, as inferring the existence of a hidden partition shouldn't be impossible on a technical level. The fact that a large part of the computer isn't allocated, effectively preventing use of part of your computer's storage, should be enough to make an analyst at least suspect a hidden partition may exist, doubly so if someone mostly used their hidden partition so that their visible partition was rarely used or too small to be useful. Once a hidden partition is suspected some analysis of 'randomness' of the 1 and 0 on the unallocated space could be used to provide extremely strong evidence that there was encrypted data saved there, with a very large area of encrypted data in turn being very suggestive, but not definitively prove, that a hidden partition is being used.\n\nSo say that a suspected criminal, who used one of these hidden partitions, had his computer confiscated. Let's further say the polices' technical folks are on the bar and noticed the evidence which strongly suggests, but could never definitively prove, that the suspect was using a hidden partition. The police would, of course, like to get access to this hidden partition to see if anything incriminating is saved on it, but their going to need the magic thumb drive to view anything saved on it.\n\nI suspect the police could not compel the criminal to hand this over directly, as the evidence, no matter how suggestive, would not be be absolute proof that the hidden partition existed. Though if the police were able to find some other proof of a hidden partition, such as conversations the suspect had with someone where the suspect refers to his use of such a partition, they may be able to meet a sufficient burden of proof to compel the suspect to make the content of the partition available to them?\n\nWould there be any other options that the police may have to deal with such a suspected hidden partition which may contain incriminating data? The two obvious ones I could think of are:\n\n1. getting a second search warrant to allow them to search for the thumb drive used to connect to the partition. I imagine that they only need reasonable suspicion of a hidden partition to get a more extensive search warrant? Though I doubt that would be too useful since a criminal would presumably destroy such a device immediately after their computer was confiscated to prevent police from getting hold of it?\n2. Could the mere (strongly suspected) presence of a hidden partition be used against the suspect? for instance in a criminal trial could the prosecutor argue the fact that the suspect was apparently going to great lengths to make it impossible to see what he was using his machine for as evidence that the suspect likely was doing something unlawful with the machine?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> ***Though if the police were able to find some other proof of a hidden partition, such as conversations the suspect had with someone where the suspect refers to his use of such a partition, they may be able to meet a sufficient burden of proof to compel the suspect to make the content of the partition available to them?***\n\nThe US courts have [ruled on this](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/appeals-court-upholds-constitutional-right-against-forced-decryption), and the answer is \"no\":\n\n> San Francisco \\- A federal appeals court has found a Florida man's constitutional rights were violated when he was imprisoned for refusing to decrypt data on several devices. This is the first time an appellate court has ruled the 5th Amendment protects against forced decryption \u2013 a major victory for constitutional rights in the digital age.\n> \n> \n> In this case, titled United States v. Doe, FBI agents seized two laptops and five external hard drives from a man they were investigating but were unable to access encrypted data they believed was stored on the devices via an encryption program called TrueCrypt. When a grand jury ordered the man to produce the unencrypted contents of the drives, he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self\\-incrimination and refused to do so. The court held him in contempt and sent him to jail.\n\n[TrueCrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt) is one of the forerunners of hidden partition cryptographic tools. The anonymous team behind it closed shop suddenly and unexpectedly in 2014 in mysterious circumstances.\n\n> ***getting a second search warrant to allow them to search for the thumb drive used to connect to the partition.***\n\nThis is entirely reasonable, as it does not require self incrimination \\- if the USB key was password protected (as it should be) then you are back to square one.\n\n> ***Could the mere (strongly suspected) presence of a hidden partition be used against the suspect? for instance in a criminal trial could the prosecutor argue the fact that the suspect was apparently going to great lengths to make it impossible to see what he was using his machine for as evidence that the suspect likely was doing something unlawful with the machine?***\n\nIt would be a very weak argument, if allowed by the court \\- the defence could equally argue that the partition contains medical information, self taken naked pictures or grand political plans that the defendant does not want to be made public.

A quick Google search suggested that the definition for this is \"anything likely to cause offence\" which sounds horribly vague to me.\n\nThe case in question involved the man writing fiction on the Internet.\n\n* What limits are there to this?\n* If it's just fiction, and obviously fiction, does that mean he was essentially charged with the crime of thinking differently?\n* There is a myriad of online fiction already on the Internet. Should we be charging people who write mature fiction in general, or does it have to contain some specific themes in order to qualify?\n* Do other countries have different rules?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: WRT the UK, [Connelly v DPP \\[2007] 1 ALL ER 1012](http://www.5rb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Conolly-v-DPP-QBD-15-Feb-2007.pdf), it was found that\n\n> The words \u201cgrossly offensive\u201d and \u201cindecent\u201d are ordinary English\n>  words. They are not used in a special sense in section 1 of the 1988\n>  Act\n\nIn this instance, the lower court decided that her actions were grossly offensive; for her to win her appeal (which she did not) she would have to show that the decision was \"one which no court acquainted with the ordinary use of language could have reached\". The higher court agreed that the photographs were \"shocking and disturbing\". The [Communications Act 2003 section 127](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/127) likewise does not define \"grossly offensive\", meaning that it has it's ordinary meaning. Something is offensive if people are offended by it (the number or nature of the people so offended is not part of the meaning of offensive), and \"grossly\" is an intensifier suggesting that many people are offended, or people are highly offended. In other words, it refers to an emotional reaction. Whether or not a person has that reaction depends on the subject of the emotion (the person having it).\n\nFreedom of speech is protected to various degrees, by country. For example, blasphemy against Islam is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia, but not the US. It is a crime to criticize or insult the royal family in Thailand, but not the UK. The term \"obscene\" is often used to focus laws on sexually\\-offensive material, and in the US you don't generally find laws against \"offensive\" speech (I don't know of any survivors, though there may be some).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United Kingdom, how is \"grossly offensive\" material defined under the Communications Act 2003?\n\nA) It is strictly defined as material containing explicit sexual content or violence\nB) It refers to any content that criticizes the government or royal family\nC) It is determined by its ordinary meaning in language and the emotional reaction it provokes in people\nD) It only applies to material that incites religious hatred or discrimination\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, the term \"grossly offensive\" is not specifically defined in UK legislation like the Communications Act 2003. Instead, it is interpreted using its ordinary meaning in language. The case of Connelly v DPP [2007] established that \"grossly offensive\" refers to material that causes a strong emotional reaction of offense in people. The degree of offense is considered \"gross\" if many people are offended or if people are highly offended. This interpretation leaves room for subjective judgment based on societal standards and reactions, rather than having a strict legal definition or being limited to specific types of content."

While some illegal activities are already grounds for eviction under most laws, this clause can potentially cover a broader range of activities.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because not all illegal activities are automatically grounds for eviction under landlord/tenant law. Some minor infractions may not be covered.\n\nAnswer B is too broad. While the clause does expand the landlord's rights, it doesn't necessarily allow eviction for any and all illegal activities, especially very minor ones.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the clause does have a legal impact beyond just being a deterrent.

I don't pay tax in any other country and the company i'm contracting for is not registered in the UK (its in the EU).\n> \n> \n> I'm confused about where / if i should be paying tax.\n\nI am wondering \\- what is the worst\\-case scenario?

While double taxation treaties exist to prevent paying taxes twice on the same income, they don't guarantee that the total tax burden won't exceed 100% in extreme cases. The digital nomad has acquired tax residency in multiple countries through various means (property ownership, days present, work contracts, etc.), and each country may claim the right to tax their income. The US, for example, taxes its citizens on worldwide income regardless of residency elsewhere. Other countries may have conflicting residency rules or interpretations of tax treaties. While efforts would likely be made to resolve such conflicts, it's theoretically possible for the combined tax obligations to exceed 100% of income in a worst-case scenario.

The most logical and legally sound approach is to understand the intent of the notice and apply the increase from the last possible date in the specified month, which is February 28, 2022."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My question is very simple: **are marriages arranged through [Web Wed](https://webwedmobile.com/faqs/) legal?** Specifically:\n\n* Are such marriages fully recognized in the United States?\n* With [the apostille service](https://webwedmobile.com/ufaqs/can-i-use-my-license-for-immigration-purpose-only/), are such licences fully recognized in all countries? For this part of the question, I am particularly interested in the case where neither spouse is a United States resident or citizen. If there are some countries that are known to or expected o not recognize Web Wed marriages, I would appreciate the clarification.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n* I am aware of the new laws (sometimes temporary) put in place because of Covid\\-19 restrictions, but I am not asking about that. Web Wed claims that they have been arranging weddings since 2015, so apparently their legal framework has nothing to do with the temporary Covid\\-19 provisions. My question is about if Web Wed as a specific company provides legally recognized services (with or without Covid\\-19 allowances).\n* Web Wed explicitly claims that their arrangements are NOT proxy marriages, so my question is about the legality of the alternative approach that they take.\n* I am hoping for answers more specific than generic \"this is not possible\" responses without knowing Web Wed's specific approach (such as the answers offered to [Quora's question on the same topic](https://www.quora.com/Is-webwed-site-that-marries-people-online-legit), not posted by me).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: According to an article in *Bride's* [\"Zoom Weddings Are Now Legal!\"](https://www.brides.com/virtual-weddings-legal-new-york-4842735) dated April 2021,several states including California, New York, Ohio, and Colorado have made **temporary** arrangements to make it legal for weddings to take place over video conference in response to the pandemic. Several also permit remote applications for marriage licenses.\n\nAccording to the June 2021 article [\"Is it legal to have a virtual wedding?\"](https://wedfuly.com/is-it-legal-to-have-a-virtual-wedding/) from *Wedfuly* states permitting such weddings include New York, California, and Illinois. However, in Florida, Hawaii, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas the article says that both parties to the wedding, and the officiant must all be physically present in the same place, although the wedding may be displayed on video for people at other locations.\n\nAccording to the *New York Times* article [\"Why Virtual Weddings Are No Longer Legal in New York\"](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/nyregion/legal-virtual-weddings-marriages.html) dated July 16, 2021, on June 25, 2021 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo **ended** the executive order he originally issued in April 2020 allowing couples to be married online.\n\nAccording to that NYT article new legislation would be required for such weddings to be legal in New York again.\n\nOther states might cancel or change their temporary rules allowing \"virtual\" weddings at any time. The New York decision apparently came as a surprise, causing a number of scheduled weddings to be canceled or changed to in\\-person events. One planning such a wedding would do well to check current rules in the state involved.\n\nCitizenship or permanent residence should not matter to the validity of such weddings, as it does not matter for in\\-person weddings. However, it seems that both parties and the officiant must all be physically present within the same US state or other jurisdiction for the marriage to be valid.\n\nNot all countries recognize the validity of such \"virtual\" marriages. It is specifically mentioned that the UK does not.\n\nAlso, it seems that while such weddings were lawful in New York, the temporary rules required that both members of the couple, and the officiant, be physically within the state of New York for the wedding to be legal. Other states seem to have similar rules.\n\nIf the members of the couple are not in the same state, it seems that the wedding becomes a [\"proxy wedding\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_marriage). This is a process where one person is not present at all, but is represented by a \"proxy\". Proxy weddings have been lawful far back in history, at least as far as the middle ages in Europe, and perhaps farther. They are currently lawful in only a few US states. According to the Wikipedia article linked above these are: Texas, Colorado, Kansas, and Montana. Such weddings are invalid in all other states. Some of those states limit proxy marriages to active members of the US Military on deployment.\n\nThe service *Web Wed* seems to claim that members of a couple may be located anywhere or the virtual wedding, but this appears incorrect. They also claim a patent on some forms of this process, and seem to say that they are the only legitimate provider of virtual weddings, but the articles linked above quote various officiants and services that have performed hundreds of such marriages.\n\nUnder the \"full faith and credit\" clause of the US Constitution, marriages that are legal under the laws of any US state must be recognized by all other US states. Other countries may or may not recognize such marriages, depending on their own laws.\n\nI do not find any court case in which such a wedding was challenged and a court ruled on its validity, one way or the other.\n\n**Additional info**\n\nAn answer by user Roberto says that Web Wed does this by having an officiant in Utah County, Utah. The Utah County Clerk's office [page on Web Ceremonies](https://www.utahcounty.gov/Dept/ClerkAud/WebCeremonyFAQ.html) does say that the counter permits weddings by video conference as long as the \"host location\" is in the state of Utah. However, it does not mention WebWed specifically, and some of the information does not match. WebWed's site says:\n\n> Once you have the license, there is no rush to perform the ceremony. Once issued thru the courts the marriage licenses never expire, so once you have it you can get legally married whenever you wish. However, please note that each state expiration is different. You must adhere to that specific state policy. In most states, you have 30 days to get married after the license is issued.\n\nUtah marriage licenses are valid for only 30 days and are not issued by a court, so that does not seem to be what WebWed is talking about. The public pages of their site do not seem to mention Utah specifically.\n\nThe WebWed site also says:\n\n> A state issued marriage license is required to use this service. Please note that it is the registers/users responsibility to verify and abide by state, county, and armed forces marriage laws prior to using this service.\n\nWebWed's site advises government officials to reject any online marriage not preformed through their service. If such marriages are lawful and valid, they will be available to anyone that follows the proper rules. US states do not grant exclusive rights to specific commercial services in such cases.\n\nUS Federal Law\n--------------\n\n[8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101) which is the Definitions section for CHAPTER 12\u2014 IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY, says that:\n\n> (a) As used in this chapter\u2014\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (a) (35\\) The term \u201cspouse\u201d, \u201cwife\u201d, or \u201chusband\u201d do not include a spouse, wife, or husband by reason of any marriage ceremony where the contracting parties thereto are not physically present in the presence of each other, unless the marriage shall have been consummated.\n\n\"consummated\" is not defined in this section, and so presumably has its normal meaning in regard to marriage, that is, that the parties have had sexual relations at least once after the marriage occurred.\n\nThis section would apply to proxy marriages as well as to \"virtual\" marriages, but applies only in the context of immigration law.\n\nNormally US Federal law leaves the issue of marriages to the states, except where there is a claim that Federal constitutional rights are being infringed, such as in the cases of [*Loving v. Virginia*, 388 U.S. 1 (1967\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia) which forbade states to prohibit interracial marriage, and [*Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644 (2015\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) which forbade states to prohibit same\\-sex marriage.\n\nUtah Law\n--------\n\n[Section 30\\-1\\-6 of the Utah Code](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title30/Chapter1/30-1-S7.html) provides that:\n\n> 30\\-1\\-7\\. Marriage licenses \\-\\- Use within state \\-\\- Expiration.  \n> \n> (1\\) No marriage may be solemnized in this state without a license issued by the county clerk of any county of this state.  \n> \n> (2\\) A license issued within this state by a county clerk may only be used within this state.  \n> \n> (3\\) A license that is not used within 32 days after the day on which the licensed is issued is void.\n\nNote that 30\\-1\\-6(2\\) says that any such marriage shall take place \"within the state\". Nothing in this section, or any other section of chapter 30, specifically authorizes a marriage by video conference where one or both parties are not within the state when the marriage occurs. It is not clear on what basis the Utah County clerk's office considers such marriages valid.\n\n[Section 30\\-1\\-8 of the Utah Code](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title30/Chapter1/30-1-S9.html) provides that:\n\n> (b) Each applicant and if an applicant is a minor, the minor's consenting parent or legal guardian, shall appear in person before the clerk and provide legal documentation to establish the following information ...\n\nHowever that may be relevant only when one or both parties to the marriage is a minor.\n\nI can find no other provisions of the Utah code which control applications for a license by web, or specifies where a marriage may or may not be held, or who is or is not required to be physically present at a valid marriage ceremony.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the provided documentation, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of online marriages arranged through services like Web Wed in the United States?\n\nA) Online marriages are fully recognized in all 50 states as long as they are performed by a licensed officiant.\n\nB) Online marriages are only legal in states that have passed specific legislation allowing them, and even then, usually with strict residency requirements.\n\nC) Online marriages are universally recognized across the United States due to the \"full faith and credit\" clause of the Constitution.\n\nD) Online marriages are legal nationwide, but may not be recognized for immigration purposes unless consummated.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation indicates that online or \"virtual\" marriages have only been made legal in certain states, and often only as temporary measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even in states where such marriages were permitted, there were usually strict requirements, such as both parties and the officiant being physically present within the state. The legality of these marriages varies by state and can change quickly, as evidenced by New York's sudden termination of its allowance for virtual weddings. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because online marriages are not fully recognized in all 50 states. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because while the \"full faith and credit\" clause requires states to recognize marriages performed in other states, this only applies to marriages that were legal in the state where they were performed. \n\nAnswer D is partially correct about immigration law not recognizing unconsummated marriages where parties were not physically present, but it's incorrect to say that online marriages are legal nationwide."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In this question I will give an example of a law that effectively bans the import of (and makes attempted import without prior approval a crime) certain goods that can be freely bought and sold on national market. The effect is that the goods are hard to find and cost 10 times more than in countries where such a ban does not exist.\n\nThe actual question is: **how common is this scenario** in free/democratic countries? Is it common, or is the below example just a legal anecdote that ideally needs to be fixed by lobbying/pushing the law makers in the right direction?\n\n---\n\nIn New Zealand, people over 18 can [freely buy and sell](https://www.trademe.co.nz/sports/hunting-shooting/air-guns-parts/air-pistols) air pistols. No firearms license is required (unless you are younger than 18\\).\n\nHowever, if Bob wants to buy an air pistol from say Amazon, he needs to apply to the Police for a [permit to import](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/whole.html#DLM72906). The most amazing/amusing thing here is that, unlike *real*, non\\-air guns (e.g. a regular rifle, an application to import which can be considered just by any \"member of the Police\" who \"must\" grant it if certain criteria is met as per section 18(2,3\\)), an application to import an air pistol (which is [\"restricted airgun\"](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/DLM72627.html#DLM5829905)) has to be considered by the Commissioner (the head of the NZ Police themselves) who only \"may\" grant it, and *only* if there is a \"special reason\" to it (section 18(4,5\\)).\n\nThe law does not elaborate on what \"special reasons\" are, but the Police still [has its idea](https://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/sights-imported-airguns-and-military-style-firearms-new-gun-laws). In a nut shell, if Bob simply wants to practice target shooting with an air pistol at his rural backyard, or control the population of rats threatening his duck flock, he is out of luck: import is effectively banned for him. But he still can just buy the same thing locally \u2014 if he is lucky enough to find it.\n\nNow, there is more to it. Say Bob, who routinely buys stuff from Amazon, sees there an air pistol he wants for only $50, *new*, whereas locally he can find it only for no less than $500, *used*. He orders it without hesitation, thinking that if he can freely trade and use it locally, surely there will be no troubles buying it from overseas. He has no idea that there is section 16 which, in its [previous version](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/43.0/DLM72903.html) could send him to jail for 1 year (in the [current version](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/DLM72903.html) they've added \"without reasonable excuse\" which now could possibly save Bob from becoming a prisoner). Bob's Amazon order arrives at the customs which, upon not finding a matching import permit, forfeits it by way of transfer of title to the Crown. Bob loses the money \u2014 getting punished for not being clairvoyant enough to expect that such a law could exist. Moreover, he should be thankful that no charges get laid against him.\n\nApparently, the legislative intent here was to limit the number of air pistols in the country: if they were as accessible as they are in the world, the number of crimes involving them would have gone up. However, managing the risk of unlawful use just by keeping the prices 10 times higher (as opposed to either completely banning trade/possession or applying the same \"special reason\" threshold as for import) does seem like a very odd, peculiar solution.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The import of slaves into the United States was [banned in 1808](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_Prohibiting_Importation_of_Slaves), although slavery itself and the buying and selling of slaves [remained legal on a Federal level until 1865](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).\n\nThere were, of course, many many violations of the law against importing new slaves.",

The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves was passed in 1808, making it illegal to bring new slaves into the United States from foreign countries. However, this did not end slavery or the domestic slave trade within the U.S. The buying and selling of slaves remained legal on a federal level until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, which abolished slavery entirely. This created a situation where importing slaves was illegal, but owning and trading slaves domestically was still permitted for nearly six decades after the import ban. It's also worth noting that the ban on importation was frequently violated, indicating that laws prohibiting certain goods don't always prevent their entry into a country."

The documentation states that the classification of a worker as an independent contractor or employee is based on the facts and circumstances of the relationship, not just the agreement between parties. Many workers on shift-based schedules for a single company are often misclassified and are actually employees under legal definitions. If John is correctly classified as an independent contractor, ABC can likely terminate the relationship without notice or severance. However, if John should be classified as an employee, he may have additional rights and protections. Therefore, the legal implications of ABC's actions depend on John's correct classification under the law."

For example, a person planning to kill their neighbor in what is supposed to look like an accident would be different than a fight escalating and leading to the death of one of the people involved.\n\nOne distinguishing factor between \"murder\" and \"manslaughter\" is whether or not there was premeditation, meaning the perpetrator made the decision to kill someone before it occurred. However, I wonder, how long before the actual killing does this decision need to be made for it to be considered \"murder\" as opposed to \"manslaughter\"?\n\n---\n\n*Note:* I am mostly interested in answers regarding laws in Europe, but answers regarding other jurisdictions are welcome as well.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on the jurisdiction, but in the U.S. first degree murder will always require premeditation. The time required can be quite short too... down to nearly instantly in some jurisdictions.\n\nSecond degree Murder will typically cover Murder that is \"a crime of passion\" (i.e. you come home to find you spouse in bed with another man/woman and fly into a violent rage and kill the intruder.). Generally in jurisdictions that don't have instantaneous premeditation, this is used. If they do, 2nd degree includes crimes where you intend to harm the victim and got to carried away and killed them (often called Felony Murder... this could bump it to Murder in the First Degree).\n\nManslaughter usually implies no intent at all, but either negligence or a death that occurred as an unintended result of a lesser crime (Misdemeanor crimes generally net Manslaughter if they caused a death).\n\nIn Common Law, the intend doesn't play much of a role in the charge as it does in the sentencing. Common Law trials will first establish that a crime occurred, so intent has little to do with verdict, but with jail time (And in the U.S., depending on the state, Death Penalty. While not the only crime on the books that can get death penalty convictions, First Degree Murder is far and away the most common.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the legal use of this font on the website?\n\nA) The developer can freely distribute the font file with the website since it was pre-installed on their computer.\nB) The developer can use CSS to specify the font for text rendering, but cannot embed or distribute the font file.\nC) The developer must purchase a commercial license for the font before using it in any way on the website.\nD) The developer can embed the font file in the website as long as they include a copyright notice for Arphic Technologies.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. According to the information provided, it is legal to use CSS to specify the font for text rendering on a website. This allows browsers to use the font if it's already installed on the user's computer. However, the developer cannot distribute or embed the font file itself, as this would constitute copyright infringement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because pre-installation doesn't grant distribution rights. \nOption C is incorrect because purchase isn't necessarily required for specifying the font in CSS. \nOption D is incorrect because embedding the font file would still be a copyright violation, regardless of including a notice.\n\nThis question tests understanding of font usage rights in web development, distinguishing between specifying a font for use and distributing the font file itself."

The location seems to be local. The poster posted on the day after I lost my cell phone. He/she said on the posting that it was bought and then dropped, thereby causing the smashed screen. \n\nI am extremely wary about calling the police. Part of the worry comes from the fact that I shared a personal email address with the stranger. The email address does not contain any real names, but I am concerned that something may be used to track down a person's location or identity, and if that happens, I may be in danger of a vengeful attack. Part of the worry also comes from whether the police would keep whoever calls the police secret. \n\nAnyway, I am not entirely sure how the American law system works in response to suspected theft. What does or can the police do legally? Can the suspected thief see the identity of the one who alerts the police? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The legal system is set up to alleviate the problem or conundrum of intimidation by perpetrators. In the US criminal system, the State is the plaintiff, not the individual.\n\nIn the extant described situation, very likely all you would have to do is sign an affidavit that the recovered phone is your phone, and that it was removed from your possession by unknown means on or about a certain date. From your description given here you don't know if it was stolen...you appear to have perhaps dropped it or left it somewhere, and someone picked it up/found it. Clearly it didn't belong to them, but this is more like \"recovered lost property\" rather than \"received stolen property.\"\n\nThe craigslist poster might be entirely un\\-chargeable with a crime, though they might have to give up the phone to you.",

In the US criminal justice system, the State acts as the plaintiff in criminal cases, not the individual reporting the crime. This setup is designed to protect individuals from potential intimidation or retaliation by accused perpetrators. The individual who reports the suspected theft typically only needs to provide an affidavit confirming ownership of the property and the circumstances of its loss. They do not become the plaintiff in the case, nor are they required to prove the theft beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, the police generally keep the identity of individuals reporting crimes confidential to ensure their safety and encourage reporting of criminal activities."

In fact, there are [services](https://www.tunnelbear.com/why-vpn) that anonymize Internet use and represent the traffic as coming from some machine providing the service, which could be anywhere in the world. For example, the Opera web browser has a built\\-in VPN feature that does this.\n\nIs there anything illegal about using this to view content that would otherwise be refused?\n\nFor specific example, a person currently in Canada trying to view content on [the PBS web site](http://www.pbs.org).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It could be. Accessing any web page is subject to whatever the terms of use are for the page, and if those terms state that the page may only be accessed from within the US, then accessing the page from outside the US is a violation of the TOS (hence use is infringing): see 2\\.4(h) of the [Netflix EULA](https://help.netflix.com/legal/eula).\nThere are [EU rules](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20170207IPR61510/accessing-online-films-and-tv-while-abroad-deal-with-council) that override such terms, within the EU.\n\nThe usual way to circumvent technological location\\-restrictions (where the web page says \"I'm sorry, I can't let you do that\") is to use a VPN and pretend to be somewhere else. Use of a VPN is not per se illegal in most countries (there are exceptions), but using it to circumvent geo\\-blocking may be. Again returning to the point that the TOS may itself say \"No you may not\", the interesting question is what to conclude if there is no such statement, for example I did not see anything in the PBS TOS that restricts access to the US (I didn't look very deeply). Terms of service can't be secret: you can't be held to following rules that you cannot reasonably know of. If you attempt to access a page that uses un\\-announced geo\\-blocking technology and it informs you that you can't use the page because of your location, then you have effectively been put on notice that there is a rule. If you happen to be using a VPN and access an un\\-announced, (reasonably) undetectable geo\\-blocked site, that would not be a breach of the terms (because you have not been put on notice that location is a term of use).",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) Using a VPN to access geo-restricted content is always legal as long as the VPN service itself is legal in the user's country.\n\nB) Accessing the PBS website from Canada using a VPN is definitely illegal because it violates international copyright laws.\n\nC) The legality depends on the PBS website's terms of service and whether they explicitly prohibit accessing content from outside the US or using VPNs.\n\nD) It's legal to use a VPN to access the PBS website from Canada as long as the user doesn't download or save any content.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of using a VPN to access potentially geo-restricted content depends primarily on the website's terms of service. If PBS explicitly states in its terms that access is restricted to US users or prohibits the use of VPNs, then bypassing these restrictions would violate the terms of service and could be considered illegal. However, if PBS does not have such restrictions clearly stated in its terms, and there's no clear notification about geo-blocking when attempting to access the site, then using a VPN might not be a violation. The key factor is whether the user has been reasonably informed of any access restrictions. Options A and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the issue, while B is too extreme without considering the specific terms of service involved."

It is simply inputted and, implementing the algorithm/system, an output is given. \n\nGiven this, that it is impossible to actually prove the key is \u2018correct\u2019, if the authorities/prosecution were to \u2018find\u2019 said \u2018correct key\u2019, they cannot actually prove that the key is the correct one, therefore they cannot actually prove that the output provided by using said key is actually the original plaintext that was encrypted.\n\nMy point being: \nThough I assume, from previous legal cases around the world regarding infosec, that this would make any \u2018evidence\u2019 \\- obtained by \u2018decrypting\u2019 said data with this \u2018correct key\u2019 that any prosecution/authorities should obtain \u2013 inadmissible as they cannot actually prove said evidence ever existed, I am asking here if this is the case?\n\nSorry for the lengthy explanation, it is a rather niche question, I shall clarify it with an example for what I intend to actually ask; example:\nSay the authorities/prosecution obtain what they say is the \u2018one\\-time\\-pad\u2019 (though of course, as we know there is no irrefutable way to actually prove said claim) \nSaid one\\-time\\-pad is then used to produce plaintext which results in incriminating material being discovered.\n\nIs said material considered admissible evidence, given that:\nWith some clever, (though not actually that difficult to perform) maths some geeks could quite happily engineer a \u2018one\\-time\\-pad\u2019 to produce an output of said incriminating plaintext. \nRegardless of this, there is no way to actually prove said key is the correct key, and so creates the situation which allows for above abuse.\n\nI realise this may seem a very strange, obscure, niche question, but I find it interesting \\& I have not been able to find any real (public) history of any case where this has been so.  \n\nBefore you endeavour to answer, I must add some information:\nI realise that even if the material is inadmissible, as it may have been created by the prosecution/authorities or otherwise, they could use this material that they believe to be correct/accurate to find other evidence \u2013 I realise this and it is not the question.\nFurther to the above, I realise that said material could be so circumstantual a prosecution may argue it evident, i.e. the plaintext produced (with the \u2018correct\u2019 key the prosecution provides) contains an image with metadata \u2013 nevertheless this is covered under the same circumstance as the above, as of course this could have been engineered.\nI believe this question to be \u2018on\\-topic\u2019 and important/relevant as I do not believe it has been asked before here on stack\\-exchange, nor adequately answered/explored elsewhere.\nI also realise that the likelihood of authorities performing said \u2018exploit\u2019 is less likely than other exploits being performed, nevertheless the overarching point is the plaintext cannot ever actually be proved to be the actual plaintext. Anyway, I have already said that \u2013 my point here was that regardless if the authorities do not perform such exploit, it is a very real possibility that should material claimed to be plaintext ever be considered evidence, that other parties such as the prosecution (who will most likely have had access to examine/read/copy the hard drive for their own independent examination) would be able to perform such attack. Such attack would not be necessarily complex, though I\u2019m not saying it would be in any means easy (or computationally cheap), I am just saying it is entirely possible, and again the overarching point being it is impossible to prove the key is ever said key.\n\nAnd yes, I realise that a good prosecution could provide such circumstantual evidence, though in my belief circumstantual, such as:\nData y was stored by/accessed by defendant, we can prove this (though not actually prove its the key), we believe this is the key (because of a,b,c,) and hence this is the plaintext of the defendants hard drive, which is therefore incriminating.\n\nMY PRIOR RESEARCH:\nOf course without the key it is impossible to actually \u2018decrypt\u2019 said data (provided no key reuse), I know that authorities/prosecution wouldn\u2019t be able to \u2018decrypt\u2019 the hard drive if they didn\u2019t have the key. The point is, again to reiterate, that the very mathematical nature of this predicament further creates/also is the predicament that it is impossible to prove the data produced is actually the \u2018original\u2019 plaintext. Hence, given that the authorities cannot actually \u2018decrypt\u2019 the data without the key that is used, I would like to know if it is legally valid for them to say that they have done so in any case? \n\nI am asking this as I have researched and have not found any cases that are public, neither in the scenario/principle described, nor have I even found any that actually involve unbreakable \u2018one\\-time\\-pad\u2019 encryption. I ask this as again, if it were to be legally valid then it would enable anybody to perform some clever calculations to effectively invent incriminating evidence.\n\n<https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/10/uk_police_can_n.html>\nThe comments section of this page provides interesting discussion on the topic, of which is scarce generally. The comments seem to support the idea that any one\\-time\\-pad encryption scheme properly implemented makes all \u2018evidence\u2019 produced from said data inadmissable.\n\n[https://ifca.ai/pub/fc97/r4\\.pdf](https://ifca.ai/pub/fc97/r4.pdf)\n*\u201cIn 1995, it was finally divulged that the Rosenbergs, while attempting to use \u201cone\\-time pad\u201d encryption,infra, were careless in doing so, and didn\u2019t really use a one\\-time pad after all. This enabled the government to develop evidence that assisted in their conviction.\u201d*\nThe above quote from the linked paper also suggests that anything properly encrypted with a one\\-time\\-pad scheme is merely data, and that no admissible evidence can be produced. \n\nSo yes, a long question, maybe repetitive \\& lengthy, but I hope you can read through this as it is important to clarify. \n\n**A further DISCLAIMER:**\nPlease focus on the question, it is already long enough, I don\u2019t wish to write an entire text on the questions I am not asking. As a final clarification, the question above has been asked clearly, however niche you may think it there are valid concerns (as are shared by those in the comments linked). I realise that you could just have the key tortured out of you by a malicious entity, this is not the question nor it is relevant, this is long enough now so I conclude.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If it was for a criminal case, the jury would have to decide if they believed the person who claimed he/she cracked the code. \n\nReally, any evidence is interpreted by the jury if it is regarding facts. \n\n> 1\\) An issue of fact, not law.

In a criminal case, questions of fact are typically resolved by the jury. This includes assessing the credibility of witnesses and the strength of evidence presented. In this scenario, the jury would have to evaluate the claims made about the decryption process and decide whether they believe the person who claims to have cracked the code. While the mathematical properties of one-time pad encryption make it theoretically impossible to prove the correctness of a key, the legal system relies on the jury to make judgments about the believability and weight of evidence presented, rather than requiring absolute mathematical proof. Options A and D are incorrect because they assume automatic inadmissibility or require mathematical proof, which is not how the legal system typically operates.

The conditions of using the data from these areas are the same as the conditions on airline websites. I don't think that all these websites have licenses for such things. Examples are <http://www.azair.com/> or <https://en.surebet.com/surebets>. Both sites use data from dozens of sources and I find it hard to believe that they have licenses for all this.\n\nTo sum up, do you really need such licenses from each entity or are there any other solutions that allow to legally use this data in a price comparison engine?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the EU:\n\nIn [Ryanair Ltd v PR Aviation BV \\[2015]](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=161388&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=331775) the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) held that subject to national law the owner of a publicly accessible database is free to determine by contract the conditions of its use. In other words the owner is free to set the T\\&Cs and you must abide by them or not use the website.\n\nYou can ensure you don't infringe the rights of the data owner by obtaining their consent to the screen scraping and your intended uses of that data.\n\nI've checked several airline websites, they all explicitly forbid screen scraping and some suggest obtaining a licence from them for access to their APIs.\n\nAs for commercial use: you intend to use something for the purpose of making money from it.\n\nOther laws:\n\nIf you're merely scraping flight times and prices then its unlikely to engage copyright law.\n\nIn the UK, the Computer Misuse Act is so broadly written that screen scraping might constitute a criminal offence, depending on the circumstances.\n\nIn some cases courts have ruled that trespass extends to online activities, i.e. using a website without permission or using it after being asked to stop using it is trespass.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of screen scraping airline websites for price data in the European Union?\n\nA) Screen scraping is always legal as long as the data is publicly accessible on the airline's website.\n\nB) Screen scraping is permitted if the company doesn't generate direct income from the scraped data but only from advertising and partner programs.\n\nC) Screen scraping is legal as long as the company doesn't infringe on the airline's copyright of the price data.\n\nD) Screen scraping may be prohibited by the airline's terms and conditions, which are legally enforceable according to EU court rulings.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the Ryanair Ltd v PR Aviation BV [2015] case ruled by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), website owners are free to determine the conditions of use for their publicly accessible databases through their terms and conditions. These T&Cs are legally binding, and users must abide by them or not use the website. Most airline websites explicitly forbid screen scraping in their terms of service.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the public accessibility of data doesn't override the website's terms of use.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the method of generating income (direct or indirect) doesn't determine the legality of screen scraping. The website's terms of use are the determining factor.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while copyright infringement is a concern, it's not the primary legal issue in this case. The enforceability of the website's terms and conditions is the main legal consideration."

Could the accused use the fact that the US has ratified the 1967 protocol in defense, despite the fact that the protocol's protection against penalties for illegal entry is not explicit in US law?\n\nNote that there *is* explicit protection against prosecution for document fraud, seemingly motivated by the US ratification of the protocol, at [8 CFR 270\\.2(j)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/270.2#j):\n\n> (j) Declination to file charges for document fraud committed by refugees at the time of entry.\n> \n> \n> The Service shall not issue a Notice of Intent to Fine for acts of document fraud committed by an alien pursuant to direct departure from a country in which the alien has a well\\-founded fear of persecution or from which there is a significant danger that the alien would be returned to a country in which the alien would have a well\\-founded fear of persecution, provided that the alien has presented himself or herself without delay to an INS officer and shown good cause for his or her illegal entry or presence. Other acts of document fraud committed by such an alien may result in the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Fine and the imposition of civil money penalties.\n\nThis relates to [8 USC 1324c, Penalties for document fraud](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1324c). A similar provision related to 8 USC 1325(a) does not seem to exist.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Could the accused use the fact that the US has ratified the 1967\n>  protocol in defense, despite the fact that the protocol's protection\n>  against penalties for illegal entry is not explicit in US law?\n\n**Is The Protocol Self\\-Executing?**\n\nThere is one main potential difficulties with this particular defensive theory.\n\nMany international agreements are interpreted by the courts to be not \"self\\-executing\" which is to say that they are agreements to pass compliant domestic laws and policies, rather than directly creating rights for individuals. In contrast, if it is self\\-executing then it can be used as a defense. \n\nThe legal effect of the 1967 Refugee Protocol, \"Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees\", 19 U.S.T. 6223, 606 U.N.T.S. 267 (January 31, 1967\\), and in particular the question of whether it is self\\-executing is disputed, at least, academically. \n\nBut, a State Department legal opinion which has not clearly and explicitly been overruled by the courts, states that it is not self\\-executing, despite the fact that a lower Article I court in *In re Dunbar*, 141\\. \\& N. Dec. 310 (Board of Immigration Appeals 1973\\), had previously held that the Protocol was self\\-executing (despite ruling against the immigrant on the merits in interpreting the obligations created under the Protocol).\n\nThe issue was raised and not resolved in a case related to mass migration from Haiti during the George H.W. Bush administration, but that issue was not reached in the judgment in that case. This position was supported by a [1991 State Department legal memorandum](https://www.justice.gov/file/23326/download), which claimed that the 1967 protocol was not self\\-executing. A [law review article from 1993](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/997/) examined this issue rather comprehensively, questioning the conclusion of the State Department Memo. A [1997 law review article](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1154&context=bjil) argues that it does have binding effect but that the U.S. has erroneously failed to treat it that way in either the courts or in some of its administrative policies.\n\nThe thrust of the executive branch legal opinions and case law regarding the Protocol appears to be that it is not self\\-executing.\n\n**The Protocol As A Guide To Statutory Interpretation**\n\nOn the other hand, even though there is not an explicit U.S. law statute providing a defense to illegal entry, one could argue that since refugee status is recognized in the U.S. that the entry is not illegal. And, the Refugee Convention could definitely be used as evidence of legislative intent in interpreting the law to determine if U.S. law implicitly prohibits such a prosecution, in the face of the question of whether or not other legal authorization to give someone refugee status makes the entry not illegal. \n\nIn particular, \"it is absolutely clear that the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980 \\[Pub. L. No. 96\\-212, 94 Stat. 102] was intended to implement American obligations under the Protocol.\" (from a [2000 law review article](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=2482&context=articles)). For example, three of the leading cases interpreting the 1967 Protocol and the Refugee Act of 1980 (with a largely anti\\-immigrant outcome on the merits) are *[INS v.Aguirre\\-Aguirre](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/526/415/)*, 119 S. Ct. 1439 (1999\\) and *INS v. Cardoza\\-Fonseca*, 480 U. S. 421 (1987\\), and *INS v. Stevic*, 467 U.S. 407 (1984\\) (limiting refugee litigation rights), still purported to interpret the Refugee Act of 1980 in light of the fact that it was intended to implement the Protocol.\n\nIn addition to the Refugee Convention, the long standing practice (until the current administration) of neither immediately deporting nor prosecuting people who claim refugee status for illegal entry would also argue in favor of this interpretation. \n\nAn agency's historical and traditional custom and practice in applying a law is an important part of interpreting laws in which the agency, at the outset, has considerable discretion to resolve ambiguities regarding its meaning, although existing policies and positions of the agency are also entitled to deference.\n\nFurthermore, when Congress amends a law, it is presumed to know the way that the law is currently being interpreted by the Executive Branch and the Courts, and to ratify those positions if they are not changed.\n\n**Practical Issues**\n\nAny argument referencing the Refugee Protocol would also have to establish under the currently applied precedents that the purported refugee has, or at least is likely to have, a well founded fear of persecution in the country from which they are fleeing. Likewise, the refugee would have to prove that exceptions to the general rule (e.g. national defense and prohibitions on alien non\\-political criminals) do not apply.",

It can be used as evidence of legislative intent in interpreting US refugee laws, particularly the Refugee Act of 1980, which was intended to implement US obligations under the Protocol. This interpretation strategy has been used in Supreme Court cases like INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca. Additionally, historical practices of not prosecuting asylum seekers for illegal entry could support this interpretation. However, the defense would still need to establish that the defendant has a well-founded fear of persecution and that no exceptions to refugee protections apply."

If there is no written agreement, just a verbal contract and exchange of money for truck, you may be able to enforce the contract in regular court.

Or, suppose that additional elections produced Senate majorities of a different party than the President, such as a continuation of the 2016 arrangement. Could the Senate simply decide to stop confirming Presidential nominees to be judges on the Supreme Court, even after there are no judges left on the Supreme Court? If not, why not? \n\nIf unclear, absent a Supreme Court to authoritatively interpret the constitution, who would decide the answer? \n\n*While we would hope the \"no judges remaining\" would take a while, a disaster or major attack could cause such a situation to arise within a short period.*\n\nIf so, this would be an interesting twist in constitutional law, that the Founding Fathers may not have considered. \n\n---\n\n[Article II, Section 2, of the US Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section2) states:\n\n> \\[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law\\[.]\n\n*A separate question about if the President could do something similar is [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7189/could-the-president-abolish-the-supreme-court); they seem separate because of the stronger duty to nominate (\"shall\") imposed on the President.*\n\n*Could* is intended to refer to *legally could;* political feasibility considerations would be at [Politics](http://politics.stackexchange.com), not Law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the Senate took the extreme measure of attempting to abolish the Supreme Court, there's nothing in the Constitution that requires them to confirm any of the President's nominees. However, attempting to dismantle one of the three branches would be nothing short of a coup d'etat.\n\nThe president has some options here:\n\n> He \\[the President] may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses \\[of Congress], or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper. \\-\\- Article 2, Sec. 3\n\nBasically, this means that, in an extraordinary circumstance (total defiance of the entire Senate would easily qualify), the President can lock the Senate in their chamber until they straighten their heads out. And when I say \"lock them in\", I don't mean that figuratively. The Constitution requires that a majority of each house be present to constitute a quorum to do business. The President could order up to 51 Senators to convene, and if they refused, could order the FBI or whoever to physically arrest them and drag them to the capitol building. This was actually done in Wisconsin by Gov. Scott Walker in 2011 when 14 Democrat Senators fled the state to avoid the quorum needed to vote on a controversial bill that they couldn't block. It would be messy for sure, and as far as I know, has never been done with the U.S. Senate. But there is precedent for it.\n\nAdditionally, the President could use his vacancy power and just appoint a justice. Legally, he would have to wait for the Senate to be in recess, and the Senate would likely arrange things so that never happens. However, if there were no justices left, he could just appoint a Chief Justice (the Constitution provides that there be at least one justice). Even if he did this in the most \"in\\-your\\-face\" illegal way, with both middle fingers extended, the only judge that can tell him he did wrong is the guy he just seated. Of course, the Senate would move to impeach that judge, and probably the President too for having appointed him illegally, but you need a supermajority of both houses to remove them from office. If you had such a supermajority, then the game is over at this point; there's no way the President would step down in such a situation (who would force him?) and we're in a civil war because we don't have a functional government anymore.\n\nIn reality, this isn't an \"interesting twist in constitutional law that the Founding Fathers may not have considered.\" It's that if Congress ever went totally off the rails like that, the President, or the people would have to step up and hope they could end the standoff peacefully without resorting to violence, because this is the kind of thing that revolutions are fought over.",

Simply being wrong is not in and of itself enough to give rise to either civil or criminal legal liability.

A copyright notice, if present, may specify a pseudonym, a business name, or a form of the author's name other than his or her legal name. The validity of the copyright does not depend on the name in the notice. This is true in all Berne Convention countries.\n\nEven under the 1909 US copyright law, when a notice **was** required for protection, the exact form of the name used was not important, and pseudonyms and variant forms were permitted, as well as DBA names, which might not be easy to associate with the actual copyright holder. Nor do I know of any other country in which an error in the name in the notice would invalidate the copyright.\n\nAside from people changing names, a copyright can be sold or otherwise transferred. This does not require changing the copyright notice to reflect the changed ownership of the copyright, although it is often done with new versions or printings. The name on a copyright notice is at best suggestive or helpful; it does not define the owner.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer, Jane Doe, released a program under the name \"JD Software\" in 2010 with a copyright notice. In 2015, she legally changed her name to Jane Smith and sold the rights to the software to a company called TechCorp. In 2022, a dispute arises over the copyright of the software. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright status of the software?\n\nA) The copyright is invalid because the name on the original notice no longer matches the developer's legal name.\nB) The copyright is still valid, but only under the name Jane Doe, requiring a formal update to reflect the name change.\nC) The copyright is no longer valid because it was sold to TechCorp, who didn't update the copyright notice.\nD) The copyright remains valid and enforceable, regardless of the name change and transfer of ownership.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, the validity of a copyright does not depend on the name in the notice. Even if the author changes their name or the copyright is transferred to another entity, the copyright remains valid and enforceable. The copyright notice is not required to be updated to reflect changes in ownership or the author's name, although it may be helpful to do so. The name on a copyright notice is suggestive or helpful but does not define the owner. Therefore, despite Jane's name change and the sale of rights to TechCorp, the original copyright remains valid and enforceable."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under German law, what is the most likely legal outcome for a job applicant who witnessed an accidental exposure of an interviewer's naked body during a remote interview?\n\nA) The applicant can sue for emotional distress and receive monetary compensation\nB) The applicant has grounds to demand the job position as compensation\nC) The applicant can file a criminal complaint for indecent exposure\nD) The applicant has no legal grounds for compensation or action\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Based on the information provided, the correct answer is D. The accidental exposure during a remote interview, while potentially uncomfortable, does not provide legal grounds for compensation or action under German law. There was no contract between the applicant and the employer regarding the interview process, so the time and effort spent cannot be compensated. Additionally, the incident does not appear to meet the threshold for actionable conduct such as sexual harassment or intentional indecent exposure. Without evidence of intentional misconduct or significant trauma, the applicant likely has no legal recourse in this situation."

Carl Orff, Carmina Burana, O Fortuna \\- Fortune plango vulnera\n3. Shostakovich, Symphony No. 5 \\- Finale\n4. Gustav Holst, The Planets \\- Mars, the Bringer of War\n\nWhich options do I have, in order to do it legally, provided that \n\n1. my product will be sold primarily via American Amazon store (hence, I must design the ad so that it complies with US laws) and\n2. I need the ability to legally remix the record (i. e. cut out pieces of it, make it shorter)\n\n?\n\nFrom my point of view, I can do in several ways:\n\n1. Purchase the rights from the performers (e. g. some orchestra) to use one of their records in a commercial.\n2. Sign a \"work\\-for\\-hire\" contract with a musician. He or she will play that piece of music and the rights for the record will belong to me.\n3. Use a record in public domain.\n\nAll these options theoretically give me the rights for the **recording** (audio version of the work). But I'm not sure if the copyright holders of the notes/score version of that music (e. g. relatives of R. Wagner, C. Orff, D. Shostakovich and G. Holst) can't sue me for copyright infringement (or do any other legal action).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright expires 70 years after the original writer breaths his/her last breath, after that it becomes public domain. And all works published before 1923 are in the public domain in the US.\n\nThis means that the inheritors of the rights cannot sue you for infringement because there is nothing to infringe.\n\nIf the music is not in public domain you will need to contact the rights holders and negotiate the rights to use the music. This can also be a company that has the right to sublicense the content to others. This is often the way radios and DJs get the right for the music they play.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A filmmaker wants to use a portion of Gustav Holst's \"The Planets - Mars, the Bringer of War\" in a commercial for their upcoming documentary. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal use of this piece in the United States?\n\nA) The filmmaker needs to purchase rights only from the orchestra that performed the specific recording they want to use.\n\nB) The filmmaker must obtain permission from both the orchestra and Holst's estate to use the music legally.\n\nC) The filmmaker can freely use any recording of the piece without permission, as it is in the public domain.\n\nD) The filmmaker needs to obtain permission from the orchestra for the recording, but not from Holst's estate for the composition.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Gustav Holst died in 1934, which means his compositions entered the public domain in 2005 (70 years after his death). Therefore, the filmmaker doesn't need permission from Holst's estate to use the musical composition. However, the recording of the piece is separate from the composition itself. If the filmmaker wants to use a specific recording, they would need to obtain permission from the orchestra or record label that owns the rights to that particular performance. This scenario illustrates the distinction between copyright for musical compositions and sound recordings, which are protected separately under copyright law."

Someone suggested that one of the stock companies instead of paying me dividends bought me that stock. How can I find out if this is what happened and if so, if a stock company has the right to do that, without even asking for my permission?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not uncommon for a company to issue additional shares to shareholders instead of paying a cash dividend. This is known as a \"stock dividend\". Such payment may (less commonly) be in shares of another, often related, company. If that is the source of the stock in question there is nothing illegal about it.\n\nYour broker should have a record of your transactions and whether any stock came from a stock dividend or some other source.\n\nAccordion to the Investopedia article on [\"Stock Dividend\"](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockdividend.asp):\n\n> Also known as a \"scrip dividend,\" a stock dividend is a distribution of shares to existing shareholders in lieu of a cash dividend. This type of dividend may be made when a company wants to reward its investors but doesn't have the spare cash or wants to preserve its cash for other investments.\n> \n> \n> Stock dividends have a tax advantage for the investor. The share dividend, like any stock share, is not taxed until the investor sells it unless the company offers the option of taking the dividend as cash or in stock.\n> \n> \n> A stock dividend may require that the newly received shares are not to be sold for a certain period of time. This holding period on a stock dividend typically begins the day after it is purchased. Understanding the holding period is important for determining qualified dividend tax treatment.\n\nThe Wikip\\[edia article [\"Dividend\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend#Forms_of_payment) says:\n\n> Stock or scrip dividends are those paid out in the form of additional shares of the issuing corporation, **or another corporation** (such as its subsidiary corporation). They are usually issued in proportion to shares owned (for example, for every 100 shares of stock owned, a 5% stock dividend will yield 5 extra shares). (*emphasis added*)\n\nSo dividends payed in the stock of another company are perfectly possible, although less common.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A retail investor notices an unfamiliar stock in their portfolio that they don't remember purchasing. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this occurrence?\n\nA) The brokerage firm made an error and accidentally added the wrong stock to the investor's account.\nB) The investor received a stock dividend from one of their existing investments, possibly in the form of shares from a different company.\nC) The stock exchange randomly distributes free shares to investors to encourage market participation.\nD) The investor's account was hacked, and the intruder purchased an unauthorized stock.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most likely explanation for the unfamiliar stock is that the investor received a stock dividend. As explained in the documentation, companies may issue additional shares to shareholders instead of paying cash dividends. This is known as a \"stock dividend\" or \"scrip dividend.\" While it's more common for companies to issue their own shares as dividends, it's also possible, though less frequent, for them to distribute shares of another, often related, company. This practice is legal and doesn't require the shareholder's explicit permission. The investor should check with their broker to confirm the source of the new stock, as brokers maintain records of all transactions, including stock dividends."
