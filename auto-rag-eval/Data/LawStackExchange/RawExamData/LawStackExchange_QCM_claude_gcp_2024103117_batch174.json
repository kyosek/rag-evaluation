(attribution, non\\-commercial, same license for derivatives) I really like what it does, but I'll have to modify it a bit to fit my goals.\n\nNot sure how much of this paragraph is relevant, but it's an electronic circuit that uses the wrong shape board for what I'm doing, so I'll need to rearrange the same parts to make it fit around my other stuff while keeping the same connections between them. I'll also remove some auxiliary features that I don't need and add some that I do, but the core functionality is unchanged, including the software/firmware for one of the chips that does that core function.\n\nNone of that is a problem, as I understand, as a hobbyist and no more. And if I were to publish my version, I'd have to use the same license and refer back to the original. That's fine too...as a hobbyist and no more.\n\n---\n\nBut I also see the potential to produce and sell copies of my finished product that includes (among many other things) the core functionality of that CC\\-NC project. So how far does the \"non\\-commercial\" restriction reach? And what do I need to do now, before I start, to avoid violating it?\n\n* Does it make a difference whether I copy the original files and modify them, vs. re\\-creating my version from scratch having seen and understood the original?\n* What about permanently embedding it, vs. keeping it modular/removable?  \n\n(The original can't be made to fit if I wanted to. It must be my version or equivalent.)\n* This original does not offer a manufactured version. The expectation is that a user will take the design files and send them to their favorite manufacturer, which would be grossly unreasonable for my customers to do. So even if I were to release my derivative version per the original license, I would still have to include the manufacturing step on my side of the deal.  \n\nDoes ownership make it okay to sell my version as a manufactured product? I understand that my design files would have to be publicly available under CC BY\\-NC\\-SA per the original license that I received it under, but I own this derivative version and can therefore do what I want with it, including what would otherwise violate the license if I didn't own it. Is that true?  \n\n(I'd be okay with my design files being public like that; a few people might make their own instead of buying from me, but not many.

If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third\\-party notices normally appear.\n\nSo if whoever is reusing your software is distributing the source code but without your name and copyright notice, it would seem that they are violating the license.\n\nYou mention a README file, but do not mention the NOTICE file which is listed in the Apache license. If you included a NOTICE file, and your software, or a modified version based on your software, is being distributed in object code form (only) without either a NOTICE file listing you, or a visible display by the program listing you, it would seem that they are violating the license.\n\nThe license specifically mentions a NOTICE file. It is not clear that attributions or restrictions in a README file will have the same effect. I would suggest that you add a NOTICE file to your distribution (if you did not already have one), and include one in any future distributions under this license.\n\nIf someone distributes a modified version of your software in object code format only, and you did not include a NOTICE file, it is not clear to me that the creator of the modified version must include **any** credit to you. However, the modified files must include a statement that they were modified from the original, and indicate who did so. Absence of that statement would also seem to be a violation of the license.\n\nIf it seems that the license has been violated, AND if you know or can find out who is distributing the modified version, you can send a letter (or email or other communication) indicating that the modified software is derived from your work, and should carry attribution to you. You could request or demand that they stop distributing copies that do not carry proper attribution. You may want to ask a lawyer to draft or review any such letter.\n\nIf the modified software is posted on a site subject to US law, you could send a DMCA takedown notice about the issue. This is fairly simple, and should not require a lawyer. However, if the other party files a counter\\-notice, the site could put the software back up if, after 10 days, you haven't filed a copyright infringement suit. Some sites restore challenged content quickly if a counter notice is filed, some just ignore counter\\-notices.\n\nUltimately, if the person does not restore proper credit voluntarily, and if a takedown is not available, or doesn't get the results you want, you would need to file a copyright infringement suit. To do this you would want to be sure that you have a good case. You would need to consider upfront costs and requirements, and possible damages should you win, to decide if it makes sense to file suit. Often it does **not** make economic sense. I would urge you to consult with a lawyer experienced in copyright issues before making a decision to file suit. Such a lawyer could help you estimate your chances of success, and the probable award if you win the suit. (Note that if all you are seeking is attribution, available damages may be limited, unless you can prove that lack of attribution harms you in a specific, economic way.) Such a lawyer could advise on needed pre\\-requisites (if you are in the US, you may need to register the work before filing suit). Such a lawyer could advise on what evidence would be needed to win, and how good or bad any evidence you have is.

The judge's action of putting the defendant under oath before a closing statement is indeed unusual and not customary in legal proceedings. However, it could potentially benefit the defendant. By placing the defendant under oath, the judge creates a situation where the content of the closing statement can be considered as evidence, which would not be possible otherwise. This allows the judge to weigh the defendant's statements against other evidence when making a ruling.

But the emphasis on force or threat of force, and lack of consent is much the same.\n\nSo it seems that under Maryland law, at least, the situation described in the question would not be legally \"rape\" nor a \"sexual offense\".\n\nMaryland Criminal code [\u00a7 11\\-301](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2018/criminal-law/title-11/subtitle-3/section-11-301/) (2018\\) defines prostitution in subsection (c) which reads:\n\n> (c) Prostitution. \\-\\- \"Prostitution\" means the performance of a sexual act, sexual contact, or vaginal intercourse for hire.\n\nWhether the provision of food, shelter, and protection by one person to another in return for sex would be considered \"for hire\" is arguable.

The dissolution of the original publishing company doesn't nullify the copyright; the rights would have been transferred to another entity. The artist needs to trace the current copyright holder, possibly through investigating what happened to Vincent Stuart Publishers Limited's assets.

This policy serves as an anti-corruption measure, preventing situations where the issuer might be tempted to accept bribes to withdraw tickets.

Nation Enterprises*, 471 U.S. 539 (1985\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_%26_Row_v._Nation_Enterprises) The US Supreme Court held that quotes amounting to about 3\\-400 words from a 500\\-page book were an infringement, and were not a fair use, because they were the \"heart of the book\".\n\nThe linked article says that one should ask \"Was the work obtained from a legal source, in a lawful manner?\" and asserts that \"taking a copy from an unapproved source invalidates fair use.\" Nothing in 17 USC 107 says this, and I don't know of any authoritative source for such a statement. The article also says that \"Commercial, for\\-profit use is not fair use, while commentary or criticism may be.\" This is simply incorrect. While a commercial purpose tends to weigh against fair use, it does not preclude it, and commercial use has been held to be fair use in some cases. Even in the case of *Harper \\& Row v. Nation Enterprises* linked above, fair use was seriously considered, and was not denied simply because the use was commercial. No one o0f the four fair use factors is final taken alone. I do not think the linked article is a reliable guide to US copyright law.\n\nIn the case described by the question, an unreleased game has been distributed without authorization over the internet, and reviews written based on that unauthorized copy. Whoever copied the game committed copyright infringement, but a suit might not provide substantial damages unless actual economic harm could be demonstrated. (And, of course, the identity of the infringer would need to be proved.) But a review based on such a leaked copy would not necessarily be an infringement. If the review described the game, but did not quote any of its dialog or other text, and did not reproduce any sounds or images from the game, there would be no infringement. If the review did quote from the unauthorized copy, the usual fair use analysis would apply. The fact that the copy had been unauthorized would not determine the outcome.\n\nFair use is defined by [17 USC 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107). This provides:\n\n> Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use\n> of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or\n> phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for\n> purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching\n> (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or\n> research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether\n> the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the\n> factors to be considered shall include\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use\n> is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to\n> the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n> \n> \n> (4\\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of\n> the copyrighted work.\n> \n> \n> The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of\n> fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above\n> factors.\n\nNote that criticism is one of the specified purposes for which fair use is designed, and an unpublished work is still subject to fair use. If the review quoted so much of the game that the potential market for it was harmed, that would weigh against fair use, but it is hard for me to see how a mere review could do that to an interactive game.\n\n(17 USC 107(4\\)) is normally applied when an infringing copy serves as a replacement for the authorized version, and sales are lost as a result. I suppose it might be argued that a bad review that was a direct result of an infringement came under this provision, but it is a strech at best, and US First Amendment considerations would tend to prevent such a ruling.\n\nIn short, it seems unlikely that any normal review would be an infringement, and that the game was leaked would not make it one.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A video game developer's unreleased game is leaked on the internet.

The [War Powers Resolution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-33) limits his ability to engage unilaterally in military action, by requiring him to report to Congress within 48 hours, and if Congress disapproves, troops must be removed after 60 days. However, this law pertains to armed forces, and would not apply to remotely\\-launched missiles. Additionally, it is unknown if the resolution is unconstitutional (presidents say it is).

Having them move in might cause both you and your roommate to be evicted.\n\nYou probably don't have any rights to sue your roommate until actual damages occur (in other words, *after* you've already been evicted).

However, transactions involving gold bullion that exceed $10,000 per transferee per year must be reported to the IRS, as gold is considered a collectible cash substitute.

The case shows that even when a person uses an illegal firearm in self-defense, they may still face charges related to the weapon's possession, but murder charges can be dropped if self-defense is established. Option A is incorrect because murder charges are not automatic when an illegal weapon is used in self-defense.

Section 5103 provides that \"United States coins and currency . . . are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.\" None of the cases cited by plaintiff stands for the proposition that \u00a7 5103 requires a local government (or any other entity) to accept payment in cash, and no court has so held.\n\nThe refusal by governments to accept pennies (or any other small denomination) has withstood challenge [multiple times](https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer-protection/it-legal-refuse-cash-payment). 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103 does not create a requirement to accept cash.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A city government in the United States imposes a $500 fine for a certain violation. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the payment of this fine?\n\nA) The city government must accept payment in any form of U.S. currency, including 50,000 pennies, as it is a governmental body.\n\nB) The city government can refuse payment in coins but must accept paper currency as it is legal tender.\n\nC) The city government can place reasonable restrictions on the form of payment, including refusing large amounts of coins or cash entirely.\n\nD) The city government must accept all forms of legal tender, but can charge an additional processing fee for unusual payment methods.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to case law and legal interpretations, governmental bodies in the United States can place reasonable restrictions on the form of payment they accept, even for public debts like fines. This includes the ability to refuse payment in large amounts of coins or to exclude cash payments entirely. The concept of \"legal tender\" as defined in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103 does not create a requirement for governments to accept all forms of cash or coins. Cases like Picano v Borough of Emerson have upheld the right of local governments to impose such restrictions. \n\nOption A is incorrect because governments are not required to accept all forms of currency. Option B is also wrong as governments can refuse both coins and paper currency. Option D is incorrect because while governments can restrict payment methods, they cannot arbitrarily charge extra fees for legal tender. The correct answer reflects the legal reality that governments can set reasonable payment policies."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15753/what-statutes-if-any-would-make-it-illegal-to-publish-exact-steps-to-exploit-a", "docs_id": 15753, "title": "What statutes (if any) would make it illegal to publish exact steps to exploit a network vulnerability?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's hypothesize that John Doe, who lives in the United States, has discovered a large\\-scale vulnerability in the networks of a major industry, using legal means.

Would any whistleblowing statues protect this action?\n\nFurthermore, would John be liable if he published open\\-source software that could be used maliciously in this manner?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, you can publish what you want, thanks to the First Amendment. You would indeed expect there to be technical discussion of computer vulnerabilities, once they are discovered (you don't always get what you expect, though). Doe might be contractually required to not divulge information about the company (he signed an NDA with Acme). If Doe is working for the company now, they could fire him (for no reason, or for having embarrassed them). If Doe is just some guy off the street who figures out this bug in the network, then Acme doesn't have much recourse. \n\n\"Whistle\\-blower\" protection might prevent Acme from retaliating (e.g. firing Doe) if he is exposing \"gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety\". On the face of it, having a vulnerable network is not covered by such whistle\\-blower protections, although you never know how the courts will react to a clever argument.\n\nA specific exception to the general right to publish whatever you want comes from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, [17 USC 1201](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201), which prohibits disseminating technology for circumventing copyright protection. Trade secret law would not easily silence Doe if he learned of the flaw legally, but it might in the long run be a way to prevent exposure. In order for trade secret law to be applicable, under the normal understanding of a trade secret, the information would have to be something that gives a company an advantage over the competition, and having a vulnerability doesn't exactly give a company an advantage. However... apparently, [Blackboard](https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/689) went after a couple of folks who discovered a flaw: keeping a vulnerability secret does give a company a kind of advantage. This case was settled so we don't learn anything broadly applicable, except that if you annoy a company, they will try to bury you alive.\n\nIf you figure out an exploit and publish it to hackers, that would be aiding and abetting, the key concept being that you know you are helping someone break the law. However, you could publish these results in some general forum and that would not be aiding and abetting, even though criminals as well as security experts might read about this vulnerability in that venue.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John Doe, a cybersecurity researcher in the United States, discovers a significant vulnerability in a major industry's networks using legal means.

While the First Amendment generally protects John's right to publish his findings, there are potential legal complexities:\n\n1. If John signed an NDA or works for the affected company, he could face contractual or employment consequences.\n2. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act could be relevant if the vulnerability involves circumventing copyright protection systems.\n3. Trade secret laws might be invoked, although their applicability in this case is questionable.\n4.

They merely needed to be placed outside, on or near the driveway. Garbagemen drove motorized scooters (like the [Westcoast Mailster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westcoaster_Mailster), but with an open hopper on the back) up driveways, got out, dumped the garbage into the hopper, and then drove off to the next house. (Eventually the scooters would transfer their load to a full\\-sized garbage truck.)

Is there a form of company like an LLC that's straight forward to file that will allow it to be employee owned?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most limited liability companies (LLCs) are small, closely held firms that are owned entirely or in substantial part by active employee\\-manager\\-owners with modest capital contributions.\n\nLLCs with large numbers of owners typically have a large share of non\\-employee investor ownership and are most common in oil and gas firms and in real estate firms that either develop, or buy and hold, real estate.\n\nMost large accounting and law firms and many other professional service firms are organized as LLCs or LLP (limited liability partnerships), which are owned by the senior employees whose contributions as employees dwarfs their contributions as investors.

These are the largest firms in the world with significant employee ownership.

Some people claim that they are a form of indentured servitude and that this is illegal in the US.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a reason these are commonly called \"TRAP\"s (**T**raining **R**epayment **A**greement **P**rovision). These agreements don't just protect the employer from paying for training that an employee can use elsewhere. These agreements frequently act to \"trap\" the employee in difficult employment circumstances where the employer can demand long hours and excessive dedication in difficult jobs for little pay, knowing that if the employee tries to leave, they could face a substantial financial burden.\n\nThese agreements are generally legal, provided they are executed in good faith.\nHowever, certain circumstances have been used to void the agreements.\n\nIn particular:\n--------------\n\n* If the cost or value of the the training is vastly overstated, so the training actually provides minimal value to the employee, but has a disproportionately large repayment cost that only benefit the employer.\n* If the term of the agreement is excessively long (typically, more than 1 year). Training is unlikely to be so valuable and specialized that the employee would need years to repay the benefits. (Certain exceptions apply, such as for advanced engineering work or specialized skills like airline pilots)\n* If the \"training\" doesn't actually have much value; if the training is just company propaganda and policies, rather than job specific skills, repayment costs are unlikely to hold up in a dispute.\n* If the employee already has demonstrated skills before the training, then forcing them into unnecessary training just for a TRAP contract is unlikely to be supported. For example, someone with years of skilled electrical design work probably cannot be forced to repay thousands of dollars of \"training\" for a few weeks of basic electrical refresher courses.\n\nBasically, if the training isn't valuable to the employee and the cost isn't reasonable for the training, the TRAP line can frequently be voided. Yet doing so almost always requires mediation or a suit, which are also expensive, time consuming, and have uncertain outcomes.\n\nIts best for a prospective employee to call out a TRAP provision as a red flag before accepting an offer, and avoid it if at all possible unless they truly believe they'll benefit from the training, intend to stay the full term, and understand the employer might use the cost as a way to expect more from them or hold back their professional advancement.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company offers new employees a training program in advanced machine learning techniques.

So, who is bound by the first?\n\nWell, corporations can only act through agents and agency law tells us that an agent who purportedly acts for a non\\-existent principal is actually acting on their own behalf. So, the person(s) who signed for Company X on the first contract are personally bound to the contract.\n\nUnless they explicitly told Company Y that they wouldn\u2019t be.

The first contract, signed before Company Z was incorporated, is not binding on the company itself. However, the individual(s) who signed on behalf of the non-existent company at that time can be held personally liable for that contract. The second contract, signed after incorporation, is valid and enforceable against Company Z.

This probably confuses matters but if you are to search for more answers this could be a good place to start.\n\nOne of the elements of common law assault is that the threat must be able to be carried out immediately; it must be imminent. I do not have a cite for this but I recall that this means that conditional threats are excluded from assault. So calling a politician on the phone and telling them that if they do not drop out of a race you will hurt them is not assault. So, \"*You cut that out now or you\u2019ll go home in an ambulance*\" sounds a lot like, \"stop or you will get hurt.\" The victim has the opportunity to avoid the danger; the threat is not imminent. But the facts here are interesting because the speaker touched the victim while speaking which might mean fear of imminent was real. But they were in a crowded room in front of cameras \\- could the victim really feel that threat was imminent? Plus, the \"you will go home\" implies a future harm. Oh, and the speaker does not say \"I will hurt you,\" maybe she was actually trying to protect the victim from someone else's actions.

The legal interpretation of conditional threats in assault cases is nuanced and depends on several factors. Generally, conditional threats are not considered assault because they lack the element of imminent danger, which is a key component of assault in common law. The threat must be able to be carried out immediately for it to constitute assault.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overgeneralizes. Not all conditional threats are considered assault; many factors are considered.\n\nOption B is too absolute. While conditional threats often do not constitute assault, there may be circumstances where they do if the threat is imminent and unavoidable.\n\nOption C is misleading. While physical contact can be a factor, it doesn't automatically make a conditional threat assault if other elements (like imminence of danger) are missing.\n\nOption D correctly captures the nuanced approach courts take. Conditional threats generally don't constitute assault, but could if there's clear and imminent danger that the victim can't easily avoid. This aligns with the principle that the threat must be imminent and the victim must reasonably fear immediate harm for it to be considered assault."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64151/open-release-of-a-personal-attorney-email-to-a-school-board", "docs_id": 64151, "title": "Open release of a personal attorney email to a school board", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A school board gets an email from superintendent's personal attorney restricting questioning of the superintendent.
