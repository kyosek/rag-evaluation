The assets were sold prior to my moms death and placed in a DA Davidson account to manage will she lived in assisted living. My sister is the executor of the will, giving her control of the the estate and accounts. After my moms passing her DA Davidson account was closed and another DA Davidson account was opened in my sisters name with a tax ID number instead of my moms social security number. The new account doesn\u2019t show the previously closed account history. I want to be able to review it for myself but my sister isn\u2019t being very forthcoming which leads me to believe she may have something to hide. \n\nBoth accounts have her name on them giving her access, but being that I an one of the beneficiaries who is willed a equal portion of the inheritance does that give me any legal right to review the account information for myself or do I have to rely solely on the documents provided by the executor? \n\nIf legally they are not required to give me the login and password is there another way to get the information, can I force them to add me to the account or is there a way that I can acquire the official account history from DADavidson that doesn\u2019t involve the executor sending them to me? I just want to make sure I am getting the full picture. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: They are probably prohibited from complying with your requests, since you are not \"on the account\" (and that is as far as they can inquire). That is, under the law, a financial firm does not make a legal determination regarding your rights to some part of the estate. There are many financial privacy laws that prevent institutions from dispensing private financial information, for example, I cannot get access to your bank records based on the fact (let us assume it were a fact) that I am your cousin, or that you have power of attorney to manage my mother's affairs. If we have a joint account, then I have an equal right to the account, but otherwise, the law protects the privacy of a person's financial records.\n\nThe only way to legally get the information you are interested in is to politely request it from the person who owns the account, or else to get a court order to compel such an accounting. I don't think there is a way to sue the institution to compel disclosure in this situation and leave the executor out of the matter, rather you have to sue the executor alleging a wrong\\-doing (the point being that you want to subpoena the records, and a court will not issue a subpoena just because you are curious: there has to be an actual court case)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a situation where an individual is a beneficiary of an estate but not the executor, what is the correct legal approach to obtain detailed financial information about the estate's accounts?\n\nA) Directly contact the financial institution and request access to the account information, citing beneficiary status\nB) Sue the financial institution to compel disclosure of the account details\nC) Politely request the information from the executor, or if unsuccessful, seek a court order to compel an accounting\nD) Demand that the financial institution add the beneficiary to the account for full access\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because financial institutions are bound by privacy laws and cannot disclose information to individuals not listed on the account, regardless of beneficiary status.\nB) is incorrect as there is no legal basis to sue the financial institution directly in this situation.

The American Bar Association explicitly states that lawyers should work to ensure equal access to justice, especially for those facing economic or social barriers. The example of John Adams defending British soldiers in the Boston Massacre case illustrates that lawyers have a professional duty to represent even unpopular causes or clients who may face powerful opposition. While it's acknowledged that individual lawyers might be reluctant, the profession as a whole should not allow a situation where no lawyer is willing to take on a case due to threats from a powerful entity.

Even though the driver violated traffic laws by not stopping for a pedestrian in a crosswalk, this does not give the pedestrian the right to damage the vehicle. The law does not favor either party in this situation, and both the driver and the pedestrian could potentially face charges for their respective actions.

Anyone (as an individual or a group who conspires) who commits a crime can be indicted. (But, it's a fantasy to think that millions would be indicted as part of a conspiracy.)\n\nThe reason many people are not indicted for crimes is because they are not caught by law enforcement (LE) or because of the lack of the sheer numbers of LE required to pursue all criminals. And, if criminals are caught, the reason they may or may not be indicted is either prosecutorial discretion, i.e., a prosecutor decides not to indict because the crime isn't very serious. Or, probably much more relevant, is that there simply are not enough personnel in a county or state attorney's office to prosecute everyone who could be indicted. Prosecutors must oftentimes make decisions on who to indict and consider their available time, the seriousness of the crime, the available evidence and the possibilities of the success of their indictments.\n\nAnd, of course, politics sometimes comes into play; prosecutors may or may not pursue indictments because of political expediency, i.e. deporting an model citizen who also happens to be in the country illegally. But political pressure can work both ways, for and against prosecutorial discretion. Depending on your persuasion, it's either a bug or a feature in our legal system. But political influence and public opinion can also lead to changes in the legal system, as it is the representational branch of our governmental system that legislates the laws that the judicial system uses and enforces. If enough criminals are not indicted for a particular crime, and social or political pressure comes to bear, chances are good the legislative branch will take action.

So you could easily have a copyright suit by the photographer, or subjects in the case of a work for hire, if you copy those pictures. Their likenesses are additional protected by various laws regarding [\"personality rights\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights#United_States). The specific details vary according to jurisdiction, but you might easily get sued in California (full of celebrities), which has strong laws against the exploitation of images without permission.

The photographer (or the entity that commissioned the work) holds these rights, regardless of whether the celebrities posted the images publicly.\n\n2.

UK law enforcement cannot directly enforce RIPA 2000 on companies outside the UK, as the law is not extraterritorial.

This process involves specifying what information is needed, and it's up to the receiving jurisdiction to decide how to proceed. The company would then be legally obliged to comply with the resulting court order from their jurisdiction. Options A and D are incorrect because RIPA 2000 cannot be enforced on foreign companies.

What right, if any, does the online retailer have to repudiate the apparent deal? After all, didn\u2019t it make an offer to sell at a particular price that became a binding obligation when the buyer accepted the offer by tendering the purchase price?\n\n...\n\n> In the first instance, there may or may not have been a binding offer and acceptance. Contracts 101 teaches that whether a communication from one party to another constitutes an actionable offer, as distinguished from mere preliminary communications or an invitation to make an offer, is a fact\\-intensive inquiry, looking at all the circumstances.\n\n...\n\n> Some online retailers have adopted website terms and conditions that attempt to overcome such uncertainties by explicitly characterizing the customer\u2019s order as the offer, thereby leaving the retailer free to reject it for any reason, including because the advertised price was erroneous. Others simply reserve the right to cancel orders, either for any reason or specifically where the posted price was erroneous. In addition, even absent such contractual hedges, under the common law doctrine of unilateral mistake of fact, a contract is voidable if its enforcement despite one party\u2019s mistake regarding a material term such as price would be \u201cunconscionable\u201d or if the other party \u201chad reason to know of the mistake . . . .\u201d Thus, at least where a posted price is so egregiously low\u2014or, in Razor\u2019s case, a coupon so dramatically over\\-generous\u2014that a reasonable consumer would suspect it is a mistake, this doctrine would entitle the retailer to repudiate the contract.\n> \n> \n> On the other hand, none of these safeguards is necessarily ironclad. The unilateral mistake doctrine is so obviously fact\\-dependent that in all but the most egregious circumstances, its applicability is likely to be disputable. Using agreed terms and conditions to avoid the otherwise\\-uncertain application of general contractual rules is a time\\-honored strategy. But online terms and conditions are both adhesive in nature and subject to special FTC rules requiring that they be \u201cclear and conspicuous.\u201d Thus, their enforceability is also inherently very fact\\-bound.

Courts generally require concrete evidence of danger to the children's well-being before considering removal.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because automatic removal based solely on criminal history of housemates is not standard practice. \n\nAnswer B is overstated; while the father may raise concerns, a \"strong case\" cannot be based solely on the criminal history without evidence of current risk.\n\nAnswer D goes too far in the other direction; while past criminal convictions alone are not sufficient for removal, they are not entirely irrelevant and may be considered as part of a broader assessment of the children's living situation."}, "18": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6121/who-legally-owns-millenium-falcon-now", "docs_id": 6121, "title": "Who legally owns Millenium Falcon now?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: First off,\n\n* The question is an actual Earth (American version, if jurisdiction matters) legal one\n* It was inspired by Star Wars Episode VII, \"The Force Awakens\" [related question on SciFi.SE site](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/113213/who-owns-the-millennium-falcon?lq=1). \n\nAs such it contains ***spoilers*** for an important plot twist in the film, so please continue reading at your own risk.\n\nLet's pretend that Millenium Falcon is a regular, Earth human trading freighter ship, registered to US flag. \n\nIt has an owner\\-captain (Han Solo), and a First Mate (Chewbacca) who is second in command.

The same would apply to shares in any holding company interposed between the captain/first mate and the ship.

The manner in which Harvey breaks privilege is as follows:\n* + > Harvey told Donna Paulson, their chief operating officer who then told Lowe (Donna and Lowe have been romantically involved for a few episodes now).

Each country in the world is a jurisdiction. Sub\\-national entities like states, provinces and municipalities may be a jurisdiction depending on the operation of law in the country they are part of. Some supra\\-national bodies like the EU and the UN are jurisdictions. To some extent, even companies, clubs and similar bodies are jurisdictions to the extent that they can make, interpret and enforce its own rules.\n\nA jurisdiction can decide that it has jurisdiction based on a whole raft of matters including:\n\n* where the event took place\n* where the party(s) are resident\n* where the party(s) are citizens\n* registration of things like planes, trains and automobiles\n* if money passed through their financial system\n* etc.\n\nA court or tribunal *has* jurisdiction if the jurisdiction has jurisdiction and it is the correct body within its jurisdiction to hear a particular matter.\n\n**Which laws apply?**\n\nOnce a court or tribunal has decided that it does have jurisdiction it then needs to know what law to apply. This may be the law of their jurisdiction or another jurisdiction or both.\n\n**Example**\n\nFor example, imagine there is a company in New York, USA that sells a product to a consumer in New South Wales, Australia. Further suppose that the contract says it will be governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada (don't ask me why).\n\nIn the event of dispute, let's say the consumer begins proceedings in the Local Court in New South Wales. The New York company petitions the court to say that the correct forum is the court in Ontario, or New York, or Mexico where the product shipped from but certainly not New South Wales.\n\nThe court in New South Wales will consider the jurisdictional arguments and decide if it does or does not have jurisdiction. If it decides that it doesn't then the customer would have to bring an action somewhere else (where the process repeats). Worth noting that the New York company would be precluded from arguing in that forum that New South Wales was the right jurisdiction because they can't have their cake ...\n\nIf it decides that it does have jurisdiction then it would consider what law applies. Its quite probable that they would accept that the contract is governed by Quebec law. However, Australian law, most specifically the Australian Consumer Law would also apply. If there was a claim on a tortuous basis this might be New South Wales or New York law. They would then proceed to decide the case on the applicable law including working out how to reconcile any incompatibilities."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer in Australia purchases a product online from a company based in the United States.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Australian court must first determine if it has jurisdiction. This is not automatic, but it's possible given that the consumer is in Australia.\n2. If the court determines it has jurisdiction, it doesn't mean only Australian law applies.\n3. The court would likely respect the contract's choice of Canadian law for contractual matters.\n4. Australian consumer protection laws may still apply regardless of the contract's specified law.\n5. U.S. law might be relevant for certain aspects, given the company's location.\n\nA is incorrect because jurisdiction isn't automatic, and multiple laws may apply.

Here's how I think a court would treat each of them:\n\n1. This transaction is itself illegal. When a transaction is illegal or for an illegal purpose, courts will not intervene and will just let the parties live with whatever happened. So if I bought a bag of pot from you and got home to discover oregano, a court wouldn't care \\-\\- at least not if we came in on a breach\\-of\\-contract case. Of course, there would be separate criminal sanctions possible.\n2. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the buyer would have several theories by which he could recover the price of the vehicle from the dealer: warranty of title, unilateral mistake, fraud, etc. But the buyer might not actually want to do that. Because he's what the UCC considers a \"bona fide purchaser\" he may be able to keep the car, even if the original owner tried to recover it.\n3. The fact that the software doesn't comply with regulations probably doesn't make the sale itself illegal. If the hospital is required to use software that complies with the regulation, it would probably be able to obtain a refund because the software violates the implied warranty of merchantability, and maybe also because the contract to sell it was premised on a mutual mistake."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small pharmaceutical company, BioTech Inc., develops a new software system for managing clinical trial data.

The sale itself is not illegal, but the product (software) fails to comply with regulations that were not obvious to either party. In such cases, the buyer (HealthCare General) would likely be able to seek a refund based on the implied warranty of merchantability, which assumes that a product is fit for its intended purpose. Additionally, the concept of mutual mistake could apply, as both parties were unaware of the regulatory requirements at the time of the sale.

The constitution is drafted by statespersons within the state and voted on in a referendum within the state or within the area that is proposed to become a new state.\n\nIn all but one instance, when Congress as admitted a new state to the Union, a new constitution of that state took effect at the time of admission and superseded whatever system of governance existed there before that, and a new governor and other new officers of the state (legislators, judges, etc.) began their terms.\n\nBefore March 4, 1791, a polity then called the State of Vermont was neither one of the states of the Union nor a territory governed under and according to an act of Congress (as was done in many territories later), but was under a constitution drafted and put into effect within Vermont without any participation from outside Vermont, just as in states of the Union. In October 1790 Thomas Chittenden was sworn in to a one\\-year term as governor of the State of Vermont, succeeding Moses Robinson who had likewise been sworn in as governor of the State of Vermont one year earlier, and less than five months later when Vermont was admitted to the Union, he continued uninterrupted in the same one\\-year term as governor of the State of Vermont under the same constitution of the State of Vermont, as did all judges, sheriffs, members of the Governor's Council, etc.\n\nSo now my terminology question: Should one say that this was the only state that did not undergo an **internal constitutional discontinuity** at the time of its admission, or would some other phrasing be more correct or otherwise better?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Law and language: You are asking the wrong question**\n\nI take your point, but I'd say you are asking the wrong question. The more interesting question is why Vermont did not need to change its constitution upon statehood. The answer is simple: Vermont had this constitution because, **from its beginning,** Vermont's citizens **hoped for statehood.** They made this clear in their very first constitution, written in 1777\\. After explaining at length why Vermont could not remain in either the British Empire or New York state, the [preamble](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/vt01.asp) says Vermont should be:\n\n> a *free and independent State*; and a...proper form of government, should exist in it, *derived from*, and *founded on*, the *authority of the people* only, **agreeable to the direction of the honorable American Congress.**\n\nExcept for Vermont, Texas, California and West Virginia, the rest of the new states needed new constitutions because they had been territories of the US before statehood. As such, they did not have constitutions.\n\nOnly Vermont and Texas were \"independent\" until statehood. Unlike Vermont, Texas **had** to change its constitution before statehood because its constitution explicitly provided for national powers. For example, [Sections](https://tarltonapps.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1836/a2) 4 and 5 of Article II of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas gave its Congress the power to:\n\n* To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and to regulate captures.\n* To provide and maintain an army and navy, and to make all laws and regulations necessary for their Government.\n\nObviously, these powers are inconsistent with statehood.\n\n**How to talk about drastic change in governance institutions**\n\nI see what you mean about there being a discontinuity, but I'd be wary of mathy metaphors, such as discontinuities, bifurcations, catastrophes or singularities. I'd stick with words commonly used to describe drastic constitutional change. For example, \"Vermont was the only new state that did not have a *constitutional revolution* when it became a state.\"\n\nHaving said that, I realize that constitutional historians and others love to talk about continuities, so why not use discontinuity?

You (almost always) gain your citizenship (or nationality) in the first instance, at birth, without the agreement or assent of you or your parents. It is thrust upon you.\n2. Usually, your country of citizenship must consent to end your citizenship (or authorize you to do so unilaterally) under that country's laws.\n3. Once you have citizenship or nationality, in practice, in most countries, you can generally only renounce your citizenship if you contemporaneously or already have a citizenship somewhere else. You are at a minimum strongly dissuaded from doing so and are not a sympathetic candidate for relief under laws related to statelessness if you willfully put yourself in this position knowing the consequences. This is a feature of the citizenship laws of most countries in order to implement international treaties designed to prevent statelessness which are widely adopted.\n4. When an adult is naturalized as a citizen of a new country, usually, their old citizenship is revoked by operation of law under the laws of their old country.\n5. In many countries, including the U.S., there are high fees and tax consequences for renouncing your citizenship. Any potential tax liabilities in the future that were not yet due under U.S. law (e.g. capital gains taxes an appreciated assets not yet sold, and estate taxes that would be due if the person renouncing their citizenship had died on that date) are owed immediately upon applying to renounce your citizenship.\n6. **A stateless person is, subject to quite narrow exceptions, still subject to all of the laws of the place where they are located, including almost all of its criminal laws (except treason) and its tax laws (at least on income earned in that country).**\n7. **A stateless person lacks many rights.** They can't travel internationally (there are exceptions under treaty in some cases, but obtaining those rights is cumbersome at a minimum). They can't vote. They typically aren't entitled to domestic welfare state benefits like national health insurance, disability payments, unemployment benefits, subsidized housing, old age or retirement benefits, etc. They can't work in a licensed or regulated profession. They may not even be able to sign a lease. They may not be allowed to own a company or serve as an officer or director of a company or as a trustee of a trust. They aren't entitled to diplomatic assistance.\n\n**There are many fraudulent legal movements such as the \"sovereign citizen movement\" (and the [Moorish Sovereign Citizens](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/moorish-sovereign-citizens)) that assert that citizenship is voluntary and that just by disavowing it in some official feeling way, they can be exempt from taxes, court jurisdiction, and/or other laws.

I also cannot find anyone going to jail for \"usage\"\n\nFor comparisson\n\n<http://www.flevin.com/id/lgso/translations/JICA%20Mirror/english/4868_UU_35_2009_e.html>\n\nIn Indonesian law article 127 says:\n(1\\) Every abusers:\n\n> a. Narcotics Category I for themselves shall be punished with\n>  imprisonment of 4 (four) years;\n>  b. Narcotics Category II for themselves shall be punished with imprisonment of 2 (two) years, and\n>  c. Narcotics of category III for themselves shall be punished with imprisonment of 1 (one) year.\n\nThat explicitly prohibit \"usage\". Of course, most users are not really abusers and are just casual users. However, I don't think the court think that way.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the U.S., Law enforcement favors going after the distribution of narcotics over the use. Going after the users just means dealers will seek out new customers whereas going after dealers means eliminating the supply chain. And Law Enforcement would much rather have a dealer flip on a manufacturer at that. The bigger the fish they bring in, the more damage they can do to the supply chain.\n\nThe U.S. has recently been moving towards treating the use of illicit substances as a disease rather than an crime, especially when the use is tied to addiction. To this end, the current trend is to get the users to clinics that can specialize in breaking addiction rather than jailing a user. Prisons and jails do not have a strong track record for this, but they do have programs for substance abuse.\n\nThe U.S. also favors plea bargins rather than taking every case to trial. 90% of all legal cases are settled out of court with a negotiation between the prosecution and the defense. Usually this acts in a \"you scratch my back\" arrangement where the offender will plea to a lesser charge and in exchange, help the investigators find that bigger fish. This may be testifying against them or giving them the supplier or even acting as a mole. This also benifits the state as the prosecution doesn't have to pay for all the costs of arguing a case a trial. For example, if the cops bust a user, he will be charged with Possession, but they might drop charges if the user can name the dealer and will testify against him. If the cops bust the dealer, the dealer is charged with Possession (with intent to sell), but if he's low on the totem pole, they can ask him to name the supplier he gets his goods and testify against the supplier and in exchange, they drop the charge to Possession. They will be less inclined to bring this fact up, but Possession is easier to prove in court than Possession (With Intent to Sell) because the former requires finding drugs on the person and his property. The later needs to prove that the drugs were not for personal use but instead for distribution to others. Almost universally, anyone convicted on mere possession charges probably did something a lot worse. Law enforcement tends to charge as many crimes as possible... as long as they can prove guilt on one, they can put someone away for a while. Al Capone famously went to one of the most notorious prisons in the United States for Tax Evasion (a very white collared crime that typically results in fines and very minimum jail time. While we're on the subject, the IRS has a 98% conviction rate, and ties with Secret Service (the guys who protect the President) for most successful Federal Law Enforcement Agency, to give you an idea of where the priorities lie in the United States. All Federal Law Enforcement is ridiculously good, to the point that bringing charges against anyone is almost as good as saying they're guilty).\n\nAnother reason Use of drugs isn't pushed is that, well, producing that evidence is difficult. The common user bust is drinking and driving (since alcohol is legal in the U.S., use based crimes are the top level of enforcement. You legally cannot hold a firearm in the U.S. while drunk, even if you could do so while sober). A brethalizer is built to measure the amount of alcohol is in one's system and if it is over the limit for what is safe. Most illicit drug tests don't do this and rather look for chemicals in general and will ping if there's any trace... even if the last use was a month ago. Certain substances linger for a while, especially if they can deposit in hair folicle. You could be six months sober and still ping the test. Other issuses include drugs that contain components of legal substances. Opiods (the big problem drug right now) are manufactured from the Poppy Plant... which also is grown for legal consumable products. There are cases where the Opiod tests pings positive on people who have consumed Poppy\\-Seed Bagels (perfectlly legal and quite common) for breakfast the day of the test. Other tests aren't reliable and will give a false positive from time to time.\n\nEdit: Typically, Possession of a controlled substance assumes you will use it. Reasonable Doubt is harder to make for having the stuff then it is for using it. Someone under the influence could claim they were drugged and law enforcement would have to prove that they weren't to convict (There's actually a known problem where law enforcement agents can get dosed by accident while handling contraband evidence. There was an episode of CSI: Miami where one character had this happen to her... and they realized where the drugs were hidden in a warehouse she served a warrant on but didn't find any evidence. DVD extras featured a police consultant who explained that the whole sequence was thought up because it happened to her for real.). Having the stuff in your possession is much more difficult as they have to show you had it (someone slipping it into your pocket without your knowledge is your job to prove).\n\nIn the U.S., Prosecution Discretion means that the Prosecutor can choose not to press the case for any number of reasons, they don't have the resources to fight it, to they don't think they can win with the evidence they have, to political motives (they don't agree with the law... this can be risky depending on the nature of the crime). Typically a simple possession charge where the amount is clearly small enough that it's only for personal use and no other crimes are charged wouldn't be worth the amount of resources to fully prosecute. TO give an example, while Marijuana is legal in the State of Colorado, it's still illegal under Federal Law, so smoking for recreational use in Colorado is still a crime, but not one enforced by the State of Colorado but the Department of Justice (U.S. Federal Law enforcement department... usually). Remember the Feds generally deal with bigger crimes than someone getting high under the bleachers while listening to Jimmy Hendrix, so it only really comes up if you did something bigger (kidnapping a girl, driving over state lines into Colorado, go to a school to get high under the bleachers while listening to Hendrix would get you a Federal Possession charge... but the real concern is the Kidnapping, not controlled drug use). And most crimes that occur in entirely one state, Feds are content to let those states deal with the problem and rarely get involved."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the approach to drug-related offenses in the United States legal system?\n\nA) The primary focus is on prosecuting individual drug users rather than dealers or manufacturers.\n\nB) Law enforcement prioritizes targeting the distribution chain and larger-scale operations over individual users.\n\nC) Drug use itself is explicitly illegal and heavily prosecuted, similar to the approach in Indonesian law.\n\nD) Possession and usage of drugs are treated equally under U.S. federal law, with no distinction in enforcement priorities.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Sealed records are not destroyed or permanently inaccessible, but they cannot be freely accessed by the public or government officials without proper authorization. Typically, a court order is required to \"unseal\" and release these records.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because sealing does not involve destroying information, and sealed records can potentially be accessed under certain circumstances.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct in that it restricts public access, but it's wrong to say that any government official can freely access sealed records.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because sealing is not the same as classifying information as top secret, and the accessibility is not limited only to the President.\n\nThe question also touches on the common use of sealing in cases related to past criminal convictions, where statutes are designed to minimize the long-term effects of these convictions on an individual's life, similar to a pardon's effect."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81941/can-the-term-code-be-used-as-an-all-encompassing-legal-term-for-law-statutes", "docs_id": 81941, "title": "Can the term &quot;code&quot; be used as an all-encompassing legal term for law, statutes, bills, acts, constitutions, and other &quot;legislation&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am trying to figure out what law, codes, statutes, bills, acts, constitutions, opinions, decisions, and legislation have in common, what the overarching entity is that these objects all are. I am working on an ontology and would like to put constitutions under the category of \"codes\", along with regular \"codes\" (like the US Code), since it seems they are both dealing with law and thus can be classified the same (though they are obviously different in some ways). Likewise, after an hour of digging around, I couldn't find really what the similarities and differences were between these 9 or 10 terms really was. Can they all be bucketed under the category of \"codes\" at the end of the day, or why do they need to be kept separate? Sorry for the naive question, I am no legal person, just a software developer learning as I go.\n\nWhat really is a \"code\", then? To my understanding so far, a [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_law) is a comprehensive collection of laws. So wouldn't that mean it accounts for all these other object types?\n\nJust found:\n\n> Once a bill has been enacted into law, it is called an act of the legislature, or a statute. Bills are introduced in the legislature and are discussed, debated and voted upon.\n\nThat helps clarify somewhat, so now it seems to come down to statute vs. constitution vs. code.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Codes\" are usually ***collections*** of previously existing laws. The Code of Hammurabi and the Code of Justinian were both collections of laws, gathered for easy reference. In the US, the US Code (USC) is an almost comprehensive collection of current law, much of which was passed in separate statutes before it was codified. In this contest, to **codify** is to include a law in the code, altering formatting and numbering to make it consistent with the rest of the code. Laws in the US are normally passed and go into effect **before** they are codified.\n\nIn modern usage \"code\" is not normally used for a single law.\n\nThere is also the US Code of Federal Regulations or CFR which is a **collection** of regulations passed by various federal agencies to implement law. They are not laws, but in many respects thy have the force of law.\n\nI believe that several other legal systems use \"code\" or a word that might be translated as \"code\" in a similar way.\n\nIn a wider sense, \"code\" can be used to refer to an entire system of law, as \"the Mosaic code\" or \"the Anglo\\-American code\". It can also be used for the precepts of a non\\-legsal system as \"an ethical code\" or \"the architect's code of practice\".\n\nA bill is a proposed law not yet passed by a legislature.\n\nIn modern US usage, codes **only** include statutes passed by legislatures, not constitutions. This is because codes collect the work of legislatures, but written constitutions come from different and special sources.\n\nThe term \"act\", in modern usage, is a synonym for \"statute\". In historic usage not all acts were statutes, only those important enough to be routinely quoted verbatim, not paraphrased."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between codes, statutes, and constitutions in modern US legal terminology?\n\nA) Codes are comprehensive collections of laws that include both statutes and constitutions.\n\nB) Statutes are proposed laws that have not yet been passed by a legislature, while codes are collections of enacted laws.\n\nC) Constitutions are a type of code that outlines the fundamental principles of governance.\n\nD) Codes are collections of statutes passed by legislatures, but do not include constitutions.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, in modern US usage, codes are collections of previously existing laws, specifically statutes passed by legislatures. Codes do not include constitutions because constitutions come from different and special sources, not from the regular legislative process. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while codes are comprehensive collections of laws, they do not include constitutions in the US system.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it confuses statutes with bills. Bills are proposed laws, while statutes are enacted laws.\n\nOption C is incorrect because constitutions are not considered a type of code in the US legal system. They are separate and distinct from codes.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the distinctions between different types of legal documents and their classifications in the US legal system."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73540/how-terms-of-service-can-avoid-copyright-infringement-by-users", "docs_id": 73540, "title": "How terms of service can avoid copyright infringement by users?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I saw this on the [dribbble.com/terms](http://dribbble.com/terms):\n\n> **Your Responsibilities**: ...

This clause is related to the Indemnification clause \\#12\\. The user promises that they will not upload another person's stuff. If they do, that is a violation of the TOS. The indemnification clause says that the user will \"take the hit\" if the user violates the TOS and the website owners get sued (which they probably will).
