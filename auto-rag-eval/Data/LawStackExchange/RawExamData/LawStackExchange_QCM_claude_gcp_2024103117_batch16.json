So far I have used about 40GB high speed data this month and the system shows my data balance is negative.

The customer is not responsible for the company's network management decisions and cannot be held liable for using the service as it's being provided.

I cannot pinpoint the line for you or tell you whether any particular action would lie on one side or the other, but I can describe the test.\n\nIn Maryland, there are \"five elements necessary to consider before applying the defense of necessity\" (*[Marquardt v. State](https://casetext.com/case/marquardt-v-state-5)*, 164 Md. App. 95, 135\\-36 (2005\\), citing *Sigma Reproductive Health Center v. State*, 297 Md. 660, 677\\-79 (1983\\)):\n\n1. The harm avoided \u2014 this need not be physical harm but also may be harm to property as, for instance, where a firefighter destroys some property to prevent the spread of fire which threatens to consume other property of greater value.\n2. The harm done \u2014 this is not limited to any particular type of harm but includes intentional homicide as well as intentional battery or property damage. An illustration is supplied:\n\n\\`\\[A]s where A, driving a car, suddenly finds himself in a predicament where he must either run down B or hit C's house and he reasonably chooses the latter, unfortunately killing two people in the house who by bad luck happened to be just at that place inside the house where A's car struck \u2014 it is the harm\\-reasonably\\-expected, rather than the harm\\-actually\\-caused, which governs.'\n3. Intention to avoid harm \u2014 to have the defense of necessity, the defendant must have acted with the intention of avoiding the greater harm. Actual necessity, without the intention, is not enough. However, an honest and reasonable belief in the necessity of his action is all that is required.\n4. The relative value of the harm avoided and the harm done. The defendant's belief as to the relative harmfulness of the harm avoided and the harm done does not control. It is for the court, not the defendant, to weigh the relative harmfulness of the two alternatives. To allow the defense the court must conclude that the harm done by the defendant in choosing the one alternative was less than the harm which would have been done if he had chosen the other.\n5. Optional courses of action; imminence of disaster. The defense of necessity applies when the defendant is faced with this choice of two evils: he may either do something which violates the literal terms of the criminal law and thus produce some harm, or not do it and so produce a greater harm. If, however, there is open to him a third alternative, which will cause less harm than will be caused by violating the law, he is not justified in violating the law. For example, \"\\[a] prisoner subjected to inhuman treatment by his jailors is not justified in breaking prison if he can bring about an improvement in conditions by other means.\"\n\n*Marquardt* at 137:\n\n> in order for the defense of necessity to have been warranted in this case, appellant must have presented \"some evidence\" that there was a choice between two evils, that no legal alternatives existed, that the harm appellant caused was not disproportionate to the harm avoided, and that the emergency was imminent.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John is walking past a house when he hears screams and sees through the window that a person inside appears to be choking.

This situation invokes the defense of necessity, which requires several elements to be met:\n\n1. There must be a choice between two evils (in this case, trespassing vs. potentially letting someone die).\n2.

I saw a lot of news about it, and my general understanding is that the companies are simply not providing their service to that individual, something they have complete right to do.\n\nBut also, there was that [Colorado baker](https://www.pressherald.com/2018/08/15/baker-who-refused-cake-for-gay-wedding-in-2012-sues-colorado-again/) case, and there was a whole lot of discussion if he could or not deny service to the couple.\n\nMy question is how these two cases are **different** and how US law states if a company can or can't deny a service to someone.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The key difference is the motivation for denying service.\n\nGenerally, a business can deny service for almost any reason, or for no reason, and doesn't have to explain its reasons for doing so.\n\nHowever, laws may make it illegal to deny service for certain specific reasons. The federal [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Title_I) forbids discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. So a business may not deny service for those *specific* reasons. In the Colorado case, there was a similar state law that also forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. \n\nIf they deny you service because of your political views, or the way you dress, or because they just plain don't like you as a person, that's legal. If they deny you service because of your sex, or race, or on the other bases in the Civil Rights Act, that's illegal.\n\nObviously, since a business doesn't have to say why they're denying service, or could lie about the reason, this could make it hard for a plaintiff to prove that denial was in fact based on (e.g.) race. They might be able to do so by finding out about internal discussions within the business, or by showing a pattern of denial to customers of a particular race.\n\nIn *Masterpiece Cakeshop*, the baker made it easy by explicitly stating that he was denying service because of the customers' sexual orientation, or at least because of the same\\-sex nature of the marriage in question. This would appear to violate the Colorado state law. Had he just said no without giving a reason, it would have been harder for the plaintiffs to make their case. (A state commission held that the baker did violate the law, but the US Supreme Court reversed because, they said, the commission had improperly taken the baker's religion into account.)\n\nBut there is no such law that forbids discrimination on the basis of political views, so Alex Jones can't make a similar case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A restaurant owner in California refuses service to a customer wearing a political t-shirt supporting a controversial candidate.

The restaurant owner's actions are legal, as political views are not a protected class under federal or California state law. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and similar state laws prohibit discrimination based on specific characteristics such as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, and in some states, sexual orientation. However, political views or affiliations are not included in these protected categories. \n\nOption A is incorrect because political views are not a protected class under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n\nOption B is too broad; while businesses have significant latitude in denying service, they cannot do so based on legally protected characteristics. \n\nOption D is incorrect because California law does not specifically protect against discrimination based on political affiliation in public accommodations (though it does in employment contexts).\n\nThis question tests understanding of anti-discrimination laws, protected classes, and the limits of business owners' rights to refuse service."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21984/copyright-for-re-scored-tune-that-was-out-of-copyright", "docs_id": 21984, "title": "Copyright for re-scored tune that was out of copyright", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a song is out of copyright, but has been re\\-scored for a movie, can it be used in an amateur video?

The question presents an interesting issue of contract law.\n\n> Can a Rental Contract Supersede State Law?\n\nNo, not in your situation. The doctrine of [*contra proferentem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem) is decisive, and it favors your position unless you are the party who drafted the lease contract (which is unlikely in a landlord\\-tenant context).\n\nThe clause establishing a six\\-month statute of limitations is in conflict with the tenant's right (per the same contract) \"*to pursue legal action within 30 days of terminating the lease*\". That is, the contract creates an ambiguity.\n\nBecause the 30\\-day deadline has not expired \\-\\-by virtue of your lease not having been terminated yet\\-\\-, the doctrine of *contra proferentem* dictates the ambiguity is decided or solved by adopting the option that favors the party who is not the draftsman of the ambiguous contract.\n\nThere is one note of caution, though. You mention that the statute of limitations in CA is four years, and also that the habitability issues lasted four years. At first glance, the latter suggests that the CA statute of limitations might have expired anyway (depending on the exact dates when your claims \\-\\-specifically, your losses\\-\\- accrued). If that's the case, you need to be careful about what legal theory (or theories) to pursue. Some of these theories could be to proceed on the basis of:\n\n* *Breach of contract* by establishing that your losses accrued at the instant(s) the landlord failed to fix the issues;\n* *Unjust enrichment* accruing at the instant when the landlord refused to reimburse you for rent overpaid (assuming that reimbursement is consistent with the language of the lease); and/or\n* *Fraud*, if you are able to prove that the landlord intentionally misled you, and that your reasonable reliance on his representation(s) caused you losses.\n\nNote that although in California \"*there is not a standalone cause of action for 'unjust enrichment,' which is synonymous with 'restitution', \\[...] \\[unjust enrichment and restitution] describe the theory underlying a claim that a defendant has been unjustly conferred a benefit through mistake, fraud, coercion, or request. \\[...] The return of that benefit is the remedy typically sought in a quasi\\-contract cause of action.*\", [*Astiana v.

The lease creates an ambiguity by having both a 6-month limitation and a clause allowing legal action within 30 days of lease termination. The doctrine of contra proferentem dictates that ambiguities in a contract are interpreted in favor of the party who did not draft the contract (likely the tenant in this case). This allows the tenant to pursue legal action despite the restrictive clauses. Additionally, state law cannot be superseded by a rental contract in this situation.

What's stopping them from asking the US's assistance in raiding the servers like the US literally did in the case of [shutting down Megaupload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload#Arrests_in_New_Zealand)?\n\nIs it a matter of \"this is possible but will not be considered worth the effort and taxpayer money\"? Do you think that will ever change?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The ruling that allows the ban on child pornography is based on two SCOTUS decisions: *Miller v. Califorina*, which legally defined \"obscene\" and declared obscenities to be beyond the protection of the First Amendment (just an fyi, the definition includes that the material is lacking in \"serious scientific, literary, artistic, or political value\" which the courts usually don't hold a high threshold of quality above. Obscenity laws are also, per Miller, to be in the power of the most local levels of governance among a body of people (so while the U.S. cannot ban content on a web forum, the forum's own rules may).\n\nThe other case is law is *New York v. Furber* which held that there is a compeling government interest in protecting the physical and mental health and well being of a child and that the manufacture and sale of child porn leads to the abuse of children and tramautic memories of the experience that last for much of their lifetime that overrides any protection offered by the First Amendment, thus the material need not be legally obscene to make illegal.\n\nIt's that compelling government interest that forms the basis of the answer. Because that is the justification for the illegalization of child porn and as such it would not always fall to obscenity laws without the interest, there is a bit of a loop hole. To be illegal, the pictures in question must have a real child featured in the porn in question. Thus pictures depicting fictional characters in their entirety (such as cartoon depictions of children) and erotica (literature featuring sexual content) are not illegal under *Ferber* and must fall to *Miller* to determine if it is illegal.\n\nBecause *Miller* leaves the rules to the lowest level of community law possible, these pictures can be against the rules of many websites, 4chan is (in)famous for having next to no standards, this kind of material is perfectly legal on this site as far as higher levels of government are concerned and it falls to the moderation team of 4chan (such as they are) to limit the offensive content.\n\nIt is because these materials do not depict actual real children that they are legal. This is due to the fact that these works can just barely qualify as having an artistic or literary value (the bar is very very low as to what qualifies as \"merit\" under *Miller*). It's also acceptable to make pictures of a real child portraying a fictional character who in the story is a victim of child pornography, regardless of the work's depiction **so long as you aren't actually having the child actor strip on camera.** This can be done by giving the child flesh colored clothing that covers the areas deemed obscene and using shoot angles that depict the child's skin that is legally allowed to be exposed (to hid the fact that for legal reasons the child is legally dressed on the set. Other production tricks are to hire actors who are older than 18 years old, but look younger than they are and can play a kid.). So long as you are not actually making child porn (showing the \"no\\-no areas\" on a real child), you can make fiction works that depict fictional characters involved in such activities in artistic ways to make any statement you want on the subject matter.\n\nIn your two examples, Operation Avalance targeted sites that had materials such as pictures and videos that depicted actual children in pornographic situations. In the case of the Megaupload, the U.S. was requesting extradition for money laundering and racketeering in connection with the legal seizure of Megaupload following investigations into the site concerning digital piracy. I'm unaware of actual instances of child porn involved, but not saying it's not impossible. Extradition only works if the country requested (Here New Zealand) chooses to honor the request (the U.S. and New Zealand have an extradition treaty and very similar laws so extradition is both required per treaty when requested AND the accused person would face similar charges if the crime was committed in the requested country.).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under U.S. law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of cartoon depictions of child pornography?\n\nA) All cartoon depictions of child pornography are illegal under federal law.\n\nB) Cartoon depictions of child pornography are always protected by the First Amendment.\n\nC) Cartoon depictions of child pornography may be legal unless ruled obscene under the Miller test.\n\nD) Cartoon depictions of child pornography are treated the same as photographs of real children under the law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of cartoon depictions of child pornography in the U.S. is complex. Unlike photographs or videos of real children, which are illegal under New York v. Ferber due to the compelling government interest in protecting children from exploitation, cartoon depictions do not involve real children and thus are not automatically illegal. However, they can still be deemed illegal if found to be obscene under the Miller v. California test. This test considers whether the average person would find the work appeals to prurient interest, whether it depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and whether it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. If a cartoon depiction fails this test and is ruled obscene, it can be considered illegal. However, if it passes the test or is not challenged, it may remain legal. This is why some websites may allow such content without legal consequences, as long as it is not deemed obscene by relevant authorities."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/65497/legal-latin-term-for-argument-that-treats-someone-elses-injuries-as-ones-own", "docs_id": 65497, "title": "Legal / latin term for argument that treats someone else&#39;s injuries as one&#39;s own?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Interning in a court, and I note that the defendant's brief once had a case dismissed because of potential overreach by the court, but that overreach would not injure the defendant's interests, it would injure others.\n\nI feel like there's a legal or latin term for this kind of argumentation \\-\\- where you're acting as if injuries to someone else are actually injuries to you, and requesting relief for those injuries.\n\nDoes such a term exist, and if so what is it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It sounds like you're thinking of [third\\-party standing](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-3/section-2/clause-1/standing-to-assert-the-rights-of-others).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a legal case, the defendant argues that the court's potential overreach would harm other parties, not the defendant directly.

B never established an employment relationship with E, and by allowing N (and by extension, E) to work with the hospital, B effectively waived any non-compete rights it might have had. N, on the other hand, never established a new non-compete agreement with E. The original agreement was between E and A, and it doesn't automatically transfer to N just because the same seller is involved.

Most cases where these things become federal crimes involve conduct affecting multiple states, and the person committing the crime would likely also commit at least one state crime.

While the Constitution doesn't prohibit Congress from enacting laws that may be considered unwise or destructive, all laws must still pass the rational basis test. This test, while generally favorable to legislators, requires that laws have a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. Extremely destructive laws might fail this test and could be challenged in court on these grounds.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Supreme Court doesn't have the authority to overturn laws simply because they're considered \"stupid.\" As Justice Stevens noted, the Constitution doesn't prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.\n\nOption B is incorrect because states cannot nullify federal laws.

Since the Toronto University name is trademarked, you have to respect their rights pertaining to the usage of the trademark. Since you don't list too many details, I'll try to give more of a general overview.\n\nThe registration and use of trademarks in Canada is governed by the [Trade\\-marks Act, RSC 1985, c T\\-13](http://canlii.ca/t/52dg3). Similar to copyright, the owner of a trademark is entitled to exclusive rights regarding its usage. However, there are exceptions to where usage of a trademark does not infringe on the owner's rights. \u00a720 outlines when a trademark is infringed, as well as two exceptions.\n\nRelevant to your case, is \u00a720(d):\n\n> **Infringement**\n> \n> \n> 20 (1\\) The right of the owner of a registered trade\\-mark to its exclusive use is deemed to be infringed by any person who is not entitled to its use under this Act and who\n> \n> \n> (d) manufactures, causes to be manufactured, possesses, imports, exports or attempts to export any label or packaging, in any form, bearing a trade\\-mark or trade\\-name, for the purpose of its sale or distribution or for the purpose of the sale, distribution or advertisement of goods or services in association with it, if\n> \n> \n> * (i) the person knows or ought to know that the label or packaging is intended to be associated with goods or services that are not those of the owner of the registered trade\\-mark,\n\nSince your app is intending to be associated with the trademark owner's institution, you would not be infringing a trademark.\n\nHowever, trademarks are fairly complicated.

While the use of \"Toronto University\" in the app store listing likely falls under fair use as it's intended to identify the target audience (students of that university), trademark law can be complex. The usage doesn't seem to infringe on the trademark owner's rights according to \u00a720(d) of the Trade-marks Act, as the app is intended to be associated with the institution. However, it's always advisable to seek permission from the trademark owner to avoid any potential legal issues. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because this use isn't always illegal; it may fall under fair use.\nAnswer B is too absolute; while it may be fair use, there are still potential restrictions and it's not without any limitations.\nAnswer D is incorrect because the app being free doesn't automatically grant unrestricted use of trademarks."}, "27": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58473/selling-my-own-label-making-software-for-zebra-printers", "docs_id": 58473, "title": "Selling my own label-making software for Zebra printers", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I did a little research on Google about the licensing problem of selling original label\\-making software for Zebra printers and failed to find anything related to it.\n\nNormally there shouldn't be any problem because, I believe, it's no different from making software to print on any other printers.\n\nAnd I don't think you have to get any licensing permission to print on, say, Epson's printers.\n\nBut because printing on Zebra's label printers involving using their creation \\- ZPL (Zebra Programming Language), now I'm not so sure about the legality of selling anything which have used their creation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There appear to be no special license requirements on the use of ZPL, or Zebra printers.

But, it isn't necessary to reach the constitutional issue to make it a close case.\n\nThe common law rule is that someone making a statement can be liable for false material statements about presently existing material facts, but cannot be liable for statements of opinion, because statements of opinion are inherently neither true nor false.\n\nThe question presented with respect to common law liability is whether a too high credit rating is a statement about a presently existing material fact, which is actionable, or an opinion, which i not actionable.\n\nThe argument that a credit rating is more than a \"mere opinion\" that is incapable of being true or false, is that credit ratings are prepared based upon a careful methodology that is based upon presently existing material facts. Thus, the argument goes, rather than being a mere opinion, a credit rating is better described as a summary or compilation of presently existing material facts, from which presently existing material facts underlying the rating can be inferred, or if it is so discretionary that a credit rating doesn't really imply any underlying basis in presently existing material facts.\n\nThe methodology used by credit reporting agencies, the way business people use the credit reports of companies (especially in bond trading), the way that federal securities law regulation uses credit ratings of companies from this agencies, and securities fraud caselaw holding that statements that historically would have been considered opinion in common law fraud cases that imply facts are actionable for statutory securities fraud claims, all argue that credit reporting agencies should be exposed to liability because a credit rating from such an agency can be a misrepresentation (at least if it is far off the mark in light of objective methodological concerns).\n\nThe argument in favor of not holding credit reporting agencies liable for inaccurate credit ratings is basically that they have acted in reliance on long standing common law case law holding that there is no liability for statements of opinion, and that the credit reporting agencies didn't bargain for this potential liability when they issued their reports (for fees that were a tiny percentage of their potential liability).\n\nEven if civil liability is rare, a ruling that there is liability for an inaccurate credit rating essentially turns what was a zero liability risk line of business into a business where basically 100% of their work product could expose them to liability if a company with a good credit rating defaults, particularly because the credit reporting agency itself claims argue from historical records, that a credit rating disclosed a percentage likelihood of default, but recognizes that any company with any credit rating could default on its debts.\n\nIf credit reporting agencies knew that they were exposed to so much liability for their credit ratings when they charged fees to prepare them, they argue, they would have charged ten times a much or more for this work, in much the way that an attorney preparing an opinion letter on the law that exposes the attorney to liability if the opinion letter is wrong charges much more than their hourly rate for essentially guaranteeing that courts will treat a transaction as the lawyer claims that they should.\n\nCritics of this argument, however, say that it is possible in many clear cases to say that the rating itself clearly made a bad estimate of the probability of default and not just whether there would be a default or not, based upon the standards that credit reporting agencies use to assign the ratings in the first place.\n\nThe answer from @DavidSiegel notes that the First Amendment defense failed in many of these cases in preliminary motion practice in these cases. But those decisions didn't resolve those cases on the merits of the claims made, and I'm not aware of how these cases were resolved on the merits.

The passage indicates that CRAs were not merely offering unsolicited opinions, but were providing paid expertise and actively participating in the design of financial products. Their ratings, based on careful methodologies, could be seen as summaries or compilations of existing material facts rather than mere opinions. This interpretation would make their inaccurate ratings potentially actionable as misrepresentations, especially given how their ratings are used in the financial industry and under securities law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the First Amendment argument has been used by CRAs, the passage suggests that this defense has often failed in preliminary motions.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the CRAs' activities, as described, went beyond traditional journalistic practices and involved paid, solicited expertise.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while this is an argument used by CRAs to avoid liability, the passage presents counterarguments suggesting that credit ratings could be considered more than just opinions in a legal context."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90293/is-there-a-practical-way-to-see-the-actual-rulings-reasons-considerations-that-r", "docs_id": 90293, "title": "Is there a practical way to see the actual rulings/reasons/considerations that resulted in the litigation bars in effect against vexatious litigants?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is a register of bans available at [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vexatious\\-litigants](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vexatious-litigants), but it is just the barest list of names.

Please note, you have only a few days to report damage so if the delivery company drops off your package without your signature, call or contact them right away.

Wait about 30 minutes and then run your tracking number online. It will show that you reported the damage. Once it shows, you then contact the seller. \n\nCarefully review the text of the following documents to determine who is responsible for the replacement or refund and under what conditions:\n\n1. The manufacturer warranty,\n2. The terms of service for the website on which you ordered your product\n3. The agency that controls the payment method you employed (if it's not cash).\n\nKeep your communications with the seller in writing so there is never any doubt as to when you contacted them or what was said by either party. A reasonable response time is a full business day for them to get back to you with an offer of resolution.\u00a0\n\nIf a seller claims the item was sold *[as is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_is)*, then that does not apply to freight damage. If the seller claims the item was sold *as is*, then they need to have stated it was damaged in the advertisement or the auction.

According to the documentation, if the musician operates from outside Germany but within the EU, it is generally sufficient to satisfy their own country's regulations. However, due to EU directives like GDPR and the eCommerce Directive, they must still disclose certain information, including their name, geographic address, contact details, and potentially registration numbers or VAT ID. They don't need a German Impressum specifically, but they can't operate anonymously. Option A is incorrect because a German Impressum isn't required for non-German EU businesses.

That would be the case with an airline reservation, and one clear sign is that you have to pay for the ticket when you make the reservation; or, it you don't, then there is no contract, and they can cancel or change the price. You would look for clear signs of an agreement, such as a \"agree to terms\" button that you have to click. Paying a deposit is another clear sign. Then you would simply look at the terms of the contract to see what their obligation is, and what yours is. They may have strongly committed to providing service in which case you might have a cause for legal action if they break that commitment, or they might have made no specific promises about service in case of intervening events (such as if the chef has a heart attack, or the power goes out). If we do think of this as a contractual matter, you breached your duty as a customer, to be there by 7:30, so even if there is a contract, they didn't break it. The note that you added renegotiating the arrival time was insufficient \u2013 it is outside of the contract, and possibly something that they didn't see (they only look at the names and official time blocks reported by the web page).\n\nIn lieu of a contract, there could be some statutory obligation, i.e. a specific regulation in Sweden saying \"if a restaurant accepts a reservation, they absolutely must hold the space available for the entire reserved time\", which is an unreasonably onerous business practice that no nation requires.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of restaurant reservations, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal status and obligations of such reservations?\n\nA) Making a restaurant reservation always creates a binding legal contract between the customer and the restaurant.\n\nB) A restaurant reservation only becomes a legal contract if the customer pays a deposit or agrees to specific terms and conditions.\n\nC) Restaurants are legally obligated to hold reserved tables for the entire duration specified in the reservation, regardless of when the customer arrives.\n\nD) Restaurant reservations are generally not considered legally binding contracts unless there are clear indications of a formal agreement, such as payment or explicit terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, restaurant reservations are not typically considered legally binding contracts. They only become so when there are clear indications of a formal agreement, such as payment of a deposit, clicking an \"agree to terms\" button, or other explicit commitments. In most cases, reservations are informal arrangements without the legal weight of a contract. This means that while restaurants generally try to honor reservations as a matter of good business practice, they are not legally obligated to do so in the absence of specific agreements or local regulations. The other options are incorrect because they either overstate the legal nature of reservations (A and C) or oversimplify the conditions under which a reservation might become a contract (B)."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49124/can-i-compel-my-neighbor-to-remove-or-relocate-a-tree-that-completely-encroaches", "docs_id": 49124, "title": "Can I compel my neighbor to remove or relocate a tree that completely encroaches my property?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My neighbor planted a pygmy date palm cluster fairly close to our common property line.

We are located in Florida, US, if that is pertinent to the answer.\n\nI don't have an image of the actual plantings in question, but below is a good approximation of the size of the plantings, and degree that the tree crosses the boundary line (yellow line).

Our landscaper disputes the neighbor's claims, but allows that they may have inadvertently stepped over the property line. This is possible, but not likely, as the neighbor's plantings are low, and it would be difficult to trim their plantings that cross the line from slightly over the line. Not to mention, pointless, as it is easier to trim the encroaching plants entirely from our property, than it is to stand on or near the property line.\n\nNotwithstanding our neighbor's claim, he has crossed entirely to our property while trimming his plantings. When he attempted to confront us about our landscaper allegedly crossing over, he defended his own crossing over as allowed because he was maintaining his plantings.\n\nThe neighbor has sent a letter from his attorney stating that we are not allowed on his property without express written consent. Fine, we have no interest, nor need, to cross onto his property. However, we are incensed that he misrepresented the facts, and we feel he is essentially attempting to bully us into letting his plantings grow by vaguely claiming some of our trimmings have damaged the \"heart\" of the tree; and asserting our landscaper engaged in \"conversion\" (*sigh*).\n\nPrior to my neighbor's belligerence, we were content to simply trim the low trees that crossed over the line; it wasn't much of a big deal. But now battle lines have been drawn.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The only way to compel a neighbor to do something is to sue him and get the court to use force. In order to succeed in your lawsuit, you need to show that you have been harmed (annoyance/nuisance does not count). The courts are generally not sympathetic to battle lines being drawn, but might in principle listen if you show that the tree is harming you (not just annoying you). Even then, the court will order compensation for that damage and will not order the removal of the tree.\nThe tree\\-owner has a duty to take reasonable care to maintain the tree, so they cannot just let it fall on your gazebo and say \"oops\". The problem is that the basic rule is that \"a possessor of land is not liable to persons outside the land for a nuisance resulting from trees and natural vegetation growing on the land\", but if a tree destroys your property, the courts also will not suppose that the neighbor has a right to negligently destroy your house. See [Scott v McCarty](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2533344/scott-v-mccarty/), 41 So. 3d 989, [Gallo v. Heller](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1111782/gallo-v-heller/), 512 So. 2d 215\\. Therefore, a lawsuit would have to focus on the extent of actual damage \u2013 it has to be more than a nuisance. Also, the principle that \"it is wiser to leave the individual to protect himself, if harm results to him from this exercise of another's right to use his property in a reasonable way\" does not mean that you cannot trim the tree at all: you may be able to mitigate the problem without damaging the tree. You almost certainly will have to accept some level of \"trespass\" from the vegetation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Florida, a homeowner is dealing with a neighbor's pygmy date palm that grows diagonally over the property line.

There are a few questions here.\n\nFirst, is the message protected by copyright? In general, it probably is, but there are many exceptions that might allow you to use it without permission. Unfortunately, these exceptions vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The exceptions tend to allow the use of small excerpts of a work for various sorts of purposes that don't undermine the copyright holder's ability to profit.\n\nThat leads to the second question, which is why you are using that message. If you're including it in your source code so you can test whether a message generated at run time is in fact that message, that's one thing, and it's probably okay. On the other hand, if the owner of the copyright sells a database of all its message strings, and you're compiling a similar database that you also intend to sell, that's probably not okay.\n\nA third question concerns the Firefox license terms. It's entirely possible that they allow you explicitly to do what you're considering, in which case it doesn't matter what copyright law says about it. On the other hand, Firefox is open source software, and under some open source licenses, if you incorporate any of the source code in your own product, you are required to release your product's source code under the same license.

While error messages can be protected by copyright, there are often exceptions that allow for limited use, especially for purposes that don't undermine the copyright holder's interests. The developer should consider:\n\n1. Copyright protection and potential exceptions in their jurisdiction.\n2. The purpose of using the error message (e.g., for testing vs. commercial compilation).\n3. Firefox's specific license terms, which may explicitly allow or restrict such use.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because error messages can be protected by copyright.

In other words does the image on the source website stay in the public domain?\n\nNote: I have cropped the image to use in my profile.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My answer assumes that the photo you found is in fact in the public domain. See [here](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/ \"here\") for how works can enter the public domain (in your case, you're hoping that it was \"dedicated\" by the photographer, and not otherwise assigned to some third party who is not the photographer, e.g., his employer).\n\nAssuming it's in the public domain, what this means is that nobody has any of the exclusive rights to the work anymore (see [17 U.S.C. 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106)). \n\nNow, a bit of property law. You can imagine the list of exclusive rights listed above as a handful of post it notes. One says, \"to reproduce the copyrighted work...\" Another says \"the right . . . to display the copyrighted work publicly.\" Someone who owns all of these exclusive rights can do anything he wants with them. He can give one of the post\\-it notes away permanently (assignment) to another person, or he can give it away temporarily (usually, a license). He can give away just one, or all at the same time.\n\nThe terms of this website are effectively requiring you to let SE borrow, forever, the post\\-it note that says \"publicly display\" **so that they are not violating your exclusive right of public display**.\n\nHowever, this assumes you even own that exclusive right (post\\-it note). Something in the public domain no longer has any rights (post\\-its). No exclusive rights exist at all with respect to such a public domain work *in copyright*.\\*\n\nTherefore, since you do not possess any copyright rights with respect to a public domain work, you have nothing to give to SE, and so you have not given anything to SE.\n\nThe answers to your questions therefore are \"no you have not licensed anything\" and \"yes it stays in the public domain\".\n\n* Other rights can apply to images, such as trademark.

Are you a US citizen?\n\n\t* For a person who is a citizen of the United States and at least one other country, is it okay simply to answer *yes*?\n\t* For a person who is a citizen of multiple countries, not including the United States, is it okay simply to answer *no*?\n2.

Does it matter if one of those countries is the US?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Yes. A multi\\-nation citizen who has US citizenship has equal US citizenship with every other citizen; therefore the answer to this binary question is \"Yes\". The citizenship(s) of anyone who does not have US citizenship is irrelevant to this question; thus, the answer to this binary question is \"No\".\n2. Yes. The main point here is to determine if you have the relevant documents and permissions to be legally present in the US. If you are a US citizen, a) this makes the process easier for you and b) avoids any possible issues if evidence is found of citizenship from another country, which will make immigration think that A) you are not a US citizen and b) you lied to them. Most people have only a single citizenship. That is the default mindset of immigration. There's no downside for you to inform them; there may be additional difficulties, delays, and scrutiny if you do not.\n\nIf you are not a US citizen, most of the same applies. Additionally, lying (even by omission) can be grounds to have your legal status revoked.\n\nIn summary, if you have the legal *right* to be in the US (e.g. US citizen, legal resident) being fully honest cannot hurt you, and can make the process smoother.

A tip is an amount of money paid by a third party to the employee without a legal obligation in addition to a service owed to the employer.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThe base *Salary* can never be paid in anything but Euros.\n\nMakes sense, how would you determine whether 2 apples, an egg and a parttime timeshare of a camel each month are above or below the minimum wage? How would the employee pay their own costs from that, even it it were worth more? Taxes would be a nightmare. Good luck to the Ex\\-Wife and kid, getting half an apple and a stinky camel timeshare for a day as alimony. No, money is there for a reason.\n\n*Benefits* like bonuses or additional agreements on top of your basic salary *can* be goods of other kinds. Loot boxes for example. Please note that the employee has to explicitely agree on that. I will assume getting an *additional* lootbox on top for free is something an employee can agree on without a second thought. Getting parts of your salary normally paid in Euros or bonus normally paid in Euros as Lootboxes would be something the employee would have to explicitely agree to, otherwise it must be Euros. You cannot \"force\" an employee to accept anything but Euros.\n\nNote the sentence that the employer can give the employee goods instead of Euros not for their made up \"sale\" price, but for the cost of making them. So for no profit. You could pay someone partially in loot boxes, but since a loot box costs about 0,01\u20ac to make (electricity, database maintenance, the developer who has to press the button once a month), that would be a *lot* of loot boxes to pay a part of the salary.\n\nAnd yes, even \"goods\" will be taxed.

You're free to launch the app as a separate website, or print out the flyers and hand them to people on the bus, or publish your own monthly magazine comparing various platforms, so you still have freedom of speech and of the press.\n\nAs an example, if you write a letter about how great the government of North Korea is to the letters department at Stamp Collectors Magazine, and they don't publish it, have they violated your human rights?\n\nThe app store restriction may be quite dumb.

Apple rejects the app from its App Store, citing a guideline that prohibits referencing third-party platforms. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) Apple's rejection of the app is a clear violation of the developer's freedom of speech and press rights as protected by the US Constitution.\n\nB) The developer can sue Apple for censorship and force them to accept the app into the App Store.\n\nC) Apple's rejection does not violate freedom of speech rights because, as a private company, it can set its own rules for its platform.\n\nD) The developer's constitutional rights are being infringed, but only if they are unable to distribute the app through any other means.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Apple, as a private company, has the right to set its own rules and guidelines for its App Store. This does not constitute a violation of freedom of speech or press rights as protected by the US Constitution, which primarily restricts government actions, not those of private entities. The developer still has the freedom to distribute their content through other channels, such as websites or other app stores. While Apple's policy may be restrictive, it does not infringe on the developer's constitutional rights. Options A and D incorrectly assume that constitutional protections apply to private company decisions. Option B is incorrect because the developer cannot force a private company to accept their product if it violates the company's guidelines."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52932/remedy-for-breach-of-contract-with-a-no-assignment-clause", "docs_id": 52932, "title": "Remedy for breach of contract with a &quot;No Assignment&quot; clause", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It is common for written contracts between entities to contain a \"No Assignment\" clause, which essentially states that, for a contract between entities *A* and *B*, the benefits or rights under the contract *A* cannot be assigned to another entity *C* without the consent of *B*.\n\nIt is possible for a breach of contract by *B* to precipitate the dissolution of *A*. (Examples: If *B* poaches a key member of *A*, or if the existence of *A* as a going concern depends entirely on its contract with *B*.) In such an event, it appears that a \"No Assignment\" clause would in effect make *B* immune to any liability claims, because *A* no longer exists and the contract could not be assigned to any beneficiary of *A*.\n\nNot a perfect analogy, but in playground terms this is sort of like Bob and Al agreeing, \"Let's build a sandcastle.

The dissolution of Company A due to B's breach doesn't automatically invalidate potential claims against B.\n\nLegal doctrines exist to prevent parties from unfairly benefiting from their own wrongdoing. In this case, Company A's beneficiaries or representatives (such as a trustee in bankruptcy) may still have standing to pursue claims against Company B for its breach, despite the \"No Assignment\" clause.

I go to Google and find some pictures with copyright, save them on my phone and send them to my friends without any commercial purpose.\n\nDo I commit a crime in this case? Do I break the EU's or US's laws in this case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Technically, downloading such pictures and sending them to others is copyright infringement, unless they have been released under a license which permits sharing them with others.\n\nCopyright infringement is not a crime. It is a ***tort***. That means the copyright owner can sue, if and when the owner learns this has happened, and chooses to bring a court action. As that would involve paying a lawyer, and court fees, and other expenses, most owners will not bring such a suit unless they think the damages are likely to be large enough to make it worth their time and trouble, over and above getting their expenses back. Most copyright owners would not bother to sue over personal sharing of pictures posted on the net. However, that is the choice of the owner to make, if they learn of the sharing.\n\nNote that, if instead of attaching a picture to an email, one sends a link, there is no copyright infringement involved, even technically.\n\nWhile the details of copyright laws differ in different countries, the information above is true for both the US and the EU, and most if not all other countries.\n\nOne of the ways in which copyright laws differ between countries is in the exceptions to copyright that are available. In the US there is the somewhat complex concept of \"fair use\". Being personal and non\\-commercial use does not automatically make something fair use, although it helps support a finding of fair use. Some EU countries have a specific exception for personal use. I believe that India has such an exception also. Many countries have exceptions for news reporting, use in classroom teaching, parody, and various other cases.\n\nI said above tyht copyright infringement is not a crime. That is not always true. Under [17 USC 506](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#506) infringement can be criminal, but **only** if the infringement is:\n\n1. willful;\n2. for private financial gain or commercial advantage; and  \n\n3A) of works valued at over $1,000, or  \n\n3B) of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, knowingly preempting such distribution by electronic posting.\n\nI believe that there are similar limits on criminal copyright infringement in the laws of other countries.\n\nBeyond that, the current policy of the US Department of Justice is to prosecute criminal copyright infringement **only** when it is done on a bulk basis, as a business. In particular, mass reproduction and sale of CDs and DVDs without permission may be prosecuted.\n\nComments point out that a plaintiff may, in the US, elect to receive statutory damages, instead of actual damages, and in that case need not prove any financial loss. This is true, but the damages may be as low as $750 per work infringed (not per copy) or as low as $200 for \"innocent infringers\". The amount is set by the court, as it thinks just.\n\nIt is also true that a US court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs, under 17 USC 505\\. But this is wholly in the court's discretion, it is in no way automatic, and I understand is typically not awarded in \"minor\" cases.
