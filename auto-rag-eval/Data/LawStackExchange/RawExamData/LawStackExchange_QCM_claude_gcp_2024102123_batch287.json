            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A few years ago a woman I was dating asked me to cosign on a loan for a vehicle. I did so, and all was fine for 2 years. Then after a bad breakup, she stopped making payments.\n\nThe bank sent out a notice of voluntary surrender to both her and myself to be signed and sent back. I personally did not sign the form as one of the lines in the paper said \"If the property does not sell for the total amount owed, I will be responsible for the unpaid amount.\" As I took this to mean that I alone would have to pay this back. (Nowhere in the letter did it state that there were cosigners or two parties involved) She, on the other hand, did sign the paper that was sent to her and return it to the bank.\n\nSeveral months later I have received word that I, as well as her, are being sued for the rest of the amount owed on the vehicle after the sale, which comes to a total of $4800\\. As I have not signed the release and she did, is she responsible for the amount owed? I have not only the original letter, but also the emails from the bank about the release and a recording of the bank manager telling me that she signed the form and I did not (I'm in Missouri, where one party can record their conversations.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no significance to using the words \"I\" or \"we\", nor does it matter that you didn't sign the surrender paper (after al, you did not have possession of the vehicle and it is not yours to surrender). You will have gotten a notice, at the beginning of this process (when the loan was taken out) that provides information like [this](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0215-co-signing-loan), in particular\n\n> The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to\n> collect from the borrower. The creditor can use the same collection\n> methods against you that can be used against the borrower, including\n> suing you or garnishing your wages. If this debt is ever in default,\n> that fact may become a part of your credit record.\n\nWhen you are a loan co\\-signer, that means the creditor can go after you and you alone to get the money. Since it seems the creditors are pursuing you both, that beats the alternative that you have to sue her to get anything.\n\nSince there is no question that money is owed, the point of the trial is to decide who pays it: it will be one or both of you, and it won't be that the bank has to take a loss. Your attorney's job is to argue that it should not be you (her attorney's job is to argue that it should be you). Your concern should be that it's too difficult to get the money from her, and easy to get the money from you, which is why you need to hire a good attorney.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a co-signed loan where one party stops making payments after a breakup, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the co-signer's legal responsibility?\n\nA) The co-signer is not responsible for the debt if they did not sign the voluntary surrender form.\n\nB) The co-signer is only responsible if the primary borrower cannot be located or refuses to pay.\n\nC) The co-signer is fully responsible for the debt, regardless of whether they signed the voluntary surrender form or not.\n\nD) The co-signer's responsibility is nullified if the primary borrower signed the voluntary surrender form.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As a co-signer on a loan, you are fully responsible for the debt, regardless of whether you signed the voluntary surrender form or not. The fact that the primary borrower signed the form does not release the co-signer from their obligation. Co-signers are equally liable for the full amount of the debt, and creditors can pursue either or both parties for repayment. The voluntary surrender form is not relevant to the co-signer's legal responsibility, which was established when they initially co-signed the loan. This is why it's crucial to understand the risks involved in co-signing before agreeing to do so."

The requirement is thus legally toothless at present.

The rules are described as \"legally toothless\" in their current form. The only situation where penalties might apply is if there was intentional wrongdoing, specifically an \"intention to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain.\" Therefore, if a company is simply overwhelmed by the volume of complaints and unable to respond to all of them in time, they are not subject to any specific statutory penalty, making option D the correct answer."

The NDA is very broad saying \"never talk about anything you learn while in this position\". If the person asks \"can I talk about things that I learned after they become public knowledge\" and they receive the answer\"yes\" but this all happens in a separate communication (e.g. a chain of emails). Would signing the original agreement invalidate the public knowledge part? What if the contract has some sort of integration/merger clause?\n\nAnother example is Bob is offered a job and asked to sign a boilerplate employee contract. The contract states that payable hours are only those done in the workplace. Bob asks his manager if he can be compensate for travel time and the manager says yes. If Bob signs the original boilerplate employee contract, does he wave his right to get paid for travel time? \n\nI ask because I know sometimes administratively it may be difficult to change a contract. For example if it's boiler plate or if it's done online and requires replaces a file on a server etc. Is it sufficient just to have written communication even if it's prior to the signing? \n\nThis is different than the linked to question at the top, because that asks about clarifying an interpretation, but here I'm wondering about a more substantial change to a contract. \n\nUPDATE: thanks to all who answered.

See the [case law citation](https://www.leagle.com/decision/200866176calrptr3d5851616) (specifically the excerpt that \"*The court generally may not consider extrinsic evidence of any prior agreement or contemporaneous oral agreement to vary or contradict the clear and unambiguous terms of a written, integrated contract*\") given in [this comment](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38269/if-a-party-says-something-about-interpretation-of-contract-is-it-binding#comment69456_38270).\n\n> I know sometimes administratively it may be difficult to change a contract.\n\nThat is the drafter's excuse for potentially disavowing at a later time whatever concession was agreed upon \"on the side\". For practical purposes, the protocol or administrative \"difficulties\" can usually be overcome by establishing the sought change(s) and making explicit reference(s) to the contract on which the change(s) would apply.\n\nA court will not care *why* the prior or extrinsic agreement was not duly memorialized/incorporated in the contract.

The contract states that only hours worked at the office are compensable. Before signing, Bob emails the HR manager asking if he can be paid for travel time, and the HR manager replies \"Yes\" via email. Bob then signs the original contract without any modifications. Later, the company refuses to pay Bob for his travel time. Which of the following is most likely to be true?\n\nA) The email exchange creates a binding modification to the contract, and Bob is entitled to payment for travel time.\nB) Bob can use the email exchange as evidence to prove the company's intent, which will override the written contract.\nC) The signed contract supersedes the email exchange, and Bob is not entitled to payment for travel time.\nD) Bob can claim promissory estoppel based on the HR manager's email, which will allow him to receive payment for travel time.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, when parties sign a written contract, it supersedes any prior agreements or discussions. The signed document takes precedence over previous communications, even if those communications suggested changes or modifications to the terms. In this case, although Bob received an email from the HR manager agreeing to pay for travel time, by signing the original contract without modifications, Bob agreed to its terms as written. The contract's language stating that only hours worked at the office are compensable would be enforced, regardless of the earlier email exchange. This illustrates the importance of ensuring that all agreed-upon terms are incorporated into the final written contract before signing."

You are expected to know what the laws are in whatever jurisdiction you are in, and cannot say \"I didn't know that that was against the law\". There is no requirement that you know all facts of the world that enter into a determination of legal guilt. Indeed, typically for a criminal conviction, it is required that the person know (\"or should know\") that the facts of the situation match what the law describes, and knowing that you still do the act. The crime of fraud requires that you *know* that the claim that the other party relies on is false, thus being factually mistaken is not a crime.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the context of interpreting the U.S. Constitution, what is the distinction between textualism and originalism? Are the two approaches applied much outside of the U.S. in other contexts?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is generally held that Textualism is a kind of Originalism, which is a set of theories: these theories have something in common, which sets them apart from Minimalism or Living Constitiutionalism. The problem is that it is very difficult to establish a defining canon for Originalism, whereas Textualism is a newer development prominently associated with Scalia. There are three related theories: Original Intent, Textualism, and Original Public Understanding, subsumed under the umbrella of Originalism. The textual difficulty is finding a (somewhat) contemporary advocate of Original Intent or Public Understanding who maintains that theory in the face of Textualism, so that we can see the essential principles that distinguish the theories.\n\nSmith ([\"Why originalism won\u2019t die\u2026\"](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/djclpp/vol2/iss1/3/) says that\n\n> Originalism is the view, embraced by Antonin Scalia, Robert Bork,\n>  Clarence Thomas and many academic legal theorists, that the meaning of\n>  the Constitution should be settled by reference to the original\n>  understanding of those who enacted its provisions\n\nAs characterized by [R.G. Natelson](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2012/05/21/original-intent-original-understanding-original-meaning/), \n\n> The *original meaning* (or *original public meaning*) is how a\n>  reasonably intelligent, involved member of the public would have\n>  interpreted a provision. Primary evidence of original meaning is how\n>  words were used in common discourse and the definitions in\n>  contemporaneous dictionaries and legal sources. Circumstantial\n>  evidence includes the drafting and ratification conventions, public\n>  debates, and so forth.\n\nThe public meaning theory seems to have not gotten much traction, though it might be subsumed under an attempt within Original Intent theory to find evidence for that original intent. Scalia (the arch\\-Textualist) characterizes his \"opponent\" originalism (not textualists) saying \n\n> \"Originalists believe that the Constitution should be interpreted to\n>  mean exactly what it meant when it was adopted by the American\n>  people.\" (quote from Scalia AUSTIN AM.\\-STATESMAN, May 6, 2005, copied from\n>  Smith)\n\nBork (*The tempting of America*) says that under the Original Intent view, \"a judge is to apply the Constitution according to the principles *intended* by those who ratified the document\" (emphasis added)\n\nA variant sub\\-theory is strict constructionism, and in *Common\\-Law Courts in a\nCivil\\-Law System*, \nScalia cites the case of [Smith v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/508/223/), 508 U.S. 223 \nto illustrate the difference between strict construction and textualism. In this case, \ncase where defendant was said to have \nused a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking \ncrime when he offered it in exchange for cocaine. Scalia, opining in the\nminority, rejects the majority\u2019s \"strict\" interpretation of the word\n\"use\", says \n\n> The phrase \u201cuses a gun\u201d \n>  *fairly* \\[emphasis added] connoted use of a gun for what guns are normally used for, that is, as a weapon. When you ask \n>  someone \u201cDo you use a cane?\u201d you are not inquiring whether he \n>  has hung his grandfather\u2019s antique cane as a decoration in the\n>  hallway.\n\nIn Scalia\u2019s theory, which is a formalist but not a mechanical theory, words are to be interpreted \"fairly\", rather than \"strictly\":\n\n> A text should not be construed strictly, and it should not \n>  be construed leniently; it should be construed reasonably, to \n>  contain all that it fairly means.\n\nFocusing on the difference between Scalia\u2019s theory as a representative of textualism (sometimes called \"original meaning\" theory), and his characterization of other broadly\\-construed originalist theories (strict constructionism, as identified in *Common\\-law courts\u2026*, Scalia in particular denies the relevance or even the existence of \u201cintent\u201d behind legislation. \n\n> The first and most obvious reason this is true is that, with \n>  respect to \n>  99\\.99 percent of the issues of construction reaching the courts, there \n>  *is* no legislative intent, so that any clues provided by the legislative history are bound to be false\n\nfollowed by some interesting extracts from Senate floor debate that indicates how a certain bill was passed without anyone apparently reading the relevant committee report.\n\nIn short, the difference between original intent and original meaning has to do with whether the words used in a statute are dispositive, or are they a guide to discerning the intention of the legislature where that intention is to be enforced.",

Textualism, as championed by Justice Scalia, focuses on what the text of the Constitution \"fairly means\" without trying to discern the intent behind it. Scalia argued that words should be interpreted \"reasonably, to contain all that it fairly means,\" rather than strictly or leniently.\n\nOther forms of originalism, such as original intent theory, seek to understand and apply the intentions of those who ratified the Constitution. This approach, as described by Robert Bork, aims to \"apply the Constitution according to the principles intended by those who ratified the document.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mischaracterizes textualism's focus. Option B is incorrect because textualism actually rejects the use of legislative history, not relies on it. Option D is incorrect because it confuses textualism with strict constructionism, which Scalia explicitly distinguished from his approach."

While the GDPR does allow individuals to sue data controllers for non-compliance, including the right to request information about stored data, there are several practical limitations that make such lawsuits often ineffective or impractical in cases of spam emails:\n\n1. Many spammers are criminals who don't comply with GDPR and may be difficult to identify or locate, especially if they're outside the EU.\n2. The cost of pursuing a lawsuit is often much higher than any potential damages an individual might recover from receiving spam emails.\n3. While individuals can sue for compliance (e.g., to compel fulfillment of an access request) or for damages stemming from GDPR violations, the practical benefits in spam cases are usually minimal compared to the effort and expense involved.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the ease of suing and ignores the practical difficulties. Option B is wrong as it incorrectly assumes such lawsuits are always cost-effective. Option D is incorrect because the GDPR does provide legal recourse, even if it's not always practical to pursue it."

How can I guarantee with a form that both of us cannot ditch the other in the company?\n\nIn short, I want to make sure that neither of us can screw each other over in this startup (before creating the legal company) as minors.\n\nThe partner is also a minor.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If a minor enters a contract, the contract is not invalid, it is voidable. That means the minor or their guardian can at any time void the contract (in other words, the contract doesn't exist anymore); until that happens, the contract is perfectly valid. \n\nYour friend, assuming he or she is an adult, cannot void the contract. The contract is valid until you or your guardian changes their mind about it. For your friend, the contract is binding. For you, it's not binding as soon as you decide that you don't want the contract. \n\nAs Dale said, minors or their guardians can void a contract until the minor isn't a minor anymore (and for a reasonable short time afterwards). \n\nSo if *you* are a minor, that shouldn't stop you from entering the contract. Of course you should make sure that you fully understand the contract; you get protection by the law because the law assumes that you might not fully understand the consequences of the contract and get ripped off as an unexperienced person. \n\nIf your friend is a minor, you need to determine how much you trust your friend, how much he behaves like an adult, and what's the worst that can happen. For example if you inherited $50,000 and invest it all in the business, the worst that can happen could be that you lose it all. On the other hand, if you only invest your hard work to get the business up and running, worst case is that you lose the work that you invested. \n\nOf course if it is a person that cannot be trusted, then it doesn't matter how old they are, because they cannot be trusted.",

They want to create a legally binding agreement to protect their interests. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their situation?\n\nA) Any contract they sign will be automatically void because they are minors.\nB) The contract will be valid and binding for both parties until they turn 18.\nC) The contract will be voidable, meaning either minor or their guardian can nullify it at any time before reaching the age of majority.\nD) The contract will be enforceable only if co-signed by both sets of parents or legal guardians.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When minors enter into a contract, it is not automatically invalid, but rather voidable. This means that either minor or their legal guardian has the right to void the contract at any time before the minor reaches the age of majority (and for a short period afterward). Until such time as the contract is voided, it remains valid and enforceable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because contracts involving minors are not automatically void; they are voidable.\nOption B is incorrect because the contract is not automatically binding until they turn 18; it can be voided at any time before then.\nOption D is incorrect because parental co-signing is not a requirement for the contract to be valid, although it may provide additional assurance.\n\nThe key point is that while minors can enter into contracts, they have special protections that allow them (or their guardians) to nullify these agreements if they choose to do so. This protection exists because the law assumes minors may not fully understand the consequences of their contractual obligations."

It is also legal to write and publish erotic content, so long as it is not legally obscene (under the *Miller* test), and does not involve images of actual children. It is even legal to charge for such work (and many do) but the OP does not seem to want to do that.\n\nA comment mentions tax implication, although the question does not ask about them. According to [\"Do You Have to Pay Income Tax on Crowdfunded Money?\"](https://www.thebalance.com/do-you-have-to-pay-taxes-on-crowdfunded-money-4773839) from *The Balance*, The IRS definition of a gift is:\n\n> A gift proceeds from a \u2018detached and disinterested generosity,\u2019 and is made \u2018out of affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses.\u2019\" (*quoted from Internal Revenue Service. \"Number: INFO 2002\\-0112,\" Page 3\\.*)\n\nA gift is not taxable income. I gather that creating something, allowing anyone to access it, and asking those who appreciate it to donate is probably not legally income in the US, but I can find no clear statement on the matter. One would do well to consult a tax attorney on the matter if significant funds are derived from such a source. If one provides something of value in direct return for the donation, it is income, as far as I can determine, but again check if it matters to you.\n\nIf the sites is created or hosted outside the US, the laws of the countries involved may apply. Sexual content is an issue on which laws vary widely, and what is lawful in one country may be seriously illegal in another.",

If I have two database tables, both encrypted.\n\nOne table is globally available and contains user sessions. For the sake of conversation assume that globally means it's physically hosted in countries that EU might now deem equivalent in terms of protection. It holds no PII, just session status and expiry time. It also holds a user UUID that's been randomly generated but is tied to the lifespan of the user i.e. once assigned to a user it does not change.\n\nThe other table is physically hosted in EU, and holds a UUID to email mapping.\n\nIf a breach results in the first table being leaked the data is anonymous, it is only when joined with the second that that the user session can be tied to PII (email address).\n\nDoes this mean that both tables fall under GDPR and thus must be placed in EU (or equivalent), or is it sufficient that only the table containing PII is located there?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The way you describe this UUID, it is **pseudonymous** data (see [GDPR Art 4(5\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) and Recitals [28](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-28/)\u2013[29](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-29/)). That is, it is not directly identifying, but you have a mapping between pseudonyms and identifiers that can be used to re\\-identify this data. Effective pseudonymisation requires not only that the data is logically separate, but that there are effective organisational and technical measures preventing re\\-combination by unauthorized persons. Alongside with encryption, pseudonymisation is one of the safety measures that the GDPR explicitly requires whenever appropriate (see Art 25, Art 32\\).\n\nPseudonymous data is still personal data, because you can easily re\\-identify the data. The PII concept is US\\-specific and is misleading in a GDPR context, where it is not the inherently identifying characteristics of the information that matters, but the realistic ability of the data controller to single out data subjects to whom this data relates (compare Art 4(1\\) and Recital 26\\).\n\nHowever, were you to irrevocably erase the UUID\u2013email mapping, things are more tricky. There is no longer any connection with directly identifying data, so this data might be anonymous. On the other hand, such a persistent UUID still allows you to recognize/distinguish persons, so it might still be personal data. This might be the case especially when the UUID is used in long\\-lived cookies of website visitors, thus matching the GDPR's concept of an \u201conline identifier\u201d. This conclusion could be avoided by limiting reuse of UUIDs, e.g. creating a new UUID after some context\\-dependent appropriate duration.\n\nThe GDPR does not require all data to be stored in the EU, but requires international transfers of personal data to have sufficient protections. If you're processing these data in countries without adequate legal protections (like the United States), additional safeguards have to be used. Pseudonymisation could be part of such safeguards, and has been suggested by some data protection authorities in the wake of the Schrems II ruling. However, pseudonymisation alone does not make the international transfer legal, it is more of a strategy to reduce remaining risks.\n\nI think that your systems has a good chance of being OK, but not neccessarily so. If in doubt, perform a DPIA and possibly consult your data protection authority under GDPR Art 36\\. If feasible, storing/processing data only in the EEA or in countries with an [adequacy decision](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_enk) will simplify compliance. Safeguards such as pseudonymisation could be strengthened by rotating UUIDs, and by restricting access to the table with identifiers.",

It allows for the identification of individuals when combined with the email mapping, making it personal data. GDPR considers the realistic ability of the data controller to single out data subjects, not just inherently identifying characteristics. Therefore, both databases contain personal data and are subject to GDPR regulations, including restrictions on international transfers. Pseudonymisation is a recommended safety measure but does not exempt the data from GDPR compliance. The global nature of one database doesn't make it exempt; instead, it requires additional safeguards for international transfers of personal data."

The example of climate change advertisements being potentially considered partisan is due to one party denying climate change as a threat, making it a contested election issue.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because not all climate change ads are automatically partisan or illegal; it depends on the context and content.\n\nAnswer B is overly broad and not supported by the given information. The document doesn't mention a blanket ban on religious advertisements.\n\nAnswer D is also too extreme. The information doesn't suggest a ban on all issue-based advertising, only that some may be considered partisan depending on the circumstances.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the statement that the issue \"could easily change\" and depends on party platforms, highlighting the contextual nature of what constitutes partisan advertising in Canadian elections."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential consequences of this action?\n\nA) The employee has not disclosed any confidential information, as all details shared were personal.\nB) The employee has likely breached confidentiality and could face severe legal consequences, regardless of their employment status.\nC) The employee may have violated company policy while still employed, but faces no risk once they leave the company.\nD) The employee may have disclosed some confidential information, but the consequences depend on their employment contract, any non-disclosure agreements, and the company's perspective on the matter.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While the employee's dismissal is considered personal information that they can share, details about the merger and the company's plans to move development to an external partner may be considered confidential. The potential consequences depend on several factors:\n\n1. The employee's current employment contract may prohibit actions that damage the company while still employed.\n2. There may be a non-disclosure agreement in place that extends beyond the termination of employment.\n3. The company's perspective on the matter is crucial - they may not be concerned if the merger was going to become public knowledge anyway.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D, as it acknowledges the potential disclosure of confidential information while recognizing that the consequences are not clear-cut and depend on multiple factors."

But to have equations, explanations, replica of figures, and discussion, would basically be a copy of the paper, and I imagine that would be copyright infringement. Where exactly can a line be drawn?\n\nNote: There are questions on stack exchange which ask similar questions, but often in context of building up on previous research. Since the point of such a journal is just to replicate, it would seems that the aim is to build a freely available copy of the existing (perhaps paywalled, copyrighted) material, that can be freely accessed, and this is different intent than regular articles.\n\nAlso, answers regarding plagiarism aren't much help in this case as the point is to do \"explicit plagiarism\" with proper attribution.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright protection exists for the (typeset) image of an equation, so you have to recreate the equation (the final output could be indistinguishable from the original when the object is created automatically by a program and you happen to use the same program). Figures may enjoy a more protection, since they involve both the facts reported and the means of expression (rows and columns, order, subgroup, labels). Explanations and discussion (I don't know what distinction you're getting at there) are text from the original article,and those are indeed protected by copyright, which is moderated by the \"fair use\" exception. There are various claims out there about how much you can quote with the confines of fair use, but nobody really know in the academic context (as far as I know, there is no case law in the US that tests how much quoting you can do in an academic journal). The basic rule of thumb is to quote only when the literal words are required, and otherwise re\\-express the idea.",

The line in the sand is that they cannot *prevent* a person from filming them. It would be interesting to know how many officers are actually unaware that they cannot force a person to stop filming.

IANAL.\n\n* As far as I know, illegal immigration (well, technically speaking, \"illegal entry\" is a crime (misdemeanor or felony depending on particulars).\n* To the best of my understanding, if you help someone to commit a crime, you can be charged and prosecuted (aiding and abetting?). Concealing a crime can be prosecuted (accessory after the fact?). If you deliberately plan to do so in advance, presumably you can be prosecuted for conspiracy.\n\nCombining the two points above, can people in general, and especially politicians or LEOs, be charged and prosecuted for intentionally violating immigration policies (e.g. failing to detain someone knowing their illegal status, etc...)?\n\nContext for the question: [http://fortune.com/2016/11/11/new\\-york\\-los\\-angeles\\-sanctuary\\-cities\\-donald\\-trump/](http://fortune.com/2016/11/11/new-york-los-angeles-sanctuary-cities-donald-trump/)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am answering assuming that LEO must mean \"Law Enforcement Officer\" (the abbreviation is not widely used).\n\n> can people in general, and especially politicians or LEOs, be charged\n>  and prosecuted for intentionally violating immigration policies (e.g.\n>  failing to detain someone knowing their illegal status, etc...)?\n\nThe short answer is **no**. But, they can be successfully sued for enforcing immigration laws when they do not have the legal authority to do so, and usually, state and local government officials do not have the legal authority to enforce federal immigration laws. (State and local governments are also generally prohibited from enacting state or local laws pertaining to someone's immigration status.)\n\nIn general, the only people with the authority to detain someone for violating immigration laws are immigration officers employed by the federal government. They have absolute discretion in how they enforce federal immigration laws and are free to systematically or on a case by case basis choose not to enforce those laws, as are the executive branch politicians to whom they report. \n\nOne of the main reasons that state and local officials cannot enforce immigration laws is that this would interfere with this exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government over immigration and with the absolute discretion of federal officials to decline to enforce the immigration laws or to enforce immigration laws merely on a selective basis.\n\nState and local officials have authority in this regard only if they are expressly authorized to do so by law, and then, only if the state or local government chooses to cooperate by allowing their officials to be used for that purpose. \n\nGenerally speaking, the federal government authorizes state and local jail administrators to detain someone pursuant to an immigration hold if the state and local government authorizes the jail to do so. But, usually state and local officials do not have the authority to arrest someone solely for being in the U.S. without having a valid and current immigration status. This authority is largely reserved to Homeland Security officials, although FBI agents in the Justice Department probably also have this authority.\n\nIn contrast, generally speaking, someone detained by a state and local law enforcement officer who enforces a federal immigration law, despite not having the legal authority to do so, could prevail in a lawsuit against the state or local law enforcement officer for violating the civil rights of a person detained by someone who had no legal authority to do so. Such suits have prevailed repeatedly in Phoenix, Arizona where a rogue sheriff attempted to enforce federal immigration laws despite not having the legal authority to do so.\n\nThus, the assumption that the kind of actions involved, for example, in \"sanctuary city\" policies are intentional violations of immigration law is ill\\-founded (violating a mere \"policy\" that is not actually a law is by definition never illegal). Generally speaking, there are no immigration laws violated. \n\nA \"coyote\" is intentionally violating an immigration law as is someone sneaking over the border when not legally authorized to do so. Someone who doesn't participate in the act of illegal entry, and who does not violate federal employment laws related to immigration (basically requiring an I\\-9 to be filled out and filed with the federal government), is violating no law.\n\nAs a matter of constitutional law, the federal government does not have have the constitutional authority to compel state and local government officials to enforce federal law (although it can authorize and \"bribe\" state and local governments to do so). Subject to applicable state law, for example, a city government has every right to declare itself a \"sanctuary city\" and refrain from actively assisting the federal government's enforcement of federal immigration laws.\n\nAlso, politicians and state and local prosecutors are absolutely immune from legal liability in connection with performance of their official duties, and law enforcement officers have qualified immunity for their acts. \n\nIn particular, law enforcement and prosecutors have essentially absolute discretion to refrain from choosing to enforce any law, and their politician bosses have broad authority to direct how they will exercise this discretion. For example, in general, even if a prosecutor and law enforcement know to an absolute certainty that someone is a serial killer, and can effortlessly arrest that person without any risk of harm to anyone and at minimal expense, they have no enforceable legal duty under U.S. law to try to arrest that person or prosecute that person for any crime. Failing to enforce a known violation of the law is not a crime (unless the failure to enforce is caused by a bribe).\n\nMany millions of people who reside in the United States are deportable but have not committed any crime, so rendering assistance to someone is deportable is not *per se* assisting someone in the commission of a crime, even after the fact, and indeed, many public officials have a legal duty to aid all \"persons\" in protecting their legal rights, including people who are deportable.",

According to the information provided, state and local governments do not have a legal obligation to enforce federal immigration laws. The federal government cannot compel state and local officials to enforce federal law, and these officials have discretion in how they allocate their resources. Declaring a \"sanctuary city\" and instructing local law enforcement not to actively assist in federal immigration enforcement is generally within a mayor's legal authority.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the mayor is not conspiring to violate federal law; rather, they are choosing not to actively assist in its enforcement, which is within their rights.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because local law enforcement officers following the mayor's instructions are not aiding and abetting illegal immigration. They are simply not actively participating in federal immigration enforcement, which is not a legal requirement for them.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because while the federal government might disagree with sanctuary city policies, cities have the right to determine how they allocate their resources and are not legally obligated to assist in federal immigration enforcement.\n\nAnswer D correctly reflects the legal principle that state and local governments have discretion in how they interact with federal immigration enforcement, and choosing not to actively participate is generally within their legal rights."

For example one could crochet potholders with the image of a Little Einstein character. This is generally not possible without the permission of the design's creator (or whoever owns the copyright). There is a widespread belief that non\\-commercial exploitation is allowed, under a \"[fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info)\" analysis: this is only true to a miniscule degree. If you copy without permission, you may be sued, and your attorney could try to raise a fair use defense. One of the factors allowing exploitation is the commercial nature of the use (where a non\\-commercial exploitation would be more consistent with \"fair use\"). Another factor is the \"transformative\" nature of an exploitation, meaning that the more you change the original, the better off you are. Probably working against you would be \"effect on market\", since offering something for free is likely to negatively affect the rights\\-holder's market share. Even if a rights holder does not currently sell a particular version of a product, such as a PDF version of a book, they might potentially wish to exploit a market. Even if there is no current Little Einstein crocheted potholder, your product would clearly have a huge impact on that potential market. Also working against you would be the amount and substantiality of the copying. In text copying, you can usually copy a short paragraph from a book, whereas the designs you are likely to put out there would be pretty much the whole thing.\n\nCounting on a fair use defense is pretty risky, unless it is based on one of the two fairly clearly established types of use (text copying of short illustrative quotes to prove / exemplify a point, and private\\-use copying of 40 pages or less of a publication). As far as I know, Disney is very protective of their property rights. The best way to determine if a particular use is allowed is to describe the use and formally request permission from the rights\\-holder. If they say \"No, absolutely not\", that would be a reason to ask your lawyer if s/he thought that you could mount a fair use defense against infringement.\n\nAnother issue to consider is whether the design enjoys protection as a trademark. Unlike copyright, trademark is not automatic, but you can search the [US trademark database](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/search-trademark-database), though actually finding things is not trivial. In US law, there are two types of fair use defenses for trademark infringement. One is \"descriptive\" use, which address the fact that Apple computer company has a registered trademark on \"Apple\", but that doesn't mean that grocery stores have to start calling the tree fruit \"pomme\". Conceivably, some company might register a drawing of a quarter moon as a trademark, but that does not mean that nobody can then use a quarter moon as a graphic element. When someone uses an existing image / design as a trademark, they have much less control over use of that design. Little Einstein Leo would be totally outside the realm of descriptive fair use.\n\nThe other version is \"nominative\" fair use, where you are referring to the product, using only as much of the trademark as is needed to identify the thing, and not implying endorsement by the trademark owner. I could refer to Boeing, the airplane maker, as \"that plane maker with facilities in Renton\", or I could use their trademark. But using their circle\\-swoop\\-plane graphic would be beyond nominative fair use. What you are describing is well beyond any fair use concepts for trademarks in the US. Unlike copyright where some version of \"fair use\" is universal, trademark fair use is not universally recognized.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A hobbyist crocheter wants to create and distribute free patterns based on popular characters from Disney, Nintendo, and Studio Ghibli. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) It's legal because the patterns are being distributed for free and not for commercial gain.\n\nB) It's legal as long as the crocheter includes a disclaimer stating they don't own the characters.\n\nC) It's likely illegal and could result in copyright infringement claims from the companies.\n\nD) It's legal under fair use as long as the crocheter modifies the characters slightly.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Even though the patterns are being distributed for free, this doesn't automatically make it legal or fall under fair use. Non-commercial use is only one factor in fair use analysis and doesn't guarantee protection. Using recognizable characters from Disney, Nintendo, and Studio Ghibli without permission would likely be considered copyright infringement. These companies are known to be protective of their intellectual property.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because non-commercial use alone doesn't make copyright infringement legal.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because adding a disclaimer doesn't negate copyright infringement.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because slight modifications typically wouldn't be enough to qualify as fair use, especially when using well-known characters.\n\nThe safest approach would be to seek permission from the copyright holders before creating and distributing such patterns."

(1\\) A person commits the offense of impeding traffic if the person drives a motor vehicle or a combination of motor vehicles in a manner that impedes or blocks the normal and reasonable movement of traffic.\n\nA Class D violation is punishable by a fine of $65\\-$250, with the presumptive amount being $115\\.\n\nA more serious potential charge would be disorderly conduct in the second degree (ORS 166\\.025\\), a Class B misdemeanor. This would apply if \"with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, the person \\[...] obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic on a public way;\"\n\nAs far as \"none of them are individually obstructing traffic\", I might disagree. If the roundabout has plenty of space for other cars, then remaining in the roundabout unnecessarily might not in and of itself impede traffic. But here the roundabout is entirely filled with cars (those of the other drivers participating in the scheme). When there is no other available space in the roundabout, then I would argue that by remaining in it, you *are* impeding traffic: if you personally were to exit, then one more car could enter, which they otherwise cannot.\n\nThere is also a principle of joint criminal liability. Assuming that these drivers are participating in the blockade by common agreement, they have criminal liability for each other's conduct under ORS 161\\.155\\. Then under ORS 161\\.150, each one is guilty of a crime if it is \"committed by the person\u2019s own conduct or by the conduct of another for which the person is criminally liable, **or both**.\" Here it is their collective conduct that commits the crime of impeding traffic or disorderly conduct, and so they are all guilty.",

According to Oregon Traffic Code 811.130, impeding traffic is a Class D traffic violation. The drivers' collective action of blocking the roundabout and preventing normal traffic flow fits the definition of impeding traffic. The presumptive fine for this violation is $115.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even though drivers in a roundabout typically have the right-of-way, intentionally blocking traffic flow is still illegal.\n\nOption C is incorrect because intent is not necessarily required to be charged with impeding traffic. The act itself of blocking normal traffic movement is sufficient.\n\nOption D is incorrect as impeding traffic is a traffic violation, which is a form of criminal offense, not a civil matter. Additionally, their actions could potentially be charged as disorderly conduct, which is a Class B misdemeanor.\n\nThe question tests understanding of traffic laws, collective responsibility in traffic violations, and the distinction between civil and criminal matters in traffic-related incidents."

After construction, the speed limit signs are removed for a new speed study. The road is a numbered state highway and farm-to-market road with few driveways, considered to be outside an urban district. Given Texas transportation code and the concept of a \"reasonable person,\" what would likely be considered the enforceable speed limit on this road in the absence of posted signs?\n\nA) 55 mph, as per the town's existing ordinance\nB) 30 mph, as it's within town limits\nC) 70 mph, based on state law for highways outside urban districts\nD) No speed limit is enforceable without posted signs\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C (70 mph). According to Texas transportation code, a speed of 70 mph is lawful on a highway numbered by the state outside an urban district, including farm-to-market roads. The concept of a \"reasonable person\" standard would apply here. A reasonable driver would observe the highway's characteristics (6 lanes, few driveways, outside urban district) and, seeing no posted speed limit signs, would likely assume the standard highway speed limit applies. The town's unposted ordinance would not be known to a reasonable person, and the deliberate removal of the 55 mph signs suggests that limit is no longer in effect. The 30 mph limit applies to urban districts, which this road is not. Finally, while the absence of signs might create confusion, it doesn't negate the existence of a speed limit; rather, it defaults to the state-mandated limit for such roads."

Mainly I am wondering if this is referring to student aid from a community college, because I did receive student aid last year and so did my brother.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you need legal advice about how to proceed, you need to hire an attorney. We can only address questions about the general nature of law, etc. The caveat out of the way, the first question is whether financial aid is \"compensation\". [MS\u00a725\\-4\\-3(e)](http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2015/title-25/chapter-4/article-1/section-25-4-3/) in article on the Ethics Commission defines the term:\n\n> \"Compensation\" means money or thing of value received, or to be\n>  received, from any person for services rendered or to be rendered\n\nStudent aid is not necessarily compensation, but it might be. One form that it can take is as a loan, or as a grant: that is not a thing of value for services rendered. But another is e.g. work\\-study, which is employment, where you do some work and are paid for it \u2013 that is compensation. So it depends on the facts. \n\nThe other question is whether (if the aid was in the form of employment) the employer got the money to pay you from a public body. There is not a clearly applicable definition of \"public body\" in the ethics statutes. [\u00a731\\-7\\-301](http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2013/title-31/chapter-7/timely-payment-for-purchases-by-public-bodies/section-31-7-301) defines \"public bodies\"\n\n> The term \"public bodies\" shall mean all state agencies, political\n>  subdivisions, school districts, municipalities and public\n>  corporations, whether created by charter, statute or executive order,\n>  whether supported wholly or in part by public funds, or which expend\n>  public funds.\n\nThis, though, is in an unrelated section about timely payment for purchases by public bodies. The Public Records law [\u00a7 25\\-61\\-3](http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2013/title-25/chapter-61/section-25-61-3) defines a public body as\n\n> any department, bureau, division, council, commission, committee,\n>  subcommittee, board, agency and any other entity of the state or a\n>  political subdivision thereof, and any municipal corporation and any\n>  other entity created by the Constitution or by law, executive order,\n>  ordinance or resolution.\n\nThe wording is different, but there isn't a clear difference in terms of what things are covered by one definition versus another. In case you worked for a committee that was created by a city council resolution, that would not obviously be covered by first definition, but it is clearly included by the second; the first definition ties \"public body\" to public funds but the second doesn't. It is therefore difficult to tell what the law says, when the law doesn't actually give a uniform definition of the term. In case of doubt, include everything.\n\nFurther supporting an expansive legislative intent is the definition of \"public servant\" as an elected or appointed official of the government (pretty normal) and also\n\n> Any officer, director, commissioner, supervisor, chief, head, agent or\n>  employee of the government or any agency thereof, or of any public\n>  entity created by or under the laws of the State of Mississippi or\n>  created by an agency or governmental entity thereof, any of which is\n>  funded by public funds or which expends, authorizes or recommends the\n>  use of public funds; or\n> \n> \n> Any individual who receives a salary, per diem or expenses paid in\n>  whole or in part out of funds authorized to be expended by the\n>  government.\n\nIn other words, if the money can be traceable back to a governmental unit, that is probably considered to be a \"public body\". Also, \"public employee\" is defined as:\n\n> any individual who receives a salary, per diem or expenses paid in\n>  whole or in part out of funds authorized to be expended by the\n>  Mississippi State Legislature or by the governing body of any\n>  political subdivision thereof, or any other body politic within the\n>  State of Mississippi\n\nFor example, if I happen to give a lecture, not even in Mississippi, and part of my expenses are paid in part by U. Miss, then I am a \"public employee\" \u2013 not the ordinary interpretation of the term, but they can define terms as they want. \n\nThe really tricky part is that the payment does not have to be directly from a public body. You may work for a private company, but that company may be, in part, using money from a public body to pay you, and you may not know that.",

Despite these precautions, which of the following legal issues is the platform LEAST likely to face?\n\nA) Liability for copyright infringement if users post lengthy excerpts from copyrighted books\nB) Charges related to hosting illegal content if users upload child pornography\nC) Defamation claims if users post false and damaging statements about others\nD) Criminal charges for inciting violence if the platform fails to remove user posts calling for unlawful actions\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: While all of these are potential legal issues for social media platforms, copyright infringement (option A) is generally the least severe and most manageable of the listed problems. Platforms often have established procedures for handling copyright claims, such as DMCA takedown notices, and courts have recognized \"safe harbor\" provisions for platforms that respond promptly to such notices.\n\nOptions B, C, and D represent more serious legal challenges:\n\nB) Hosting child pornography, even inadvertently, can lead to severe criminal penalties and is a top priority for law enforcement.\n\nC) Defamation claims can be complex and costly to defend against, and platforms may face challenges in balancing free speech with protecting individuals from false and harmful statements.\n\nD) Incitement to violence can lead to criminal charges and is taken very seriously by authorities, especially in the current climate of concern over online radicalization.\n\nWhile copyright issues are important, they are generally easier to address through established legal frameworks and are less likely to result in criminal charges or severe reputational damage compared to the other options."

The basic idea is that on an issue of public concern, an honest opinion isn't defamatory unless it makes a reasonable listener think the speaker knows something that is in fact not true (the classic example is \"In my opinion, Jones is a liar:\" here the speaker implies he knows that Jones lied, which is a statement of fact that can be true or false).\n\nIn your example, there are questions that have to be reached before fair comment even enters into it. First off, in US law *any* defamation claim has to be for a statement that a reasonable person would interpret as being a statement of fact or (if it's an opinion) implying a statement of fact (like \"I think Jones is a liar\"). This is context\\-dependent. \"I wouldn't let my child be alone with someone like *famous convicted pedophile 1*, *famous convicted pedophile 2*, or *politician*\" is more likely to be read as \"*politician* is a pedophile.\" A marked work of fiction is unlikely to be read as a statement of fact. If the statement is read as a simple opinion, or as pure fiction, there's no defamation under US law.\n\nOnce we've established that an express or implied statement of fact is at issue, fair comment asks whether the fact is true or false and whether it's an issue of public concern. But in the US, with a politician, you'd never go for the fair comment defense, because you have a much stronger defense \\-\\- a politician can only win the suit if they show that not only is the statement false, but the speaker actually knew or strongly suspected that it was false. It's not enough that a reasonable person would suspect it's false; it has to reach the level of recklessness, which is *extremely* hard to show (public figures in the US do not often win defamation suits). This is strictly easier than for fair comment.\n\nIf the politician wasn't a politician, and was actually a private figure, then fair comment could enter into it. In that case, the question is whether the statement is a reasonable opinion drawn from the (true) facts that lots of people didn't want their daughters alone with the person. While it's context\\-dependent, that could very well be fair comment.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A popular novelist writes a work of fiction featuring a character based on a well-known politician. In the story, the protagonist expresses concern about leaving his college-aged daughter alone with this character. The politician, upset by this portrayal, considers suing for defamation. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential legal outcome?\n\nA) The novelist is likely to be found guilty of defamation because the character is clearly based on a real person.\n\nB) The politician will easily win the case because the story implies improper behavior without direct evidence.\n\nC) The novelist has a strong defense against defamation due to the work being labeled as fiction and the politician's status as a public figure.\n\nD) Fair comment would be the best defense for the novelist, regardless of the politician's public figure status.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The novelist has a strong defense against defamation for two main reasons:\n\n1. The work is labeled as fiction, which makes it less likely to be interpreted as a statement of fact by a reasonable person. In U.S. law, defamation claims must be based on statements that a reasonable person would interpret as fact.\n\n2. The politician's status as a public figure provides significant protection for the novelist. In the U.S., public figures face a much higher bar in winning defamation suits. They must prove not only that the statement is false, but also that the speaker knew it was false or had strong suspicions about its falsity, acting with \"actual malice\" or reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nOption A is incorrect because being based on a real person doesn't automatically make fictional portrayals defamatory. Option B is wrong because public figures face a high burden of proof in defamation cases. Option D is incorrect because while fair comment could be a defense, it's not the strongest or most relevant one in this case given the politician's public figure status and the fictional nature of the work."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is inspired by the discussion in the comments of [this answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/72866/3066) to another question. In those comments I claimed that the estate of a deceased person is not a legal entity and that it is the personal representatives (executors if testate, administrators if intestate) who hold legal title to the assets of the estate and can sue and be sued in relation to those assets. That assertion was challenged by several people, which leads me to wonder if this is something which varies by jurisdiction.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, I'm taking \"legal entity\" to mean an entity which can hold legal title to an asset and be named as a party to a lawsuit in relation to that asset. There was some talk in the discussion about entities being *represented* in court by a natural person, but I do not consider that the same as being the person named as the party. So e.g. an assertion that \"*to sue for the assets in an estate, you sue the executor*\" would suggest that an estate is *not* a legal entity, while \"*to sue for the assets in an estate, you sue the estate itself which is then represented in court by the executor*\" would suggest that it *is* a legal entity.\n\n**Is the estate of a deceased person a legal entity?**\n\nGiven the level of disagreement, I'd prefer if possible to see jurisdiction tags and citations of which at least one is an authoritative legal source (ideally primary sources such as legislation or precedents, but secondary sources such as legal textbooks, journal articles, or practice notes aimed at practitioners would suffice).\n\nIt was pointed out that the IRS refers to an estate as a legal entity but my research indicates that carries a different meaning to the legal one and is relevant only in the context of federal tax filings. If intending to cite the IRS I'd be grateful if this could be backed up with a legal source to show that their use of \"legal entity\" carries the same meaning as the one defined above.\n\nI will self\\-answer to provide some citations which I believe support my proposition.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Good news: it behaves *like* a legal entity.\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAn estate is a collection of assets and liabilities that belonged to the deceased. The collection behaves a great deal like an LLC or other legal entity, *although states don't call it that*.\n\n* The collection is isolated from anyone else's collection of assets and liabilities. For instance, it's not part of the executor's personal assets, nor liabilities. That's very important because...\n* If the collection is *sued* e.g. by a creditor, the suit can only make claims against assets in the \"collection\". That is to say, the executor's own assets are not at risk. **That's very important if you're thinking about volunteering to become an executor or manager of a trust. You can do so without fear of personal liability**. Asterisk here \\*, but don't panic, it's a harmless asterisk.\n* The collection can buy and sell goods and services (more the latter generally). A typical service purchased by an estate is storage unit rental.\n* The collection can hire, fire and generally do business. Consider an estate which owns an apartment building. Life goes on: rent must be collected, utilities paid, leaky toilets fixed, contractors and managers hired and fired. In this case, the estate is *a going\\-concern business* behaving a lot like an LLC.\n* The collection/estate could potentially do business *indefinitely*, if the will of the heirs is to continue doing so. This might happen if splitting the assets equitably amongst the heirs wasn't possible (e.g. the estate of Leonard Cohen collects a lot of royalties)... or too complex to easily back out of (say: the deceased owned 5 McDonalds franchises and had bet the farm on opening two more; backing out now would bankrupt the estate, so the estate might oddly open two McDonalds.)\n* The collection can also sue, and proceeds from the suit or settlement go into the collection. Asterisk again. \\*\n* The collection has its own Taxpayer Identification Number (aka SSN or EIN).\n* The collection files its own 1040 tax form, and may do so for years or even decades.\n\n### The point of all these practical examples is that an estate *looks, walks and quacks* like a \"legal entity\". To the point where the IRS even calls it one.\n\nAnd to a boots\\-on\\-ground executor, manager or trustee, the reality is it handles like a legal entity, and the experience you have managing legal entities will largely apply, almost in full. Almost.\n\n\\* Now, that asterisk. Due to state court rules in many states, if you attempt to sue an estate, you have to use the right name. *And that's what this question is all about.*\n\nIt's a naming convention, and that is all.\n------------------------------------------\n\nAnd courts treat it as such.\n\nTake *Roe v. Wade*. \"Roe\" is an adaption of \"Doe\" as in \"John Doe\". Wade, however, was the district attorney of Dallas County at the time of filing. Wade wasn't being sued *personally*. It's just the quirky naming convention the court uses.\n\nWhat you have identified is a similar quirk in court rules, where instead of suing\n\n* Estate of John Q. Example,\n\nthe syntactically correct thing is to sue\n\n* Jane Doe, *in the capacity of, Executor of John Q Example's estate*.\n\nAnd the italic parts are optional, because the court knows that.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nIt's not important, and that's what the Florida Court of Appeals said in [florida](/questions/tagged/florida \"show questions tagged 'florida'\") [Spradley v Spradley 213 So. 3d 1042 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2017](https://casetext.com/case/spradley-v-spradley-5). The plaintiff had made exactly the above error: suing \"the estate of\" instead of suing \"Derreck Spradley et.al. (implied: in their capacity as executor)\". The judge threw out the case, saying in essence \"You forgot to \"dot an i\". The appeals court said no, the distinction is trivial and the court should have simply let the brother \"dot their i\" and continue with an entirely valid case.\n\nIn other words, **it was a distinction without a difference**.\n\nSo if sued, the executor should not panic about being \"named personally\" in the suit \\- you're not personally liable. And it is a waste of time to pick nits over how the name of the defendant is spelled, so says the Florida court at least... and in my humble opinion that precedent would be well received in other state courts, as it avoids wasting docket time and citizen filing fees on an action that will simply be re\\-filed correctly the next day.\n\nNot a license to cheat, however.\n--------------------------------\n\nOne way an executor *can* manage to create personal liability is to abuse or mishandle the role with extreme negligence. In that case, yes, the executor's personal assets could come under fire, basically as punishment for misdeeds. An executor who is careful, honest and gets help when needed won't have any trouble at all.",

Nobody, certainly not the state, represents the birth records as inerrant or complete. Birth records frequently have to be corrected. In fact the point of many paternity suits is to correct the official birth record. Sometimes the father, or even the mother will be listed as \"unknown\" on the birth record, so the absence of a birth record naming a person as a father is not dispositive. No government official would ever issue a legal document declaring that the man is not any child's legal father because the records don't establish that. At best they could issue a document stating that the man was not the father of record for any child in the state.\n\nAnyway, the exercise would be pointless. The only birth record the court would be interested in would be that for the child before them. None of the other birth records would be relevant to the case at hand.\n\nThe court in a paternity case would ask for evidence, such as birth certificates, or statements acknowledging paternity. If the two parties continued to dispute paternity, the court would order a paternity test.

This aligns with the legal requirements outlined in the Data Protection Act 2018, which focuses on confirming identity rather than specifically requiring a matching signature. If UKVI has doubts about Sarah's identity, they may request additional information. This approach allows Sarah to initiate the process honestly while giving UKVI the opportunity to verify her identity through other means if necessary.

Thus state/country borders are not an issue, yet they won't allow foreign readers to join, referring to the Patriot Act and all the complexities surrounding it.\n\nFrom their perspective, it makes sense given how expensive specialty legal counsel is, and most such non\\-profits have either gone bankrupt during the pandemic or are on the verge, but I'm still interested if this (i.e., citing the Patriot Act) has merit (or any other laws or statute that I'm not aware of).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First off, no the Patriot Act would not stop you from participating in this organization (The Patriot Act broadened the definition of Terrorism and types of crimes that might constitute terrorism, the ability to investigate potential security threats to the United States mostly through loosening restrictions on Warrants for such investigations.).\n\nSecond and more pedantically, the Patriot Act is no longer law as of March 27, 2020 (this might have gotten lost in the news due to this being the start of Covid\\-19 pandemic shut downs globally). Much of the Patriot Act's laws did live on in the form of the USA Freedom Act. But in 2022, no one will arrest you under any provision of the Patriot Act. Yay!\n\nAll that said, I am not aware of any laws restricting 501(c)(3\\) organizations from taking donations (either in monetary or in kind) from non\\-U.S. Citizens or Residents. All that the label means is that the organization is tax\\-exempt and that donors to such organizations can deduct their donation from the taxes they owe to the government (i.e. if I owe $500 in taxes but I gave $1000 to a 501(c)(3\\) that year, then I don't owe the government any tax. In fact, the government owes me a $500 rebate.).\n\nAll 501(c) organizations (there are 29 different classifications) have rules about what they may and may not do and will lose their tax\\-exempt status if they fail to abide by those rules. Each different category has different restrictions (For example, a 501(c)(3\\) may not partake in any political campaigning or lobbying as part of it's position but a 501(c)(4\\) may (though funds used for such activities are not tax\\-deductible. Really the 501(c)(3\\) status only applies for tax purposes, so if you are not filling out a U.S. Tax Return, it shouldn't matter to you (though you may want to see if your government allows donations to foreign charities to count for tax\\-deductions).\n\nBest thing to do is to reach out to the charity and ask if there are any problems with you helping given your not a U.S. resident. If there is, consider starting up a similar charity for people within your own nation... maybe even ask them if you could be a part of a chapter within your nation.",

First, the Patriot Act expired on March 27, 2020, and is no longer in effect. Second, even when it was in effect, the Patriot Act did not prohibit foreign volunteers from participating in U.S. non-profit organizations. It primarily dealt with broadening the definition of terrorism and increasing investigative powers for national security purposes. Additionally, there are no federal laws that prohibit 501(c)(3) organizations from accepting donations or volunteer services from non-U.S. citizens or residents. The USA Freedom Act, which replaced some provisions of the Patriot Act, also does not restrict foreign volunteers in non-profit organizations. The organization's policy appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the law or an overly cautious approach that is not legally required."

I am not sure if I understand the law, but it seems like you're forced to print the will and have it signed and then have two persons as witnesses sign the will in order for it to be enforceable. Is this the case in the whole of Canada?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> It seems like you're forced to print the will and have it signed and\n> then have two persons as witnesses sign the will in order for it to be\n> enforceable. Is this the case in the whole of Canada?\n\nSubject to an exception for holographic wills (in all but one Canadian province) and choice of law issues, yes.\n\n**Ordinary Written Wills And Witnessing Irregularities In Them**\n\nA will does not need to be notarized to be valid, although the notarization makes the admission of the will to probate (i.e. the court process of determining that a will is legally valid) easier.\n\nA will with one witness that is notarized by a separate person still meets this requirement, however.\n\nSome people are not eligible to witness a will. So, if a will is signed by the testator and two witnesses, but one of the witnesses is ineligible to serve as a witness (e.g. because the witness is 7 years old, or has certain prohibited conflicts of interest), there is a problem.\n\nBut, I don't know what remedy would be applied in each province. Some jurisdictions allow a witness who was ineligible at the time and is not ineligible to be a witness at the time of death to testify and cure the defect. Some jurisdictions invalidate the will. Some jurisdictions, for example, in a case where someone not allowed to be a witness due to a conflict of interest witnessed the will, validate the will but void the rights of the ineligible witness under the will.\n\n**Other Irregularities In Written Wills**\n\nSome U.S. jurisdictions (including Colorado) and some jurisdictions in Australia, recognize the validity of the will that have immaterially defective formalities that were signed with an intent to be a will and have two witnesses.\n\nFor example, these jurisdictions might validate wills when the wife accidentally signed the husband's will and the husband accidentally signed the wife's will, both intending to sign their own will, or where \"magic words\" are missing from the execution clause or notarization, or where the testator's name is spelled inconsistently or incorrectly.\n\nOntario is a strict compliance jurisdiction. Any inconsistency with the formal requirements, as set out in the *Succession Law Reform Act*, renders a will invalid.\n\nI do not know if any other Canadian provinces have a legal authorization to remedy or reform such an inadvertent error in the formal execution of a will. I suspect that some do, either by statute or case law, but don't know and don't have a good source for finding out.\n\n**Holographic Wills**\n\nA will written substantially in the handwriting of the testator (i.e. of the person making their will) and signed by the testator, also known as a holographic will, is valid in most, but not all, Canadian provinces. Some jurisdictions honor oral wills in the hand writing of the testator, even without a signature, if the text makes clear that the testator is making a will for himself or herself.\n\nThe provinces that consider handwritten wills legal are Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Saskatchewan.\n\nHolographic wills are not recognized in the province of British Columbia. But if the will was written outside British Columbia and the concerned property is within BC, then the will can be upheld by the court.\n\n**Will Contracts**\n\nEven if a document is not itself a holographic will because it lacks language clearly intending to make it one itself and instead merely promises to make a will with certain provisions, a typed writing signed by someone who late dies can sometimes be interpreted as a valid contract to make a will that is enforceable in that fashion, even thought it is not itself enforceable as a valid will.\n\n**Oral Wills**\n\nNo Canadian provinces recognize the validity of oral wills (also known as nuncupative wills), that are recognized as valid under some circumstances in other common law jurisdictions.\n\nAny will not printed out in writing is an oral will, even if it is in a typewritten record in electronic form, and even if it has an electronic signature.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nA typewritten will merely signed by the testator, and not witnesses by two witnesses (perhaps with just one witness or no witnesses), or not printed out at all, would generally be invalid.\n\n**Choice of Law Exceptions**\n\nThere is also a choice of law issue. Usually a will which is valid where entered into is valid elsewhere even if it does not meet the formal requirements of the place where it is admitted to probate at the time it is admitted to probate. This is why a holographic will executed outside of BC is valid in BC (even as to BC property) even though BC does not recognize holographic wills.\n\nMost jurisdictions with common law legal systems also require that a will be in a writing signed by the testator and witnesses by two witnesses, so usually, it doesn't matter where the will was signed.\n\nBut, for example, Colorado has recently adopted a law authorizing certain will to be valid without being printed out, but to the best of my knowledge, no Canadian province has adopted legislation to this effect.\n\nSo, if you executed an electronic will in Colorado under circumstances where it would be valid in Colorado, a Canadian court might recognize it even though it doesn't meet the standards for a valid will executed in Canada.\n\nSimilarly, if an oral will was valid where it was made, but invalid in Canada, a Canadian court might still honor it.\n\n**Exceptions For Will Substitutes**\n\nAlso note that while a will must always be in writing in Canada, there are circumstances when a trust may be established orally and without witnesses other than the person entrusted with assets.\n\nAlso, some beneficiary designations on bank accounts and insurance policies and retirement policies and transfer on death deeds, for example, that function as *will substitutes*, are not held to the formal requirements of a will, even though they dispose of property upon death just as a will does. These are usually valid if signed by the person making the designation and delivered to a third\\-party associates with the asset (or noted in real property records in the case of real property) prior to the death of the person making them.\n\n**Lost Wills**\n\nUnlike most legal documents, generally, a will is like a $20 bill, a photocopy or scanned copy is not as good as the real thing. Sometimes documents like this are called \"real documents\" or \"real instruments.\" (Original promissory notes have the same character because they can be transferred to a new owner by endorsement of the original physical promissory note.)\n\nThis rule exists because, at common law and under the law still in force today in Canada and most common law jurisdictions, a will can be revoked by physically destroying or defacing the original with an intent to revoke it.\n\nBut, in the event that an original will is destroyed by fire or other disaster or malfeasance of a third party under circumstances that indicate that there was no intent to revoke it by the testator, the will can be admitted to probate based upon a paper or electronic copy of the original with adequate testimony regarding the unavailability of the original will.\n\n**Grounds For Contesting Facially Valid Wills and Will Substitutes**\n\nA will or will substitute that meets the formal requirements for a will or will substitute may still be invalidated, in whole or in part.\n\nThe most common grounds for doing so are:\n\n* undue influence on the testator by a beneficiary of the instrument,\n* lack of testamentary capacity which invalidates the instrument,\n* inauthentic signatures that invalidate a will (i.e. a forged instrument),\n* fraud in the inducement of the instrument,\n* a benefit conveyed by the instrument to someone who subsequently slays the decedent which is rendered void by operation of law,\n* a gift in favor of someone who subsequently divorced the decedent which is rendered void by operation of law,\n* unintentionally failing to provide for a child living at the time of death which results in an implied in law gift to that child,\n* partial invalidity for failing to make adequate provision for a surviving spouse, or\n* full or partial invalidity for failing to honor a valid contract or court order to make a will with specific provisions.",

It teaches how to read Japanese.\n\nI had the idea of popular titles, most of which are probably trademarked, as example phrases. For example: Naruto (\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8), Dragon Ball (\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb), Gintama (\u9280\u9b42) and so on.\n\nIt'd be akin to an app for learning English that uses the word Mickey Mouse to teach pronunciation, I guess.\n\nDoes this infringe trademark law? I'm not using clips or logos, just showing how those words are spelled.\n\nAdditionally, can I use a known quote (well, a meme) of a show in similar way without infringing their copyright? For example: omae wa mou shindeiru \u304a\u307e\u3048\u306f\u3082\u3046\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b. (in an parallel: does using \"you're a wizard, Harry!\" to teach English pronunciation infringe H.P. copyright?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Applicability of trademark laws\n-------------------------------\n\nTrademark laws apply when you intend to use a word as the name of a brand, make, model, or otherwise the identifier of what you intend to sell. In addition, trademarks are registered within a bound domain and do not impact anything outside it. For example:\n\n* There are two Apple trademarks: One for Apple Inc., the notorious American company that sells iPhone and Mac. The other is a record label.\n* The Metro Inc. from Canada and the Metro AG from Germany cannot sue Microsoft for trademarking the word \"Metro\" for its API.\n\nApplicability of copyright laws\n-------------------------------\n\nCopyright, however, does not apply to individual names. Once a work as a whole is protected by copyright laws, no part of it may be reproduced in any way without the explicit permission of the copyright holder. But then, copyright laws of different countries are subject to such exceptions as:\n\n* Threshold of originality (whether something as a whole has enough authorship to be protected by copyright, whose purpose is to foster the growth of original art and culture); this does not apply to you.\n* The *de minimis* principle (applies when the violation of the law, including copyright, is so insignificant that the only disruption in the whole system of the governing country is the lawsuit itself)\n* The *fair use* principle (an exemption that applies to works that definitely infringe upon the core statements of copyright laws but they don't impact the author of original work significantly and actually foster the growth of art and culture). See the following:\n\n[Would it be legal to copy a small passage from a book to a website for language teaching purposes?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29148/would-it-be-legal-to-copy-a-small-passage-from-a-book-to-a-website-for-language)\n\nThe sum of all fears! (Pun intended)\n------------------------------------\n\nSo, for the usage that you mentioned, neither the trademark laws nor copyright laws hinder you.\n\nBut err on the side of caution: I've been told that while the spirit of the laws don't hinder what you explained, there were cases in U.S. in which some trademark holder attacked a party that used its mark, claiming that the latter intended to falsify association. Believe me, you don't want this to happen, i.e. you don't want to go to the court even though you win. (Not unless you have ample money, time and nerves, and are willing to waste them.)\n\nSo, publishers (well... at least, American and Canadian publishers) usually add a fineprint like this to their works:\n\n> * \"Windows\" is a trademark of \"Microsoft Corporation\". Unless stated otherwise, our use of this trademark does not imply any form of association to, or endorsement by, Microsoft Corporation.\n> * \"Harry Potter\" is an imprint of \"Scholastic Corporation\". Unless stated otherwise, our mention of the aforementioned does not imply \\[...]\n\nYour disclaimer, however, should probably be in Brazilian Portuguese, in which I am not fluent. So, you might want to use the appropriate literature. The purpose of this disclaimer is to defuse the potential lawsuit before it goes to the court. First, it reassures the trademark holder that you don't seek to abuse his/her mark. Second, if he/she is not convinced, there will be the burden of proving that your disclaimer was a lie. Going to the court isn't cheap and the burden of proof makes it more expensive. In United States, there is an additional device called \"[motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal))\" that complements this reassurance in your favor.",

The safest approach is to use the content while including a clear disclaimer that states the usage does not imply any association with or endorsement by the trademark holders.

Under which circumstances would the game developer most likely be able to include the English translation without obtaining permission?\n\nA) If the game is only sold in countries where copyright duration is 50 years after publication\nB) If the game developer creates their own new translation of the original Spanish text\nC) If the game is released as a free educational tool instead of a commercial product\nD) If the original author has been deceased for more than 70 years\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because even in countries with shorter copyright terms, the 1962 translation would likely still be protected.\nB) is correct because while the original 1939 Spanish text may be in the public domain in some jurisdictions, the 1962 English translation is likely still under copyright protection. By creating a new translation, the developer avoids infringing on the existing translation's copyright.\nC) is incorrect because the educational or commercial nature of the game doesn't change the copyright status of the translation.\nD) is incorrect because the death of the original author doesn't affect the copyright of the translation, which is held separately by the translator or publisher.\n\nThis question tests understanding of copyright duration, derivative works, and the distinction between original works and their translations in copyright law."

I also notice Google has started supporting a different programming language called [Kotlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)) on Android alongside Java, even to the point of calling it \"Google's preferred language for Android app development\". It's worth noting that Java APIs, including the contested ones are [easily accessible from Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html) by default.\n\nI'm wondering if, given Oracle wins, the legal consequences for Google would be materially different if Google was to suddenly drop support for the contested APIs on Android, (possibly by providing non infringing alternatives), while continuing to support, develop, and otherwise continue with the above projects.\n\n(I'll mention here that this is an attempt to rework [this closed question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51622/assuming-oracle-wins-google-v-oracle-america-then-does-google-have-an-incentiv) to be on\\-topic.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nDamages are restitution for events that have already happened (although the damage may be still in the future e.g. future lost earnings).\n\nHowever, if they loose, then it is likely that the judgement will contain an injunction *prohibiting* them from using the contested material in the future.\n\nThey then have 4 choices:\n\n1. stop using them and do nothing,\n2. agree licence terms from a poor negotiating position\n3. use their own alternative\n4. keep using them and go to jail for contempt of court.\n\nThey probably aren\u2019t considering number 4 but they are probably considering all the others.",

Messages sent to other users may be considered part of those users' data as well, complicating the erasure process. The company may need to retain some data for legal purposes, even after service discontinuation. While the company should inform users about data retention policies, there isn't an absolute requirement to destroy all data immediately upon service termination.

A medical professional's job is to provide care and support for their patients \\-\\- \"first do no harm\". But plainly their actions in this case can at best do nothing and at worst get them in a lot of legal trouble, or perhaps at worst damage the blood vessel or give them an infection \\-\\- though obviously that is VERY rare.\n\nGiven that you are innocent until proven guilty the only purpose of the test is to prove you guilty, and so the person administering the test is doing so with the intent of doing you harm.\n\n**Are medical personnel required to draw blood in support of police investigations even when the patient/suspect is unable to provide consent?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can look at Missouri law as an example. [Missouri Statutes \u00a7577\\.029](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=577.029) says\n\n> A licensed physician, registered nurse, phlebotomist, or trained\n> medical technician, acting at the request and direction of the law\n> enforcement officer under section 577\\.020, shall, with the consent of\n> the patient or a warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction,\n> withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol content of\n> the blood, unless such medical personnel, in his or her good faith\n> medical judgment, believes such procedure would endanger the life or\n> health of the person in custody. Blood may be withdrawn only by such\n> medical personnel, but such restriction shall not apply to the taking\n> of a breath test, a saliva specimen, or a urine specimen. In\n> withdrawing blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol content\n> thereof, only a previously unused and sterile needle and sterile\n> vessel shall be utilized and the withdrawal shall otherwise be in\n> strict accord with accepted medical practices. Upon the request of\n> the person who is tested, full information concerning the test taken\n> at the direction of the law enforcement officer shall be made\n> available to him or her.\n\n\"Shall\" means \"must\" \u2013 if there is a warrant (we assume there is no consent). Then the question is, what happens if the phlebotomist (etc) refuses? First, [\u00a7577\\.031](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=577.031&bid=29960) immunizes the medical\\-person from legal liability when they act in compliance with a request from a LEO (a simple request, not necessarily accompanied by a warrant). [\u00a7577\\.033](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=577.033&bid=29962) says that being dead, unconscious or otherwise incapable of refusing does not constitute withdrawal of consent (which is implied, by law). No specific penalty is prescribed for refusal to administer a court\\-ordered blood draw. There is no penalty for complying, there is no prescribed criminal penalty for refusing to comply with a court order (there is the possibility of a finding of contempt of court).\n\nNot every state is Missouri: I understand that Utah is different.",

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the medical professional's legal obligations in this scenario?\n\nA) The medical professional must always comply with the request, regardless of circumstances or potential health risks to the suspect.\n\nB) The medical professional can refuse without consequences if they believe the procedure violates their ethical duty to \"do no harm.\"\n\nC) The medical professional must comply if there is either patient consent or a valid court warrant, unless they believe the procedure would endanger the life or health of the suspect.\n\nD) The medical professional has no legal obligation to comply with the request and cannot face any legal consequences for refusal.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Missouri Statute \u00a7577.029, a licensed medical professional \"shall, with the consent of the patient or a warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol content of the blood.\" However, this is not an absolute requirement. The statute also provides an exception if the medical professional \"in his or her good faith medical judgment, believes such procedure would endanger the life or health of the person in custody.\" This balances the legal obligation with professional medical judgment.

There is no statute regarding emancipation, which means that the courts deal with the issue on an ad hoc basis. The process is basically that you file a petition with the Court of Common Pleas, there will be a hearing, and the judge will issue a ruling. There is no specific form, instead you would need to hire an attorney to file a petition etc. The process focuses on the specific reason for emancipation, for example \"for medical consent\", or to get around the fact that you have to go to the school in the district where your parents live. Bear in mind that what emancipation means is \"being treated as an adult\", where no court order will give you the right to purchase alcohol under\\-age. No emancipation hearing is required to receive public assistance. The Erie county page gives more information on reasons where a court hearing is not required (rights that flow from already being married, and the complication of medical consent plus the higher bar that must be clear for an abortion).

According to the information provided, Pennsylvania does not have a specific statute regarding emancipation. Instead, courts deal with emancipation cases on an ad hoc basis. The process typically involves filing a petition with the Court of Common Pleas, followed by a hearing where a judge will issue a ruling.

While using a fake name for a simple inquiry might not always be illegal, it's important to consider that:\n\n1. Some jurisdictions have laws against making false statements to government officials, even for seemingly harmless inquiries.\n2.

The employer is not likely to be a \"covered entity\", so these permissions are irrelevant. Furthermore, included in this section is a provision where disclosure is allowed in the case of\n\n> (v) An employer, about an individual who is a member of the workforce\n> of the employer\n\nwith various conditions following such as\n\n> (A) The covered entity is a covered health care provider who provides\n> health care to the individual at the request of the employer:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) To conduct an evaluation relating to medical surveillance of the\n> workplace; or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) To evaluate whether the individual has a work\\-related illness or\n> injury\n\nHowever, these permissions apply to covered entities, not employers. (\"Work\\-related\" is not defined, but having a dangerous contagious disease does clearly relate to the workplace, thus it would be reasonable but not guaranteed to consider such a disclosure to be connectable to this section).\n\n[45 CFR 164\\.510](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2bfa687d7ff15861c37082ad0a37948b&mc=true&node=pt45.2.164&rgn=div5#se45.2.164_1510) says that\n\n> A covered entity may use or disclose protected health information,\n> provided that the individual is informed in advance of the use or\n> disclosure and has the opportunity to agree to or prohibit or restrict\n> the use or disclosure, in accordance with the applicable requirements\n> of this section\n\n[\u00a7508](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2bfa687d7ff15861c37082ad0a37948b&mc=true&node=pt45.2.164&rgn=div5#se45.2.164_1508), covering required authorization (\"explicit yes\") says\n\n> Except as otherwise permitted or required by this subchapter, a\n> covered entity may not use or disclose protected health information\n> without an authorization that is valid under this section.\n\nThere is no applicable provision whereby the proposed employer policy would clearly expose the employer to legal sanctions, since HIPAA does not purport to regulate everybody, only those entities where Congress authorized it to do so, via the concept of a \"covered entity\".\n\nFurthermore, the employer is not directly revealing any personal medical information: the employee (the *other* employee) is. A vaccinated employee is allowed to wear a sticker that says \"I was vaccinated\". An imaginable application of HIPAA to vaccinated employees would be a policy of *requiring* a vaccinated employee to advertise that they were vaccinated.\n\nOne can reasonably guess that a person who does not wear a mask, given such a policy, has been vaccinated, but it is not a reasonable inference that a person who wears a mask has not been vaccinated (many vaccinated people continue to wear masks out of an abundance of caution). There is no legal basis for penalizing an employer who allows vaccinated employees to do things that weakly suggest that *other* employees have not been vaccinated.",

An unvaccinated employee claims this violates their rights.

This is the most accurate statement because:\n\n1. HIPAA primarily applies to \"covered entities\" such as healthcare providers and insurance companies, not employers like schools. The school isn't directly revealing protected health information.\n\n2. Not being vaccinated is not considered a disability under the ADA, so the policy doesn't violate ADA protections.\n\n3. While the policy doesn't clearly violate HIPAA or ADA, it could potentially face legal challenges on other grounds, such as discrimination or privacy concerns, depending on specific circumstances and local laws.\n\n4. The policy doesn't automatically expose the school to immediate legal sanctions under HIPAA or ADA.\n\n5. The inference that an employee wearing a mask is unvaccinated isn't necessarily accurate, as vaccinated individuals may choose to wear masks for various reasons.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complex interplay between workplace policies, health information privacy, and disability rights in the context of COVID-19 measures."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There seems to be the idea that the right not to self\\-incriminate does not apply to civil cases. Is that true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, One Can\n------------\n\nIn the United States, one may assert the Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify or otherwise give information that might tend to implicate the speaker in a crime. This is true in any court proceeding, civil or criminal, whether the person asserting the privilege is an accused, a witness, or a party to a civil case. It may be asserted in a Grand Jury or trial proceeding. One may also assert the privilege under police interrogation, or in an administrative proceeding. One may also assert it when testifying before Congress, a state legislature, or any local legislative body. One may also assert it when testifying before a government agency, such as the Interstate Commerce Commission. Asserting the privilege is often informally called \"pleading the Fifth\", although strictly speaking \"pleading\" is something that only an accused does (as in \"I plead not guilty\"). The availability of the privilege in civil cases has been true at least since the *Saline Bank* case of 1828 (see below).\n\nThe privilege is not available when no criminal prosecution is legally possible, such as when the statute of limitations has expired, or when the law invoked has been held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, and no other valid law applies. Thus, if an authorized government official (usually a prosecutor) offers a grant of immunity, the privilege is no longer available on matters covered by the grant, and the person asserting it must then testify on such matters.\n\nThe privilege may be asserted when the person doing so is actually guilty, or when the person is not guilty, but has a reasonable belief that the statements asked for might be used against the speaker in some current or future criminal proceeding. A person who has been tried for a crime nut had the case end in a mistrial, or a dismissal without prejudice, could still be re\\-tried for that accusation, and so may assert the privilege.\n\nAny assertion must be clear, but need not use a specific form of worfs. The standard form advised by many lawyers is\n\n> I decline to answer on the grounds that the answer might tend to incriminate me.\n\nbut less formal wording such as 'I take the Fifth\" will also serve to assert the privilege.\n\nWhen the privilege is asserted in a court case, the Judge may question the person asserting it in private, off the record, to determine whether the fear of incrimination is reasonable.\n\nCase Law\n--------\n\n### *Saline Bank* (1828\\)\n\nIn the case of [*United States v. Saline Bank of Virginia*, 26 U.S. 100 (1828\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/26/100/) Chief Justice Marshall wrote:\n\n> It is apparent that, in every step of the suit, the facts required to be discovered in support of this suit would expose the parties to danger. The rule clearly is that **a party is not bound to make any discovery which would expose him to penalties**, and this case falls within it. \\[This case was cited in *Murphy*, below]\n\n*Saline Bank* was a civil suit by the US treasury in Federal curt against an apparently unincorporated bank, but a Virginia state law of the time made it a crime to operate or participate in a bank without a proper charter. Thus the Marshall Court held that a witness in a civil suit could assert the privilege against the future possibility of a state criminal proceeding.\n\n### *Kastigar* (1972\\)\n\nIn [*Kastigar v. United States*, 406 U.S. 441 (1972\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/406/441/#T10) the US Supreme Court wrote (footnotes omitted):\n\n> It \\[the privilege against self\\-incrimination] can be asserted in any proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory, and it protects against any disclosures that the witness reasonably believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used. This Court has been zealous to safeguard the values that underlie the privilege \\[Citing the *Miranda* case in a footnote].\n\n(*Kastigar* was a case in which people subpoenaed before a Grand Jury asserted the privilege, were granted immunity, and still refused to testify, alleging that the grant of immunity was not enough to revoke the privialge. They were held in contempt, appealed, and the Court held that the immunity was sufficient to allow the witnesses to be compelled to testify. In the court of its opinion, the *Kastigar* Court reviewed the history of the privilege and of immunity statutes in some detail.)\n\n### *Murphy* (1964\\)\n\nIn [*Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n*, 378 U.S. 52 (1964\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/378/52/) the US Supreme Court wrote:\n\n> We have held today that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self\\-incrimination must be deemed fully applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. *Malloy v. Hogan*, 378 U. S. 1\\. ...\n> \n> \n> Petitioners were subpoenaed to testify at a hearing conducted by the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor concerning a work stoppage at the Hoboken, New Jersey, piers. After refusing to respond to certain questions about the stoppage on the ground that the answers might tend to incriminated them, petitioners were granted immunity from prosecution under the laws of New Jersey and New York. \\[Footnote 2] Notwithstanding this grant of immunity, they still refused to respond to the questions on the ground that the answers might tend to incriminate them under federal law, to which the grant of immunity did not purport to extend.\n\n\\[This case was cited in *Kastigar* above.]\n\n### *McCarthy v. Arndstein* (1924\\)\n\nIn [*McCarthy v. Arndstein*, 266 U.S. 34 (1924\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/266/34/) (footnotes omitted, boldface added) The US Supreme Court wrote:\n\n> The case is now before us on rehearing, granted in order to permit argument of the proposition, not presented by counsel before, that the privilege against self\\-incrimination does not extend to an examination of the bankrupt made for the purpose of obtaining possession of property belonging to his estate.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The contention now is that the privilege against self\\-incrimination ought to have been disallowed because, under the Constitution, it does not extend to the examination of a bankrupt in a bankruptcy proceeding.\n> \n> \n> The government insists broadly that the constitutional privilege against self\\-incrimination does not apply in any civil proceeding. The contrary must be accepted as settled. **The privilege is not ordinarily dependent upon the nature of the proceeding** in which the testimony is sought or is to be used. **It applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it.** The privilege protects a mere witness as fully as it does one who is also a party defendant. It protects likewise the owner of goods which may be forfeited in a penal proceeding. See *Counselman v. Hitchcock*, 142 U. S. 547, 142 U. S. 563\\-564\\.\n> \n> \n> The government urges more strongly a narrower contention. It claims that the constitutional privilege does not relieve a bankrupt from the duty to give information which is sought for the purpose of discovering his estate. It asserts that, in England, such an exception to the common law privilege prevails, and that the exception had been established there prior to the Declaration of Independence. Whatever may be the rule in England, it is clear that, in America, the constitutional prohibition of compulsory self\\-incrimination **has not been so limited**.",

As long as you are insured (you have a card in your hand) and you have permission to drive the car, it does not matter who owns the car. There is a difference between the legal minimum insurance coverage and actually adequate coverage, and since you are not getting separate insurance where control the insurance levels, you theoretically run some liability risk if you have an accident and the coverage is less than the damages (insurance doesn't mean that the other guy can't take you to court for the rest of the amount).\n\nThere is also a risk that the housemate will do something crazy like cancel the insurance coverage for you, or report the car stolen, so you have to decide how worried you are about that possibility.",

Diversity jurisdiction in federal courts is determined based on the citizenship of the actual parties to the lawsuit at the time it is filed, not based on witnesses or original signatories who are no longer parties to the contract. In this case, both current parties to the dispute (A and C) are from California, so there is no diversity of citizenship. The fact that Party B, who is from a different state, was involved in the original contract or could be a potential witness does not affect the diversity jurisdiction determination. Witnesses' citizenship is irrelevant for this purpose.

You would have to rebuild the code from scratch. There is a significant chance that the code would be \"substantially similar\" to the code that you were hired to build, also that if anybody else were to write a bubble sort or 24\\-to\\-am/pm conversion routine, it would look the same, where even variable names (which should describe function) are the same or very similar. In case of an infringement lawsuit, you would have to defend yourself by showing that there are only a few ways to code a given function.\n\nCopyright protects only the \"expression\", not the abstract idea. A linked list is an idea, which can't be protected by copyright; same with recursion, pointers, stacks, object\\-oriented programming... Anything that involves copy and paste is infringement. If you re\\-read the copyrighted code and then try to reconstruct it, you probably crossed the infringement line. If you remember the problems and solutions and accidentally write somewhat similar code, that is probably on the safe side.\n\nFrom the perspective of the programmer not wanting to always reinvent the wheel, it would be most useful to make a distinction in the contract between \"the essentials of the customer's program\" versus \"incidental utility work\". The difficulty will arise in saying specifically what is essential vs. incidental. For instance, I know that if I were to hire you to develop a speech\\-recognition system, low\\-level audio\\-acquisition and encoding would not be essential to my purpose, whereas DSP parsing routines would be the center of my interest. The programmer would then want to retain recycling rights to all non\\-essential code.",

The contract states that \"once paid, the developer transfers all rights to the client.\" Which of the following actions would likely be considered copyright infringement under this agreement?\n\nA) Using the same variable names in a different project for similar functions\nB) Implementing a linked list data structure in a future project\nC) Copy-pasting a small function for time conversion from the client's project to a new project\nD) Applying the concept of object-oriented programming in subsequent work\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is likely not infringement as variable names that describe function are often similar across projects. \nOption B is not infringement because data structures like linked lists are abstract ideas and cannot be copyrighted. \nOption C is the correct answer because directly copy-pasting code, even small functions, from a project where all rights were transferred would be considered infringement. \nOption D is not infringement as programming paradigms like object-oriented programming are general concepts that cannot be copyrighted.\n\nThe key point is that while the client owns the specific expression of the code, they cannot own general programming concepts or ideas. However, any direct reuse of code, no matter how small, could potentially infringe on the client's rights under such an agreement."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of donations for overhead costs?\n\nA) California law mandates that no more than 25% of donations can be used for overhead costs.\nB) There is no general limitation on the percentage of donations that can be used for overhead costs in California.\nC) The organization must use at least 75% of donations for program services to maintain tax-exempt status.\nD) Federal law requires all tax-exempt nonprofits to use a minimum of 50% of donations for direct charitable activities.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, there is no general limitation on how much of a tax-exempt nonprofit's donations can be used for overhead costs in California. Some organizations may even legitimately use 100% of donations for overhead, depending on their purpose.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because California law does not mandate any specific percentage limit for overhead costs.\n\nAnswer C is false because there is no such requirement to maintain tax-exempt status in California based on the given information.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as it mistakenly applies a non-existent federal law to all tax-exempt nonprofits. While private foundations have certain distribution requirements, this does not apply to all nonprofits and is not related to a 50% threshold for direct charitable activities.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's understanding of nonprofit regulations in California and their ability to distinguish between factual information and common misconceptions about nonprofit overhead spending."

And here I am not talking about covid\\-19 crisis but before the global pandemic.\n\nI find this practice barely legal when [the French education code requires establishments to verify that students have the technical means necessary to carry out exams](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000034485782&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071191&dateTexte=20170427).\n\n> The conditions for validating lessons, given in the presence of users or remotely, where applicable in digital form, are set in each higher education establishment at the latest at the end of the first month of the teaching year and they cannot be modified during the year. The validation of lessons, controlled by tests organized remotely in digital form, must be guaranteed by:\n\n> 1 \u00b0 Verification that the candidate has the technical means allowing him to effectively pass the tests;\n\n> 2 \u00b0 Verification of the candidate's identity;\n\n> 3 \u00b0 Supervision of the test and compliance with the rules applicable to examinations.\n\nHence my question: Do universities have the right not to provide the material necessary for students to carry out exams remotely?\n\nI know only one University that follow this rules in France : The Sorbonne, Paris. My University and all others I know doesn't respect it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To comply with the rules that *allow* them to take tests remotely, they'd have to comply with all requirements. If they can't comply with all three requirements, they are not allowed to offer these remote tests.\n\nBut what do the parts mean? Stanca 2, verification, can be solved easily. 3 can be solved by simply allowing all sources and making sure that the questions are complex enough so that wild googling doesn't help to work it out in the time limit. LEaves 1, the means.\n\nHere there are several general approaches: On the one hand, they could make sure that the means to do the exam are as low as possible \\- which could be as low as \"send an E\\-mail with your answers in clear text to the office with a timestamp no later than XY:AB, questions appear on the internet under test.com at AB:XY.\"\n\nThe other, more complex solution, would be to do the test via a web\\-app that then needs to run on any usual browser and there have to be (mandatory) means to test so beforehand.\n\nThe most restricting approach would be the one followed by the Sorbonne: Specific software that monitors the student during the examination. This could raise privacy concerns, but you can contract away a lot of freedoms...\n\nThe rules as stated **don't** specify how the goals are to be achieved, so it is *up to the university* to invent a system that they are happy with and that aims for the three given goals while adhering to the rules. They *also* don't require the university to hand out laptops or such, but renting out tablets to take the exams on could be one solution to help lessen the burden on low\\-income students.",

However, it does not explicitly state that universities must provide all necessary equipment to students free of charge. \n\nOption A is incorrect because verifying the candidate's identity is explicitly mentioned as a requirement. Option C is also a stated requirement for exam validation. Option D is the first requirement listed in the code. Option B, while it might be a practice followed by some institutions like the Sorbonne, is not explicitly required by the education code as described in the given text. Universities have flexibility in how they ensure students have the necessary technical means, which could include various approaches such as using low-tech solutions, web applications, or rental programs, but are not obligated to provide equipment directly."

The only replies I got were 'not available anymore' emails.\n\nSo I got curious and decided to an experiment, so to say. I asked my girlfriend (a German) if she could also send showing appointment requests to the landlords. We both send requests, same written emails, with names changed.\n\nLo and behold, she always got calls or email replies giving away appointments, whereas I would not receive any replies, only a 'not available anymore' message sometimes.\n\nThe posts from apartments we applied to were operated by agencies, not private owners.\n\nI found [this document](https://www.antidiskriminierungsstelle.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/publikationen/Refugees/Fluechtlingsbroschuere_englisch.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=15)(III, Clause 6\\) online, which briefly talks about rental discrimination:\n\n> However, there are also forms of discrimination on the housing market\n> that are less obvious.

Am I being discriminated against by these landlords(companies)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What's the legality of this situation?\n\nIt's unlawful and you should seek support for it. That document you linked to appears to have resources that could help you, such as support lines and counselling centres, etc.\n\n> Am I being discriminated against by these landlords(companies)?\n\nI would say so. It sounds like you're being discriminated against on grounds of race and ethnic origin. It appears to violate the [General Equal Treatment Act](https://www.antidiskriminierungsstelle.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/publikationen/agg_in_englischer_Sprache.pdf;jsessionid=BFB1745DAF2E8F6F9D781E66585357F9.2_cid360?__blob=publicationFile&v=2).\n\nHowever, I do want to stress that there may be completely reasonable factors as to why landlords are rejecting your appointment requests. For example, it would **not** be discriminatory to refuse housing on the basis that you don't have the appropriate income, or you have a poor credit rating, or you don't have any previous rental references.\n\nIt can be very difficult to prove discrimination if any of the above factors apply, since the landlord could simply cite one of those reasons instead.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The landlord's actions are legal as long as they provide a non-discriminatory reason for rejection.\n\nB) This scenario clearly violates the General Equal Treatment Act and is definitely unlawful discrimination.\n\nC) The situation suggests possible discrimination, but proving it may be challenging if other factors like income or credit history are involved.\n\nD) Housing agencies are exempt from anti-discrimination laws in Germany.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the scenario strongly suggests potential discrimination based on race or ethnic origin, which would violate the General Equal Treatment Act, it's important to note that proving discrimination can be challenging. Landlords could potentially cite other non-discriminatory reasons for rejection, such as income levels, credit history, or lack of rental references. The correct answer acknowledges both the possibility of discrimination and the complexity of proving it in such cases. Option A is incorrect because providing a non-discriminatory reason doesn't necessarily make the action legal if discrimination is actually occurring. Option B is too definitive given the potential complexities. Option D is false, as housing agencies are not exempt from anti-discrimination laws in Germany."
