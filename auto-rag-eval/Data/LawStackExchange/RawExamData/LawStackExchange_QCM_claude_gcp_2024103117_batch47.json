But recently a friend of mine had the same issue and my curiosity got the better of me and I wanted to learn what the law is on this. \n\nSay you book an apartment through booking.com (or any other booking website) and pay the amount in advance (no refund possible at this point). Say you arrive late at night (outside the indicated check\\-in time) and the owner then asks you to pay extra for the check\\-in, is he/she allowed to do that? In my friend's case, there was no mentioning of a late check\\-in fee but you can also not refund the booking so you are sort of forced to pay the extra amount if you don't want to loose the payment you have already made for the apartment. What does the law say on this?\n\nIn my case it ended there but in my friends case the airplane got delayed and as a result my friend arrived 2 hours late at the property. In the meantime (while on the airplane), my friend received angry emails (capitalised words, every sentence marked with several exclamation mark, the whole array ...) saying because of the late arrival the late check\\-in fee has doubled which my friend was then forced to pay (which were equal to 2 nights rent, so it was a significant amount which was not agreed upon before and again, there was not really an option to avoid this fee (other than, again, losing the down payment and looking for a different hotel at 5 in the morning with all your luggage). Again, is the owner allowed to just arbitrary set prices and force you to pay (as the owner knows that you don't really have another option). It feels a bit like exploitation, just wondering if there is a law on that. \n\nOK, so now to the interesting bit. I understand that booking.com (or the website you booked through) is just a facilitator of sorts, so they don't need to mediate between you and the apartment owner (and from experience it seems that's exactly their strategy), but if we look more closely at the problem, effectively you were making a booking through their website based on incomplete information. I understand that this is the owners fault of not providing this information, but is booking.com (or again your favourite website) not, at least, being sloppy with due diligence by pretty much saying \"your problem, not ours, we only run this website and don't care if you have to pay extra\"? I have a feeling that they are operating within the margin of the law, but that then means that you are pretty much at the mercy of the apartment owner and if he/she wants to drain your vacation funds there is nothing stopping him/her?\n\nAnd one more thing, if make your booking in country A for an apartment in country B through booking.com, which law should be considered? The one from country A (where you booked from), country B (where you are going to) or maybe where the website you bought it through is registered? (possibly a third, different country)\n\nOh and just one last thing, thankfully it didn't happened (to neither me nor my friend), but out of curiosity and on that topic, what happens if the owner decides to withhold the deposit you paid? Again, there seems little that you can do. I guess you can take pictures of everything but in the end it will be your word against the owner, it seem pretty easy then for them to just cash in some extra money if they wanted to do so. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am not a lawyer, but to me this sounds like it is a case of **contract law**, and contracts are enforceable worldwide as long as the terms in them are not illegal.\n\nbooking.com has a contract with the Trip Providers for offering their trips/hotels. And when you order an airBnB via booking.com you sign a contract with booking.com. In both cases, the [booking.com terms and conditions](https://www.booking.com/content/terms.en-gb.html?aid=318615;label=New_English_EN_DE_21457879225-Jdut*siugXVp60tvDpgYjQS99511067545:pl:ta:p1:p2:ac:ap1t1:neg:fi:tidsa-55482331735:lp9043572:li:dec:dm;ws=&gclid=CjwKCAjwkrrbBRB9EiwAhlN8_AdF2SIsE8HIrJmfIP2UcVqx3o7kHGVDO3SyxwdihwzGsoQHcZJ9EhoCDoYQAvD_BwE) apply. These conditions do include this (emphasis mine):\n\n> 2. Prices, crossed\\-out rates and We Price Match\n> \n> \n> The prices as offered by the Trip Providers on our Platform are highly competitive. **All prices for your Trip are** displayed **including VAT/sales tax and all other taxes** (subject to change of such taxes) **and fees**, unless stated differently on our Platform or the confirmation email/ticket. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> Obvious errors and mistakes (including misprints) are not binding.\n\nThis should protect you from sudden fees, but beware, there is also this, that does allow *some* fees that were not so obvious:\n\n> 6. Pre\\-payment, cancellation, no\\-show and fine print (emphasis mine)\n> \n> \n> By making a Trip Reservation with a Trip Provider, you **accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no\\-show policy of that Trip Provider**, and to **any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the Trip Provider** that may apply to your Trip (including the fine print of the Trip Provider made available on our Platform and the relevant house rules of the Trip Provider), including for services rendered and/or products offered by the Trip Provider. The relevant (delivery/purchase/use/carrier) terms and conditions of a Trip Provider can be obtained with the relevant Trip Provider. The general cancellation and no\\-show policy of each Trip Provider is made available on our Platform on the Trip Provider information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable). Please note that certain rates, fees or special offers are not eligible for cancellation, refund or change.\n\nThese additional delivery terms and conditions could arguably be cover fees for late check in. However, these would have to be in the Terms and Conditions of the Trip provider, so unannounced fees that were not in the terms and conditions should default to the booking.com Terms and Conditions Part 2\\.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nMy layman's opinion based on this: the Trip Provider might be in breach of contract with booking.com and you or not depending on his own Terms and Conditions, which you did not provide. If the Trip Provder breached the contract with booking.com and thus with you is up to booking.com to decide, so you should call their customer support. How to do this is in the above mentioned Terms and conditions of booking.com contain this:\n\n> 7. (Further) correspondence and communication\n> \n> \n> \\[...] Any claim or complaint against Booking.com or in respect of the Trip Service must be promptly submitted, but in any event within 30 days after the scheduled day of consummation of the product or service (e.g. check out date).

According to the precedent set by Miranda v. Arizona and subsequent rulings, when a suspect invokes their right to counsel during an interrogation, the police must immediately stop questioning. The interrogation cannot resume until an attorney is present for the suspect.\n\nOption A is incorrect because continuing questioning directly violates the suspect's invoked right to counsel.\n\nOption B is not permissible because even a brief pause followed by resumed questioning without an attorney present goes against the legal requirement to cease interrogation completely.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although offering a phone to call an attorney might seem helpful, continuing the interrogation while waiting for the lawyer still violates the suspect's rights.\n\nOnly option C correctly follows the legal requirement to immediately stop the interrogation and not resume until an attorney is present, as established by Miranda v.

The documentation emphasizes that standard open-source licenses are not suitable for this situation, as they often grant too broad permissions. The developer needs to maintain ownership (copyright) while allowing limited access and contributions. This requires a custom license tailored to the developer's specific needs, which should be drafted with the help of a lawyer.

If that is the case, you need to contact the court and they will forward the money directly to the child. If your question is, can you still use the money toward rent or bills so the child has a place to stay during breaks, then the answer is, it depends on how much you are supporting the child while away.

As is typical, the DMV does not accurately say what the law is, they only paraphrase a regulation that they wrote that is related to the law. The law simply says that to operate a vehicle in NY, you have to have insurance of a bond. Violation yields a fine of $150\\-$1500, 15 days in prison, or both. There is no provision that says \"you may delay getting insurance for N days\". When the DMV says \"To register a vehicle in New York State you must have New York State issued automobile liability insurance coverage\", they are not accurately saying what the fundamental law is \u2013 have insurance, period. Them refusing to register a vehicle without insurance is a way to enforce the law (via [\u00a7 312](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/vehicle-and-traffic-law/vat-sect-312.html)), but it doesn't mean that you can skip the insurance if you're unregistered.\n\nIt is worthwhile to consider why this is so. If you don't have the required insurance, then you might smack somebody and do damage, and the victim would have no practical way of recovering their damages. This would clearly be a problem, and therefore it is, as far as I know, a universal requirement in the US that you absolutely must have liability insurance (or a bond) to drive, so that you can live up to your legal obligations in case you cause damage. The state's interest in registering vehicles is entirely separate (as a revenue\\-generating scheme and means of establishing ownership). You are required to have insurance even to drive through New York; you are not required to register your vehicle to drive through.

My main characters are the crew of a US Navy seaplane from WWII, and they've ended up in a new world of similar tech level. Now, they're still loyal service members of their nation, but they don't have any knowledge of this place they've been dumped into nor any contact with the United States but they *have* made contact with the local's military.\n\nThe major problem the bomber's crew has is that they have no money or identification here, aliens in more then one sense of the word. They can't refuel their plane here without committing a crime and stealing the fuel, and spare parts are limited to the few onboard that they were carrying on their bombing run.\n\nOne theory for their next course of action would possibly have the crew make an alliance of sorts with the local military, possibly agreeing to trade some knowledge and/or the services of their aircraft to the locals in exchange for fuel, parts, identification, and possibly cash to sustain themselves and their aircraft.\n\nSo, what I'm wondering is if they can somehow pull this off without committing treason against the USA by military law, or are they in a real Morten's Fork situation here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **It's only treason if they wage war with the US**\n\nTreason is unique in American law: It is the **only crime** that is defined in the [Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section3). It is made a crime in the US code (**[18 USC \u00a72381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381)**) not \"military law.\"\n\nFollowing the Constitution's Treason Clause, USC \u00a72381 has two prongs. To be guilty of treason, one must either:\n\n1. Levy war against the United States; or\n2. Adhere to its enemies, giving them aid or comfort.\n\nSince this country is not at war with the US, the first prong does not apply. \"Enemies\" has been interpreted narrowly, to mean only enemies *in a real war.* Thus, one can only be guilty of treason in the US during wartime, so the second prong does not apply either.\n\nThe Founders defined treason narrowly and put it in the Constitution to de\\-politicize it. According to James Madison (in [Federalist 43](https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a3_3_1-2s17.html)), in the past, \u201cviolent factions\u201d had often used \u201cnew\\-fangled and artificial\" definitions of treason to \u201cwreck their alternate malignity on each other\u2026\u201d To keep from repeating this sorry history, the Constitution \u201copposed a barrier to this peculiar danger,\u201d by defining what constituted treason and specifying how it was to be proved.\n\nExactly how narrowly treason is defined can be seen in the Supreme Court's 1807 decision in *[Ex Parte Bollman](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/8/75/).* This case arose out of the [Burr Conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_conspiracy), Aaron Burr's plan to carve a new country out of the US. Bollman was charged with conspiring with Burr. The Court ordered Bollman released. In his opinion, John Marshall explained why:\n\n> However flagitious may be the crime of conspiring to subvert by force the government of our country, **such conspiracy is not treason.** *To conspire to levy war, and actually to levy war, are distinct offenses.*\n\nIf you want to read more about treason, here's a short [article](https://theconversation.com/treason-is-now-a-popular-word-heres-what-it-really-means-102968) by a law professor, and here's a nice [overview](https://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1943021600) of the topic from the Congressional Quarterly.\n\n**Denationalization: Another problem they *probably* don't have to worry about**\n\nIf you are looking for reasons for these patriots to worry about joining the military of another country, treason is not the only legal danger they face. Volunteering in the armed services in another country's military can also lead to losing one's citizenship, *even if that country is not at war with the US.* During WWII, loss of citizenship was controlled by \u00a7401 of the Nationality Act of 1940\\. Under [\u00a7401(c)](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/76th-congress/session-3/c76s3ch876.pdf#page=33) US citizens could serve in foreign armed services if \"expressly authorized by the laws of the US.\" Otherwise, the law **only** provided for the denationalization of any citizen who served in a foreign military in which he *had or acquired* nationality. The 1940 Act said nothing about serving as an officer or intending to renounce American citizenship. Those provisions were added in later Acts.\n\n**How to apply real law to an imaginary world**\n\nYou will have to stretch the words of the *Nationality Act of 1940* and the \"Neutrality Acts\\* to get them to apply to this imagined situation. Instead of parsing these texts ever more finely in the hope you can figure out how to apply them to a situation those who passed these laws did not (and probably *could not*) imagine, a simpler and more direct approach would be to interpret these laws light of their purpose. The purpose of \u00a7401 of the *Nationality Act* is clear: If an American citizen shifts (or splits) his allegiance from the US to another country, he will lose his citizenship. \u00a7401 lists various acts that will be taken as evidence of shifting (or splitting) allegiance. So unless your guys do things that show they have changed their allegiance, they will be fine.\n\nKeeping your guys on the right side of the *Neutrality Acts* might be a little trickier. Their purpose is simple: To keep anyone from dragging US into war before Congress declares it by making sure every American remains neutral between \"belligerents.\" Unless you've built this world in such a way that the US could be easily dragged into a war on it, it seems your guys won't violate the purpose of the Neutrality Acts.

The police would likely return the motorcycle to this verified owner, rather than the person convicted of stealing it, destroying it, or holding it indefinitely.

Courts often use the \u201cdoctrine of reasonable expectations\u201d as a justification for invalidating parts or all of an adhesion contract: the weaker party will not be held to adhere to contract terms that are beyond what the weaker party would have reasonably expected from the contract, even if what he or she reasonably expected was outside the strict letter of agreement.\n\nThis distinction is (I believe) fairly common in common law jurisdictions.\n\nAs far as advice for your specific situation, consult a qualified attorney\n==========================================================================\n\nAs far as whether the voices.com contract which you mentioned constitutes a contract of adhesion, whether the terms in questions are unconscionable or otherwise not binding, and whether it would be worthwhile to disregard those terms given the probability and potential cost (both in time and money) of a potential lawsuit, there is a chance that any of that would be legal advice (I think; I'm new here) and thus not only off\\-topic but potentially outright illegal UPL.

Contracts of adhesion, which often include Terms of Service agreements, are typically drafted by one party with stronger bargaining power (usually a business) and offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis to the other party (often a consumer). Due to this potential power imbalance, courts apply stricter scrutiny to contracts of adhesion and may invalidate certain provisions if they are deemed unfair or unconscionable.

However the Title IX office of a university does not attempt to tackle behaviors that fall outside of ensuring compliance with the federal law.\n\nUsually, faculty and staff are required to report or consult with the Title IX office if they become aware of misconduct.

However, academic units are usually set up in such a way that \"the department\" can't do anything, but the chair can, perhaps following a vote of the faculty. The faculty could denounce the accused, but as long as they didn't cross the line to defamation they can express themselves as they see fit. The chair, on the other hand, probably has the power to actually punish the accused, and would need to back off somewhat. For example, the faculty might wish to impose a substantive sanction, but they almost certainly don't have the power to do so, whereas the chair probably does.

There is no comprehensive database. So, one has to turn to appellate court rulings on complaints dismissed for being too long, and to media reports.\n\nThe governing rule in federal court is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, so annotations to that rule of court decisions interpreting it are the natural place to begin to look. As a practical matter, complaints are far more often dismissed for not saying enough than for saying too much.\n\nA rare such case said this about the Complaint before it (although it doesn't appear to have had all that many pages):\n\n> The amended complaint is still extremely verbose and rambling, and\n> contains a lengthy recital of evidentiary matters, examples of\n> which are paragraphs 26, 32, and 36\\.

Hunt*, 29 F.R.D. 14, 15\u201316 (D. Mass. 1961\\).\n\nA 317 page complaint in a securities fraud complaint that attempted to incorporate as many facts as possible, and repeated many allegations three or four times was too long and striken.\u2002*In re Metropolitan Securities Litigation*, 532 F.Supp.2d 1260 (E.D. Wash 2007\\). On the other hand a 70 page complaint with 30 pages of exhibits in a class action securities fraud case was not too long. *In re Intuitive Surgical Securities Litigation*, 65 F.Supp.3d 821 (N.D.Cal.2014\\).\n\nAnother 300\\+ page *pro se* complaint against mortgage broker and others was held to be too long when it contained over 1,000 specifically numbered paragraphs and hundreds of additional, non\\-numbered paragraphs, was disjointed and unorganized as whole, and contained hundreds of paragraphs that were irrelevant or were relevant only to claims that had already been dismissed with prejudice. *Grimes v. Fremont General Corp.*, 933 F.Supp.2d 584 (S.D.N.Y.2013\\).\n\nIn general, complaints are held to be too long when they are not only long in absolute terms, but also contain repetition, irrelevant material, or don't have almost every paragraph advance the general narrative.\n\nFor example, a *pro se* plaintiff's 56\\-page complaint alleging negligence was too long where it consisted of poorly numbered paragraphs that combined different sets of circumstances in disorganized fashion. \u2002*Cintron\\-Luna v. Roman\\-Bultron*, 668 F.Supp.2d 315 (D.Puerto Rico 2009\\). Typically, a simple negligence complaint would be only five to fifteen pages long with no exhibits.\n\nSimilarly, a complaint of 96 pages, much of which consisted of background information, was held to be too long, although the remedy was for the court to strike irrelevant or unnecessary parts of the complaint, effectively editing it, rather than dismissing the complaint in its entirety, and demanding that the plaintiff start over. *Verfuerth v. Orion Energy Systems, Inc.*, 65 F.Supp.3d 640 (E.D.Wis.2014\\).\n\nOn the other hand, it wouldn't be unusual for a law firm to file a commercial debt collection case, perhaps foreclosing on a mortgage of business real estate in a shopping center or high rise, or in an HOA dispute, to have a complaint of ten or twenty pages supported by all of the core contractual documents of the mortgage or homeowner's association as exhibits, that would run to 50\\-100 pages.\n\nStandards for complaint length have evolved over time. In 1946, a 14 page complaint with 17 pages of exhibits was stricken for being too long.\u2002*Renshaw v. Renshaw*, 153 F.2d 310 (D.C. App. 1946\\).\n\nI've personally seen complaints of about 120 pages in the early 1990s in relatively straightforward civil rights cases stricken for being too long, but complaints of 20\\-40 pages with additional exhibits running dozens of more pages aren't uncommon in a complex fact pattern.\n\nHistorical context does matter. There were four phases of pleading at the federal level, most of which were also present at the state level. And, in general, courts have become more tolerant of long complaints with many long exhibits in recent times.\n\nThe first was \"common law pleading\" which was quite arcane with a lot of idiosyncratic rules. For some kinds of claims this produced very short complaints, for other kinds of claims this demanded very long complaints.\n\nThe second was pleading based upon New York States's Field Code, which required the pleading of non\\-conclusory facts in support of each element of the claim asserted in the case, but that legal authority should generally not be referenced unless a specific statute was at issue. This standard produced complaints similar in length to the current standard, but usually somewhat shorter in practice.\n\nThe third was pleading based upon the federal rules of civil procedure as reformed in the 1930s, which required a \"short and plain\" statement of the facts merely sufficient to put the defendant on notice of the nucleus of facts giving rise to the dispute with the safe harbor federal rules of civil procedure as a guide. Under this standard a case could be dismissed on the face of the complaint only if no relief would be available on any set of facts consistent with the allegations of the complaint, even if it seemed far fetched and did not set forth facts in support of every element of a claim. This was the most bare bones stage of federal pleading and is still the de jure standard in some state and local courts, and the de facto standard in most courts of limited jurisdiction (e.g. hearing claims only up to $15,000\\).\n\nThe fourth and current standard of plausibility pleading, in which non\\-conclusory specific facts must be set forth sufficient to support the material elements of a claim for relief in a manner that is plausible in the eyes of the judge under a pair of U.S. Supreme Court cases known as *Twombly* and *Iqbal*. The fact that relief would be possible consistent with the facts set forth in the complaint, if it is not enough to make success plausible, is insufficient. Also, under this standard, one must have actual knowledge of the facts in support of a claim, rather than making allegations of facts necessary to make a claim plausible based merely upon \"information and belief.\" This makes complaints significantly longer. Given the vast discretion inherent in determining if a complaint is \"plausible\" in some areas of the law, there is a strong incentive to \"over write\" a complaint so that it includes detail that may not be legally necessary, because you don't know in advance how picky or skeptical the judge that your case is assigned to will be.\n\nIn addition to these four legal standards, the other issue is technology. It is much easier to cut and paste language into a complaint, and to attach copies of key documents supporting a legal case, than it was prior to computers and photocopiers and scanners and printers. The advent of electronic filing made filing of a long complaint even easier, avoiding the need to mail or hand deliver a large stack of documents in many cases.\n\nFrom a comparative perspective, there was once a time in recent history in Spanish jurisprudence, when, to file a lawsuit, you needed to include all of the documentary evidence and affidavits you intended to present in the case, literally wrapped in a ribbon.

Note that you have to consider the data collection as a whole \\- even if there are no names in your data, if there is enough info in it that you can work out who the individual is (or probably is) its personal data.\n\nObvious things include names, dates of birth, physical addresses, electronic addresses, social media profiles etc. Less obvious things include job or profession, memberships of organisations, friends and associates, town/suburb etc. i.e. things that in combination can reduce the set of people it could be to a small number of individuals.\n\nBasically, if you collect and store information about individuals *in any way* you are caught by this regulation. Even an email address used for login is personal data in that it identifies an individual and tells a hacker that they use your software.\n\nExamples of what is *not* personal data includes information about [judicial persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality) (companies and other organisations that are sufficiently large that individual information cannot be inferred) or properly [anonomized data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_anonymization) where the data set is sufficiently large that identifying any particular individual is highly improbable (several dozen people at least depending on how revealing the data is).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company is developing an app for EU citizens that collects various user data.

While the initial 2-year term plus 2 weeks could have been challenged as violating BGB \u00a7309.9b during that period, once the member allowed the automatic extension to take effect, they waived their right to contest the initial term's validity. The 1-year extension is within legal limits and creates a new, valid contract period. The ruling in the Aachen case (6 S 199/07) emphasizes the importance of the timing of such claims.

Other legal bases such as *legitimate interest* exist as well. So the question is: does the company have a legitimate interest to send you these emails?\n\nThe answer is that this case is more about direct marketing, less about personal data. The circumstances under which direct marketing emails can be sent are covered by the ePrivacy directive, which is implemented in the UK via PECR (Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003\\).\n\nPECR and ePrivacy introduce a concept known as *soft opt\\-in*:\n\n> where a natural or legal person obtains from its customers their electronic contact details for electronic mail, in the context of the sale of a product or a service, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, the same natural or legal person may use these electronic contact details for direct marketing of its own similar products or services provided that customers clearly and distinctly are given the opportunity to object, free of charge and in an easy manner, to such use of electronic contact details when they are collected and on the occasion of each message in case the customer has not initially refused such use.\n> \n> \n> (ePrivacy Directive, Art 13(2\\))\n\nIn plain language, they are allowed to send unsolicited marketing emails to existing customers, under the following restrictions:\n\n* this only applies to customer relationships\n* the marketing must be for similar products or services\n* you must be able to object to further messages, i.e. unsubscribe\n* upon collection of contact details you were given the opportunity to opt out", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A customer rents a bicycle from a bike-sharing company through their app. The company then starts sending marketing emails about their services.

The document itself is an \"Arbitration and Waiver of class action.\" The effective date is defined as \"the 61st day after we provide ... \\[this notice] to you.\" You have the option to opt out, in writing to a P.O. box. If you don't jump through these hoops \"you will be deemed to have consented to \\[arbitration].\" There is also a clause that it is retroactively enforceable if the claims \"relate to conduct that happened \\[before this notice].\"\n\nIt seems ludicrous to me that the process is\n\n1.

No mention of what information to include, and I hope you have envelopes and stamps at the ready otherwise there's another hoop to jump through.\n\nThis feels to me like getting people to agree to contracts they've never seen. Can the bank do this? Are companies allowed to create contracts with anything they want in them, and apply them to you because you didn't read an email and subsequently jump through 5 hoops? Is this practice legally enforceable? How does this differ from me dropping off a letter in all my neighbors mailboxes stating that if they don't come to my place with an engraved card stating intent to opt\\-out, they're agreeing to send me $100 per month for eternity? What do you mean, they had the chance to opt\\-out!\n\nThe actual notice [here](https://www.macu.com/about/disclosures/arbitration-notice).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For a contract to be valid, there needs to be \"consideration\" given to both sides, which is legalese for \"something of value\", including money, credit, service or goods. In the case of your neighbors, you are not giving them any consideration\n\nWith your bank, you are engaged in a contract, with each of you receiving consideration. Generally, you get consideration in the form of a) safekeeping of your money, b) transfer service of your money (electronically and in the form of checks), and c) interest, however good or pitiful it may be. You bank generally gets consideration in the form of a) any fees you pay and b) the right to use your money in fractional reserve banking to make loans to other people.\n\nGenerally, with a bank contract, there is generally no temporal binding on your relationship; by which I mean, there is no penalty (with perhaps the loss of a promotional interest rate) if you were to withdraw all of your funds today without any notice and close your account. (Though some savings account have withdrawal delays that the bank may or may not choose to invoke, but that is more for avoiding \"runs\" more than anything else). \n\nHowever, a bank can also choose to stop doing business with you, close your account, and give you your money, ending the relationship. Because you don't have a temporal binding in your contract, it can do so at any time. It can also refuse to do business with you under the existing terms, and only continue business on new terms.\n\nFor example, lets say that you have a lawn, and we have a contract (noting that a contract need not necessarily be written down) that I come by every Saturday and Tuesday morning and mow it, for which you pay me $20 a week. At any time, I could refuse to continue under the current terms, and demand new ones, which you could acquiesce to, refuse, or make a counter offer. So if I came to you and demanded $40 dollars a week, you could agree, refuse (and either end the contract or continue offering $20 a week for two days mowing), or counter offer, perhaps offering $30 or my only coming on Saturdays to mow the lawn for the original $20\\.\n\nEDIT: Note that this process doesn't work with a loan, because with a loan, there is technically only a single transaction: the lender trades the one\\-time consideration of the loan (money) for the borrower's binding promise to repay the money, by a specified schedule with a specified rate of interest.\n\n**You actually have three options here**: accept the new terms, send a letter to opt out, or stop using the service and terminate the contract that you have in place with your bank (which *should* be relatively simple and painless, EDIT: Unless you have a loan, but if you did, said loan would almost certainly not be affected by the change in terms, as one side cannot unilaterally change a loan contract). The reason for the opt out clauses is that binding arbitration clauses are under fire, with many (myself included) believing that they infringe on important rights. The opt\\-out clause, which gives you the option not be bound by the clause if you take action, is intended to be more palatable to judges, who might otherwise be more inclined to strike the contract in its entirety or otherwise create precedent hostile to arbitration.\n\nAs for the required format of the opt\\-out notice: yes, they are intentionally making it difficult for you to file it; however, they have chosen a format that is judicially recognized and until very recently, was the default means of judicially recognized communication. It was only in the last few years that courts have allowed for text messages, emails, etc. to be used for official court communications, such as summons, subpoenas and other serviced documents.

That permit is a contract and it will clearly state what can be significant fines for not following the process, as well as the potential liabilities for fire, adjacent property damage and injuries.\n\nThe details on these applications are sometimes forwarded to the utilities themselves and the local fire department, especially in the case of public and commercial buildings, for coordination and verification.\n\nOf course, in rural areas outside of cities, permits and building codes can be minimal.

As I understand it they only keep my credit data for 6 years, but I would expect them to keep sales data for much longer. Say they know that they sold a large dataset to a third party 20 years ago, and cannot definitively say my data was not included. Are they required to give me details of this transaction? What if they had a potential data breach 20 years ago, would they be required to give details of this? Is there any particular language I should use in my SAR to make sure this is included?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In principle, the data subject's right to access involves a copy of all personal data the controller holds on them. There are no time limits by default. Of course, the controller can ask a data subject to clarify their request, e.g. to focus on a particular time frame.\n\nThere is an implied time limit though: personal data may only be processed/stored for as long as the data is necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected. Afterwards, it must be deleted. A controller with good data management will be able to limit their effort by having as short retention periods as possible for their different records.\n\nFurthermore, a lot of data is not personal data, or falls out of scope of the GDPR because it is not processed with automated means or forms part of a filing system. For example, if thousands of old invoices were archived in paper form in boxes that are only sorted by year, there might be an argument that this isn't a filing system in the sense of the GDPR and that a DSAR would not have to involve looking through all the archived invoices (compare also Art 11\\).\n\nIn your scenario, there is a clear retention period of six years. You are asking for records about how that data might have been used further in the past. To the degree that such data is actually available, that could reasonably be personal data and should be included in a response to a DSAR.\n\n* E.g. they might have information like this: \u201cFile \\#1234 was included in a data set that was sold to EvilCorp in 2007\\. The entries in File \\#1234 that are older than 2014 have been purged, so we do not know which entries were included in the data set. The current name on File \\#1234 is Dave.\u201d This information about the sale would be personal data because it relates to you, and you are identifiable. Of course, the controller might not be set up to perform this search unless specifically asked.\n* However, more unspecific information might not be personal data. For example: \u201cAbout 70% of our files were included in a data set that was sold to EvilCorp in 2007\\. We no longer have records indicating whether your file was included.\u201d Since there is no link between the sale and your personal data, I don't think it would have to be included in a DSAR response.\n\nThe primary reason why you should be told about sales of personal data is that per Art 15(1\\)(c), you should be informed about \u201cthe recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed\u201d in a DSAR response.\n\nSo when making a data subject access request, it could make sense to explicitly referencing this paragraph. So you would be interested in receiving a copy of your personal data as per Art 15 GDPR, and in particular any available information per Art 15(1\\)(c) GDPR about the recipients or categories of recipients to whom your personal data has been or may have been disclosed in the past.\n\nQuite likely the response will be underwhelming, e.g. by just giving a broad category such as \u201cpotential creditors who are contractually obligated to use the data only in accordance with our policies\u201d.

Also, if she said my status was employee, how can she resume the case when I am no longer affiliated with the school nor am I seeking employment at the school again? How can she resume the case with my status being an alumni and is there such a thing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The basic authority of university staff is summarized [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/21559). What seems to be at issue here is whether you have a property right to \"access\" to the university, as an alumnus. Legal protection of alumnus rights is pretty minimal, contrasted with student or employee rights. There could be a line in the sand pertaining to whether you've paid for something, or are the privileges that you've enjoyed simple part of a PR stunt? If you pay the university for access to university facilities (borrower privileges, for example) then it would be harder to revoke that privilege. Most universities grant a certain level of added privilege, such as an alumnus email account, without any requirement to pay. (They hope to create some good will which translates into donations). So it would really depend on what the basis is for claiming access to university resources, as an alumnus.\n\nThere is no general obligation of a university to grant alumni various privileges, but they may have created a reasonable expectation and legal right to such privileges, as part of their advertising: that can only be judged by looking at all of the facts. There might be rules within the university which address alumni, so obviously reading the university rules is important. That is really how you would determine whether the coordinator is overstepping her authority.\n\nIf the university admits that it no longer has jurisdiction over you, then that *might* be the end of the case, unless that was an error based on less than the totality of the facts. If an accused completely and irrevocably severs relations with a university, the university would have no power over the accused. If there is still a relationship, or if the severance is revocable (i.e. you can become a student again), the university retains some power over an accused.\n\nIf a student violates the federal regulations pertaining to sex discrimination, the university could be in trouble if they do not address the situation. If the accused leaves the university for a quarter, that does not erase past acts, so the university could be in trouble if they don't address the situation in case of an intervening term off. Thus a legally\\-viable option would be for a university to permanently remove (unprotected) relations with an accused \u2013 not access to transcripts, because of FERPA, but certainly the right to re\\-enroll or the right to use the library as an alumnus.\n\nAgain, though, it would depend on what the university rules say. It is highly unlikely that the coordinator has the authority to find facts and mete out punishment (determine that an accused did the act), and this is usually determined by a committee, subject to approval by higher administration. However, an administrator does have the right to limit an individual's relationship to the university in a manner that protects the university's interest. For example, in the event that a person is accused of sexual harassment, the university can temporarily relieve a person of teaching and advising duties, until the case is resolved and there has been a final finding of fact. In general, universities are very protective of their interests and will absolutely squash anything that they think will get them into legal trouble. All that is necessary is that there be a credible basis for the claim \u2013 often, that means simply \"an accusation\". If a complainant vigorously pursues a case, the university could be in trouble because the law allows punishment (loss of funds) in case of a single past violation of the regulations. Their interest therefore is being sure that they have remediated the situation (the stronger course of action), or the complainant has given up (risky since the complainant can change their mind).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A university alumnus has been accused of stalking by a current student.

If copyrighted content is uploaded to YouTube and matched against the Content ID database, YouTube will either\n\n* block access to the content\n* show adverts with the video for the copyright holder to earn revenue\n* allow the video with no advertising\n\nwhere the action to take is decided by the copyright holder. As such, the copyrighted content is perfectly legal and explicitly permitted for use in the video by the copyright holder (this system even applies to other videos that use the copyrighted content as, for example, background music \\- personally I had some song parodies recorded over the original backing tracks that were caught by the same system).\n\nVevo is a specific service for music producers to upload their own music to an \"official\" channel. If you see a Vevo channel and it's got the \"verified\" check mark next to it then you can be certain that it's an official channel operated by or on behalf of the original content producers.\n\nFor content not present in the Content ID database or identified by the Content ID system, I'm not sure what the legality is. YouTube has typically operated on a policy of \"hold no responsibility for illegal content and wait for the copyright holder to request takedown\", which they will then honour.\n\nIn any case, you cannot be in legal trouble for watching/listening to copyrighted content on YouTube. The legal responsibility falls on YouTube for distributing the content to you, and on the original uploader for copying and uploading the content. AFAIK copyright laws apply to the person *producing* a copy (either modified or unmodified) of the copyrighted content or *providing* a copy to someone else, not the person *receiving* or *consuming* the content. Watching a video online does not constitute producing a copy (downloading does, however).\n\nIt's also very likely that your use of the copyrighted content would fall under fair use (this applies particularly to the \"take screenshots of it\" part), as it is private and non\\-commercial use for study/educational purposes.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legality of listening to copyrighted music on YouTube for educational purposes?\n\nA) It is always illegal to listen to copyrighted music on YouTube, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nB) It is legal to listen to copyrighted music on YouTube only if it's on an official Vevo channel.\n\nC) It is legal to listen to copyrighted music on YouTube and take screenshots for educational purposes, as long as the content hasn't been blocked by Content ID.\n\nD) It is illegal to listen to copyrighted music on YouTube, but the listener cannot be held legally responsible.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

How could they make it happen?\n\nOf course, they could abolish the federal death penalty with an ordinary act of legislation, and the President could pardon or commute the sentences of all federal prisoners on death row. But 31 states also provide for the death penalty, and in principle, Congress does not have the power to change their laws (Tenth Amendment). Let us suppose that those 31 states (and their legislatures, governors, courts, etc) are intent on preserving the death penalty, so that a Constitutional amendment to abolish it would not be ratified by 3/4 of state legislatures as required.\n\nThe Supreme Court could effectively abolish it by ruling that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment (which also applies to the states via the [incorporation doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights) and the Fourteenth Amendment). But let's suppose the Judicial Branch is not on board.\n\nSo how can Congress and the federal government proceed, legally?\n\n* They could agree to a \"litmus test\" policy, to appoint / confirm only Supreme Court justices who they could trust to vote for abolition, as above. But this would not be effective until sufficiently many vacancies had opened on the Court and been filled, which could take many years. Moreover, the justices thus appointed could change their minds.\n* The President's power of clemency only extends to federal crimes, right? He/she has no power to pardon crimes under state law, nor to order state prisoner reprieved. So that doesn't help.\n* They could attempt to coerce the recalcitrant states, by denying them federal funding of one sort or another until they change their laws. This presumably would work, but would depend on how stubborn the holdout states were, and how much chaos Congress was willing to cause to the public in the meantime (e.g. no roads getting fixed, no Medicaid, etc).\n* They could make it a federal crime for any state official to perform or authorize an execution. But would this pass Tenth Amendment scrutiny?\n* They could pass a Constitutional amendment banning the death penalty, and specify that it should be ratified by [state ratifying conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ratifying_conventions), as was done for the Twenty\\-first Amendment, thus bypassing the state legislatures.

Currently, the Supreme Court chooses which cases it reviews, this law would force the Supreme Court to review each death penalty case. Congress could also mandate that an automatic stay of execution would be issued upon appeal. Then Congress could mandate that such a stay continue until a petition for rehearing is denied. Then Congress could make another law saying that any argument not raised in a lower court is not waived when it is not raised in an appeal. Additionally, it could allow the defendant to appeal each issue one at a time and declare that a stay must be issued for each appeal.\n\n**In brief, the above would indefinitely postpone any execution for the whole foreseeable future**. \n\nLet's say the above is not enough. Congress could first off prevent any further appeals when the defendant prevails in any level. For example if the defendant wins an appeal at a state Supreme Court, congress could prevent appeal to the federal Supreme Court.\nNext, Congress could also delay collateral attacks on the conviction by turning writs of Habeas Corpus proceedings into second trial by adding some clause that if the respondent to the writ does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner committed the crime from the evidence heard during the proceeding, the writ shall be issued, which essentially means the defendant's original trial is invalidated.\n\nIn brief, Congress could make it financially impossible to handle appeals of death sentences for states, while providing funds for the defendants sentenced to death.\n\nCongress could also add so many procedural safeguards that postpone hearings for a duration much longer than a person's expected lifetime.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Congress wants to effectively abolish the death penalty nationwide, including in states that wish to maintain it.

Option D is not the most accurate because while quantum meruit could theoretically apply in the absence of an agreement, in this scenario, there is a set price available, making it unnecessary to resort to fair market value calculations."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/93870/are-amateur-radio-transmissions-in-the-public-domain", "docs_id": 93870, "title": "Are amateur radio transmissions in the public domain?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've heard from many non\\-authoritative sources that all US amateur radio transmissions (except copyright\\-infringing ones, of course) are automatically released into the public domain, but I have never seen a citation either to copyright law or to FCC rules, and Part 97 does not contain the words \"domain\" or \"copyright.\" Is it true that transmitting something over amateur radio in the United States constitutes a release of the material into the public domain?\n\nI'm asking here rather than on Amateur Radio SE because this question is about copyright law, not just Part 97\\.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\\* in the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWaht falls under copyright in the US is described in\n[17 USC \u00a7102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102), and the whole question hinges on the bolded part:\n\n> (a)*Copyright protection subsists*, in accordance with this title, in *original works of authorship* **fixed in any tangible medium of expression,** \\[...]\n\nThe radio transmission itself thus does not fall under copyright, as it is not *fixed in a tangible medium* while it travels through the air, and it is not a **sound recording** under 17 USC 102 (a)7 either.\n\nAs such, normal discussions on the bands like Alice talking to Bob, does not even create a copyright in the first place. That is not regulated in FCC rules, it falls directly from the copyright law: because the material is not fixed, it is not copyrighted in the first place. That is, if nobody fixed or fixes the transmission, nobody owns them. That doesn't mean the contents are public domain:\n\n**However** the contents of the transmission can be under copyright anyway and transmitting them might be copyright infringement (aka [\"Radio Piracy\" or \"Pirate Radio\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_radio)): you could play a recording of a song via amateur radio, which is under copyright, or you could read a book which is under copyright, and that would violate the author's copyrights if you don't have license to do so. But even if you *have* a license, transmitting does not put the materials into the public domain: it is a fixed expression (replayed on amateur band) and thus copyrighted.\n\nNothing in copyright law would turn a transmitted copyrighted material into the public domain \\- that requires an express release into it.\n\nBut it's complicated...\n-----------------------\n\nNow, it gets *really* complicated if we introduce simultaneously fixing the material. [Now, the same rules apply as they do when you record a visiting speaker.](https://artquest.org.uk/artlaw-article/recording-visiting-speakers/) Or rather, the same setup as a studio and the musicians using it.\n\n### Alice creates copyrighted material at home\n\nIf Alice loops her signal through a recording box somewhere on her side, the material gets fixed while she is sending. That means it is copyrighted material, and Alice has the copyrights in the original recording, as she both creates the material **and** records it.\n\nAlice also might own the copyright in the script or notes she used, but that's beside the point.\n\n### Bob creates copyrighted material from afar\n\nLet's assume Alice never thought about recording and just airs her material into the night without infringing on other people's copyrights.\n\nBut now let's assume Bob, 3 counties over, is also recording Alice signal, and thus fixing the material. Bob had no creative input besides the recording, but the material is now fixed. Bob had some technical and arguably creative input into that recording by choosing the filter settings on his radio setup, antenna placement, and such.\n\nBob for sure does own a copyright in the recording itself, especially in the alterations he made. However, he would **not** gain copyright over the material that Alice introduced, which now became fixed by Bob's action. In a strange fashion, Bob turned Alice's speech into a copyrighted tangible expression, and the recording is in a very strange place:\n\n* Bob owns the \"[Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_(audio))\" itself, and the technical changes that he did.\n* Alice owns the contents of the recording, as in her voice input and choice of words.\n\nDistribution of this recording would require **both** Bob's and Alice's consent now, or Fair Use.\n\n### Alice clawing back the rights!\n\nBut Alice can circumvent Bob's copyright at any time by simply re\\-recording her show, and Bob can not claim copyright on that **different** recording \\- that was **exactly** what [Taylor Swift did in 2019\\.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_masters_controversy)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Alice, an amateur radio operator, broadcasts a live poetry reading of her original work without recording it herself. Bob, another amateur radio operator, records Alice's transmission without her knowledge. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the copyright status of this scenario?\n\nA) Alice owns the copyright to the content of the broadcast, while Bob owns the copyright to the recording itself.\n\nB) The entire broadcast and recording are automatically in the public domain due to being transmitted over amateur radio.\n\nC) Bob owns full copyright to both the content and the recording since he fixed it in a tangible medium.\n\nD) Neither Alice nor Bob have any copyright claims since amateur radio transmissions cannot be copyrighted.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This scenario illustrates the complexity of copyright law in amateur radio transmissions. Alice's original poetry, even though not initially fixed by her, becomes copyrightable material once Bob records it. Alice retains the copyright to the content (her poetry and voice input) because she is the original creator. However, Bob's act of recording the transmission creates a fixed, tangible medium, giving him copyright over the recording itself (the \"master\") and any technical alterations he made during the recording process. The broadcast is not automatically in the public domain, and Bob doesn't gain full rights to Alice's creative content. Additionally, amateur radio transmissions can indeed be subject to copyright when fixed in a tangible medium. Therefore, option A is the most accurate representation of the copyright status in this situation."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48180/lawsuit-over-the-breach-of-terms-and-services-against-a-non-resident", "docs_id": 48180, "title": "Lawsuit over the breach of Terms and Services against a non-resident", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So, there's an automation tool for a well\\-known US\\-based online platform. \n\nCan that platform sue a non\\-US\\-based company (or an individual residing outside of the USA) over a breach of its Terms of Services (or, rather, for providing services that facilitate other people, including US residents, breach ToS).\n\nI've read that a court summons should be served to the defendant, which would not be possible unless they visit USA.
