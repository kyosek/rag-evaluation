One simple way to see this is that people who do not itemize their deductions have never been able to take this tax deduction. \n\nThe power of the federal government to impose taxes is not entirely unlimited under the U.S. Constitution, but it has the express power to impose an income tax, and income defined without a state and local tax deduction is not so far afield from the meaning of \"income\" that it ceases to be an income tax without it.\n\nIn contrast, denying a deduction for the cost of goods sold of a business, converts the income tax from an income tax to a sales tax and this interpretation when applied in the case of Internal Revenue Code Section 280E was held to violate the constitution, forcing a different interpretation of that section that allowed a cost of goods sold deduction, in order to make the section constitutional.\n\nTherefore, the hypothetical case has little legal merit.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York planned to sue over the 2018 federal tax plan, claiming it was unconstitutional due to changes in state and local tax (SALT) deductions.

The federal government has broad constitutional powers to levy taxes, including income taxes. The state and local tax (SALT) deduction is not constitutionally mandated. This is evident from the fact that taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions have never been able to claim this deduction. The definition of \"income\" for tax purposes does not inherently require SALT deductions to be constitutional.

I want to protect my assets from creditors. If I put my personal assets into my business, will they be protected? From what I understand, Wyoming and some other states are business friendly in their incorporation laws. But if I am doing business in another state and residing in another state, will the credit dispute be covered under the laws of the state of incorporation, or my state of residency, because that changes things significantly. For example, that may mean that I would be better off forming the LLC in my resident state rather than in another state if the other state's laws do not apply in a special case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It sounds like what you are discussing is a personal liability unrelated to the business which you want to protect from your personal creditors by contributing to an LLC.\n\nThis is not the usual way that an LLC is used to limit liability. Normally, the idea is that you put business assets into the LLC and that creditors of the LLC arising out of contracts that the LLC enters into and out of legal wrongs committed by the LLC in which you did not have personal involvement (which would give rise to personal liability on your part) are limited to collecting from the assets that have been put in the LLC, thereby protecting your personal assets.\n\nThe reverse is not true. As a general rule, ownership interests in an entity are not exempt from the claims of a general creditor of the owner of the entity. What practical rights this gives a creditor, however, in the case of a closely held unincorporated entity (like an LLC with a small number of members) is a bit involved.\n\nSo, while sometimes, the ownership of an asset in the LLC form may provide, as an accidental consequence of the procedures involved in enforcing a judgment, some degree of asset protection, this has no policy justifications or intentional legislative intent to provide asset protection to support it, so courts feel more free to find artificial solutions to the artificial problems created by this kind of tactic.\n\nSo, suppose that you do have personal assets that you do put into an LLC and a personal creditor tries to satisfy a judgment out of those assets.\n\nThere are basically six avenues available to your personal creditor (you can quibble with my lumping and grouping of remedies to get a different number and I'm sure there are one or two I have omitted):\n\n1. Impose a \"charging order\" upon the LLC or garnish amounts that the LLC owes to you. (A 'charging order\" includes future amounts that will come due, a garnishment pertains to amounts that are currently enforceable debts that you are owed from the LLC.) Basically this involves tapping your income stream from the LLC much as you might garnish wages. Typically 100% of the amount distributed from the LLC would be subject to diversion to the creditor. This remedy is almost always available to a creditor of an LLC owner.\n2. Execute upon and seize your membership interest in the LLC much as you would on shares of stock in a large publicly held company. The creditor gets your ownership interest in the LLC as property for payment of the debt, and that LLC interest then, in turn, can be used potentially to either access the assets that the LLC owns or to force the dissolution of the LLC and related distribution of its assets to the owners (one of whom would be your personal creditor). Often the law regarding the availability of this remedy is undeveloped and unclear. The Court could also order you to turn over your membership interest in the LLC to the creditor, or to exercise your voting rights in the membership interest to take particular actions that you have a right to take.\n3. Attack the transfer of personal assets to the LLC as a fraudulent transfer made with an intent to conceal assets from present or future creditors, or to hinder collection of present or future debts. This remedy is almost always available. This remedy is also particularly likely to be utilized if the debt was in existence at the time of the transfer, if the assets transferred do not generate income, and if the assets transferred are used for personal benefit by the person transferring them to the LLC.\n4. Attack the LLC's very existence as an alter ego of you that should be ignored entirely. I am aware of bankruptcy court cases that do this in the case of single member LLCs. This is harder to argue in the case of multiple member LLCs where the other owners are distinct from you and not obligated on your personal debt. This is sometimes called \"reverse veil piercing\" and is expressly authorized by case law in most states that have considered the issue at all.\n5. The court in which the judgment was entered could issue an order directing you, if you controlled the entity, to turn over the asset owned by the LLC to the creditor as an equitable remedy and injunction punishable by contempt of court if not honored (this is particularly common in child support and alimony judgment cases). This is generally not possible, however, in the case of an LLC in which you do not have a controlling interest and are instead a minority interest owner.\n6. The creditor could force you into an involuntary bankruptcy in which your membership interest in the LLC is distributed to creditors as an asset of the bankruptcy estate, in which case federal bankruptcy law would govern.\n\nAll of these remedies would ordinarily be pursued in the court where the money judgment against you was obtained by your personal creditor. This would as a default apply the law of the jurisdiction where the court is located.\n\nBut, it is plausible and maybe even likely that the court where the judgment was entered would consider the law of the state of formation of the LLC with respect to the first two remedies (LLC's are \"formed\" or \"organized\" in a jurisdiction, never \"incorporated\").\n\nMy language regarding choice of law is equivocal because modern choice of law rules are very vague and wishy washy and subject to manipulation. In the 19th century and early 20th century, choice of law rules were typically clear, bright line rules that left no doubt regarding which jurisdiction's law applied to a dispute. But, in the late 20th century, the law evolved and is now extremely vague in most cases, for example, stating that \"the law with the most significant relationship\" to a legal issue should be applied.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An individual with personal debts transfers their assets to a single-member LLC formed in Wyoming, while residing and conducting business in California.

Which of the following statements is most likely to be true?\n\nA) The creditor can only pursue a charging order against the LLC in Wyoming, as Wyoming law will exclusively govern the dispute.\n\nB) The creditor cannot access the LLC's assets at all, as the formation of the LLC in Wyoming provides complete asset protection.\n\nC) The creditor can potentially use multiple legal strategies in California courts, including attacking the transfer as fraudulent and seeking to pierce the LLC veil.\n\nD) The creditor must file a new lawsuit in Wyoming to access any of the LLC's assets, as California courts have no jurisdiction over a Wyoming LLC.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The scenario described is likely to be viewed as an attempt to shield assets from creditors, which courts generally frown upon. While the LLC is formed in Wyoming, the fact that the individual resides and conducts business in California means California courts would likely have jurisdiction. The creditor has multiple potential strategies available, including:\n\n1. Attacking the transfer of assets to the LLC as a fraudulent transfer.\n2. Seeking to pierce the LLC veil through \"reverse veil piercing,\" which is particularly applicable to single-member LLCs.\n3. Pursuing a charging order or garnishment against distributions from the LLC.\n4. Potentially seeking an equitable remedy directing the individual to turn over LLC assets.\n\nCalifornia courts would likely apply California law to most of these issues, especially regarding fraudulent transfers and veil piercing. While Wyoming law might be considered for some LLC-specific issues, the overall dispute would likely be governed primarily by California law. The formation of an out-of-state LLC does not provide absolute protection against creditors, especially when the debtor continues to reside and operate in their home state."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86876/are-there-common-law-marriage-like-implications-in-states-without-common-law-m", "docs_id": 86876, "title": "Are there &quot;common-law-marriage&quot; like implications in states without common law marriage?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are only under 20 states that recognize common\\-law marriage.\n\nMy question is, in the other 30\\+ states, is there any legal effect caused by \"common\\-law\\-like conditions\"?

The only remedies that the UDRP provides are transfer and cancellation, neither of which can affect a party which has already sold the domain.\n\nFor the new owner, the three\\-prong test at UDRP para 4(a) still applies. A complaint will be upheld if\n\n> (i) your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and\n> \n> \n> (ii) you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and\n> \n> \n> (iii) your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\n\nIn this case, the \"you\" now refers to the (possibly bad faith) purchaser of a domain from the original (good faith) registrant.\n\nIf the new owner has purchased the domain solely for cybersquatting, this clearly satisfies all three prongs (and therefore would likely be transferred). This is the situation regardless of whether it was purchased from a current registrant or registered anew. But if the new owner has legitimate rights in the domain (and therefore does not satisfy prong (ii)), the complaint would not be upheld.\n\n**Hypothetical example**\n\nBy way of hypothetical example, there was the very famous (but settled well before the UDRP) dispute between Apple (the Beatles' music company) and Apple (the computer company). Both parties owned a trademark for \"APPLE\" (albeit in different fields).\n\nOne day Apple (Music) buys the domain apple.com from a small\\-town fruit vendor (the original good faith registrant), with a view to preventing Apple (Computer) from having it. This is identical to a trademark in which Apple (Computer) has (and so prong (i) is satisfied). This was done in bad faith to affect Apple (Computer) (and so prong (iii) is satisfied). But Apple (Music) has legitimate interests in the domain, in that they have a business and trademarks of their own by that name. So prong (ii) is not satisfied, and so a complaint would not be upheld. Nor would a complaint be possible against the small\\-town fruit vendor (since they don't own the domain, so there is no possible remedy against them).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner, Bob, registered the domain \"innovatech.com\" in 2010 for his local tech repair shop.

InnovaTech Inc. files a UDRP complaint against Carol. Which of the following is most likely to be true?\n\nA) The domain will automatically be transferred to InnovaTech Inc. because they now own the trademark.\nB) Carol will definitely keep the domain because Bob registered it before the trademark existed.\nC) The outcome will depend on whether Carol has legitimate interests in the domain and is not using it in bad faith.\nD) Bob will be held liable for selling a domain that infringes on a trademark.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The outcome will depend on whether Carol has legitimate interests in the domain and is not using it in bad faith. The UDRP three-prong test applies to the current owner (Carol), not the original registrant (Bob). Even though Bob registered the domain in good faith before the trademark existed, what matters now is Carol's use and intent. If Carol has legitimate interests in the domain (e.g., running a genuine tech blog) and is not using it in bad faith to exploit InnovaTech Inc.'s trademark, she may keep the domain. However, if Carol is using the domain in bad faith (e.g., for cybersquatting), she may lose it. The fact that Bob originally registered it in good faith does not automatically protect Carol. Additionally, Bob cannot be held liable for the sale, as the UDRP only provides remedies against the current owner."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79477/the-copyright-issue-of-a-movie-review-on-youtube", "docs_id": 79477, "title": "The copyright issue of a movie review on YouTube", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to review one part of a movie (less than 15 min of it) in my channel in YouTube.

Should I show the part in smaller size, I mean in screen\\-split form or picture\\-in\\-picture form?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A review is a classic occasion for fair use under US law, for fair dealing under UK law, and for other exceptions to copyright under the laws of a number of other countries, including many of the EU countries. However, such exceptions usually require that no more of the copyrighted work is used than is needed to demonstrate and support the reviewer's points.\n\nIt is usual in a review of a film or video to show only very brief clips, usually a few seconds or a minute or so at a time. There is no specific limit on how long an excerpt may be used in a review without the review constituting copyright infringement, this is judged on a case\\-by\\-case basis. But if the reviewer actually includes a full fifteen\\-minute clip, that might be held to be too much.\n\nNote that the reviewer can, and often will, **discuss** the entire film. But it is not usual to \"show\" the entire film. Just a a book review normally quotes only a few paragraphs, even as it discusses the entire book, a film review normally includes only short clips of scenes significant to whatever points the reviewer makes.\n\nIn US law, a significant issue is whether the review can \"function as a substitute for the original\" (17 USC 107\\). That is, whether people are likely to watch the review and come away feeling as if they had seen the entire film, and so need not watch the original. If sop, it is more likely to be considered an infringement.\n\nI can only speak to what might be an infringement of copyright under the law of various countries. I cannot speak to YouTube policies or how such policies might be applied.

Using brief clips of a few seconds to a minute to illustrate specific points is a common and accepted practice in reviews. This approach allows the reviewer to comment on the entire film while only showing small portions necessary to support their arguments.\n\nOption A is incorrect because showing a full 15-minute segment is likely too much and could be seen as a substitute for the original work, potentially violating fair use.\n\nOption B, while reducing the video size, still shows the entire 15-minute segment, which may be considered excessive and go beyond what's necessary for a review.\n\nOption D, like B, still shows the entire 15-minute segment, which is likely more than needed to support the review and could be seen as infringing copyright.\n\nThe key is to use only as much of the copyrighted material as necessary to make the review's points, which is best achieved through brief, illustrative clips rather than extended segments."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79558/is-it-possible-to-send-an-additional-email-to-people-who-didnt-confirm-their-su", "docs_id": 79558, "title": "Is it possible to send an additional email to people who didn&#39;t confirm their subscription?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We are wondering if we can send another email to people who subscribed to our newsletter but never clicked on the confirmation link sent afterwards.

There is no specific rule in the GDPR on how many times one may request confirmation in such circumstances. I would think it poor practice to overdo this. It might be good practice for any confirmation email to provide a link or address or means by which the person can communicate the concept \"I did not subscribe\".

The answer might change if the name\\-calling went far enough to suggest some false assertion of fact about your subject. Calling someone \"murderer\" or \"pedophile\" might cross the line into libel, which is unprotected, or it might be punished as \"fighting words\" if it could be expected to provoke the subject to violence.\n\nAnother qualification is that the government has a bit more leeway to regulate speech when it is acting as an employer rather than as the government.

Whether this is ensured by an employment contract or another legal mechanism is not important.\n\nThere is one subtlety though: employees of the controller act on behalf of the controller, and aren't a third party. In contrast, non\\-employees are third parties. They are either controllers of their own, or they are processors that serve the controller. If a controller takes on a processor, this requires a contract with certain items.\n\nSo while I think that an data controller can decide to give an employee access to some data under whatever circumstances the controller deems appropriate, they cannot give a not\\-yet employee such access.

And, under U.S. tax law, a partnership must allocate all of its taxable income and all of its expenditures with U.S. income tax effects to some partner in the partnership in a manner consistent with U.S. partnership tax laws and regulations (which basically means that the allocation must have \"substantial economic effect\").\n\nNotwithstanding this fact, [for purposes of federal employment taxes and certain federal excise taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/llc-filing-as-a-corporation-or-partnership), an LLC with an employee subject to U.S. employment taxes, or that owes federal excise taxes (e.g. because it has a U.S. firearm dealer's license in force upon which an annual excise tax is due even if it has no firearm sales in a given year) must still file the tax returns associated with these federal taxes.\n\nWhether it has to file a state tax return is a question of Wyoming tax law. Wyoming does not have a generally applicable state income tax, but it does have other state taxes and fees that could conceivable apply in some circumstances, such as its annual LLC registration fee.\n\nIf the LLC had instead been organized under the law of a foreign country, for example, as a GmbH under German law, which is an \"eligible entity\" that can elect to be taxed as a partnership under U.S. income tax law, it would instead be a foreign partnership and [subject to the following filing requirements](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1065#en_US_2021_publink11392vd0e545):\n\n> Generally, a foreign partnership that has gross income effectively\n> connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United\n> States (ECI) or has gross income derived from sources in the United\n> States (U.S. source income) must file Form 1065, even if its principal\n> place of business is outside the United States or all its members are\n> foreign persons.

The security deposit clause in the rental agreement specifies only certain items (property inspection, damage, TV and phone charges) that can be deducted from the deposit. An increase in occupancy tax is not listed among these items. Therefore, without specific language in the lease authorizing the deduction of increased taxes from the security deposit or billing the tenant for such increases, the landlord would not have the right to recover this amount from the tenant.

But, any application of this definition must flow from other federal laws and regulations, and in practice, few federal laws or regulations impose any notable duties in this situation which is mostly governed by state law.\n\nNotably, federal law does not have a general purpose homicide or child abuse statute, although it does have a compulsory emergency medical treatment act that applies to emergency rooms only (which is a place where induced abortions are very rarely conducted).\n\nIn particular, since there is no general purpose homicide statute in federal law, it does not prohibit infanticide.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 primarily serves to:\n\nA) Require doctors to provide medical attention to any infant born alive after a failed abortion\nB) Define \"born alive\" for the purposes of federal laws and regulations\nC) Establish a federal statute against infanticide\nD) Mandate emergency medical treatment for all newborns in any setting\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 primarily serves to define what constitutes a \"born alive\" infant for the purposes of federal laws and regulations. It does not directly require doctors to provide medical attention (A), nor does it establish a federal statute against infanticide (C). While it does touch on medical situations, it does not mandate emergency treatment for all newborns in any setting (D).\n\nThe act specifically defines \"born alive\" as an infant of the species homo sapiens who, after expulsion or extraction from the mother, breathes, has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of the circumstances of the birth. This definition is to be used in interpreting federal laws and regulations, but the act itself does not create new obligations or prohibitions.\n\nThe confusion might arise because people often assume the act does more than it actually does. It's important to note that the act doesn't directly require medical intervention or criminalize any specific actions.

There is a \"uniform law\", [Uniform Guardianship, Conservatorship and Other Protective Arrangements Act](https://www.guardianship.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/UGCOPPAAct_UGPPAct.pdf) which would limit a guardian's power to limit visits, but this has not been enacted by Kansas, and the Kansas does not have any [such laws](https://codes.findlaw.com/ks/chapter-59-probate-code/#!tid=NB322A8E01F8811DE9E59BEA71169014E) (art 30\\), so it is a power of the conservator to restrict visitors.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Kansas, a legal guardian of an adult with autism has prevented family friends from contacting the individual.

According to the information provided, Kansas has not enacted the Uniform Guardianship, Conservatorship and Other Protective Arrangements Act, which would limit a guardian's power to restrict visits. Furthermore, Kansas does not have specific laws limiting a conservator's ability to restrict visitors.

For a video testimony, solids come across better than complex patterns if the video resolution turns out to be low. Your clothing should not be a message other than that you are a respectful reputable member of the community.\n\n**Language and Content**\n\nYou should avoid colloquialism or profanity (except in a quotation from someone else about what they said out of court), but should not try to affect an accent or dialect that you cannot speak naturally. If you grew up in rural West Virginia, don't try to pretend you grew up on the Harvard University campus. \n\nIf you need an interpreter, you should let someone know in advance as this can be arranged.\n\nGenerally, you should only speak in response to question, and should leave a \"beat\" between being asked and answering any question in case someone says \"I object\" before you start to answer.\n\nYou should listen to the question you are asked, truthfully answer the question you were actually asked (not necessarily the one that was intended to be asked), and stop when you have answered it. (This is harder than it seems.) If asked an open ended question, take whatever time it takes to answer it completely.\n\nIt is appropriate to instead ask for clarification of a question if you couldn't hear it properly or if you don't understand it because it uses a word you don't understand.\n\nIf the question assumes something that isn't true, correct that wrong assumption. For example: \"what did you see the defendant doing at the football game on Sunday?\" \"I didn't see the defendant doing anything at the football game on Sunday because he was having dinner with me after the baseball game on Sunday.\"\n\nDon't rush. Most people talk fast when they are nervous or try to over summarize. Everyone has gathered at this moment, in part, to hear what you have to say. Take the time necessary to say what you need to say to tell the whole story in response to the questions you are asked without summarizing the facts.\n\nA little emotion can be appropriate in your tone, but stay civil and don't blow your top. As a rule of thumb the person who seems most reasonable usually wins.\n\nThe judge can be referred to as \"your honor\". Lawyers can be referred to as \"sir\" or \"ma'm\".\n\nIn content, you will be normally asked to provide your opinion on things like \"is there any reason he would be a flight risk\" (ideally answering with not just a \"no\" but a \"he owns a home and has deep ties to the community and would never flee.\"), \"is he a threat to the public?\", \"does he have a good reputation in the community?\" (\"Yes, I'd trust him with my money and my children.\").\n\nDon't make things up, but focus on facts that reasonably demonstrate that he is unlikely to flee because he has too much to lose, firm ties, and no place to go.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When testifying at a bail hearing via video conference for a relative accused of a white-collar crime, which of the following statements best describes the appropriate approach to language and content?\n\nA) Speak in a formal, academic tone to impress the judge, and volunteer additional information beyond what was asked to show your relative's innocence.\n\nB) Answer questions concisely and truthfully, focus on facts that demonstrate the accused is not a flight risk, and maintain a respectful demeanor.\n\nC) Use colloquialisms and casual language to appear relatable, and share personal anecdotes about the accused's character even if not directly asked.\n\nD) Speak quickly to cover as much information as possible, and argue passionately about the injustice of the charges against your relative.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to answer questions concisely and truthfully, focus on facts that demonstrate the accused is not a flight risk, and maintain a respectful demeanor.

In a family situation where a member simply enters and walks around without permission, it's unlikely to meet this threshold unless there's clear evidence of such intent. The law focuses on the intent behind the entry rather than the mere act of entering without explicit permission.

I am wondering how much impact the bias of a judge can have on criminal sentencing in the U.S., because it seems that judges aren't always very objective.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, there are limits on judicial sentencing discretion, which differ from state to state. For example, mandatory minimum sentences are common for certain crimes.

In the U.S., a judge's discretion in sentencing for murder cases is limited by several factors:\n\n1. Mandatory minimum sentences: For example, first-degree homicide may have a mandatory minimum prison term (20 years in Washington state).\n2.

They suspect that he may hold evidence of the crime within the encrypted data, but have no way of getting to it without a password.\n\nCan the police force the owner of the computer to reveal his password, and/or penalize him if he doesn't, since they have a search warrant which justifies their viewing his data? Or would this qualify as being forced to bear witness against yourself and thus be protected under the bill of rights?\n\nRelated question, if they confiscate a user's computer and learn his password, either from his providing it or it being saved on his computer, would they have the right to use that password to view information stored on 'the cloud', such as in his e\\-mail or even on his facebook?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ***If law enforcement is actually requesting an encryption key, talk to a real lawyer.***\n\nTo answer your first question, the answer is \"the government probably can't demand the *password*, but might be able to demand the *data*.\" Some courts have ruled that the Fifth Amendment can prevent courts from forcing someone to decrypt data for the government, because the act of decrypting the data conveys information (see [United States v. Doe](https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/opiniondoe22312.pdf) from the 11th Circuit). Other courts have ruled that there are situations where that is not the case ([US v. Fricosu](http://www.internetcases.com/library/cases/2012-01-23-us_v_fricosu.pdf), [In re Boucher](http://volokh.com/files/BoucherDCT.1.pdf)). *Boucher* is particularly interesting because the government first asked for the password itself, and then (when that subpoena was quashed by the magistrate) narrowed its request to the decrypted data on appeal. In the magistrate's [opinion](http://federalevidence.com/pdf/2009/03-March/InreBoucherI.pdf), we see\n\n> Also, the government\n> concedes that it cannot compel Boucher to disclose the\n> password to the grand jury because the disclosure would be\n> testimonial.\n\nIt is not generically a violation of the Fifth Amendment to compel production of documents (the 11th Circuit, quoting the Supreme Court, considered this a \"settled proposition\"). The issue is that the *act of producing* the documents can be considered testimony \\-\\- by producing the documents, the person is showing that they know the documents exist, where they are, how to read them, etc. Possession of the key to decrypt a file links you to that file, because keys are generally kept secret. In the 11th Circuit case, the court found that the government didn't know for a fact that a) Doe could decrypt the files, and b) what files existed on the encrypted drive. In the cases where forced decryption was allowed, the government had seen enough to independently show that the files existed, were authentic, and that the defendant had actual control/possession over them. The 11th Circuit asked for a bit more (the location), based on a standard that is in effect in some circuits but not others.\n\nIn any event, courts seem to generally consider this to take a court order to force production of anything; the police can't just order you to do it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where law enforcement has obtained a search warrant for a suspect's computer containing encrypted data potentially related to a crime, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the suspect's Fifth Amendment rights and the government's ability to access the encrypted information?\n\nA) The police can directly force the suspect to reveal their password without a court order, as long as they have a valid search warrant for the computer.\n\nB) Courts have consistently ruled that compelling a suspect to decrypt data always violates the Fifth Amendment, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nC) The government may be able to compel the suspect to produce decrypted data, but not the password itself, depending on specific circumstances and court rulings.\n\nD) Law enforcement can freely access any cloud-based data associated with the suspect's accounts once they have physical possession of the computer, without additional legal considerations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided indicates that while the government generally cannot compel a suspect to reveal their password (as this would be considered testimonial and protected under the Fifth Amendment), there are circumstances where courts have allowed the government to compel the production of decrypted data. This depends on factors such as whether the government can independently show that the files exist, are authentic, and that the defendant has control over them. The answer also reflects the complexity and variability of court rulings on this issue, as different circuits have interpreted the Fifth Amendment protections differently in these cases.\n\nOption A is incorrect because police cannot directly force password revelation without a court order, even with a search warrant. Option B is incorrect because court rulings have not been consistent, and some have allowed compelled decryption under certain circumstances.

The home page itself does not have 18\\+ content.\n* A website shows an 18\\+ warning before viewing content and requires users to click that they are at least 18 years old and would like to view 18\\+ content.\n* A website requires users to create an account and provide their birthdate, but does not require an actual ID, before viewing 18\\+ content.\n\nNo financial transactions take place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A website can arbitrarily decide that it will not allow access to any person under 18\\. The minor violating the TOS in that case would bear whatever the legal consequences fall upon them, by being sued by the website owner.\n\nFor most if not all cases of so\\-called \"18\\+\" content, the restriction relates to laws regarding dissemination of obscene materials to minors. There are various state laws against disseminating obscene material to anyone, and additionally, federal laws against disseminating obscene materials to minors, see [47 USC 223(d)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/223). It is extremely unclear what constitutes \"obscene\" material (this is determined by the jury), so while porn may be legal, there *is* a risk in allowing a minor to view porn, because there is an increased risk that content that is deemed to be legal to show to an adult may be deemed obscene when shown to a minor. Out of an abundance of caution, a website operator may therefore try to filter out minors from the viewing audience.\n\nHere is the logical flow of the relevant federal law. 1: A website cannot send obscene material to a minor. 2: Nor can they make it available for a minor to see. However, both provisions are subject to a \"knowingly\" provision, thus accidentally making obscene material available is not a violation of the law. Additionally, subsection (e)(5\\) provides defenses, one that the person\n\n> has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate\n> actions under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by\n> minors to a communication specified in such subsections, which may\n> involve any appropriate measures to restrict minors from such\n> communications, including any method which is feasible under available\n> technology\n\nor\n\n> has restricted access to such communication by requiring use of a\n> verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult\n> personal identification number\n\nAnd furthermore, (6\\):\n\n> The Commission may describe measures which are reasonable, effective,\n> and appropriate to restrict access to prohibited communications under\n> subsection (d).\n\n(The \"Commission\" is the FCC). There are apparently no such regulations.\n\nThere are related laws such as [18 USC 1470](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1470) which criminalize transferring obscene material to anyone under age *16*, which also has a \"knowingly\" requirement. There are [laws against tricking children](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252C) into viewing \"harmful\" content by using misleading names, but the law also says that \"a word or digital image that clearly indicates the sexual content of the site, such as 'sex' or 'porn', is not misleading\".\n\nIn short, in a hypothetical cases where some content is *labeled* \"18\\+\", there are no legal consequences for the website operator unless the material is actually deemed to be obscene. In that case, the operator would have to make a reasonable attempt to exclude minors, such as by requiring a customer to be 18\\+ to view the site.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website hosts content that could potentially be considered obscene.

This law states that a person has a defense if they have \"taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors.\" Requiring users to create an account and provide a birthdate is a more robust measure than simply displaying warnings (A and C) or relying on Terms of Service (B).\n\nWhile option C (showing a warning and requiring confirmation) is a step in the right direction, it's easier for minors to circumvent compared to creating an account with a birthdate. Option D creates a record and requires a more deliberate action from the user.\n\nOptions A and B are the weakest measures, as they provide minimal barriers to access and would likely not be considered \"reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions\" under the law.\n\nIt's important to note that while option D is the strongest of the given choices, the law also mentions methods like verified credit cards or adult access codes as even stronger measures.

It's his aim or purpose to achieve this consequence (death).\n* Oblique intention: the result is a virtually certain consequence or a 'virtual certainty' of the defendant's actions, and that the defendant appreciates that such was the case.\n* Knowingly: the actor knows, or should know, that the results of his conduct are reasonably certain to occur.\n* Recklessness: the actor foresees that particular consequences may occur and proceeds with the given conduct, not caring whether those consequences actually occur or not.\n* Criminal negligence: the actor did not actually foresee that the particular consequences would flow from his actions, but a reasonable person, in the same circumstances, would have foreseen those consequences.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Mens rea* is a concept that is one of many elements that must be proved for particular crimes and torts. The *mens rea* necessary for one offense and the *mens rea* necessary for another offense are often different.\n\nFor example, the *mens rea* requirement for murder and the *mens rea* necessary to hold someone liable for wrongful death in tort, are different.\n\nIf someone is not found to have had the necessary *mens rea* for a particular offense or tort, that person is absolved of criminal consequences, or civil liability, as to that particular offense or tort, but not as to offenses or torts with a less strict *mens rea* requirement.\n\nThus, if you negligently, but not intentionally or recklessly kill someone while driving your car, you are not guilty of the crime of murder, but do have civil liability in a wrongful death action for the death that you caused.\n\nWhen there are multiple criminal offenses that are identical except for the *mens rea* requirement, with the higher *mens rea* requirement invariably associated with authorizing a more severe punishment, then the offenses with lower *mens rea* requirements are called \"lesser included offenses\" and depending on some rather arcane questions of criminal procedure, a jury may be asked to considering the most serious offense charged and also lesser included offense, at the same time as they deliberate. The jury could acquit as to an offense with a higher level of *mens rea* while convicting on an offense with a lower level of *mens rea* when that happens, if that is what they determine was the factual reality of the criminal defendant's intent to commit the crime.\n\nBut, it is also possible that a criminal defendant will be charged only with one offense, and will not be charged with lesser included offenses, and lesser included offenses will not be presented to a jury.\n\nFor example, there could be a situation in which it would make sense that someone has a intent to kill someone, and it would make sense that someone acted negligently in a manner that was not criminally negligent, but not intermediate fact patterns would be plausible under the circumstances. So, the criminal defendant might face only a murder charge and not other charges, and the jury would have to make an all or nothing call on criminal liability. A prosecutor might refrain from bringing lesser included charges to prevent the jury from being tempted to make a split the difference compromise verdict that is unlikely to reflect the factual reality.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John is driving his car while texting.

While John likely lacked the mens rea (criminal intent) required for murder, which typically requires direct or oblique intention, he could still be held criminally liable for lesser offenses with lower mens rea requirements, such as involuntary manslaughter or negligent homicide. These offenses often only require criminal negligence or recklessness, which John's actions (texting while driving) might satisfy.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because lack of intent to kill does not automatically absolve one of all criminal liability. There are crimes with lower mens rea requirements.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because prosecutors can and often do charge lesser included offenses, not just the most serious one.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect for the same reason as A - lack of direct intention does not automatically absolve one of all criminal responsibility, especially for crimes with lower mens rea standards.\n\nThis question tests understanding of mens rea, lesser included offenses, and how different levels of intent apply to various criminal charges."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17071/where-to-find-court-rulings-related-to-spousal-alimony", "docs_id": 17071, "title": "Where to find court rulings related to spousal alimony?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: * I've been to CAB \\- <https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/>\n* I've been to a lawyer *(initial consultation)* some time ago\n* I've been to a meetup \\- <https://fnf.org.uk/>\n* I've read the book \\- [https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/cka/Family\\-Courts\\-without\\-Lawyer\\-Handbook\\-Litigants\\-Revised/0956777406](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/cka/Family-Courts-without-Lawyer-Handbook-Litigants-Revised/0956777406)\n\nNow I'm having another conversation with a lawyer and I'm not particularly happy *(not to say outraged)* that to answer a simple question they require **\u00a395 \\+ VAT** for 30 minutes Skype session.\n\nMaybe it is a common practice in law industry \\- in my industry *(web development)* we share our knowledge in an open\\-source manner. \n\nI'd like to educate myself and learn about a number of cases related to spousal alimony in the UK.\n\nSome resources that come to my mind:\n\n* <http://www.bailii.org/>\n* <http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/>\n\nIf possible, I would like to obtain **links to court cases dealing with spousal alimony** so I could educate myself in the matter.\n\nWhile I appreciate professional legal advice *(I know it is required)* I have a belief that by obtaining some knowledge first I'll be in a position to ask better questions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Now I'm having another conversation with a lawyer and I'm not\n>  particularly happy (not to say outraged) that to answer a simple\n>  question they require \u00a395 \\+ VAT for 30 minutes Skype session.\n> \n> \n> Maybe it is a common practice in law industry \\- in my industry (web\n>  development) we share our knowledge in an open\\-source manner.\n\nThe rate you were charged is actually reasonable for such a limited engagement. Few lawyers are willing to even consider providing any advice on such a limited basis. Most would try to limit their clients to cases generating thousands of pounds in an in person visit.

One of the main things that a legal education provides is an ability to \"issue spot\" so that you know what points need to be researched and where to look for them. Without the overall context that a legal education provides, knowing what issues you should be looking for is difficult or impossible, and this is particular true in Anglo\\-American common law systems, where the law is embedded in an opaque network of appellate cases rather than laid out more or less completely in a carefully organized statute.\n\nAlso, you are almost completely unqualified to distinguish between a simple question and a hard one.\n\nJust as it is difficult for a non\\-expert to know what is difficult or impossible for a computer to do (e.g. turning raw image input in the models of reality is very hard for computers but easy for people, while intense calculations are simple for computers but hard for people), it is often very difficult for a non\\-lawyer to know what is an easy or hard legal question. \n\nFor example, the rights of neighboring home owners when trees start to grow across property lines seem like simple questions but are actually extremely complex legally, as is another simple question such as explaining what a book means in IP terms as a book migrates to a new platform. But, some seemingly complex points (e.g. detailed questions of tax law or civil procedure) can have very simple and clear answers.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that in a situation like spousal alimony, if you've done as much research as you state, it is very likely that a definitive answer that you are looking for simply does not exist. There a lots of legal questions that do not have clear objective answers. \n\nThis is because trial judges in family law matters have wide discretion in a lot of the fine points of alimony decisions, much of it exercised at the trial court level that does not generate binding legal precedents and is not widely available to researchers. Therefore, there is really no substitute in evaluating how judges will exercise that discretion for the collective experience of an attorney who has been through the process many, many times before the particular group of judges who are likely to handle your individual case.\n\nIn sum, while I understand your frustration, a lot of it is rooted in common, but inaccurate assumptions about how the legal system works.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here is a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes why it can be challenging for non-lawyers to effectively research legal issues on their own, particularly in common law systems?\n\nA) Legal research materials are not publicly accessible\nB) Legal language is too complex for non-lawyers to understand\nC) Non-lawyers lack the context and \"issue spotting\" skills to identify relevant legal questions\nD) Lawyers intentionally make the law obscure to protect their business model\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The passage states that \"One of the main things that a legal education provides is an ability to 'issue spot' so that you know what points need to be researched and where to look for them.

Champerty is an aggravated form of maintenance. The distinguishing feature of champerty is the support of litigation by a stranger in return for a share of the proceeds.\"\n> \n> \n> At common law, maintenance and champerty were both crimes and torts, as was barratry (the bringing of vexatious litigation). This is generally no longer so1 as, during the nineteenth century, the development of legal ethics tended to obviate the risks to the public, particularly after the scandal of the Swynfen will case (1856\u20131864\\).2 However, the principles are relevant to modern contingent fee agreements between a lawyer and a client and to the assignment by a plaintiff of his rights in a lawsuit to someone with no connection to the case.

Interim Settlement Funding Corp.*, 99 Ohio St.3d 121, 2003\\-Ohio\\-2721\\.. In that case a Ms. Rancman, who had a valid claim against an insurance company, did not wish to wait for the resolution of her case, and contracted with Interim Settlement Funding Corp. for an advance against the settlement of $6,000, in return for a promise of an amount ranging from $16,800 to $27,600, depending on how soon the case was resolved. If she lost the case, she would owe nothing according to the terms of the contract. When her insurance case settled for $100,000, she refused to pay as specified in the contract, instead offering to return the money advanced plus interest at eight percent per year. The lower courts upheld the eight percent rate as valid, The Ohio Supreme Court, however, held (at \u00b619}) that:\n\n> The advances made to Rancman constituted champerty and\n> maintenance. Consequently, the contracts requiring their repayment are void and shall not be enforced.\n\nApparently this left Interim Funding not even getting their principal back. Given this relatively recent holding (2003\\), one doubts that funding companies would be willing to advance money on future Ohio claims.\n\nIn the *Rancman* opinion Justice O\u2019Connor wrote:\n\n> {\u00b69} It is unnecessary for the resolution of this case to determine the threshold level of risk necessary for a contingent advance to be treated as an investment rather than a loan. **The advances here are void as champerty and maintenance regardless of whether they are loans or investments.** {*Emphasis added*}  \n> \n> {\u00b610} \u201cMaintenance\u201d is assistance to a litigant in pursuing or defending a lawsuit provided by someone who does not have a *bona fide* interest in the case. \u201cChamperty\u201d is a form of maintenance in which a nonparty undertakes to further another\u2019s interest in a suit in exchange for a part of the litigated matter if a favorable result ensues. 14 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1995\\), Champerty and Maintenance, Section 1\\.\n> \n> \n> \n> > The doctrines of champerty and maintenance were developed at common law to prevent officious intermeddlers from stirring up strife and contention by vexatious and speculative litigation which would disturb the peace of society, lead to corrupt practices, and prevent the remedial process of the law.\u201d 14 *Corpus Juris Secondum* (1991\\), Champerty and Maintenance, Section 3\\.\n> \n> \n> See, also, *Bluebird Partners, L.P. v.

In the *Rancman* case, it seems that no one was criminally prosecuted.\n\nSuch an agreement is not legal in Ohio only in the sense that the court will not enforce it. Thus no funding company who checks the law would, I expect, enter into such an agreement and risk the same fate as Interim Settlement, not even getting the money advanced back when the suit had been won by the plaintiff.\n\nNor is this case obscure \\-\\- a simple google search found it via the Wikipedia article, and other simple searches probably would also.\n\n### Notes\n\n1.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal status of this arrangement under Ohio law?\n\nA) This arrangement is legal and enforceable, as long as the activists are not attorneys and do not directly participate in the litigation.\n\nB) This arrangement is illegal and could result in criminal charges for champerty and maintenance against the activists.\n\nC) This arrangement is legal but unenforceable; a court would likely void the contracts but not impose any penalties.\n\nD) This arrangement is legal and enforceable, but only if the percentage promised to supporters does not exceed 10% of the total damages awarded.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the Ohio Supreme Court's ruling in Rancman v. Interim Settlement Funding Corp., such an arrangement would be considered champerty and maintenance under Ohio law. The court held that contracts involving champerty and maintenance are void and unenforceable. However, the case does not indicate that such arrangements are criminal offenses in modern Ohio law, even though they were historically considered crimes under common law. The court's focus was on refusing to enforce such contracts rather than imposing penalties. Therefore, while the activists' arrangement would likely be deemed void if challenged in court, it would not necessarily result in criminal charges or other penalties. Options A and D are incorrect because they state the arrangement would be legal and enforceable, which contradicts the Ohio Supreme Court's ruling. Option B is incorrect because it overstates the consequences by suggesting criminal charges, which are not indicated in the provided information for modern Ohio law."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51666/can-i-sue-for-false-promise", "docs_id": 51666, "title": "Can I sue for false promise", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: During the covid pandemic, I requested to work from home due to my kids being out of school.

About a week later after going from store to store searching for a laptop.which were sold Out due to more people Working from home I finally found one and purchased it. After I informed my manager that I now have a laptop she told me to get set up with IS and the front desk lead to work from home. I proceeded to do both which I took the rest of the day doing some training with a front desk person.when getting set up with is took about two weeks and I still was not successful due to underlying requirements that I was not aware of. I constantly had to put ticket after ticket request in in order to even download the app to my computer.

Do I have a right to sue them for renege/false promises?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can't sue for false promise per se, but it might enter into a suit for something else. It sounds like your employer offered you a choice between coming in to work (extremely difficult), termination or furlough (extremely undesirable), versus working at home (the preferable option), and the latter was contingent on you doing things that relate to being able to work at home (get a computer and so on). Relying on that promise, you purchased a computer: but then they decided that you had to come in to work. Based just on that, you could sue them for damages (maybe the computer, maybe the added cost of finding a new babysitter, possibly loss of wages). They might want to argue that they don't owe you anything, but your lawyer would (legally) prevent them from making that argument, using what is known as [promissory estoppel](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/promissory_estoppel). You took certain actions based on their promise, so you are entitled to rely on that promise. Their counter\\-argument would probably be that you didn't do what you were supposed to do, and your attorney would respond that the company obstructed you from doing what had to be done, or had not taken reasonable steps to say in advance what was required of you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An employee was promised the ability to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic if they purchased a laptop.

Which legal principle would be most relevant if the employee decided to sue the employer for damages?\n\nA) Breach of contract\nB) Promissory estoppel\nC) Negligent misrepresentation\nD) Unjust enrichment\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\n\nA) Breach of contract is incorrect because there was likely no formal contract between the employee and employer regarding the work-from-home arrangement.\n\nB) Promissory estoppel is the correct answer. This legal principle applies when one party relies on a promise made by another party and suffers a detriment as a result. In this case, the employee relied on the employer's promise of work-from-home arrangements and purchased a laptop, incurring costs based on that promise.\n\nC) Negligent misrepresentation is not the best fit here, as it typically involves a false statement of fact rather than a promise of future action.\n\nD) Unjust enrichment doesn't apply in this situation because the employer didn't receive a benefit at the employee's expense; rather, the employee incurred costs based on the employer's promise.\n\nPromissory estoppel is the most relevant principle because it specifically addresses situations where one party makes a promise that another party relies on to their detriment, even in the absence of a formal contract."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80215/is-this-really-an-explanation-of-equal-protection-of-law", "docs_id": 80215, "title": "Is this really an explanation of Equal Protection of Law?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My teacher was explaining Equal Protection of Law to our class, actually he was explaining reasonable grounds for violation of Equal Protection of Law by State, and he explained it thus:\n\n**Suppose there is manufacturing company, and in that company there are, broadly, two types of work: hazardous and non\\-hazardous. The company made it a provision that the company will pay some percentage of the life insurance instalments of all of its employees; but the percentage of instalments for workers engaged in hazardous jobs, that the company will pay, is more than those engaged in non\\-hazardous jobs.* The employees of non\\-hazardous jobs moved to Court by alleging the company of violating the equal protection of law. But the Court upheld the company's decision by saying it a reasonable differentiation.*\n\nWell, upto now I was of the view that equal protection law meant that the government officials will not have any special protection from law, like it used to be in in 18th century or earlier that King can do nothing wrong, or protection of higher officials from being convicted in any Court of Law. I understood it as: if a President/Prime Minister commits a murder he shall be tried in the same may as any other private citizen would have been had he committed a murder.\n\nIn my teacher's explanation, there are many mistakes that I can discern:\n\n1. First, the company is not a State that make laws or a Court which tries anybody. The most we can say is that the company is State\\-owned. But still, law exercises its role of protection to people through Police or Courts, paying instalments of life insurance is not a legal protection.\n2. Equal Protection of Law has nothing to do with making special provisions for weaker sections, that topic fall in Welfare principles of State. Equal Protection applies only when someone is convicted or comes under the ambit of legal punishment. For example: if a person of a particular religion is prevented from entering a restaurant, he is surely offended, but he cannot sue the restaurant on grounds of Equal Protection of Law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are indeed some problems with the teacher's explanation as given in the question.\n\n> First, the company is not a State that make laws or a Court which tries anybody.\n\nThat is absolutely correct. The Equal Protection clause limits what state governments can do, It does not limit what a private company may do. However, States can pass laws restricting what private companies can do A state can, for example, pass \"equal pay\" laws, limiting the ability of a company to pay workers different amounts for similar jobs. But such laws are not mandated by the equal protection clause, in fact that have nothing to do with that clause.\n\n> But still, law exercises its role of protection to people through Police or Courts, paying instalments of life insurance is not a legal protection.\n\nEqual Protection applies to all operations of a state government (or of state agencies and local governments created by the state). It is by no means limited to \"Police or Courts\". It may affect payments to state or local government employees.\n\n> Equal Protection applies only when someone is convicted or comes under the ambit of legal punishment.\n\nThis is not at all correct. While unequal punishments for crimes may well raise Equal Protection issues, it is not the only or indeed the most common situation for such issues to come up. Equal protection issues can arise in any circumstance where the state government is treating people who are in similar circumstances differently without a good reason. (What constitutes a good reason varies, is complex, and often winds up decided by the courts.)\n\nFor example, where districts for the state legislature are of significantly different sizes, so that different people have effectively unequal voting strength, Federal courts **may** require changes in the district maps on Equal protection Grounds. If a state law treats men and women differently, there may be an Equal Protection violation. And of course, if it is alleged that a state government treats members of one race differently from members of another, that would be an Equal Protection claim. Many other circumstances are possible.\n\n> For example: if a person of a particular religion is prevented from entering a restaurant, he is surely offended, but he cannot sue the restaurant on grounds of Equal Protection of Law.\n\nNo, that would not be an Equal Protection violation, unless the rule denying entry was **required** by state law, as racial segregation was required in many places during the \"Jim Crow\" era. But such a restriction would violate both State and Federal anti\\-discrimination law. Currently every state has such laws, and they would all make such action by a restaurant owner unlawful.\n\n> I understood it as: if a President/Prime Minister commits a murder he shall be tried in the same may as any other private citizen would have been had he committed a murder.\n\nWhile a law which treated a government official accused of crime differently than a citizen who is not an official would probably be an equal protection violation, that is not a major application of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and was never the major purpose of it.\n\nIn fact the original purpose was to prevent, in the aftermath of the Civil War, laws that treated Blacks differently than Whites. But the clause has a much wider scope than that.\n\nHowever, a high official does in some cases have the authority to do or order things that would be criminal if done by a person without such authority. For example, The President can order military action which results in people being intentionally killed. In other circumstances, intentional killing would be murder or some other crime.\n\nBut a President accused of an act not justified by that person' lawful powers should be traded just as anyone else would be. For example, Vice President Spiro Agnew was accused of accepting bribes (before he became Vice President) and resigned from office as part of a plea agreement.\n\nOne exception: A US Justice Department Opinion says that a sitting President should not be criminally charged.

A revision does not generally affect the duration of copyright: however, if a joint work is created, the copyright on the underlying work expires relative to the death of the original author and the copyright on later parts created by a second (added) author is relative to the second author's death.

There, the search results are repetitive definitions, and not much of an explanation (maybe specific step\\-by\\-step process would help, so for my frame of reference I can try to relate to if a computer strikes information similarly, as an issue of data integrity is it at all an appropriate analogous process to help explain? I'm thinking if that's like a question being moderated/censored/deleted/hidden where there are varying levels of access after, for example, with the process being cursorily defined by standards of law and mostly driven by customs. Am I correct to expect the same data integrity standards and principles are applied to cloud and court data equally? Is the court obligated to process/serve/protect/encrypt the striking before/during/after in specific written and agreed upon ways in every court room?) of the process.\n\nIf you also know, does that mean there is *any* record? Clearly people might remember, but does the law have any power to remember such stricken information? Is the paper burned, or electronically written over? Specifically the delete key or are we burning physical storage? To what extent, for in or out of court, is there penalty for remembering stricken information?\n\n[![Legal docudrama example as mentioned, shows a physical pen being theoretically used to demarcate.

Once the order is made, is that the whole/entire official process?*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My understanding is that \"the record\" only refers to the *official* record of the proceeding, e.g. the transcripts that would be kept on file and used as the basis for formal decisions. Such records are usually prepared after the fact by a court reporter based on their shorthand notes or audio recordings, so this indicates that the reporter should simply leave out the statement in question when creating those records, perhaps replacing it with a marking saying \"(stricken)\" or something of the sort.\n\n\"Stricken from the record\" doesn't indicate that the statement is to be kept secret or scrubbed from all history in some Orwellian fashion, merely that it should not be considered in any legal decision\\-making process (e.g. a judge's ruling). The decision should be made *as if* the statement had never been uttered.\n\nAnyone else in the courtroom \\-\\- lawyers, journalists, members of the public \\-\\- is free to remember it, write it down, publish it, shout it from the rooftops, or etch it into stone tablets, if they wish. No penalties exist for doing so. I also don't think there is any requirement to delete it from the court reporter's preliminary notes or audio recordings; again, only from the final official transcript.\n\n(There could be *other* situations where it is forbidden to record or divulge what was said: secret grand jury proceedings, material under seal, gag orders, etc. But those would all require some sort of regulation or order outside the usual meaning of the phrase \"strike from the record\".)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: When a judge orders to \"strike from the record\" in a courtroom, what is the primary effect of this action?\n\nA) All memory and mention of the stricken statement become illegal, including for journalists and the public\nB) The court reporter must immediately destroy all notes and recordings containing the statement\nC) The statement is omitted from the official transcript and not considered in legal decision-making\nD) A special encrypted database is used to securely store the stricken information for potential future use\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When a judge orders to \"strike from the record,\" it primarily means that the statement should be omitted from the official transcript prepared by the court reporter and should not be considered in any legal decision-making process, such as a judge's ruling. This does not mean the statement is erased from existence or that people are forbidden from remembering or discussing it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there are no penalties for remembering or mentioning stricken information outside the legal decision-making process. Journalists and the public are free to recall and discuss such statements.\n\nOption B is wrong because there's no requirement to immediately destroy notes or recordings. The court reporter simply omits the stricken statement when creating the final official transcript.\n\nOption D is incorrect as there's no mention of a special encrypted database for storing stricken information. The phrase \"strike from the record\" doesn't imply secret storage, but rather omission from the official record."}}
