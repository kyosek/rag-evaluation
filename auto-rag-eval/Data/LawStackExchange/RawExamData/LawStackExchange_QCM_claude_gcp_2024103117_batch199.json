If you use both (the contract includes versions in both languages), you also need to anticipate the possibility that the versions are not absolutely identical, in which case a specified version prevails. Either approach requires hiring a good legal translator, and the bilingual contract approach is harder and more expensive. For ZA, the situation may be substantially mitigated, since real estate contracts are usually standard forms with blanks to fill in, and it is likely that professional versions are available in English and Afrikaans. There are [sworn legal translators](http://translators.org.za/sati_cms/index.php?frontend_action=display_text_content&content_id=1530) who are competent to create correct translations.

Creating a bilingual contract with versions in both languages, while specifying which version prevails in case of discrepancies, ensures that both parties can understand the terms in their native language. This method also anticipates potential translation inconsistencies by designating a prevailing version.\n\nOption A is insufficient as it doesn't provide the seller with a written contract in their language, which could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nOption B, while providing contracts in both languages, fails to address potential discrepancies between the two versions, which could lead to legal complications.\n\nOption D relies too heavily on verbal explanation, which may not capture all the nuances of a legal document and doesn't provide a written reference for either party.\n\nThe correct approach, as suggested in the documentation, involves using both languages in the contract and anticipating potential discrepancies, which is best represented by option C."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16650/how-can-subways-and-my-local-pizzeria-legally-use-imperial-only-units-to-sell-t", "docs_id": 16650, "title": "How can Subway&#39;s and my local pizzeria legally use imperial-only units to sell their goods?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: UK and EU law state that products sold in the UK must be advertised in metric units ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_Kingdom#Retail_industry)).

Meaning you could stay for 2 months only if you gave notice on the first day. I was unable to find anything clear on the internet about this so I'm not sure if it is true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I haven't listened to the podcast, but this is probably referring to the anticipated \"Renters Reform Bill\". A [white paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-fairer-private-rented-sector/a-fairer-private-rented-sector) was published on 16 June 2022\\. There is no Bill before Parliament yet, so the mooted changes are quite a long way from happening. (Additionally, the usual political churn may mean that this does not happen at all. The Secretary of State has already changed, and will likely change again once there is a new Prime Minister; political priorities may shift in all sorts of ways; there could be a general election; etc.)\n\nOne proposal from the government is (section 3\\.1\\):\n\n> We will abolish Section 21 evictions and simplify tenancy structures. To achieve this, we will move all tenants who would previously have had an Assured Tenancy or Assured Shorthold Tenancy onto a single system of periodic tenancies.\n> Tenants will need to provide two months\u2019 notice when leaving a tenancy, ensuring landlords recoup the costs of finding a tenant and avoid lengthy void periods. This will provide greater security for tenants while retaining the important flexibility that privately rented accommodation offers. This will enable tenants to leave poor quality properties without remaining liable for the rent or to move more easily when their circumstances change, for example to take up a new job opportunity. Landlords will only be able to evict a tenant in reasonable circumstances, which will be defined in law, supporting tenants to save with fewer unwanted moves.\n\nCurrently, tenants on an AST cannot leave their tenancy during the fixed term, unless the tenancy agreement specifically provides for this with a \"break clause\". A break clause might say that after six months, the tenant is allowed to terminate the arrangement with one month of notice to the landlord. Or there might be no break clause at all, so that the arrangement can end early only if the landlord and tenant agree (\"surrendering the tenancy\").\n\nOnce the fixed term ends, it can be renewed for another fixed term, or terminated, or else it rolls on to become a \"periodic tenancy\", typically month\\-to\\-month. The tenant *can* give notice to quit during this time. The government's proposal seems to amount to having no initial fixed term, but a statutory periodic tenancy from the get\\-go.\n\nAs far as timing, the white paper says:\n\n> We will provide at least six months\u2019 notice of our first implementation date, after which all new tenancies will be periodic and governed by the new rules. Specific timing will depend on when Royal Assent is secured. To avoid a two\\-tier rental sector, and to make sure landlords and tenants are clear on their rights, all existing tenancies will transition to the new system on a second implementation date. After this point, all tenants will be protected from Section 21 eviction. We will allow at least twelve months between the first and second dates.\n\nAgain, the Bill has not been introduced to Parliament or even published in draft, so Royal Assent is a long way off.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the proposed Renters Reform Bill in the UK, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the changes to Assured Shorthold Tenancies (ASTs)?\n\nA) All existing ASTs will immediately transition to periodic tenancies upon the bill receiving Royal Assent.\n\nB) Tenants will be able to terminate their tenancy with two months' notice at any time, even during what would have been a fixed term under the current system.\n\nC) Landlords will retain the right to use Section 21 evictions for a transition period of six months after the bill is implemented.\n\nD) The new system will be implemented in two stages, with at least 18 months between the first implementation date and all tenancies transitioning to the new rules.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the white paper states there will be a transition period, not an immediate change upon Royal Assent.\n\nB is correct. The proposal aims to move all tenants onto a system of periodic tenancies, allowing them to provide two months' notice to leave at any time, effectively eliminating fixed terms.\n\nC is incorrect. The abolition of Section 21 evictions is a key part of the proposed reforms, and there's no mention of a transition period for this specific aspect.\n\nD is incorrect. While there will be two implementation dates, the white paper states there will be at least 12 months between them, not 18 months.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the core of the proposed changes, which is to give tenants more flexibility by allowing them to terminate their tenancy with two months' notice at any time, even during what would have been a fixed term under the current AST system."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77722/can-a-borrower-create-a-taxable-event-for-a-lender-by-selling-loaned-property-e", "docs_id": 77722, "title": "Can a borrower create a taxable event for a lender by selling loaned property (e.g gold)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Lending property (e.g. gold) is not a taxable event as the asset has not been sold.

Back when U.S. currency was on the gold standard, an analysis of Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 1037 would have been necessary, but that ceased to be the case on [August 15, 1971](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fdr-takes-united-states-off-gold-standard), more than half a century ago.\n\nUltimately the terms of the loan instrument would control.\n\nBut, it would be almost unheard of to make a loan denominated in gold, however, that is a true loan creating a debtor\\-creditor relationship between the parties, as opposed to (1\\) a pledge of the gold as collateral for another loan, or (2\\) as a [bailment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailment) authorizing the person getting the goal to keep in in their possession temporarily with or without a fee for doing so (this would rarely be done for gold bars, but would be not terribly uncommon for fine art or jewelry or ultra\\-expensive designer or historically important clothing, for example, for a theatrical production or to make an office of a firm look pretty).\n\nUsually, rather than \"loaning\" a gold bar to a company, what someone who wanted to provide financial assistance to the company (e.g. a shareholder) would do would be to allow the gold to be pledged as collateral for a loan of money from someone else who can make a loan in dollars (assuming a U.S. case). The security agreement pledging the gold as collateral would almost never authorize the creditor to sell the gold except in the event of a default on the loan.\n\nIn the absence of a default on the loan, the gold would be returned without being sold, when the loan of cash for which the gold was collateral was repaid in full.\n\nIf there was a default on the loan, the creditor loaning the money with the gold as collateral would then seize and sell the gold in satisfaction in whole or in part of the debt (and trigger capital gains taxation on the part of the party owning the gold bar which was pledged as collateral), pursuant to the rules of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.\n\nThe gold bar serving as collateral would usually either be placed in a safe deposit box at a bank, or a safe belonging to the creditor or an attorney connected to the transaction, or would be kept with a firm that is in the business of storing gold for third parties, which would issue a negotiable warehouse receipt for that gold bar (governed by Article 7 of the Uniform Commercial Code). If a warehouse receipt was issued, the piece of paper that is the warehouse receipt would then be held in the safe deposit box at a bank or safe belonging to the creditor, rather than actually putting the gold bar itself in that place (especially if it isn't one gold bar, but hundreds of gold bars that take up lots of space).\n\nThis is because, usually, third\\-parties don't accept gold, in kind, in transactions. I've never seen in more than 25 years of practicing law in the U.S., a lease, or a car loan, or a mortgage, in the modern U.S. (as opposed to 17th and early 18th century documents), that provides for payments to be made in gold in anything but a gold mining contract where it functions as a good produced and not as a currency substitute. Almost all legal obligations in the U.S. are denominated in U.S. dollars instead.\n\nAlternatively, the person with the gold would sell it themselves, pay the taxes, and loan money to the firm rather than gold.\n\nTax law is designed to discourage in kind true loan transactions by triggering taxation when the item loaned in kind is sold, in order to encourage firms to do business in U.S. dollars which is the way that our economy and its rules are designed to work legally.\n\nI suspect that this question is motivated by its analogy to cryptocurrency transactions of the same character, and the analogy between cryptocurrency transactions and gold is a sound analogy for almost all non\\-trivial purposes (and the analogy of a warehouse receipt for a gold bar to a Bitcoin is even more exact).\n\n**Footnote**\n\nIf the borrower of the gold bar sold it in violation of the agreement between the parties, and the lender brought suit to rescind that transaction, the taxpayer could probably defer the capital gains taxation as a result of the sale while the litigation was pending, and could probably escape capital gains taxation entirely if a court rescinded the transaction in the course of that litigation. But if the gold bar was sold to a BFP (bona fide purchaser for value), the lender of the gold bar probably couldn't successfully rescind the transaction.\n\nThe money damages awardable in a breach of contract lawsuit by the lender against the borrower for causing the lender to prematurely pay income taxes on the accrued capital in the gold bar due to a sale in breach of the contract would not usually be damages (since they would ordinarily be due sooner or later anyway, unless the lender of the gold bar could convincingly argue that it would otherwise have been held without being sold until the lender's death at which point all unrealized capital gains would no longer be taxable due to the step up in basis at death).\n\nBut, an actuary or accountant could probably quantify the lost time value of money associated with having to pay those taxes sooner rather than later, although that would be a comparatively small amount.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. company is loaned a $100,000 gold bar by a U.S. resident for 2 years.

The tax implications of this scenario are complex and depend on several factors:\n\n1. The terms of the loan agreement are crucial. If the agreement prohibited the sale of the gold bar, the company's action could be a breach of contract.\n\n2. If the sale was unauthorized, it could potentially trigger a taxable event for the lender, as it effectively forces a premature realization of any capital gains on the gold.\n\n3.

In particular if the responsible party had car insurance with reasonable (but not infinite) coverage for third party.\n\nIn practical terms, let's say I have car insurance, which covers around 50k local monetary units in damages to third parties. Then I hit a very expensive luxury car, say a Ferrari, which for the purpose for this example is worth ten million local monetary units. Totaling 8 million in repairs costs. I readily call my insurance to reimburse the Ferrari owner. If taken to court, how much could I actually be charged in each of those countries?\n\nMy assumption is that I've made my precaution for paying any third party a reasonable amount (50k should pay the repairs for any regular car). After a certain amount, the owner of the Ferrari should be aware that he cannot reasonably expect that a regular person would or should have the means to repair his damages, hence after some amount it should be his problem. \n\nIn that case, for each of these countries, would I have to spend the rest of my life with debt?

This approach allows the customer to gather more information about whether the problem is part of a larger pattern with the bank, and if others have successfully protested similar charges.

Is that true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under [17 USC 507](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/507), the limit depends on whether this is criminal prosecution versus a civil action. Criminal prosecution must be \"commenced within 5 years after the cause of action arose\". A civil action must be \"commenced within three years after the claim accrued\". The courts do not entirely agree on what that means, in particular whether that means 3 years from discovery of the infringement (the majority opinion: the \"discovery rule\" see [Warren Freedenfeld Assocs., Inc. v. McTigue](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1468111/warren-freedenfeld-associates-inc-v-mctigue/), 531 F.3d 38\\), or from the infringing act (the \"injury rule\" which has been employed in the 2nd Circuit and perhaps only there, see [Auscape Int'l v.

Discovery might mean \"or should have discovered\", following [Sieger Suarez v Arquitectonica Int\u2019l](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20140218a50), 998 F.Supp.2d 134 ('\"Should have learned,\" means whether a reasonably prudent person in Plaintiff's position would have become aware of the alleged infringement').\n\nSo, no to the number 10\\. If the plaintiff knew and ignored and the act was 6 years ago, that is past the limit. If the plaintiff did not know until recently (someone just emailed them the info), that would be within the limit, in the majority of jurisdictions. \n\n(One other complication is whether the limit would be extended under the doctrine of equitable tolling, but that seems unlikely given the circumstances described: the plaintiff was not prevented from pursuing a remedy, there was no concealment by the author).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An author creates an unauthorized derivative work of a copyrighted book and shares it with students.

In the majority of U.S. jurisdictions, the \"discovery rule\" applies to copyright infringement cases. This means that the three-year statute of limitations for civil actions begins when the copyright holder discovers (or should have discovered) the infringement, not necessarily when the infringing act occurred. While the derivative work was created six years ago, if the copyright holder only recently became aware of the infringement, they would still have three years from that discovery date to file a civil lawsuit in most jurisdictions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no 10-year statute of limitations for copyright infringement. Option B is incorrect because the statute of limitations hasn't necessarily expired if the infringement was only recently discovered. Option D is incorrect because while criminal prosecutions do have a 5-year limit, it's not from the creation date but from when the cause of action arose, and criminal copyright cases are relatively rare compared to civil actions."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15475/can-sweepstakes-require-a-survey-to-enter", "docs_id": 15475, "title": "Can Sweepstakes Require a Survey to Enter?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the USA, can sweepstakes require that users fill out a survey to enter?

Code \u00a7 44\\-8\\-7\\.\n\n**Added after comments**\n\nUnder WV law, it does not matter that you were bequeathed your mother\u2019s house. The law gives debtors priority over heirs. This means debtors are paid before any heir. Heirs are \u201cpaid\u201d from *whatever is left* in the estate *after* the debts are paid. So if the estate is underwater, if it owes more than it is worth, there will be nothing left in the estate to give to the heirs.\n\nAs executor, your job is to carry out West Virginia law.\n\nThe nuts and bolts of what happens if you refuse to the sell the house depends on WV law. You might be able to find the details by searching on line, but your best bet is to probably to talk to an attorney who specializes in WV probate law. An attorney will know both the law on the books, and how that law is implemented. They will be able to advise you on what options you really have, and the costs and benefits of those options.\n\nIf the estate is underwater, you could buy the house from the estate. If you do that, you will not be liable for any of your mother\u2019s debts; those are owed by the estate. Depending on how the sale is handled, this may be your (financially) best option.\n\n(Depending on whether the price covers the debt, and on what other heirs are bequeathed, the court might worry about you selling yourself the house at a discount price, and thus look at the sale very carefully.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: As the executor of your mother's estate in West Virginia, you discover that the estate has insufficient funds to pay all debts, including medical bills.

When a higher court (in this case, the Supreme Court) issues a new precedent, it takes effect on the decision date. However, ongoing cases don't automatically start over or pause.

The judge will then consider how to incorporate this new precedent based on its relevance, whether it's binding (which a Supreme Court decision would be), and the current stage of the case.

I came back into the doctor's office to find two policemen waiting for me.\n\nI never understood why that was legal and never got much of a chance to defend myself but it definitely felt like entrapment. I went to try to get help and the counselor sends me to jail? Does not compute.

When the police arrived, they were confronted with probable cause for an arrest. They (presumably) became aware of the matter because the doctor called the police, since she believe that you would drive drunk. (We can inquire into whether that was a reasonable belief, but it doesn't matter, what matters is that she had the belief and acted on it). Now the question is whether the doctor acting on the belief (making the call) was legal. A negative answer does not affect the legality of the arrest.\n\nThere is also a law imposing on medical professionals a [duty to report](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?chapter=2.&part=4.&lawCode=PEN&title=1.&article=2.), which is fairly wordy, but does not seem to directly require reporting the fact that a person is publicly intoxicated. However, attending circumstances could have suggested one of the triggering causes for mandatory reporting (wounds, for example). Again, it does not matter (to a point) if, in the light of close scrutiny, the doctor's conclusions were mistaken. When doctors are required to report facts to the police, reasonable over\\-reporting is not penalized. There is also no law against calling 911 to report a potential DUI (the usual public\\-campaign focus is on those actually driving). So calling the police under the circumstances falls between \"allowed\" and \"required\".\n\nThe [HIPAA privacy rule](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/combined/hipaa-simplification-201303.pdf) could be relevant because *that* theoretically could block the doctor from making the call. (Note that the doctor, and not the patient, is bound by the confidentiality requirements). \u00a7160\\.203 allows exceptions to the confidentiality requirement if \"necessary... For purposes of serving a compelling need related to public health, safety, or welfare\", so an exception may have been granted. If this was done within the scope of a mandatory reporting law, it is legal to disclose PHI; under [\u00a7164\\.512](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/combined/hipaa-simplification-201303.pdf) it is allowed, \"to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public\".\n\nA confidentiality agreement would *not* increase your chances of being arrested. If the doctor's confidentiality statement were less restrictive than HIPAA, HIPAA prevails (the law trumps contract terms). If it is the same as HIPAA, it has no effect (and simply states what HIPAA says \u2013 the normal case). If the agreement were *more* restrictive, it is possible that the doctor calling the police would be a breach of contract, unless the call was required by law. You would have to see what in the agreement would have prohibited calling the police. But that would not affect the validity of the arrest.\n\nTo re\\-phrase the matter: the arrest was because you were found to be intoxicated in public. The police were there and could judge your state (probable cause). They were there by permission of the property owner, so the arrest was not unlawful for lack of a warrant. That is as far as one can go in searching for an illegality to the arrest itself. One *might* go further and ask whether the doctor has committed an actionable wrong by calling the police with her suspicions. This could go either way: it really depends on the full set of details, regarding your condition. If the doctor suspected that your actions fell under one of the mandatory reporting categories, she had to report, and otherwise it is not prohibited under HIPAA.\n\nIf a person is intoxicated and answers the question \"Would you normally proceed to drive home in this state?\" in the affirmative, then it is a reasonable inference that the person *will* do so. An answer \"No, absolutely not\", on the other hand would work against the \"public danger\" inference: that has no effect on the arrest, but could have an effect in a suit against the doctor (violation of the privacy rule). In such a suit, the doctor's defense would presumably be that despite the answer, she still had a reasonable belief that you were a public danger. Then the matter would reduce to what other facts she knew of that would support a public danger conclusion.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A patient visits a doctor's office and becomes visibly intoxicated during the appointment.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of the doctor's actions and the patient's arrest?\n\nA) The doctor's actions were illegal because they violated doctor-patient confidentiality, and the arrest was therefore unlawful.\n\nB) The doctor's actions were legal under HIPAA's public safety exception, but the arrest was unlawful because it occurred in a private office.\n\nC) The doctor's actions were legal under mandatory reporting laws, and the arrest was lawful based on probable cause of public intoxication.\n\nD) The doctor's actions were illegal, but the arrest was still lawful because the police directly observed the patient's intoxicated state.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The doctor's actions were likely legal under HIPAA's public safety exception, which allows disclosure \"to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public.\" The doctor reasonably believed the patient might drive while intoxicated, posing a public safety risk. Additionally, some jurisdictions have mandatory reporting laws that could require the doctor to report such situations.\n\nThe arrest was lawful because:\n1. The police had probable cause to arrest for public intoxication based on their observations.\n2. The office, while private property, is considered a public place for the purposes of public intoxication laws.\n3.

Am I missing something obvious?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Firstly, penalty fines in general are not intended to act as revenue\\-generating mechanisms for the state. Their purpose is to deter people from committing the relevant offence and impose an appropriate level of punishment.\n\nIt is unfortunate that penalty fines for speeding are perhaps seen in this manner, but that is not their intended purpose.\n\nSecondly, there is a risk to the police in attempting to enforce the law here. They will likely have minimal PPE and the police have a duty of care to not endanger their officers beyond what is required for the job in the ordinary course of duty. Arguably, deliberately forcing them to police an area with a high number of uncompliant individuals who may be infected with coronavirus could potentially be a breach of that duty of care.\n\nThirdly, it is a political and operational matter for the police. Their front\\-line policing numbers are reduced because of the pandemic (a number of officers are shielding, etc.) so they may simply not have the numbers to police an area as well as perform all their other usual policing duties.\n\nIt is likely that this is viewed as a low priority offence for the police \u2014 remember that their foremost duty is to protect and serve the public; they are not there to be revenue collectors for the government and many would refuse to do it if they were seen to be doing that.\n\nWe police by consent in the United Kingdom, and if the police are seen to be allegedly unfairly targeting an area to enforce compliance purely to raise money for the government coffers, that risks eroding public trust in the police and makes it far more difficult for the police to do their jobs in the future.

Do I need to Restore old page?\n\nYou seemingly do. This is equivalent to taking your drivable car to the mechanic for maintenance or improvements. If the contract is cancelled for whatever reason, it would be unacceptable that the mechanic returns you the car in a condition worse enough that you can no longer drive it.\n\nThe transfer of domains \\& credentials to your server supports the presumption that you are responsible for the contents and functionality of the site for as long as the domains \\& credentials are under your control. To the act of returning what was given to you is attached the expectation that you would restore it to its former state if the contract is cancelled or rescinded.\n\nAn alternative scenario helps making the point. Suppose you cancelled the contract upon realizing you are not proficient enough to create the website. It would be nonetheless reasonable to expect you to bring his site back to its original state. Absent a clause addressing the event of cancellation or rescission otherwise, there is no reason why your responsibility in this regard would depend on the cause for rescission.\n\nFurthermore, the formation of the initial \\[verbal] contract tends to indicate that you are more proficient in the matter than the client. This places on you the burden of taking sufficient precautions by directly securing a backup or at least requiring your client to create one. The fact that your backup got corrupted is rather tantamount to not having done a backup at all.\n\nSomething that might favor your position is the *common practice* that many IT service providers recommend that users always have a backup, whence at this point average person \"should not\" (?) need to be reminded to do backups when transferring his data or systems to a provider. This argument might not be strong enough to release you from your responsibility to secure a backup for yourself, though. The stronger the client's expertise in IT matters, the likelier that his failure to produce a backup will release you from having to restore the site (the mere fact that the client asked you to create a website does not conclusively preempt the possibility that he might also be proficient in the matter).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A web developer verbally agreed to create a website for a client for a fixed price.

The transfer of domains and credentials to the developer's server implies a responsibility for the site's content and functionality. There's an expectation to return what was given in its original state if the contract is cancelled. The developer, being presumably more proficient, had the burden of taking proper precautions like securing a backup. While common practice might suggest clients should have their own backups, this alone doesn't absolve the developer of responsibility.

Does Bob have a case/standing?\n\nYes, this is a reasonably straightforward contract dispute. Once you contract to do something and you then don't do it, you are liable for damages. Contractual damages are assessed on an expectation basis \\- the innocent party is entitled to be placed financially in the same position as though the contract had been completed without the breach. Bob is entitled to have the item and not to be out\\-of\\-pocket more than he agreed to pay.\n\nBut ...\n-------\n\nThere may not be a contract \\- see [What is a contract and what is required for them to be valid?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6263/what-is-a-contract-and-what-is-required-for-them-to-be-valid)\n\nA contract is formed when the parties reach an agreement and most website terms and conditions are clear that this is **NOT** when the customer pays for it. For example, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000&ref_=footer_cou) says:\n\n> The Order Confirmation E\\-mail is acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered. We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when we dispatch the product to you and send e\\-mail confirmation to you that we've dispatched the product to you (the \"Dispatch Confirmation E\\-mail\").\n\nSo, here, two things have to happen before Amazon and you have a contract: they have to physically dispatch the goods *and* they have to send you an email saying they have. If they do one without the other, there is no contract. If your vendor has similar terms, you don't have a contract with them and are not entitled to contractual damages.\n\nYou would not have a case in equity because they were clear that there was no contract until these things happened.\n\nYou *might* be able to argue negligence if they sent the email without dispatching the goods but your damage basis would be different. Tort damage is calculated on a restoration basis, not an expectation basis, so you can recoup your losses but not claim any lost profits. It makes no difference here but if you had had a buyer who was going to pay you twice the price you paid, in contract you are entitled to the lost profit, in tort, you aren't.\n\nHowever, if the contract has a dispute resolution clause, that would normally have to be complied with before you can go to court. In some cases, this may prevent going to court at all, for example, if the dispute resolution clause included binding arbitration or expert determination.\n\nIf there is a choice of law clause then this will usually be binding, however, if this is a consumer contract in New Zealand then NZ consumer law will apply in addition.\n\nSimilarly, courts will usually observe a choice of venue clause.\n\n> With what reasonable time lapse between (false) shipment notification of the original order and placing the eBay order?\n\nA reasonable time.

But, even then the U.S. Constitution had some narrow provisions that were applicable to the states including a ban on religious tests for public office that also applied to state and local governments. Also, most states also separated church and state in their own state constitutions, often in language parallel to the First Amendment, but sometimes stronger.\n\nFor example, the parallel provision adopted in Colorado's Bill of Rights when it became a state in 1876 stated:\n\n> Section 4\\. Religious freedom. The free exercise and enjoyment of\n>  religious profession and worship, without discrimination, shall\n>  forever hereafter be guaranteed; and no person shall be denied any\n>  civil or political right, privilege or capacity, on account of his\n>  opinions concerning religion; but the liberty of conscience hereby\n>  secured shall not be construed to dispense with oaths or affirmations,\n>  excuse acts of licentiousness or justify practices inconsistent with\n>  the good order, peace or safety of the state. **No person shall be\n>  required to attend or support any ministry or place of worship,\n>  religious sect or denomination against his consent. Nor shall any\n>  preference be given by law to any religious denomination or mode of\n>  worship.**\n\nThe [Treaty of Tripoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli) (1796\\), for example, made clear that Christians and Muslims were equal and that the government favored neither, and was not a Christian nation. At that time, France (an ally of the United States) was pretty much the only other country in the world without an established national church. \n\nMany of the notable Founders were [deists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism).\n\nIn all or most of the Southeast United States. there was never an established church. The last established churches in the United States (in New England, see, e.g. [here](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195399677.001.0001/acprof-9780195399677-chapter-4)), were disestablished before the Civil War. The successor denominations to the established churches of New England are the Congregational churches, the United Church of Christ, and the Unitarian Church (which later merged with the Universalist Church, a church which was never an established church but had similar doctrines).\n\nThe Bill of Rights eventually started to be applied to state and local governments relying doctrinally on authority granted in the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution adopted during the Reconstruction era (specifically, in 1868\\). The incorporation doctrine applying the Bill of Rights to the states via 14th Amendment was [first applied in 1897](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights). Portions of the First Amendment had been incorporated not later than 1925\\. The free exercise clause of the First Amendment was incorporated in 1940\\. *[Cantwell v. Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantwell_v._Connecticut)*, 310 U.S. 296 (1940\\). It was all but inevitable that *Everson* (see below) would be decided that way that it was when it eventually came before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1947, many years before the U.S. Supreme Court made that ruling. Like all major U.S. Supreme Court rulings, this ruling was preceded by lower court rulings reaching the same conclusion.\n\n> Black wrote the majority opinion in the 1947 US Supreme Court case\n>  Everson v Board of Education which redefined the separation of church\n>  and state as a barrier to church/state cooperation \u2013 reversing over\n>  150 years of legal precedent in which it had been recognized as a\n>  facilitator of church influence in government.

Board of Education* (U.S. 1947\\) followed already well established law and doctrine. There has never been a time in U.S. history after disestablishment in which facilitation of church influence in government was recognized. This is fake history produced by [Christian Dominionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_theology) to further their own political ends.\n\nThis isn't to say that *Everson v. Board of Education* wasn't an important holding. But, it was not a sharp departure for prior law. It was merely clarification of the details of existing law that was well established in particular stark and quotable terms. \n\nTo quote a brief portion of the Atlantic article linked in the question:\n\n> The attack on separation began as an attack on a letter by Thomas\n>  Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association, dated Jan. 1\\. 1802\\. \n>  Jefferson assured the Baptists that \"I contemplate with sovereign\n>  reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that\n>  their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of\n>  religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a\n>  wall of separation between Church \\& State.\" In 1985, then\\-Justice\n>  William Rehnquist wrote that \"unfortunately the Establishment Clause\n>  has been expressly freighted with Jefferson's misleading metaphor for\n>  nearly 40 years.\"\n> \n> \n> But this argument ignores a historical fact.

While the regulation primarily targets businesses within the EU, it can also apply to non-EU businesses that sell goods or services to EU customers.\n\nOption A is incorrect because non-EU businesses are not entirely exempt if they engage with EU customers. Option B is too broad, as the regulation does not automatically apply to all global businesses. Option D is incorrect because the regulation actually aims to prevent blocking based on geographical location, and GDPR compliance does not justify blanket geo-blocking of the entire EU.\n\nOption C is the most accurate. Non-EU businesses must comply with the regulation if they actively target EU customers or have operations that significantly engage with the EU market. This means that if a business outside the EU directs its activities to EU member states and engages in transactions with EU customers, it would likely need to comply with the Geo-blocking Regulation.\n\nIt's important to note that while GDPR compliance is crucial, it doesn't provide a justification for geo-blocking entire regions under this regulation.

So you can't force them into a contract simply by accepting their offer. The default rule is that an ad is an invitation to make an offer rather than an offer that can be accepted.

I'm not even sure if it's illegal in the first place since I live in a country where piracy is literally part of everyday life.\n\nThe \"why I'm asking this question?\" is because it's actually against their terms, from what I read on the internet, but as I said my brother is the owner and is paying as a USA resident.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whether or not literal piracy, corruption, theft and illegal downloading are pandemic in a country, most countries in Africa have a law recognize copyright (The situation with Eritrea is unclear: [this](http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=244453) document for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that there may be some copyright protection, or laws in the works). Without knowing which country you're speaking of, it's impossible to be specific about possible consequences.\n\nThe first question would be whether using a VPN to access content outside of the US is a violation of Netflix (US) terms of service. The [TOS](https://help.netflix.com/legal/termsofuse) states\n\n> You may view Netflix content primarily within the country in which you\n>  have established your account and only in geographic locations where\n>  we offer our service and have licensed such content. The content that\n>  may be available to watch will vary by geographic location and will\n>  change from time to time.\n\nand just before that,\n\n> The Netflix service and any content viewed through our service are for\n>  your personal and non\\-commercial use only and may not be shared with\n>  individuals beyond your household.\n\nSo if you are watching content in Tanzania that is not licensed for Tanzania, that is a violation of the TOS. Additionally, \"household\" does not mean \"any relative\", so arguably any sharing of the account between siblings who live in different countries is a violation of the TOS. The fact that your brother is paying doesn't matter, nor does his citizenship matter. What does matter the most, to them, is that they have to license content from others, and the copyright holders may well impose prohibitions on distributing content outside a particular geographical zone. So they may have permission to distribute a film only in the US, and they are liable if the film is also distributed outside the US. \n\nBecause your brother has allowed you to access this content, they might terminate his account. They might also take you to court for copyright infringement, since any watching / downloading of video requires copying, and all copying requires permission (granted under the terms of service). You do not have any permission to watch stuff on Netflix. If they sue you in Delaware, they would have to get the judgment enforced in Tanzania (picking a hypothetical country), so the question is whether Tanzania would enforce infringement judgments. Or, they could sue you in Tanzania (since Netflix has actual presence in most countries).\n\nIt is impossible to know in advance whether Netflix would actually sue a person for illegally accessing content with a VPN, rather than just thwarting your attempt.

The TOS states that content is for \"personal and non-commercial use only and may not be shared with individuals beyond your household.\" Siblings living in different countries do not constitute a single household. Additionally, the TOS specifies that users may view content \"primarily within the country in which you have established your account.\" Using the account regularly in a different country violates this clause.\n\nOption A is less likely to be considered a violation as it could be argued that spouses constitute a household, even if temporarily separated.\n\nOption C is generally acceptable as the user is accessing content licensed for their home country.\n\nOption D is likely permissible as it's a temporary situation and falls under normal travel usage.\n\nIt's important to note that while B is the most clear-cut violation, Netflix's enforcement of these rules can vary, and they may use technological measures to prevent such usage rather than taking legal action."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60844/are-companies-at-sexual-discrimination-risk-for-using-whiteboard-interviews-duri", "docs_id": 60844, "title": "Are companies at sexual discrimination risk for using whiteboard interviews during the job interview?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Background**\n\nCurrently, many companies hiring software development engineers use a whiteboard algorithms interview technique.

An article titled [You're testing them wrong: Whiteboard coding interviews are 'anti\\-women psychological stress examinations'](https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/15/it_hiring_whiteboard/), published in July of last year by the Register says about the study:\n\n*As a consequence, whiteboard interviews may fail to assess coder competency. Rather, the researchers argue, they measure how well job candidates handle anxiety.*\n\n*The researchers found that stress hinders interview performance, with participants in the traditional technical interview exhibiting higher cognitive load, lower scores, and higher stress levels. In essence, social anxiety took otherwise qualified job candidates out of the running because of the circumstances of the interview.*\n\n*What's more, whiteboard technical interviews appear to favor men over women.*\n\n*'We also observed that no women successfully solved the problem in the public setting, whereas all women solved it correctly in the private setting,' the paper says.*\n\nThis is a [link to the study](http://chrisparnin.me/pdf/stress_FSE_20.pdf). There is also [another article](https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/) published by the university that summarizes the results of the study.\n\nCurrently, [just 14% of software developers in the US are women](https://builtin.com/women-tech/women-in-tech-workplace-statistics). This study suggests that one of the primary reasons for this poor representation is because of sex discrimination.\n\nSo, is this new study enough to encourage legal experts representing large corporations to at least worry about sex discrimination lawsuits from women that have failed whiteboard interviews? If you are a corporate attorney and it was your job to minimize legal risks to that company, would you recommend to human resources that whiteboard interviews are now too legally risky and the company should avoid them, or do you believe instead that it is nothing to worry about and it is okay to do business as usual?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Barrister to instructing solicitor: \u201cAm I working for the plaintiff or defendant?\u201d\n\nPlaintiff\n---------\n\nYour honour, this excellent study and the expert testimony you have heard from the authors, clearly demonstrates that whiteboard testing is sexual discrimination by another name.

Wouldn't investor A's 10%\n> stake trump investor B's 5% and give him the right to elect all board\n> members?\n\nCorporations formed under Delaware law have very broad discretion to tailor their terms to the wishes of the parties, and most of the statutory provisions are merely default rules of law that apply when not displaced by the governing documents of the corporation.\n\nIf the governing documents provide that particular investors get board seats, then, notwithstanding the share ownership of the investors and shareholders, those investors get board seats. With respect to directors, this authority is formally expressly primarily at [8 Delaware Code \u00a7 141(a)](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc04/index.html).\n\nControl of a corporation doesn't have to align with beneficial economic ownership of a corporation under Delaware law (or for that matter, in for profit corporations in most U.S. jurisdictions).\n\nIt isn't uncommon in a Delaware corporation for control of a corporation to be vested in shareholders (and even some non\\-shareholders) who control only a minority of the economic value of a corporation's shares.\n\nThere are several different ways that this can be documented from a nuts and bolts legal perspective, but the bottom line is that he who controls the board controls the corporation, and that selection of the board of directors can be varied by agreement as expressed in the governing documents (always a certificate of incorporation, usually bylaws, and sometimes also some sort of shareholder's agreement or voting trust).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a Delaware corporation, Investor B owns 5% of the shares but controls 3 out of 5 board seats.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the control and ownership of the company?\n\nA) Investor A's 10% stake automatically gives them the right to elect all board members, overriding Investor B's control.\n\nB) The percentage of share ownership always determines who controls the corporation in Delaware.\n\nC) The board of directors, regardless of share ownership percentages, has the power to make major decisions such as firing the CEO.\n\nD) Investor B's actions are automatically invalid because they own a smaller percentage of shares than Investor A.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In Delaware corporations, control of the company is primarily exercised through the board of directors, not necessarily through share ownership percentages. The governing documents of the corporation can allocate board seats and control in ways that don't directly correspond to economic ownership. In this case, Investor B's control of 3 out of 5 board seats gives them the ability to make major decisions like firing the CEO, even though they own a smaller percentage of shares than Investor A. The percentage of share ownership does not automatically confer the right to elect all board members or override the established board structure. Delaware law allows for significant flexibility in corporate governance structures, and control can be separate from beneficial economic ownership."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25371/are-employees-in-the-eu-more-protected-than-in-the-us-for-sexual-harassment", "docs_id": 25371, "title": "Are employees in the EU more protected than in the US for sexual harassment?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For example, I know someone who was hired in the US for companyX.

Your hypothetical seems to match the facts of that case:\n\n> Aereo, Inc., sells a service that allows its subscribers to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air. When a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently airing, he selects the show from a menu on Aereo\u2019s website. Aereo\u2019s system, which consists of thousands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized warehouse, responds roughly as follows: A server tunes an antenna, which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone, to the broadcast carrying the selected show. A transcoder translates the signals received by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the Internet. A server saves the data in a subscriber\\-specific folder on Aereo\u2019s hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscriber\u2019s screen once several seconds of programming have been saved. The streaming continues, a few seconds behind the over\\-the\\-air broadcast, until the subscriber has received the entire show.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that Aereo infringed the copyright owner's exclusive right to transmit or communicate a work to the public.\n\n[Here is more background on this case from SCOTUSblog](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/american-broadcasting-companies-inc-v-aereo-inc/).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company called StreamSat develops a service that allows users to watch free-to-air satellite TV channels over the internet without the need for a satellite dish.

In that case, the Court ruled that Aereo's service of retransmitting broadcast television signals over the internet infringed on the copyright holders' exclusive right to transmit their work to the public, even though the original broadcasts were freely available over the air. The fact that StreamSat is retransmitting satellite signals rather than terrestrial broadcasts doesn't fundamentally change the legal principles involved. Option A is incorrect because free availability doesn't negate copyright. Option B suggests a possible way to make the service legal, but isn't the best description of its current likely status.

A trademark protected in France, say may well not be protected in the US and vice versa.\n\nDomain registration is a different thing, and are not necessarily tied to a trademark (although registering a domain that infringes an existing trademark will often be disallowed).\n\nThe [Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy-2012-02-25-en) (UDRP) is applied in disputes over the ownership of domain names. It states in section 2 that:\n\n> By applying to register a domain name, or by asking us to maintain or renew a domain name registration, you hereby represent and warrant to us that (a) the statements that you made in your Registration Agreement are complete and accurate; (b) to your knowledge, the registration of the domain name will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party; (c) you are not registering the domain name for an unlawful purpose; and (d) you will not knowingly use the domain name in violation of any applicable laws or regulations. It is your responsibility to determine whether your domain name registration infringes or violates someone else's rights.\n\nIf you have registered a domain name, and another person or firm complains that the name is \"confusingly similar\" to an existing name or to a valid trademark, you might be required to participate in an arbitration proceeding under the UDRP, or else forfeit the registration. Note that noting happens if no one complains.\n\nSection 4(s) of the policy reads:\n\n> You are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in the event that a third party (a \"complainant\") asserts ... that\n> \n> \n> * (i) your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and\n> * (ii) you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and\n> * (iii) your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\n> \n> \n> In the administrative proceeding, the complainant must prove that each of these three elements are present.\n\nNote that\n\n\"Bad faith\" can be shown by evidence that you obtained the domain for purposes of selling or renting it, not for use; that you intended ti prevent a valid trademark owner from obtaining the name, and have engaged in a pattern of such conduct; that your purpose was to disrupt the business of the other; that you intended to attract users who were looking for the other site.\n\nNote also that the complainant bears the burden of proof of the elements of the complaint, including the bad faith in use of a domain. Evidence of actual use for legitimate purposes will be relevant to this. But note that a valid trademark from any jurisdiction will be considered in a n arbitration under the policy, not just US marks.\n\nNote that an arbitration is not a court case, and court rules do not apply. But under section 4k of the policy:\n\n> The mandatory administrative proceeding requirements set forth in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the complainant from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative proceeding is commenced or after such proceeding is concluded.\n\nSo the case may become a court case.\n\nIn an actual trademark case, the first user of the mark in the relevant jurisdiction often has a key advantage. In domain name disputes, this is less true. However, having had the name registered before it began to be used by a complainant can be evidence of lack of bad faith, which can be very important.\n\nThe UDRP is generally included in all contracts to register a domain name, so you are almost surely a party to this agreement already.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. business owner has registered a domain name 16 years ago and has been using it for business purposes without a public web presence.

The situation described involves potential environmental contamination from various sources, including hazardous materials. In the United States, such scenarios are subject to a complex system of environmental regulations at multiple levels of government. As the documentation explains, property owners may be subject to federal laws like the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), state-specific environmental laws, and local regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) oversees federal regulations, but state and local agencies also play crucial roles in environmental protection and enforcement. The complexity arises from the interplay of these various levels of government and their respective laws and agencies, making it challenging even for experts to navigate. The non-commercial nature of the activities does not exempt the property owner from these regulations, especially when dealing with hazardous materials and potential environmental contamination."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14510/was-my-house-legally-searched", "docs_id": 14510, "title": "Was my house legally searched?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A couple of months ago, I overdosed on an illegal drug and called an ambulance.

The police have the power to enforce existing law, but not the power to create new crimes. Part of police power is the power to use force to enforce laws. If a person is trying to kill another (which is a crime), the police can use force to stop the person from committing this crime.\n\nPolice power can be statutorily encoded (Parliament passes a law saying what police can and cannot do), or it could be part of common law. As for laws regulating a suspect, there may be a specific statutory prohibition \u2013 \"you may not reach into your pocket\" \u2013 or there is a common law inference to be made, that if the police have the power to order you to not reach into your pocket you may be forced to comply.\n\nThe subtle distinction here is that if it is a crime to reach into your pocket when told not to, you can be prosecuted and imprisoned. If there is no such crime, you just have the consequence that you can be roughed up to some extent for disobeying the police order.\n\nOne act of Parliament is the [Offences against the Person Act 1861](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/38) \u00a738 which says\n\n> Whosoever . . . shall assault any person with intent to resist or\n> prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of himself or of any other\n> person for any offence, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being\n> convicted thereof shall be liable, at the discretion of the court, to\n> be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years,\n\nNB \"assault\" does not require physical contact: creating apprehension suffices. Another law is the [Police Act 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/89) \u00a789 which says\n\n> Any person who resists or wilfully obstructs a constable in the\n> execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the\n> execution of his duty, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on\n> summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month\n> or to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale, or to both\n\nThese laws do not exhaustively list all of the things that are forbidden (e.g. they do not say \"may not bite. nor scratch, nor kick...\"), instead, the prohibitions fall under the general rubric of assault and resisting.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it is possible that the person could be criminally prosecuted, but even in lieu of a prosecution, it is strongly probable that the police use of force in this instance was lawful. One would have to await the outcome of investigations and litigation to know for sure.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under UK law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding police powers and civilian responsibilities during a stop and search?\n\nA) Police have the statutory power to create new ad-hoc rules during a stop and search, such as prohibiting pocket-reaching, which civilians must follow or face criminal charges.\n\nB) Civilians have no legal obligation to follow police instructions during a stop and search unless explicitly stated in statutory law, and cannot be forcibly restrained for non-compliance.\n\nC) Police can use reasonable force to prevent actions they perceive as potentially threatening during a stop and search, even if those actions are not explicitly prohibited by statute.\n\nD) Only actions specifically listed in the Offences against the Person Act 1861 or the Police Act 1996 can be grounds for police use of force during a stop and search.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. While police cannot create new crimes, they have the power to use reasonable force to enforce existing laws and maintain safety during lawful procedures like a stop and search. Actions such as reaching into pockets after being told not to, while not explicitly prohibited by statute, can be perceived as potentially threatening. Police can use force to prevent such actions under their general powers to prevent assault or obstruction of their duties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because police cannot create new crimes; only Parliament has this power. Option B is incorrect because civilians do have a legal obligation to comply with lawful police instructions, and non-compliance can result in forcible restraint if deemed necessary. Option D is too restrictive, as police powers are not limited only to actions specifically listed in those Acts, but also include common law powers and reasonable interpretations of statutory powers."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77187/can-a-landlord-raise-the-rent-as-much-as-it-want-as-long-as-it-gets-permission-f", "docs_id": 77187, "title": "Can a landlord raise the rent as much as it want as long as it gets permission from the board?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> When can a landlord raise the rent above the guidelines?\n> \n> \n> A landlord can make an application to the Board to approve a rent\n> increase above the guideline if:\n> \n> \n> * a landlord\u2019s costs for municipal taxes or utilities (heat, water and electricity combined) have increased an exceptional amount,\n> * a landlord\u2019s operating costs related to security services increased, or\n> * the landlord had eligible capital expenditures, meaning extraordinary or significant renovations, repairs, replacements or new\n> additions to the building or to individual units.\n\n[https://www.legalline.ca/legal\\-answers/rent\\-increases\\-and\\-maximum\\-rent/](https://www.legalline.ca/legal-answers/rent-increases-and-maximum-rent/)\n\nThe administrator of my apartment building said a 10% rent increase might be expected for this year, because there's a major renovation on the balcony, windows and doors.

Additionally, they almost certainly did not have a prior permission to increase the rent unless you have ignored many documents from your landlord. If they do want to increase the rent above the guidelines, an application must be made to the Board at least 90 days before the effective date of proposed rent increase. A notice of application must be delivered to the tenant at soon as possible.\n\nThe landlord claiming capital expenditures must make relevant documents available to tenants, who have a right to respond to the application before the Board.\n\nMore information can be found from the [Board's website](https://tribunalsontario.ca/documents/ltb/Interpretation%20Guidelines/14%20-%20Applications%20for%20Rent%20Increases%20above%20the%20Guideline.html):\n\n> The application MUST be filed at least 90 days before the effective date of the first intended rent increase being claimed in the application.
