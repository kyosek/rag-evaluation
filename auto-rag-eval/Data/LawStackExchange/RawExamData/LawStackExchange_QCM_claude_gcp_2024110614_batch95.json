If a coffin has not been provided by relatives, the\n> body shall be delivered in a plain coffin. If the body is not claimed\n> by relatives, it shall be given to physicians who have requested it\n> for dissection or to be disposed of in the same manner as are bodies\n> of prisoners dying in the state prison.\n\nTennessee, on the other hand, [is reported](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/breakingnews/story/2020/feb/13/no-autopsies-tennessee-electrocutions/515629/) to have honored requests to not autopsy and autopsied only 1 of 6 executed prisoners. The Tennessee law ([38\\-7\\-106](https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/oscme/tca-postmortem-examination-act.html)) says that\n\n> A county medical examiner may perform or order an autopsy on the body\n> of any person in a case involving a homicide, suspected homicide, a\n> suicide, a violent, unnatural or suspicious death, an unexpected\n> apparent natural death in an adult, sudden unexpected infant and child\n> deaths, deaths believed to represent a threat to public health or\n> safety, and executed prisoners.

[Louisiana law](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2014/code-revisedstatutes/title-13/rs-13-5713/) is a little unclear at the statutory level, because\n\n> The coroner shall either view the body or make an investigation into\n> the cause and manner of death in all cases involving the following...\n> (2\\) Sudden or violent deaths...(9\\) Deaths due to drowning, hanging,\n> burns, electrocution, gunshot wounds, stabs or cutting, lightning,\n> starvation, radiation, exposure, alcoholism, addiction, tetanus,\n> strangulation, suffocation, or smothering... (12\\) Deaths in prison or\n> while serving a sentence.\n\nThe coroner can discharge that obligation by non\\-invasive means. Lousiana has a religious\\-objection provision:\n\n> If the family of the deceased objects to an autopsy on religious\n> grounds, the autopsy shall not be performed unless the coroner finds\n> that the facts surrounding the death require that an autopsy be\n> performed in the interest of the public safety, public health, or\n> public welfare. In such cases the coroner shall provide the family his\n> written reasons for the necessity of the autopsy.\n\nIt's hard to see how there could be a public interest reason compelling an autopsy in the case of a governmental execution, but this is fiction.\n\nSome states have a law providing for religious exceptions to autopsy. You can [make a request](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/coroner/death-investigation/ReligiousobjectiontoAutopsy/Pages/home.aspx) in S.

Which of the following best describes the legal situation regarding the prisoner's request?\n\nA) The autopsy is mandatory under Tennessee law and cannot be avoided under any circumstances.\nB) The prisoner can file a religious objection that will automatically prevent the autopsy from being performed.\nC) The medical examiner has discretion to honor the request, but the district attorney general can override this decision.\nD) The prisoner's next of kin must be notified and can prevent the autopsy if they object within 24 hours.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the Tennessee law and integration of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Tennessee law (38-7-106) gives discretion to the county medical examiner to perform or order an autopsy in cases involving executed prisoners. The law states, \"A county medical examiner may perform or order an autopsy on the body of any person in a case involving [...] executed prisoners.\" This indicates that autopsies are not mandatory.\n\n2. The documentation mentions that Tennessee \"is reported to have honored requests to not autopsy and autopsied only 1 of 6 executed prisoners,\" supporting the idea that the medical examiner has discretion.\n\n3. However, the law also provides that \"The chief medical examiner or the district attorney general may order an autopsy in such cases [...] if the county medical examiner has not ordered an autopsy.\" This means that even if the medical examiner honors the prisoner's request, the district attorney general has the authority to override this decision and order an autopsy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the autopsy is not mandatory under Tennessee law. Option B is incorrect because while some states have religious objection provisions, Tennessee's law doesn't specifically mention this for executed prisoners. Option D is partially correct in that the next of kin must be notified, but it doesn't give them the power to prevent the autopsy, only to be informed about it.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze complex legal situations, integrate information from multiple parts of the documentation, and apply critical thinking to a real-world scenario in the criminal justice system."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32809/identity-of-the-controller-gdpr-can-any-website-now-ever-be-anonymous", "docs_id": 32809, "title": "Identity of the controller (GDPR): can any website now ever be anonymous?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: No matter whether a website collects personal data or not, it seems that a privacy policy is required anyway, and such a policy should contain (citing article 13 of the GDPR, first paragraph):\n\n> (a) the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller's representative;\n\nWhat is \"the identity\" supposed to be, exactly?

The correct answer (A) aligns with the documentation's suggestion that a domain name might be an acceptable form of identification for the controller. This approach allows the blogger to comply with GDPR Article 13's requirement to provide \"the identity and contact details of the controller\" without revealing personal information.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while it attempts to preserve anonymity, using a pseudonym doesn't fulfill the GDPR's requirement for clear identification of the controller.

The correct answer is C because the legislation, as exemplified by the Victorian Children, Young Persons and Families Act, does not provide a clear-cut rule but rather a standard of reasonableness that must be assessed based on all circumstances.\n\nThe law states that leaving a child without reasonable provision for supervision and care for an unreasonable time is prohibited. However, what constitutes \"reasonable\" and \"unreasonable\" is not explicitly defined and depends on various factors.\n\nIn this scenario, the short duration (3 minutes), the child's age (5 years), the sleeping state of the child, and the necessity of the errand (paying for petrol) are all relevant factors that would be considered in determining reasonableness. The parent's ability to maintain visual contact with the vehicle might also be a factor.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law does not automatically deem such actions as neglect without considering circumstances. Option B oversimplifies the legal standard and ignores other relevant factors. Option D is incorrect because service stations are not given any special legal status in this context.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple aspects of the law and critical thinking about how it might be interpreted in practice."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90685/outsourcing-work-without-informing-the-employer-is-that-illegal-or-punishable", "docs_id": 90685, "title": "Outsourcing work without informing the employer: is that illegal or punishable?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a freelancer and many times I simply outsource or hire a subcontractor (all ghost subcontractors) from like UpWork to do what my clients' ask from me.

The use of subcontractors (\"ghost subcontractors\") without client knowledge is not inherently illegal, but it can lead to complications.\n\n2. The answer states, \"If there are defects in the work product, the client will come after you, regardless of who did the work.

The answer notes, \"You, in turn, can try to recover your damages from the sub, but that depends on the nature of the contract you have with the sub.\"\n\n4. The non-disclosure of subcontracting, while not necessarily fraudulent, could be seen as a breach of trust and might lead to additional legal complications or loss of future business.\n\n5.

The correct answer is B because seeking a second opinion from another criminal defense attorney is the most practical and effective way for Rob to protect himself from potentially unethical advice.\n\nOption A, while seemingly logical, doesn't fully address the core issue of the lawyer's potential unethical motivation. A written explanation could still be manipulated to justify an unnecessary trial.\n\nOption C is premature and extreme, as there's no concrete evidence of misconduct yet. Filing a complaint without basis could harm Rob's legal representation.\n\nOption D is unrealistic and unethical in itself, as no lawyer can guarantee a specific outcome in a criminal trial.\n\nSeeking a second opinion (B) allows Rob to get an independent assessment of his case without immediately confronting or alienating his current lawyer. This aligns with the documentation's suggestion that the best protection is to choose a lawyer with a good reputation. By consulting another attorney, Rob can compare advice and better evaluate whether his current lawyer's recommendation is in his best interest or potentially motivated by financial gain.\n\nThis approach also addresses the documentation's point about the difficulty in detecting unethical intentions, as a second opinion provides a check against potentially self-serving advice.

The statute prohibits the \"fraudulent or wrongful\" use of the FBI's seal. But \"fraudulent\" and \"wrongful\" generally refer only to conduct where one uses deception or other means to obtain money, property, etc. to which they have no lawful entitlement. [*United States v. Enmons*, 410 U.S. 396, 399 (1973\\)](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-enmons).\n\nBecause you aren't using the seal to obtain anyone's property through deception, this use would not fall within the statute's proscriptions.\n\nEven if the government sought to prosecute you, you would have a valid First Amendment defense. The First Amendment protects the right to free speech, and it does not allow statements to be criminalized merely because they are false. [*United States v. Alvarez*, 132 S. Ct. 2537 (2012\\)](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-alvarez).\n\nThis outcome should be unsurprising to most U.S. observers.

Were juries used in Old Testament, Greek, Roman, or Inquisition trials?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The modern jury trial in common law countries (i.e. those with legal systems based upon those of English law) derives from [12th century English practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juries_in_England_and_Wales) as it evolved over time in England, and is frozen in time to some extent in U.S. practice, by the nature of the jury trial as an institution at the time that it became a constitutional right in the United States in 1789\\. The English jury system emerged in the 12th century in the wake of the Norman conquest of 1066 CE, and codified Norman customary law, particularly among its soldiers in courts\\-martial and had some resemblance to modern courts\\-martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for the United States military such as the notion that you could be judge's only by your peers in rank or your superiors, although it subsequently evolved in English civil practice.\n\n(England also developed in parallel non\\-jury courts of equity as a division of the tax collection department in England, a set of courts that were merged with courts of law in most places in the U.S. in the 19th century, the remains a distinctive source of U.S. jurisprudence in matters which are decided solely by judges. This short summary also ignores features like the coroners' juries and grand juries of English derived practice.)\n\nThe civil jury is now almost extinct in England itself, and in most common law countries other than the U.S., except for a handful of kinds of cases (e.g. defamation, civil fraud, false imprisonment, and eminent domain cases), and in serious criminal cases. Other cases in England are now handled in the first instance by a single judge at the trial court level in most cases. Outside the common law countries, first instance trials in serious cases are usually conducted by a panel of three or five judges, with a lead judge presiding over the conduct of the matter.\n\nMost jury\\-like systems outside of common law countries are limited to serious criminal matters, and often involve a hybrid of judges and specially selected citizens with exceptional (\"blue ribbon\") qualifications who deliberate together with the judges. These systems were mostly adopted after World War II in imitation of U.S. and English practice, but some as early as the 15th century in Europe.\n\nThe Continental European practices described in an answer by @Geremia, and likewise Greek direct democracy based trial and Sumerian trials come from a tradition that was abandoned no later than the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe as civil codes on the model of the French and German civil codes were adopted, and often much earlier. These practices are not ancestral to the current practice of jury trials in modern legal systems.\n\nJuries were not described as a means of adjudication in the Bible. \n\nIn the ancient democratic Greek city\\-states, some city\\-states had direct democracy of landed males citizens and those citizens met collectively in town meeting style to address both legislative and judicial matters. The governance practice of Caribbean pirates, or some isolated bands and tribes, of small early New England Puritan communities, and of small revolutionary military units, have some similarities to this kind of practice, all of which were small communities organized on a principle of direct democracy and which arose more or less independently of each other.\n\nMostly, in the Roman Empire, judges or regulated private arbitrators resolved the matters that were vested in civil and criminal juries today in places that still have them. Some serious matters [at times in Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial#Rome) were decided by quasi\\-juries in a Greek town meeting like format with hundreds of jurors in a stadium or amphitheater. But this was never a routine means by which justice was metted out.\n\nInquisitorial trials were a subset of canon law, and canon law is generally carried out by deputized clergy, in a process that was more written than oral, and in that involved active investigation by the judges rather than passive consideration of adversary presented evidence (giving rise to the modern inquisitorial judicial systems common in Continental Europe, Latin America, and much of Asia (where Maoist or Islamic legal systems are not primarily influences).\n\nIn Medieval Times, the predominant practice was for decisions to be made by the ranking local feudal lord, or his delegate, and the role of the delegate of a feudal lord is directly ancestral to that of the common law legal system's judges, which is one of the reasons that common law judges have powers such as contempt of court, and immunities from liability not available to judges elsewhere.\n\nSelect institutions in the Holy Roman Empire and what is now Germany in the 15th to 19th centuries appear to have been devised in imitation of the English jury system.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the origin of jury trials, here's a challenging question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A legal historian is comparing modern jury systems with historical forms of adjudication.

A license is permission to make copies, and under copyright law, you can only make copies with permission of the rights holder. You cannot use software on a computer without making a number of copies (most of which are made semi\\-automatically by the computer).\n\nIf you own a copy of the software, you are allowed to do anything with that copy (not make other copies, but otherwise, whatever you want). This is the so\\-called first sale doctrine. However, it is very rare (perhaps nonexistent) that anybody \"buys a copy of the software\", in fact it is not at all clear what that would mean. When you buy a disk that installs software, you are buying two things: (1\\) a physical disk, and (2\\) a license to use the program in a specified way. Without the license, you only have a disk which can be used as an expensive coaster.\n\nFound disks are not an escape hatch that circumvents copyright protection. Suppose you buy a copy of Word, then installed it; then toss the original disk. Someone finds the disk, installs it, and tosses the disk. Ad infinitum: 1 legal and paid copy multiplies into thousands of free copies.\n\nIf you have an installation disk for e.g. MS Word which does not have a license (look for the license file), and somehow (somehow) suppressed the code that shows you the \"you must agree\" box, then you have an illegal copy of Word. If you have software that is supposed to be distributed under some do\\-anything license (e.g. CC\\-0\\) and there is no actual license on the disk (or similar means of distributing a license along with the software), they you don't know what you have. If you can locate the author, they may say \"I put the license file on my web page, I guess the other guy didn't include the file, but as you can see, everybody has permission to use it, and you don't even have to include the license\". In other words, there *is* permission, you just didn't know it. The same author might have even thought \"If I put the software out there for all to download and don't restrict access, then I've licensed it\". Or, the original author licensed the software as long as it is used non\\-commercially. \n\nThe problem is that the honest user cannot distinguish between pirated software and sloppily\\-distributed software, where the original author or the re\\-distributor has failed to include explicit permission to use.

The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the circular nature of consideration in bilateral contracts as described in the documentation. \n\nThe passage states: \"A's promise is only good consideration for B's because the law regards it as enforceable and therefore of value, and it is only regarded as enforceable because it is supported by consideration. But it is only supported by consideration if B's promise is enforceable and so it goes on ad infinitum!\"\n\nThis describes a self-reinforcing loop where each party's promise serves as consideration for the other's promise, making the contract binding even before any performance occurs. This principle allows for the creation of enforceable future contracts, which is crucial for commercial transactions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests only one party's promise constitutes consideration, whereas the doctrine requires mutual consideration. Option B is wrong because promissory estoppel is a different legal concept and not the primary basis for enforceability here. Option D is incorrect because the time gap alone doesn't create consideration; it's the exchange of promises that does.\n\nThis question requires students to analyze the concept of consideration in bilateral contracts, apply it to a real-world scenario, and understand the seemingly circular logic that underpins this important commercial principle."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90346/how-does-a-body-corporate-get-sentenced-for-criminal-offences", "docs_id": 90346, "title": "How does a body corporate get sentenced for criminal offences?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Some criminal offences specifically state that if they are committed by the officer of a body corporate then they along with the body corporate itself may be simultaneously processed against as well as each other.\n\nThey are further specified to be punishable on indictment to X years in prison.\n\nDoes the prison term get translated according to some scale as a fine in case of a corporate defendant?\n\nFurther, can bodies corporate be tried in magistrate as well as crown court?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [canada](/questions/tagged/canada \"show questions tagged 'canada'\")\n\nCorporations are subject to the monetary fines in the *Criminal Code* or relevant Act.

I was standing outside of my apartment next door. I do have a key for that building and stated that I did but when he asked me to use it, I refused stating that I am not supposed to. He stated that I could be cited for refusing to assist him. He said he was there to talk to a sex offender. I did not ask if he had a warrant and he did not say he had one. I left after providing the contact info for the building's landlord.\n\nAfter some googling I found that it is a crime to not assist an officer but it seems to be limited to when that officer is making an arrest:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refusing\\_to\\_assist\\_a\\_police\\_officer\\#Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refusing_to_assist_a_police_officer#Colorado)\n\n* Country: United States\n* State: Colorado\n* City: Denver\n\nMy Question: since the officer did not state he was making an arrest and did not provide a warrant, was I legally required to assist him in opening the door?\n\nSide Note: the officer was nocking on several people's windows and even tried to jimmy the lock with one of his keys. I also looked at the sex offender registry afterwards and did not find anyone in that building or near by. He also asked for my name and apartment number and wrote them down. The situation seemed shady.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This all depends upon where you are. I am a landlord and I am answering based upon the laws of the U.S. and the states that I operate in.\n\nFirst things first. You are not the property owner. While this does not limit the answer, it is a factor. You do not have the right to the property even if you have a key and the permission of the tenant. You are not the property owner, do not represent the property owner nor the tenant, and by contract do not have legal rights to the apartment. It does put you in a different situation.\n\nAs a landlord, it is against the law for me to provide access to a tenants apartment to anyone without authorization. This, of course, precludes emergencies such as welfare checks. In the case of the police, a warrant is required or a form that the police fill out that allows the police to gain access. This would be used in cases such as when a spouse requires the recovery of personal property during a domestic dispute. A judges order is not always possible in these cases. These are often limited cases and the form absolves the landlord of liability even in cases where the police act incorrectly.\n\nSo without a warrant or a form that certifies any lawful request, anyone including the landlord can be arrested for a crime.\n\nFor your situation, a quick call to the landlord would have been appropriate. Without a warrant or certification, the police still had options including waiting for the person in question to either leave or return to the apartment or even request a warrant by phone. Often, the warrant, once signed by the judge, can be read over the phone. Any landlord should always have a paper copy provided within minutes since some cruisers will have a printer and can print the warrant.\n\nYour refusal appears to be legal. However, in the future, you can ask for a copy of the warrant that you provide the landlord.\n\nI do not wish to paint a negative image of the police who do the hard work that most people will never take on, they are after all heros, however, some do not know the law perfectly well especially tenant landlord law. As well, some will try and get away with skirting the law trying to get an important job done. It does happen. I hired a lawyer just last week for an illegal request unrelated to the question here.\n\nAddressing the OPs comment:\n\n> Hello, I believe I misstated the situation a bit in that the locked\n>  door in question was for the apartment building and not a tenet's\n>  apartment itself. I have edited my question. Does this change\n>  anything?\n\nTechnically, this does not change much of anything, however, the request by the police can be seen as a reasonable one. They just may want to talk to the individual which is reasonable. In this case, I might have let them in if the access I was giving them was to a common space such as a hallway. In this case, the outer door locks are only to keep Intruders from entering the building and not meant to restrict access for valid purposes.\n\nAre you in trouble? I would say no. If anyone asks, you can give reasonable arguments for your situation. However, the next time, consider what I have written here. The police have a tough enough time doing their jobs.

The correct answer, C, best balances legal obligations and tenant rights for several reasons:\n\n1. Legal requirement to assist: While there is a law in Colorado about assisting officers, it's typically limited to arrest situations, which isn't explicitly the case here.\n\n2. Property rights: As mentioned in the expert answer, without being the property owner or their representative, the individual doesn't have the legal right to grant access to the building, especially without proper authorization.\n\n3. Tenant privacy: Landlords (and by extension, others with access) are generally not allowed to provide access to tenant spaces without authorization, except in specific emergencies.\n\n4. Proper procedure: The expert answer suggests that police should have a warrant or a specific form for lawful access requests.

Reasonable cooperation: By offering the landlord's contact information, the individual is cooperating with the officer to a reasonable extent without overstepping legal or ethical boundaries.\n\nOption A is incorrect because refusing to assist isn't always illegal, especially in this ambiguous situation.

While the website owner has a legitimate claim to the domain (it's their own name), redirecting traffic intended for the celebrity to a commercial site could be seen as an attempt to capitalize on the celebrity's fame if not handled carefully.\n\nThe answer is not A (Trademark infringement) because the website owner is using their own name, which they have a right to use, even if it happens to match a celebrity's name. It's not B (Copyright violation) because redirecting traffic doesn't inherently violate copyright laws. D (Cybersquatting) is incorrect because the domain owner isn't intentionally registering a domain to profit from someone else's trademark; they registered their own name before the celebrity became famous.\n\nC is the correct answer because the main legal risk lies in potentially misleading visitors who are looking for the celebrity. If the website owner doesn't clearly distinguish that they are not the celebrity and are redirecting to an unrelated commercial site, this could be construed as impersonation or an attempt to mislead for commercial gain.\n\nTo avoid legal issues, the website owner should ensure there's a clear disclaimer on the redirected page stating that they are not the celebrity and that this is an unrelated commercial site.

Cheers\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I assume this is perfectly fine if I don't use imagery or artistic inspiration from the show?\n\nYou are correct. The idea of an elimination context is an old one, going back at least to the late Roman Republic. In can case ideas, methods and procedures are never protected by copyright.\n\n> \\[What] if a face resembling the creepy little girl's face from Game\\#1 is featured in various screens on the app?\n\nThat image is almost surely protected by copyright. Any use of it without permission from the copyright owner (whoever that might be, quite possibly the production company for the show) would be unlawful, specifically copyright infringement, unless an exception to copyright applies.\n\nIn the US that would be ***fair use***, which is a highly fact\\-driven determination. But it this case it seems unlikely that fair use would apply if you are in the US. See [Is this copyright infringement? Is it fair use? What if I don't make any money off it?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o) for more on fair use\n\nThe exceptions to copyright in non\\-US law are generally narrower and more specific than fair use, and it is rather less likely that any such exception would apply. (see [What is the practical difference between \"fair use\" and \"fair dealing\" in Copyright law?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48359/what-is-the-practical-difference-between-fair-use-and-fair-dealing-in-copyri) for more on this.) In short you may not lawfully use that image without permission from the copyright holder.\n\nIn addition, the person whose face is shown in the image may well have \"personality rights\" or \"rights of publicity\" separate from any copyright, depending on your jurisdiction (such rights are recognized differently in different places, and some jurisdictions do not recognize them at all.) She could possibly sue if her image was used without her permission.\n\nIf a game developer creates a more generic image, not directly based on any image from the show, or gets someone else to create such an image and buys or is given the copyright or a license to use the image, there should be no legal issue with regard to any image copyright.\n\nTrademark issues\n----------------\n\nIn addition to copyright issues, there could be trademark issues here.\n\nIf you use the actual name of the show \"Squid Game\", that might seem to be trading off the reputation of the show, and implying that your game is authorized or sponsored or endorsed by the show's creators. That might well be trademark infringement, unless you get permission from the trademark owner.\n\nHowever, what is a protected trademark is specific to a country. What is protected in one country is often not protected in another. Only a relative few very popular products are protected in every country.\n\nIn addition \"Squid Game\" is a rather descriptive, generic name.

The correct answer is D because using a character closely resembling the \"creepy little girl\" from the show would likely constitute copyright infringement. The documentation explicitly states that \"That image is almost surely protected by copyright\" and \"Any use of it without permission from the copyright owner... would be unlawful, specifically copyright infringement.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the elimination game format is not protected by copyright, as \"ideas, methods and procedures are never protected by copyright.\"\n\nOption B is plausible but less likely to be the primary issue. While there could be trademark concerns with using \"Squid\" in the name, especially if it implies endorsement by the show, the documentation suggests that \"Squid Game\" is a rather descriptive, generic name that would probably receive only limited protection.\n\nOption C is incorrect because using a generic little girl character (not resembling the one from the show) would not violate personality rights.

That is clear from the fact that the party seeking to rely on the strict legal position must be the same party that is required to provide reasonable notice, as the passage suggests. Strict legal position cannot mean promissory estoppel and is used to distinguish the (equitable) estoppel position. The requirement of court action is obviously a good practical point, should the promisee deny any obligation to revert to the strict position. \u201cProbably\u201d is appropriate because, of course, it may be that the promisee does consent to reverting to the strict position, but given that it is likely to perceive that it has an agreement with the promisor as to the amended payment or other obligation (whatever the subject of the promise), in practical terms it is often unwilling to do so. High Trees supports this point (and, tellingly, it is High Trees, not Tool Metal, cited in support).

Which of the following approaches is most legally sound for TechInnovate to resume their full contractual rights?\n\nA) Immediately bill DataCorp for the full amount, citing the end of pandemic conditions\nB) File a lawsuit to enforce the original contract terms without prior notice\nC) Provide reasonable notice to DataCorp of intent to resume full fees, then initiate court proceedings if necessary\nD) Retroactively charge DataCorp for the waived fees from the past two years\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the principles from Tool Metal and High Trees cases to a modern scenario. The correct approach combines elements from both cases:\n\n1. Providing reasonable notice: As established in Tool Metal, the promisor (TechInnovate) should give reasonable notice of their intention to revert to the original contract terms. This respects the principle that promissory estoppel is generally suspensory rather than extinctive for future obligations.\n\n2. Potential court action: The documentation states, \"In any event, court action would probably be required to enforce the strict legal position so that it would be necessary to initiate proceedings.\" This suggests that if DataCorp resists the reinstatement of full fees after notice, TechInnovate may need to initiate legal proceedings.\n\n3. No retroactive charges: Following High Trees, TechInnovate cannot claim the waived fees from the past two years, as these are considered extinguished.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't provide reasonable notice. Option B is premature and doesn't follow the established process of giving notice first.

One typically consents for this data to be processed when completing associated paperwork. \n\nOnce the check has concluded, would the company be obliged (if requested by the subject of the check) to purge all personal data that was gathered prior to and during the check? Furthermore, upon receiving the request, would any third parties with which the screening company shares the data also be obliged to purge it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Intro\n=====\n\nI assume that the background screening you are referring to is made in connection with applying for a job. If so, it would generally be the applicant's (prospect) employer that is primarily responsible for the processing of the personal data in relation to the applicant. The employer outsources the background screening to a service provider, which in GDPR terms is considered a controller\\-processor relationship (the service provider processes personal data about the applicant on behalf of the employer/the controller). \n\nThe same principles generally apply irrespective of whether the data is collected prior to or during the screening. However, depending on the content of such data, different safeguarding requirements may apply.\n\nConsent possibly not reliable\n=============================\n\nThe employer must identify legal grounds for processing the data that a background screening collects (see [Article 6 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)). It could be argued whether consent is valid ground for background screening considering the imbalance between the parties. In many jurisdictions within the EU, consent in an employment context has generally been very difficult to rely on. If consent could not be relied on, the employer would typically have to argue for that there is a legitimate interest to process the data. (See also [Article 88 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-88-gdpr/).)\n\nStorage time\n============\n\nA general principle in GDPR is storage limitation ([Article 5(1\\)(e)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/)). It means that a controller (or a processor) may not store personal data for a longer period than necessary. Hence, once the background screening is completed, the employer is not likely allowed to store the data for a longer period than is necessary for completion of the recruitment process. The background screening company should likely not have any use of the data after having provided the background screening report to the employer. The employer may however argue that the information must be stored for some time to be able to manage the recruitment.\n\nDeletion upon request\n=====================\n\nThe applicant has no absolute right to request a deletion of data (which is a common misunderstanding of GDPR). The \"right to be forgotten\" is a bit different depending on the context of the processing (see [Article 17 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/)):\n\n* If the processing is based on **consent**, the applicant may request a deletion, which in general must be complied with, but the employer might find other grounds for keeping the data.\n* If the processing is based on **legitimate interest**, the applicant may request a deletion, and the employer will have to re\\-assess its grounds for keeping the data. If the grounds are still valid, the employer is not obliged to remove the data.\n\nSharing with third parties\n==========================\n\nYour question touches upon the issue of parties with which the screening company would share the screening information. Except for with the employer (which has a direct relationship with the applicant), it should be noted that there is very little room in GDPR for the screening company (or the employer) to share the data with any other party, unless the applicant has explicitly consented thereto. Such a third party would then likely be a controller in itself, and the third party would then have a direct responsibility and liability towards the applicant. It would then likely be possible to withdraw the consent, which triggers an obligation to purge the data.\n\nThird party deletion\n====================\n\nIf the employer is obliged to purge the data (e.g. if consent is withdrawn or there is no remaining legal ground for continuing the processing/storing of data), the background screening service provider should also delete the data. Although also the service provider is bound by GDPR, some responsibility falls upon the employer to stipulate the conditions for such deletion in a contract between the parties (see [Article 28(3\\)(e) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/)).\n\nConcluding remarks\n==================\n\nThis area is a bit tricky and disputed, see for instance [here](https://www.sterlingtalentsolutions.com/blog/2018/04/gdpr-impact-background-screening-program/), [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pre-employment-background-screening-under-gdpr-frivaldszky-dr-llm-/) and [here](http://www.scesolicitors.co.uk/news/background-screening-and-gdpr#.Wz3V19UzaUk). A good advice is therefore to review the privacy notices that the employer must provide along with any request to provide information for a background check. \n\nIt could also be worth mentioning that a background screening company is generally prohibited from dealing with data relating to criminal convictions and offences ([Article 10 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-10-gdpr/)), which to my experience is quite common.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A multinational company conducts background checks on job applicants using a third-party screening service.

Lexmark Intern., Inc., 680 F.Supp.2d 357, 375 (D.P.R. 2010\\)](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5914b0eaadd7b04934755e02)\n\n> \"This incident, however, is not sufficient to constitute direct evidence of discriminatory animus...**\\[Defendant's agent]'s anecdote could be interpreted as emphasizing the importance of a positive attitude, rather than plaintiff's interpretation that it expressed a preference for younger male employees...This benign interpretation** seems more plausible...In light of these facts, there does not appear to be any evidence on the record that gives a 'high degree of assurance' that discriminatory animus was behind the decision to terminate plaintiff\" (emphasis added).\n\n**NOTE**: OP's original question was simply whether listing 'positive attitude' on a job description was illegal. OP has now changed the question to whether making employment decisions based on a depressed individual's lack of a positive attitude is illegal. Although I have great sympathy for those with mental illness and personally wish the law were different, my answer is still that this is almost certainly legal.\n\nAnother example of a court finding attitude to be a legitimate reason upon which to base employment decisions is: Martin v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 126 F.Supp.2d 809 (M.D. Pa 2000\\). In this case, the court accepted as a legitimate reason for promoting one individual over another that the promoted individual \"demonstrated good interpersonal skills.\" *Id*. at 817\\.\n\nA third example is Lloyd v. Swifty Transp., Inc., 552 F.3d 594 (7th Cir. 2009\\). In this case, the Seventh Circuit explicitly noted that \"\\[t]he employer, not a court, determines what functions are essential, and we will not second\\-guess that decision.\" *Id*. at 601\\. It then went on to affirm dismissal of the plaintiff's ADA claim because the employer \"said that lead drivers must have knowledge of the mechanics of the trucks and **be able to manage the other drivers on the truck through a positive attitude and ability to get along well with others. But the supervisors in charge of hiring lead drivers testified without contradiction that \\[the plaintiff] had a negative attitude that drew complaints from other drivers**.\" *Id*. at 601\\-602 (emphasis added).\n\nAfter a relatively exhaustive search, I've found no case to counter these pretty clear statements that basing employment decisions on 'attitude' is legal.\n\n**FURTHER NOTE**: OP has now modified the question again to add the qualification that the lack of a positive attitude \"doesn't prevent the employee from doing their job.\" IF this were actually true, then the answer likely becomes that illegal discrimination has occurred because then the employee would be 'otherwise qualified' (a key phrase in employment law litigation). BUT, there is an inherent contradiction in premises in OP's question now because if X is a requirement of a job, and Y employee cannot do X because of Z, then Z is preventing Y employee from doing that job. In other words, if a job requires a positive attitude, then one can't do that job without a positive attitude. Ultimately, what OP's question is really trying to get at is 'what if the employer makes 'positive attitude' a job requirement, but I don't think it should be a job requirement?' Unfortunately, there's almost certainly no legal recourse for this *as long as it's a legal job requirement* because, to reiterate the 7th Circuit, \"\\[t]he employer, not a court, determines what functions are essential, and \\[a court] will not second\\-guess that decision.\" *Id*. at 601\\.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A software company has a job opening for a senior developer position that lists \"positive attitude\" as a requirement. An applicant with a history of major depression applies for the role. They meet all technical qualifications but struggle to maintain a consistently optimistic outlook due to their condition. The hiring manager is concerned about team dynamics. Which of the following actions would be most legally defensible under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?\n\nA) Reject the applicant solely based on their inability to maintain a \"positive attitude\"\nB) Hire the applicant but require them to undergo company-sponsored therapy to improve their attitude\nC) Evaluate the applicant's ability to perform essential job functions, regardless of their attitude\nD) Create a separate position with reduced responsibilities to accommodate the applicant's condition\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the provided documentation and legal precedents. The correct answer, C, is the most legally defensible action under the ADA for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation emphasizes that the ADA requires both the presence of a disability and the ability to perform the job. Major depression is recognized as a potential disability.\n\n2. The question specifies that the applicant meets all technical qualifications, suggesting they can perform essential job functions.\n\n3. Legal precedents cited (e.g., Lloyd v. Swifty Transp., Inc.) indicate that employers determine essential job functions. However, if the lack of a positive attitude doesn't prevent job performance (as stated in the question), it may not be considered an essential function.\n\n4. The \"positive attitude\" requirement could be seen as a pretext for discrimination if it's not directly related to job performance.\n\n5. Evaluating the applicant's ability to perform essential functions aligns with ADA principles of non-discrimination and reasonable accommodation.\n\nOption A is likely illegal as it discriminates based on disability without considering job performance. Option B could be seen as invasive and potentially discriminatory. Option D, while well-intentioned, may be considered discriminatory if it unnecessarily segregates the employee based on their disability.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about the intersection of employment law, disability rights, and workplace policies, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83590/is-estimated-or-projected-income-a-legal-precedent-factor-upon-a-credit-card", "docs_id": 83590, "title": "Is &quot;estimated&quot; or &quot;projected&quot; income a legal precedent/factor upon a credit card application?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If you are self\\-employed you have no fixed income \\-\\- therefore, you can't expect that any income information given is GUARANTEED or BACKED by any solid proof \\-\\- no one can predict the future so you cannot give certainty.\n\nSay one enters a high PREDICTED or PROJECTED income in to a credit card application as per their own original insight in to their expectation or future work prospects as they are an independent contractor.\n\nGiven such, how can one draw the line between LYING about your income and PREDICTING an UNCERTAIN income?\n\nIsn't it just a moot point?

The correct answer, D, aligns with the legal and ethical considerations outlined in the top answer.\n\nOption D is the most appropriate because it involves reporting a reasonable projection based on current trends and secured contracts, which demonstrates a sincere belief in the stated income. This approach balances the need for providing income information with the inherent uncertainty of self-employment. By clearly indicating that it's an estimate, the applicant is being transparent about the nature of the income projection.\n\nOption A is too aggressive and could be seen as potentially fraudulent if there's no realistic basis for such optimistic projections. Option B, while conservative, doesn't accurately reflect the current state or future prospects of the business. Option C, while acknowledging uncertainty, may not be accepted by credit card applications that require a specific figure.\n\nThe explanation in the documentation emphasizes that fraud is limited to false statements of presently existing material facts, and future income predictions are not considered as such. However, the key is that the applicant must sincerely believe in the projection they provide.

It's not a condition precedent (ruling out A) because it doesn't specify an event that must occur before a duty arises. Instead, it's an ongoing promise of performance.\n\n3.

If you paid $2000 for the photo, you might want to check to see if it came with a licensing agreement.\n\n**Background**\n\nOne way to view this is through the lens of privacy. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652A subjects privacy invaders to liability for the resulting harm to the *interests* of the other. Because you mention public personas and your facts don't involve disclosing private details, negative publicity, or interfering with seclusion, one might think appropriation of name or likeness applies.\n\n> [Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652C](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/privacy/Privacy_R2d_Torts_Sections.htm)\n> \n> \n> One who appropriates to his own use or benefit the name or likeness of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy.\n\nComment (a) to this section explains that a person's identity is in the nature of a property right. Courts have tended to recognize an individual's interest in the exclusive use of his or her own identity, going so far as to require licensing for usage.\n\nThe most common way to violate this \"property right\" is by appropriating someone's name or likeness to promote a business or product. Cases abound on the subject, but a classic one is [*White v. Samsung Electronics America, Inc.*, 971 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir. 1992\\)](http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/mburke/Classes/Property_Current_Year/White_v_Samsung.pdf). To summarize, Samsung ran a [picture\\-based ad](http://legalstudiesclassroom.blogspot.com/2011/03/featured-case-white-v-samsung.html) featuring a futuristic robot dressed in an evening gown and turning \"Wheel of Fortune\"\\-styled letters. Vanna White was nonplussed and brought suit, which she won on appeal. In its opinion, the Ninth Circuit argued the operative question wasn't *how* Samsung appropriated her likeness, but *whether* they had done so. The point of citing *White* here is simply to observe that a person's \"likeness\" probably extends even further than mere photo reproduction.\n\nBack to your facts: posting actual images of celebrities for a commercial purpose appears a much more clear cut appropriation of likeness than *White*. While it may seem similar, I'd distinguish your situation from that of restaurant \"Walls of Fame\"\\-\\-\\-which showcase signed photos of celebrities with the owner\\-\\-\\-in that the celebrities you mention weren't using your product or service at the time of the photograph.\n\nYou might argue the photos aren't being used for advertising, but the plaintiff would counter that you posted them on a client\\-facing business website. In the Ninth Circuit this would be a question of *whether* there was an appropriation, not the way in which it was accomplished.\n\nFor argument's sake, assume the court agrees your usage isn't commercial. Even that doesn't necessarily mean you're in the clear. In \u00a7 652C, and varying state\\-by\\-state, non\\-commercial purposes are also subject to scrutiny:\n\n> Comment (b). Apart from statute, however, the rule stated is not limited to commercial appropriation. It applies also when the defendant makes use of the plaintiff's name or likeness for his own purposes and benefit, even though the use is not a commercial one, and even though the benefit sought to be obtained is not a pecuniary one. Statutes in some states have, however, limited the liability to commercial uses of the name or likeness.\n\nIt's important to remember the Restatement isn't binding: it simply attempts to \"restate\" what courts (which are binding) have had to say on the topic. If you paid a lot of money for the photo, it might pay to see if it came with a licensing agreement.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An entrepreneur attends a conference where they take a photo with a famous speaker, Dr. Pheel.

Which of the following legal principles is MOST relevant in determining the potential liability of the entrepreneur?\n\nA) Fair use doctrine in copyright law\nB) Right of publicity and appropriation of likeness\nC) First Amendment protection of free speech\nD) Implied consent through public appearance\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most relevant legal principle in this scenario is the right of publicity and appropriation of likeness. This concept is derived from the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652C, which states that \"One who appropriates to his own use or benefit the name or likeness of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy.\"\n\nThe scenario directly relates to using celebrity images for potential commercial benefit without explicit permission, which is a classic example of appropriation of likeness. While the entrepreneur might argue that the use isn't strictly commercial advertising, the placement on a business website implies a commercial context.\n\nOption A (Fair use) is less relevant because this isn't primarily a copyright issue, but rather a privacy and publicity rights issue. Option C (First Amendment) could be a potential defense, but it's not the most directly applicable principle given the commercial context. Option D (Implied consent) is incorrect because merely appearing in public or agreeing to a photo doesn't imply consent for all future uses, especially in a business context.\n\nThe explanation in the documentation specifically warns about using such photos on a client-facing business website, even if not directly for advertising. It also mentions that non-commercial uses can still be scrutinized under some interpretations of the law.

But, in these cases, the law enforcement agency is effectively an \"independent contractor\" in relationship to the judge with considerable discretion regarding precisely how and when a writ is carried out. Somebody in the law enforcement agency to which a writ is directed is required to take action, but no individual law enforcement officer is personally compelled to comply with this order.\n\nThe quote in question is not a statement about the legal authority of a judge, however. It is a statement of \"realpolitik\". The judge can't physically force or threaten law enforcement to do what they are told to do by a judge. The cops have the guns, not the judges.\n\nInstead, the judge relies upon law enforcement obeying the judge's orders because that is what law enforcement officers do. It's right in the job title. But, if law enforcement chose to ignore judges, in general, there is very little that judges could do about that (and in some countries, law enforcement does routinely ignore judicial directions).\n\nSome forms of executive branch authority to defy judicial orders is even legally codified, most starkly in the case of the pardon power.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A judge issues a verbal order during a trial for a police officer to immediately handcuff a defendant who has become disruptive.

The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced reality described in the documentation.

Justice Anthony Scalia, one of the biggest proponents of originalism, [stated](http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/02/13/scalia-on-death-penalty-torture-piers-intv.cnn) that the death penalty wasn't included under it because it was legal at the time the text was written. Under originalism modern society needs to amend the Constitution if it wants to include the death penalty or anything else under \"cruel and unusual\".\n\nDo proponents of originalism suggest the new amendment use the phrase \"cruel and unusual\" but with the understanding that those words now mean something different? Or that it specifically call out the death penalty and everything else?\n\nI wonder because the former would be strange and possibly confusing, and the latter greatly restricts amendments by not allowing them to paint with a broad stroke as the original text did.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The actual method of amending the Constition is spelled out in Article V \u2013 originalism would reject the position that there are other ways to amend it. We can see the result in the [ratified amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution). Originalism is a theory of interpretation, not a theory of drafting, and it hold that the words of the law, be it the Constitution or a particular statute, are to be understood as would be understood by people originally. (There are numerous versions of originalism, so one can't be more precise than than until you decide whether you mean original understanding or original intent, the latter now being a minority viewpoint). It does not hold that new laws should be drafted in the language as it existed in the 18th century, as indeed they are not. Thus the [26th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text) is written in contemporary style befitting the fact that it was drafted recently, and the [27th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text) is written in older style befitting the fact that it was drafted in 1789\\.\n\nAs for \"changing values\", each ratified amendment represents some change of values, whereby originally a right was not recognized (or was), and by the amendment, that value changes. The 18th Amendment represents on change in values, and the 21st reflects a change in *that* value, though not back to the status quo.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided documentation about originalism and constitutional interpretation:\n\nQuestion: A state legislature is considering passing a law that would ban a new form of capital punishment, citing it as \"cruel and unusual.\" An originalist judge is tasked with ruling on the constitutionality of this law. Which of the following approaches is most consistent with originalist principles of constitutional interpretation?\n\nA) Uphold the law if the new method is demonstrably more painful than methods used in the 18th century\nB) Strike down the law because the Eighth Amendment was not intended to evolve with changing societal values\nC) Defer to the legislature's judgment, as the phrase \"cruel and unusual\" was meant to be interpreted flexibly\nD) Evaluate the law based on whether the specific method was considered cruel and unusual in 1791\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests the application of originalist principles to a contemporary legal scenario. The correct answer, D, aligns with the originalist approach as described in the documentation. Originalism, as exemplified by Justice Scalia's stance, interprets constitutional provisions based on their meaning at the time of ratification. In this case, the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on \"cruel and unusual punishment\" would be understood in the context of 1791 when it was ratified.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it introduces a comparative element not consistent with strict originalism. Option B, while partially correct in rejecting evolving interpretations, is too broad and ignores that originalism does allow for new applications of original principles. Option C is incorrect as it suggests a flexible interpretation, which is contrary to originalist philosophy.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts, including the definition of originalism, its application to constitutional interpretation, and the specific example of the Eighth Amendment. It also presents a real-world scenario, testing critical thinking rather than mere memorization of facts about originalism."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13457/who-should-own-the-copyright-to-the-game-ive-created-me-or-my-llc", "docs_id": 13457, "title": "Who should own the copyright to the game I&#39;ve created, me or my LLC?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Who should own the copyright to the game I've created, me or my LLC?** \n\nThis is a single\\-member LLC which I'll be forming specifically to brand and sell the games I create. \n\nShould I officially transfer my copyright to the LLC, or should I license my LLC to make use of it instead? **Briefly, why?**\n\n---\n\n*Bonus Question:*  \n\n*Is a signed plain\\-English document which I draft myself \"official enough\" to act as a license for my LLC to utilize my individual copyright?*\n\n---\n\n*Bonus Question*:  \n\n*I possess the full rights to the game I've created, and the copyright is currently unregistered.

First, what is better for you? You usually start an LLC to protect yourself (the person) from liability in case things go wrong. Worst case, you lose all the assets of the LLC. So if the LLC owns the copyright, that is an asset, which can be lost if the LLC goes bankrupt. So I'd say it's better for your protection if you own the copyright personally. \n\nIf you created the software in your own time, before the LLC was started, then you own the copyright. You should create a proper contract saying that the LLC has the non\\-exclusive right to market the software and keep profits from the sale of the software, and that this agreement can be cancelled by you at any time. Signed by you, as a private citizen, and by the director of the LLC, which happens to be you as well, on behalf of the LLC. \n\nThat will give you maximum personal protection. On the other hand, investors won't be willing to invest in your LLC, because it basically owns nothing of any value. So if you want investments, then you may be less able to protect your assets, because the investors want to protect their assets as well.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about copyright ownership for a game created by an individual who is forming an LLC, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An indie game developer has created a game and is forming a single-member LLC to brand and sell it.

Two U.S. states, East Lumbago and West Lumbago, which share a common border. It\u2019s a First Amendment issue, specifically: *\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d* We\u2019ll presume that it is settled law that state and local governments are held to these standards.\n\nIn East Lumbago, any organizer who wants to stage a group demonstration must apply for an assembly permit. The organizer must show a certificate that they have taken an East Lumbago\\-approved course in Safe Public Assembly and pass a background check that confirms that they have never been convicted of riot or other serious crimes related to demonstrations. All common\\-sense restrictions to protect the public. Any person who organizes a demonstration without a valid assembly permit is subject to arrest and imprisonment.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: under state law, East Lumbago assembly permits are only issued to residents of East Lumbago. If you live in West Lumbago or any other state, you can\u2019t get an East Lumbago assembly permit, so if you go ahead and organize a demonstration, you\u2019ll be arrested and prosecuted.\n\nThere have been grumbles about East Lumbago\u2019s assembly permits, but the state makes a convincing argument that in the interest of public safety, the government must know about a demonstration in advance and take steps to prepare for it, and known, convicted troublemakers must lose the right to organize demonstrations for life. And the residency requirement? East Lumbago\u2019s legislature, in the preamble to their public assembly law, spoke of the need to end the scourge on society of outside agitators and rabble rousers coming to their fair state and causing trouble, and for this reason, only East Lumbago residents are eligible to organize a demonstration.\n\nWest Lumbago activists and organizers feel that due solely to their residence in a state other than East Lumbago, they suffer unequal protection of their First Amendment right of assembly / petition by being denied assembly permits in East Lumbago. They ask their Attorney General to take the case directly to the Supreme Court on their behalf, since the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in all disputes between the states.\n\nDoes West Lumbago have standing? Is the abridgement of the civil rights of its residents when they travel to East Lumbago a sufficient cause of action for the Supreme Court to take up the case directly rather than going through the usual district court / circuit court / Supreme Court routine?\n\nI'm aware that a state may act as *parens patriae* for its citizens by suing another state on environmental grounds or on economic grounds when the state has a demonstrable interest distinguishable from the interests of individual citizens for whom it is suing.

So obviously if we form as an LLC, then we cannot use the name \"XXXX Landscaping Cooperative, LLC\". But I was wondering about the legality of calling ourselves \"XXXX Landscaping **Co\\-op**, LLC\", since the word \"co\\-op\" is not specified in the list of prohibited words or abbreviations?\n\nObviously, this would be a sort of \"loophole\" since the law is designed to force all cooperatives into the structure dictated by the state in RCW 23\\.86, and forbid other businesses from calling themselves cooperatives. But I was wondering if legally, since the word \"co\\-op\" is not explicitly prohibited, are we entitled to use that name?\n\nIf we do have a legal basis for it, how would we approach this matter with the WA Secretary of State's office if they are resistant to the idea?\n\nThanks for your advice!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The law on the web page is not current: as of the beginning of the year, [RCW 23\\.86\\.030(1\\) reads](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5387.SL.pdf) (you'll find this under Sec. 9103\\) \"The name of any association subject to this chapter must comply with part I, Article 3 of this act\" and is otherwise unchanged.

Note that LLCs, LPs, LLPs, business corporations, nonprofit corporations and cooperative associations all have name requirements of the type \"must contain\" and \"may not contain\" (a cooperative association, oddly, has no \"must contain\" requirements).

They propose naming their business \"Green Thumb Co-op, LLC\". What legal challenge are they most likely to face, and what is the most appropriate course of action?\n\nA) The name violates LLC naming conventions; they should use \"Cooperative\" instead of \"Co-op\" to comply with RCW 23.95.305.\nB) The name implies a purpose not permitted by LLC structure; they should form as a cooperative association under RCW 23.86.\nC) The name is legally permissible; they should proceed with registration and be prepared to defend their choice if challenged.\nD) The name violates cooperative association rules; they should remove \"Co-op\" and use a standard LLC name format.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of Washington state law regarding business structures and naming conventions. The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. While the word \"co-op\" is not explicitly prohibited in RCW 23.95.305, the updated law (RCW 23.86.030(1)) refers to Article 3, which gives the Secretary of State discretion in name approval.\n\n2. Crucially, the new language in Article 3, Section 1301(4) states that \"An entity name may not contain language stating or implying that the entity is organized for a purpose other than those permitted by the entity's public organic record.\" This provision is designed to align names more closely with legal status.\n\n3. Using \"Co-op\" in the name of an LLC implies that the business is organized as a cooperative, which is not consistent with the LLC structure. This violates the spirit and likely the letter of the new law.\n\n4. The most appropriate course of action is to form as a cooperative association under RCW 23.86 if they want to use \"co-op\" in their name, as this aligns the business structure with the implied purpose.\n\n5. Options A and D are incorrect because they misinterpret the specific prohibitions and requirements for LLC names.

Is the main idea with a indemnification clause that it specifies who is responsible if it is found something illegal was done? If there is a breach in the contract, then you go to court, and if something illegal is done, it doesn't matter what the contract says, so I don't really get the use of an indemnification clause.\n\nHow does \"holding someone liable\" relate to indemnification, are they synonyms?\n\nI am building a website for someone and am thinking if I should include this in a contract. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here is an example:\n\n> The Author agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the Journal and The\n>  University against any legal claim or action or expense of any nature\n>  arising from any claim of infringement of copyrights or proprietary\n>  rights resulting from publication of the manuscript or claims of\n>  libel, obscenity, unlawfulness or invasion of privacy arising out of\n>  anything contained in the manuscript as furnished by the Author.\n\nSuppose Author infringes the copyright of Jones, by copying large parts of it into Author's work. Author is now in legal trouble because he illegally copied stuff into his manuscript, but Journal is *also* in big (bigger) legal trouble, because it made many copies of Jones' word and sold them. Jones will now sue everybody, mostly the Journal (since Journal has money, and Author doesn't).\n\nThanks to the indemnity clause, when Journal gets sued, all of the costs (of litigation and judgment) have to be born by Author. The primary purpose is to protect Journal from suits by third parties. Nothing can keep you from getting sued, but such a clause (theoretically) means that the person whom your contracting with has to cover the cost of his wrong\\-doing (assuming that he is not a turnip).\n\nThe term \"hold harmless\" is there to guarantee that Author can't decide to sue Journal for publishing a libelous or infringing article.

The correct answer, A, best illustrates the primary purpose of an indemnification clause as described in the documentation. \n\nThe example given in the documentation shows that indemnification clauses are primarily designed to protect one party (in this case, the developer) from legal claims arising from the actions of the other party (the client). In scenario A, the client's action of publishing defamatory content could lead to legal trouble for both parties. An indemnification clause would require the client to cover the developer's legal costs and potential damages in such a situation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it describes a scenario where the developer is at fault, which is not the primary purpose of an indemnification clause from the developer's perspective. Option C relates to a direct breach of contract between the two parties, which is not typically covered by indemnification clauses.

The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. The developer is entitled to all missed wages, which amounts to $10,000 (10 paychecks of $1000 each).\n\n2. Regarding penalties, the key point from the documentation is: \"The higher penalty for subsequent violations will apply after notice to the employer of a previous violation has been established, regardless of whether penalties were actually assessed.\"\n\n3. In this scenario, the developer notified the employer only after all 10 paychecks were missed. Therefore, there were no \"subsequent violations\" after notification, as all violations occurred before the employer was made aware of the issue.\n\n4. Each missed paycheck is considered a separate violation, but without the higher penalty for subsequent violations. Thus, each missed paycheck incurs the base penalty of $100.\n\n5.

(See Supreme Court Rule (SCR) 173/Model Rule (MR) 3\\.4\\.)

Unless you have a contract with your employer or a collective bargain agreement negotiated with your union that limits your responsibilities, the employer can assign you whatever duties the employer wishes.\n\n> I doubt this even abides my financial compliance/GAAP accounting laws,\n> etc.\n\nIf the company is not publicly held and is not under a contractual obligation to do so, GAAP accounting is not required. What you are doing isn't inherently inconsistent with either GAAP accounting or with HIPAA (for health care information) either. GAAP accounting (which is compelled by securities laws), HIPAA and similar laws governing record keeping and databases don't govern the mechanism by which data is put into or retrieved from databases or records (other than required security measures for the data in the case of HIPAA and some banking laws) or the precise format of databases/records.\n\nThe employer has made an implicit decision to do work in a stupid and inefficient way and to pay you to do it, rather than to do it in a cheaper and more conventional way, but that is the employer's prerogative. The employer would be perfectly within the law and its rights to have you use an abacus and cuneiform ledgers in mud with a stylus if it wished, so long as the ledgers were kept in a secure environment.\n\nThe tax laws merely require that a company keep records adequate to comply. It is poor business practice but probably not illegal. Workplace.SE would probably have suggestions about how to get an employer to be less stupid.\n\nIt may even put the company at risk of liability for negligent misrepresentation to a third party causing a customer harm occurs if an error is made and then reported to a collection agency and the error prone method is found to be negligent by a judge or jury. But, it would not be illegal and would not give rise to liability, unless an error that negligently causes harm to a customer actually happens.\n\nAlso, first party debt collections (as opposed to debt collections through a third party debt collector) are not subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. So a mistake in a bill sent to its own client would not be actionable.\n\n> (b)Just curious what my legal rights are if they ever try to fire\n> people over this?\n\nIf you are an employee at will (and in the U.S. you almost surely are), and you aren't in Montana (which has a requirement to fire only for good cause), the only right you have in connection with a firing for bad cause is that it entitles you to unemployment benefits which you are not entitled to receive if you quit or are laid off, and there are alternative severance pay arrangements when that is allowed by state law.\n\nAlso, inability to perform assigned job duties to the standard set by the employer is good cause.

Which of the following scenarios poses the greatest legal risk for the company?\n\nA) The IT professional makes occasional errors in data entry, leading to minor discrepancies in customer accounts.\nB) The company fails to implement a more automated financial transaction system, resulting in increased labor costs.\nC) An error in transaction logging leads to overcharging a customer, who then reports the company to a credit bureau.\nD) The IT professional refuses to perform the assigned bookkeeping tasks, citing lack of qualifications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal and business concepts presented in the documentation. The correct answer is C because it presents the greatest legal risk to the company. While the company's practices are generally not illegal, the documentation states that the company could be at risk of liability for negligent misrepresentation if an error causes harm to a customer. In this scenario, overcharging a customer and having that erroneous information reported to a credit bureau could potentially harm the customer's credit rating, leading to financial damages.\n\nOption A is incorrect because minor discrepancies, while not ideal, are not explicitly stated to pose a significant legal risk. Option B, while a poor business practice, is not illegal and doesn't pose a direct legal risk.

The most recent version came out in [2018](https://www.cencenelec.eu/news/brief_news/Pages/TN-2018-075.aspx), the one before that in 2006 and the one before that 1997\\. It's been around for a while.\n\n### Observation\n\nWhile comparing the 2018 version to the 2006 version, I noticed ISO 12100 (specifically parts 1 and 2, 12100\\-1:3004 and 12100\\-2:2003\\) is removed from the normative references (Annex ZA, but also chapter 2 of the standard). Considering ISO 12100 is or used to be one of the most important standards on risk assessment and safety integrity requirements (required for determining how 'safe' a complex system is), I'm confused by the MD simply dropping the reference from its normative list. It has now moved to the Bibliography, which doesn't hold the same value.\n\n### Question\n\nLast I checked, everything 'normative' in these standards is basically law. Did the value of ISO 12100 change within the scope of the MD so far that compliance is no longer required? Relevant parts are now part of the 60204, but not even close to everything.\n\nIt's entirely possible I've misunderstood something here, but are we no longer required to comply with ISO 12100 like we used to?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have not the slightest clue about this area of the law, so don't take this as an actual answer, rather as some sort of suggestion that doesn't fit into a comment:\n\nAs far as I can see, ISO 12100\\-1:2003 and ISO 12100\\-2:2003 (which you ask about) were revised and summarised in the new ISO 12100:2010 (Safety of machinery \u2014 General principles for design \u2014 Risk assessment and risk reduction). The ISO 12100:2010 standard was subsequently published in the Official Journal ([2011/C 110/01](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52011XC0408(03))), where it is stated that it will supersede EN ISO 12100\\-1:2003 and EN ISO 12100\\-2:2003, giving 30 November 2013 as the \"Date of cessation of presumption of conformity of superseded standard\". So perhaps we should really talk about EN ISO 12100:2010 rather than EN ISO 12100\\-1:2003 and EN ISO 12100\\-2:2003?\n\nNow, I'm writing this because the Commission's Implementing Decision 2019/436 of 18 March 2019 on the harmonised standards for machinery drafted in support of Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, [C/2019/1932](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019D0436), which provides for some necessary \"clean up\" in the wake of new CENELEC standards (\"As the result of the work by CEN and Cenelec \\[...] several harmonised standards published in the Official Journal of the European Union have been replaced, revised or amended \\[...] It is therefore necessary to withdraw the references of those standards from the Official Journal of the European Union.\"), notes in recital 14 that\n\n> \"Harmonised standards EN 786:1996\\+A2:2009; EN 61496\\-1:2013; EN ISO\n>  11200:2014 and **EN ISO 12100:2010 should be withdrawn** as they **no longer\n>  satisfy the requirements which they aim to cover and which are set out\n>  in Directive 2006/42/EC**.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nPerhaps that is also the reason for your observation?", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A machine manufacturer is updating their compliance documentation for a new product line to be sold in the European market.

What is the most appropriate action for the manufacturer to take regarding risk assessment and safety integrity requirements?\n\nA) Disregard ISO 12100 entirely, as it's no longer legally binding under the Machine Directive\nB) Apply ISO 12100 principles voluntarily, but focus primarily on EN 60204 compliance\nC) Consult the latest Commission Implementing Decision for current harmonized standards\nD) Continue full compliance with ISO 12100-1:2003 and 12100-2:2003 as before\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the evolving regulatory landscape for machine safety in the EU. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation mentions that ISO 12100 was removed from the normative references in EN 60204:2018, which might suggest it's no longer required.

Given these changes, the most appropriate action is to consult the latest Commission Implementing Decision for the current list of harmonized standards that provide presumption of conformity with the Machine Directive.\n\n4. This approach ensures the manufacturer is working with the most up-to-date regulatory requirements, rather than relying on outdated standards or making assumptions based on changes in a single standard (EN 60204).\n\nOption A is incorrect because disregarding ISO 12100 entirely based solely on its removal from EN 60204 would be hasty and potentially non-compliant. Option B doesn't fully address the regulatory changes. Option D is incorrect because it ignores the updates to ISO 12100 and its subsequent withdrawal as a harmonized standard.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to navigate complex regulatory changes, integrate information from multiple sources, and make appropriate decisions in a real-world scenario of updating product compliance."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59080/was-it-legal-in-2004-to-sell-a-minor-an-airline-ticket-from-the-us-to-a-foreign", "docs_id": 59080, "title": "Was it legal in 2004 to sell a minor an airline ticket from the US to a foreign country without proof of parental consent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Alone, when I was 17 (born 1987\\), I bought a \\~$537 round\\-trip web/internet ticket (for a 2\\-week trip to Amsterdam by way of Germany) and returned at age 18\\.

Such regulations are usually found in copyright law and laws regulating business conduct, and differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as do case law.\n\nMy general impression is that it is usually not considered fair *if* the use you make of other's work by such design practices is commercial in nature, you create something intended to directly compete with the site(s) you scrape, embed or modify, *and* your product or service does not communicate something new and different from the original or expands its utility.\n\nSo, as a rule, I refuse to create a competing commercial service if that is what the client requests, and I always make sure my work is transformative in nature.\n\nAs always: If you want specific advice, hire a lawyer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is creating a browser extension that enhances multiple third-party websites by adding custom buttons and modifying their interfaces.

While there are no specific laws prohibiting the enhancement of third-party services, the answer states that \"it depends\" and outlines key considerations. The most critical factors are whether the use is commercial, if it directly competes with the original services, and if it adds transformative value or expands utility.\n\nOption A is incorrect because modifying interfaces or adding features is not inherently illegal. Option B oversimplifies the issue by suggesting that merely informing users and maintaining logos is sufficient to ensure legality.

And, does the IRS have a webpage that has instructions or regulations regarding these cash transactions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general, a person who pays for goods and services with cash is not obligated to report the payments to the IRS (thus simplifying your trip to the hardware store, purchases from a vending machine, etc.). There are laws requiring reporting of *receipt* of cash [31 USC 5313](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5313) which applies to banks, which are regulated, but Ordinary Joe is not subject to this law.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states: \"Report on Form 1099-MISC only when payments are made in the course of your trade or business. Personal payments are not reportable.\" Rent for personal housing is a personal expense, not a business expense for the tenant.\n\n2. While option B mentions a partial truth about reporting cash receipts over $10,000, this applies to the recipient (homeowner) in the course of business, not the payer (tenant). It's also not the most accurate answer for this scenario.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because Form 1099-MISC reporting is for business expenses, not personal ones, and is typically filed by the payer for business-related payments, not personal rent.\n\n4. Option D is a distractor that confuses the cash transaction reporting laws applicable to financial institutions with personal transactions.\n\nThis question tests the ability to differentiate between personal and business expenses, understand the context-specific nature of IRS reporting requirements, and apply these concepts to a real-world scenario.

And, the same string of words in an insult could be slanderous when directed at one person in one setting, and not when directed at another person in another setting. The intended meaning, as the audience when it is uttered would understand it, is what matters.\n\nIn close calls, we let the trier of fact decide if the statement was or implied a literal statement of a presently existing fact, or if it was not meant in that sense, following a trial if necessary.\n\n> For instance, if Ronald calls Donald a \"retarded bastard son of a\n> senile crackwhore\", he's (going by the literal meaning of the\n> individual members of this string of insults) claiming that Donald is\n> intellectually\\-disabled and was born out of wedlock to a\n> crack\\-cocaine\\-addicted prostitute suffering from dementia, all of\n> which are things that could potentially be true, even if taken\n> literally.\n\nIf Donald is a U.S. Senator or a school teacher, this probably isn't going to be taken literally by a reasonable person hearing it.

This is crucial because:\n\n1. In the event of a disagreeable end to the relationship, the contract would provide clear documentation of the agreed-upon financial arrangements, preventing disputes over contributions to the mortgage or claims of entitlement to the property.\n\n2. If a third-party lawsuit is filed against either partner, the contract would serve as evidence that the non-owner has no ownership stake in the property, potentially shielding them from claims related to the property.\n\n3.

By making the opt-out process complex and difficult, the corporation may be violating this requirement.\n\n2.

In states with appointed judges, judges will get promoted based on their number of finished cases in a year or their efficiency.\n\nFor prosecutors, they favor plea agreements because a plea agreement removes any chance the defendant will have his/her conviction overturned. When one agrees to a plea one waives any and all right to appeal one's conviction; otherwise, all defendants are guaranteed at least one appeal, which are once again expensive. Additionally, defendants can petition for habeas corpus.

Landlord pays utilities. Non\\-signatory pays tenant for their stay in the apartment.\n2. Landlord pays utilities. Non\\-signatory lives for free in the apartment.\n3. Landlord pays utilities. Non\\-signatory doesn't pay money to live in the apartment, but is obliged (through oral agreement or contract) to pay in other ways, e.g. cleaning the apartment.\n4. Landlord doesn't pay utilities. Non\\-signatory pays tenant for their stay in the apartment.\n5. Landlord doesn't pay utilities. Non\\-signatory lives for free in the apartment.\n6. Landlord doesn't pay utilities. Non\\-signatory doesn't pay money to live in the apartment, but is obliged (through oral agreement or contract) to pay in other ways, e.g. cleaning the apartment.\n\nIn all scenarios, the landlord has been unaware of the non\\-signatory's stay. Also, I'd like to consider another conditional to the \"landlord doesn't pay utilities\", dividing all those scenarios into two, some of which the landlord only pays for water bills. This is because it seems to me, from experience, that water bills are special (perhaps very cheap or subject to different laws), as I've never seen an apartment listed where the water bills aren't paid for.\n\n---\n\n**Reflections on the scenarios' legality:**\n\nI assume 1\\. is obviously illegal. The landlord receives an increase in their expenses without their consent, and the tenant is making money off of the landlord's property, again, without the landlord's consent. In scenario 4\\., the latter part also applies. I think maybe both 1\\. and 4\\. would be considered theft?\n\nNumber 2\\. is problematic, as the landlord still receives an increase in their expenses. However, if the tenant decides to simply shower more and to live more luxuriously all of a sudden, the landlord's expenses would increase due to the tenant's decisions. Surely, the tenants decisions aren't illegal in this scenario, and the landlord's only option is to crank up the lease. So, why would then the scenario be different, if the decision causing the landlord's increased expenses, is the decision to allow a non\\-signatory to live in the apartment? Just like how the tenant choosing to live more luxuriously is their right, a right uninfringed by the fact that it leads to increased expenses for the landlord, surely allowing someone else to stay in the apartment for free is also within the tenant's rights? Maybe the difference is that one expense increase is caused by the intensity of use of the product of the product's legal leaser, whereas the other is caused by the addition of an illegal leaser?\n\nNumber 5\\. is still problematic for those same reasons. For example, if the landlord pays the water bills, their expenses will increase a little. Also, the wear and tear of the apartment will be worse, thus increasing the expenses. Not sure if this is impacted by the existence of a deposit. Then again, wearing that isn't covered by the deposit will still be worsened by more people living in the apartment.\n\nIf say, number 2 and/or 5 are legal, I could see that 3\\. and/or 6\\. would still be illegal. I guess it depends on what is legally considered payment or not.\n\n---\n\n**What counts as staying at an apartment:**\n\nIs the difference between *staying at an apartment* and *frequently visiting and sleeping at an apartment* of a quantitative and/or qualitative kind? A tenant's romantic partner is likely to do either, and I expect differentiating between those two possibilities would be tricky.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In almost every residential lease that I've ever written or reviewed, this contingency is provided for expressly in a term of the lease with several terms, one on who may reside pursuant to the lease, and another on subletting and assignments. Categories \\#1 and \\#4 are subleases. The other categories are species of guest arrangements.\n\nThose provisions, when they are present, typically prohibit occupancy by anyone other than the adults who are signed tenants and their children, and typically prohibit subleasing without landlord permission which shall not be unreasonably withheld (with the original tenant as a guarantor of the subtenant's obligation).\n\nIn most jurisdictions, the default rule of law is that you may sublet or have a guest who doesn't violate building code requirements unless the lease provide otherwise, but landlord\\-tenant law isn't entirely uniform from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Many U.S. states, U.S. cities, and foreign countries have detailed statutory or ordinance rules on the subject.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about subletting and guest arrangements in residential leases, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A landlord discovers that their tenant, who signed a lease prohibiting subletting without permission, has allowed a friend to stay in the apartment for the past three months.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) This arrangement is legal as long as the friend's payment doesn't exceed the cost of utilities and groceries.\nB) The tenant is in breach of the lease, but the landlord cannot evict if the friend leaves immediately.\nC) The arrangement constitutes an illegal sublease, regardless of how the friend's payment is characterized.\nD) The legality depends on whether the friend's stay qualifies as \"frequently visiting\" rather than \"residing.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario most closely aligns with situation #1 from the documentation, where a non-signatory pays the tenant for their stay in an apartment where the landlord pays utilities. The question tests the application of multiple concepts:\n\n1. The lease explicitly prohibits subletting without permission.\n2. The friend's extended stay (three months) likely qualifies as residing rather than visiting.\n3. The payment, even if characterized as for utilities and groceries, effectively constitutes rent.\n4. The landlord pays for utilities, so the tenant is profiting from the arrangement.\n\nThe correct answer is C because this arrangement constitutes an illegal sublease for several reasons:\n\n1. It violates the express terms of the lease prohibiting subletting without permission.\n2. The duration of the stay (three months) suggests residency rather than a temporary visit.\n3. The regular monthly payment, regardless of its stated purpose, effectively functions as rent.\n4. The tenant is profiting from the landlord's property and utilities without consent.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the legality doesn't depend on whether the payment exceeds costs; any payment in this context can constitute a sublease.\nOption B is incorrect because the breach of lease terms typically gives the landlord grounds for potential eviction, regardless of the friend's immediate departure.\nOption D is incorrect because the extended duration and regular payment suggest this is beyond \"frequently visiting\" and has become a residency arrangement.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple factors, application of lease concepts to a real-world scenario, and critical thinking about the nature of subleasing versus guest arrangements."}, "78": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30370/is-it-legal-for-stores-to-discrimate-against-customers-based-on-uniform", "docs_id": 30370, "title": "Is it legal for stores to discrimate against customers based on uniform?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am a legal\\-aged student in my country (Australia, so I am 18,) after school I enter a liquor store with the intention to purchase.

The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced legal situation:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, stores are generally allowed to refuse service based on dress code, even without posted signage. This is part of their right to refuse service, similar to how some UK stores have policies refusing to sell age-restricted items to people under 25 without ID.\n\n2.

The general principle stated in the documentation is that \"ignorance of a law is an excuse only when the law specifically says it is.\"\n\n2. The Lambert v.

(You need to look at the university rules to see what is an actual rule, as opposed to a \"goal\" for an academic unit). Since there is no such rule, the chairman has limited authority to penalize the instructor (he might for example decide to not assign that class to Prof. X in the future).

This seems to fit the public definition quite nicely. It's also arguable whether the chatroom members have reasonable expectation of privacy, a la the Wiretap Act.\n\nIf, say, someone were to record conversations on such a server and later disclose them, would this be considered recording in a public space? Does the size of the server matter? Has this happened before, and if so, is there any precedent I might be missing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two kinds of jurisdictions in this matter, one where some participant must consent to the recording, and thise (a minority) where all must consent. California is an all\\-party consent state, so we can take that as the highest hurdle that you have to clear. [Cal. Penal \u00a7632](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&part=1.&title=15.&chapter=1.5.) say (emphasis added)\n\n> A person who, intentionally and without the *consent of all parties*\n>  to a confidential communication, uses an electronic amplifying or\n>  recording device to eavesdrop upon or record the *confidential\n>  communication*, whether the communication is carried on among the\n>  parties in the presence of one another or by means of a telegraph,\n>  telephone, or other device, except a radio, shall be punished by a\n>  fine not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500\\) per\n>  violation, or imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or\n>  in the state prison, or by both that fine and imprisonment.\n\nThe definition of confident communication is important:\n\n> For the purposes of this section, \u201cconfidential communication\u201d means\n>  any communication carried on in circumstances as may reasonably\n>  indicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined\n>  to the parties thereto, but excludes a communication made in a public\n>  gathering or in any legislative, judicial, executive, or\n>  administrative proceeding open to the public, or in any other\n>  circumstance in which the parties to the communication may reasonably\n>  expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded.\n\nThere have been two standards regarding the reasonable expectation of privacy, one that is about recording, and one about disclosure (which would allow recordings if not disclosed). The California Supreme Court found in favor of the \"no recording\" interpretation\n\n> Under the construction adopted here, the Privacy Act is a coherent\n>  statutory scheme. It protects against intentional, nonconsensual\n>  recording of telephone conversations regardless of the content of the\n>  conversation or the type of telephone involved. In contrast, the\n>  O'Laskey standard urged by Honorine and adopted by the Court of Appeal\n>  would provide significantly less protection from surreptitious\n>  eavesdropping or recording when both telephones are landline\n>  telephones, a distinction that lacks any justification in terms of the\n>  purpose of the Privacy Act.\n\nInternet \"chat\" communication poses some interesting problems regarding objectively reasonable expectations, and we don't want to get bogged down in OT technical questions. The public / private distinction could be relevant because communications made in a public gathering are statutorily excluded. The law does not define \"public\" or \"gathering\", but it is unlikely that the court would hold that a gathering can only exist when the bodies involved are in a single location. There does not seem to be any precedent that tells us whether an openly accessible online chat room is a \"public gathering\", so the courts may need to look into legislative intent to see whether a chatroom is or is not one (it's hard to see how they would *not* find a chatroom to be just like a physical gathering).\n\nEven without such a determination, the question is whether a person has an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. I don't see how one can have such an expectation in an open\\-to\\-all chatroom. Anyone can drop by; you probably are announced when you enter and leave; you know, or should know, that the internet keeps track of everything. It would be possible to create a chatroom with a privacy expectation, but if we take SE chatrooms as a model, there is zero expectation of privacy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A popular online gaming community hosts a public Discord server with 10,000 members.

A member records these conversations without informing others and later publishes them on a blog. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this action?\n\nA) The recording is legal because Discord is a public platform, but publishing the content violates copyright laws.\nB) The action is illegal under all circumstances due to the expectation of privacy in online communications.\nC) The recording and publishing are likely legal, as users have no reasonable expectation of privacy in a public server.\nD) The legality depends on whether the server is considered a \"public gathering\" under state-specific wiretapping laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the provided documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The legality of recording and disclosing conversations depends on state-specific laws, particularly whether it's a one-party or all-party consent state.\n\n2. In all-party consent states like California, the key factor is whether the communication is considered \"confidential\" under the law.\n\n3. The definition of \"confidential communication\" excludes communications made in a \"public gathering,\" but it's unclear whether a large Discord server qualifies as such.\n\n4. There's no clear legal precedent on whether an online chat room constitutes a \"public gathering,\" so courts may need to interpret legislative intent.\n\n5. Even if not considered a public gathering, the question remains whether users have a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" in a server explicitly stated to be public.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Discord is public, this doesn't automatically make recording legal, and copyright isn't the primary issue here.\n\nOption B is too absolute, as the documentation suggests that expectations of privacy in online communications can vary.\n\nOption C is plausible but oversimplified, as it doesn't account for the nuances of state laws and the potential interpretation of \"public gathering\" in a digital context.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of legal concepts, consideration of digital spaces in relation to traditional legal definitions, and analysis of how courts might interpret these novel situations."}, "83": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/94253/is-an-employer-permitted-to-use-images-of-employees-for-marketing-without-their", "docs_id": 94253, "title": "Is an employer permitted to use images of employees for marketing without their consent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Paul works in a restaurant, sometimes as a chef and sometimes as a bartender.

In the case in the question, the economic damages are unlikely to exceed the $750 amount unless the employer is a massive chain of restaurants.\n\nThere are arguments that could be made against liability in this case, so it wouldn't be a sure recovery, but it would have a decedent chance of success.\n\nThe goal of the statute in this context is to have the employer separately pay a small fee, perhaps a few hundred bucks, to employees who serve as models for advertisements in addition to being employees doing their ordinary work. Of course, if your occupation is to be a promotional model (my wife's line of work for many years), your consent is inferred from the circumstances.\n\nThe statute states, in the pertinent part:\n\n> (a) Any person who knowingly uses another's name . . . photograph, or\n> likeness, in any manner, . . . for purposes of advertising or selling,\n> or soliciting purchases of, products, merchandise, goods or services,\n> without such person's prior consent, . . . shall be liable for any\n> damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result\n> thereof.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The law explicitly states that unauthorized use of a person's photograph for advertising purposes without consent creates liability.\n\n2. While there is a statutory minimum of $750 in damages, the law allows for greater recovery based on actual damages and profits attributable to the unauthorized use. Given the campaign's significant boost to sales, Paul could potentially claim a share of these profits.\n\n3. The statute provides that the injured party only needs to present proof of gross revenue attributable to the use, with the burden on the violator to prove deductible expenses.\n\n4. Although there's a rebuttable presumption for incidental use of an employee's image, the prominent featuring of Paul in a nationwide campaign likely goes beyond incidental use.\n\n5. The law also allows for attorney's fees and potential punitive damages, further strengthening Paul's position.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law applies regardless of where the photo was taken. Option B is incorrect because it ignores the potential for greater damages based on profits. Option D is incorrect because employee consent is not automatically presumed, especially for use beyond routine business operations.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple aspects of the law, apply them to a complex scenario, and understand the nuances of employee rights in commercial use of their image."}, "84": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21383/whats-the-point-of-a-subpoena-if-you-can-just-invoke-the-fifth-amendment", "docs_id": 21383, "title": "What&#39;s the point of a subpoena if you can just invoke the fifth amendment?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I always thought a subpoena was an order to produce evidence or testimony, but I recently realized that you can just invoke the fifth amendment if you're served a subpoena.\n\nGiven the complicated nature of laws and that any evidence could be potentially incriminate you even if you're not originally involved in the case, what's the point of a subpoena? What does it accomplish?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A subpoena is nothing more than court process compelling someone to testify as a witness or to produce documents in their possession, custody and control, or both, usually in connection with a court case.\n\nMost people who are subject to a subpoena are not being asked to offer testimony that could implicate them in a crime. They simply have evidence relevant to a case.\n\nFor example, bank records are routinely subpoenaed to generate evidence that can be used in a civil or criminal case against someone, even though no one accuses the bank of doing anything improper.\n\nMany witnesses are also just not bothered to testify or actively don't want to testify, even though the evidence would not personally reflect poorly on them in any way, if they are not compelled to do so. \n\nFor example, they may simply be very busy at profitable activities, or may fear retaliation from people involved in the case.\n\nAlso, subpoenas are not infrequently issued where the witness is personally happy to testify but needs court process to get permission to be away from work or other obligations.\n\nA subpoena can also overcome legal obligations to not voluntarily provide information even when it is not legally privileged. For example, a lawyers ethical obligation not to voluntarily share information about a client (even information that isn't attorney\\-client privileged like the existence of an attorney\\-client relationship or the amount of money that the attorney holds in a trust account for the client's benefit) is broader than the attorney\\-client privilege and a lawyer can be compelled to provide such information by subpoena.\n\nTo invoke the 5th Amendment in a case where you are not a defendant, you must have some good faith belief that your testimony would expose you to criminal liability, something that the vast majority of witnesses under a subpoena do not.\n\nYou cannot invoke the 5th Amendment, for example, to protect yourself from having to testify regarding something that may be highly embarrassing and may even constitute a violation of the law, but is not a crime.\n\nFor example, you can't invoke the 5th Amendment to prevent yourself from having to admit under oath in court testimony that you cheated on your boyfriend with someone else, or that you forgot to lock up the office the night before it was burglarized, or that you lied about having won a military decoration that you publicly claimed to have won but really didn't, or that you are in default on your mortgage, or that you are out of legal immigration status.\n\nThe 5th Amendment can also not be invoked to prevent you have having to testify about violations of professional ethics that are not crimes. For example, an attorney could be compelled to testify that she failed to keep confidential information private by telling her bartender client secrets.\n\nA subpoena is basically useless against a defendant in a criminal case, who has the right not to be compelled to testify in his or her own case. \n\nBut, in a civil case, you can subpoena someone to testify against themselves and they then have the choice of invoking the 5th Amendment and having an adverse inference entered against them (usually resulting in them losing the case if they are a party to it), or not invoking the 5th Amendment and testifying even though truthful testimony on the subject may be incriminating and may be used against you in a criminal prosecution.\n\nSomeone can also be compelled to testify regarding matters that could be self\\-incriminating in a civil or criminal case if someone with authority to do so (generally the relevant prosecuting attorney) grants the person compelled to testimony immunity from prosecution (usually all that must be granted is immunity from prosecution based upon the testimony offered, called \"use immunity\", which is still less than someone admitting to criminal conduct might need to feel comfortable if testifying voluntarily).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about subpoenas and the Fifth Amendment, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A civil lawsuit is filed against a company for alleged environmental violations.

For example, if you took the picture, you own the copyright in the picture. If some other person took the picture and you are just in the picture, that person owns the copyright, and you need their permission to post it on Instagram. Taking a screenshot is copying, and all copying requires the permission of the copyright owner.\n\nThings are very cut\\-and\\-dried when you put things up on a personal web page, but less clear when you use some social media platform, because then you have to navigate their terms of service to see what you have legally done by posting some content.

You simply have to work your way through all of the documentation that seems to be about policies etc. to see what you can and can't do.\n\nInstagram has [this](https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870) terms of use document.

Right below this, they start to address third parties (by putting \"you\" in the position of the third party), and they state that they can take action against you (anyone) who violates the rules or \"if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights\". They do not at any point say \"It's okay to copy stuff from another person's account without their permission\", though they do not directly say that this is forbidden (see their section on [copyright](https://help.instagram.com/126382350847838?helpref=page_content)) \u2013 they come pretty close by saying \"It's possible to infringe someone else's copyright, even if you don't intend to do so.

This includes lying about someone: it's not illegal *per se* to lie about them. What *is* illegal is slander and libel: lying about someone in a way that hurts their reputation. The defamation doctrine in the US is generally a common\\-law doctrine (i.e. the rules and limits are based on court decisions, rather than on laws passed by legislatures), although it may differ state\\-by\\-state. Depending on the state, some defamation may be criminal; there is no federal criminal defamation.\n\nUS defamation law is largely defined through its interaction with the First Amendment. While libel is not constitutionally protected, *punishment* for libel is seriously limited by the need to avoid either punishing protected speech, or chilling potential protected speech (i.e. discouraging people from saying something that would in fact be protected, because they aren't sure whether or not it's protected).\n\nLibel in the US only applies to a false statement of *fact*, or an opinion which implies some false fact. If it can't actually be proven incorrect, it can't be libelous in the US. The question of whether it's a statement of fact doesn't just depend on the literal speech; it includes things like the context, and is a question about what a *reasonable person* would think. If I were to claim that someone was \"literally Hitler,\" for instance, no reasonable person would think I was seriously claiming that the person was the former leader of Nazi Germany.\n\nNow, no reasonable person who is familiar with Twitter would ever assume that the tweet meant Obama literally stood up in front of the UN and said \"Please accept this nothingburger in place of a respectable climate plan.\" So, it only counts as libel if a reasonable person would think it implies some fact. But a reasonable person familiar with Twitter would most likely think Miesel is saying \"The president's pollution plan is a pointless piece of political puffery planned to placate principalities and potentates.\" This is basically a matter of opinion.\n\nEven to the extent that it's *not* a matter of opinion, public figures in the US cannot win a defamation suit unless they show \"actual malice:\" the speaker must *actually know* or *actually strongly suspect* that their statement is false in some material way. It's not enough that a reasonable person would think \"this might not be true;\" the speaker themselves must doubt the truth of it (they must be reckless, not just negligent). Courts are also extremely deferential to defendants in these cases. While it is *technically* possible for a public figure to prove defamation, it is exceptionally difficult. If the person didn't know they were falsely attributing the quote, and honesty thought it was correct, they're in the clear. If the quote isn't supposed to be a statement of fact, but it implies false facts, but the speaker honestly thinks those facts are true, they're in the clear.\n\nPrivate figures don't have to meet the actual malice standard to prove defamation. They still need to show that the statement is a statement of fact or something implying false facts; if it's obviously a summary of something they really said, possibly with added editorial comment, they can't prove defamation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A popular social media influencer posts a fabricated quote attributed to a sitting U.S. Senator, criticizing their recent climate policy.

The author or authors, or the heirs of the author or authors, or a majority of them, have the right to terminate copyright transfers an license grants. This termination must be effective on a date within a five\\-year period starting 35 years after the transfer or grant was made, or 35 years after publication.

Derivative (modified) works created under a canceled license may continue to be used, but the right to create new derivative works is withdrawn.\n\nIt is not clear how an author goes about sending the required notice when a work was distributed widely to the general public under a permissive license.\n\nOpen source licenses have been around long enough that early license grants could be subject to such terminations. But I have found not news reports or court cases about such terminations or attempted terminations and their effects.

The original author of this open-source code, who granted the license 40 years ago, now wants to terminate the license. What is the most accurate assessment of this situation under US copyright law?\n\nA) The license is irrevocable, and the author cannot terminate it due to the \"permanent\" nature specified in the Apache 2.0 license.\nB) The author can immediately terminate the license, forcing the company to remove the code from their product.\nC) The author has a legal right to terminate the license, but must follow specific timing and notification procedures.\nD) The company can continue using the code indefinitely, but cannot create new derivative works after termination.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of both open source license terms and US copyright law. While many open source licenses, including Apache 2.0, claim to be \"irrevocable\" or \"permanent,\" US copyright law (17 USC 203) actually provides authors with termination rights that cannot be waived. \n\nThe correct answer is C because:\n\n1. US law allows authors to terminate copyright transfers and license grants.\n2. This right exists regardless of any contrary agreements in the license itself.\n3. The termination right is subject to specific conditions:\n   - It can only be exercised within a five-year window starting 35 years after the grant.\n   - Notice must be given 2-10 years before the effective termination date.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it relies solely on the license terms without considering overriding copyright law. \n\nOption B is wrong because immediate termination is not allowed; the author must follow the prescribed timing and notification procedures.\n\nOption D is partially correct about continued use of existing works but oversimplifies the situation.

If the employee continues to work at the new location without signing the new contract, what is the most likely legal outcome?\n\nA) The employee is bound by the new contract in its entirety due to implicit acceptance through conduct.\nB) The employee remains bound by the original contract terms, except for the new work location.\nC) The new contract is unenforceable due to lack of consideration, but the employee may be bound to work at the new location.\nD) The employee is not bound by any contract and can negotiate entirely new terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves multiple complex legal concepts. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Consideration is required in Australia for contract variations to be legally binding. The documentation cites a Supreme Court decision that refused to uphold a contract variation due to lack of fresh consideration. In this case, merely changing the work location without additional benefits for the employee likely doesn't constitute sufficient consideration.\n\n2. However, the employee's conduct of working at the new location could be interpreted as acceptance of that specific change. The documentation states, \"If you were to not sign the contract but your conduct was such that it would appear to an objective and informed person that you had agreed to the contract - for example, by turning up to work at the new location - then it may be held by a court that you had accepted by conduct.\"\n\n3. The original contract likely remains in force for other terms, as the documentation notes that \"Supercession of a contract needs to be explicit - otherwise, you are bound by all previous agreements.\"\n\n4.
