As many online resources ([including StackExchange](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77282/under-the-gdpr-in-germany-is-a-privacy-policy-required-when-not-tracking-any-pe)) suggest, it is next to impossible to have a website and not fall under GDPR rules. Furthermore, there seems to be some confusion and back\\-and\\-forth on what is deemed compliant, and what's not.\n\nIf you want to clarify how GDPR rules apply in your case, the usual advice is to \"get a lawyer\". However, this is not practical for many small starting online businesses that have no resources to pay for a full time legal advisor. So I am hoping to gather some practical tips about doing this without employing a lawyer.\n\nFirst, let me lay out some assumptions on the nature of the business:\n\n* It is new and small in every sense of the word: a few dozen customers, $1k\\-2k monthly turnover\n* It is based in UK\n* It is not dealing with extra\\-sensitive data like bank account numbers or identity documents\n\nAnd now some specific questions:\n\n1. What would be the best strategy in terms of \"cost vs reliability\" to ensure GDPR compliance? Would it be practical to follow one of the many GDPR tutorials online to choose a proper hosting, security measures, etc?\n2. If I unintentionally use a non\\-compliant hosting configuration or a 3rd\\-party service like Google Analytics that transfers customers' data to a \"unsafe\" jurisdiction, what consequences is it likely to bring about? Are there any examples of this happening?\n3. How severe should data processing faults be for the business to be facing serious fines and lawsuits (vs. just fixing the fault and issuing an official apology)?\n4. What would be a sensible time to actually employ a GDPR advisor? Is this based on the kind of data that the company handles? On the number of customers? On the turnover?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is entirely possible to reach a reasonable level of compliance in a DIY approach, provided that you familiarize yourself with the relevant legal framework. The UK ICO has produced in\\-depth guidance to help here, which is significantly more digestible than the laws themselves:\n\n[ICO Guide to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/)\n\nFor a first reading, it is probably appropriate to focus on the summaries and checklists at the top of each section.\n\nYou will however notice that GDPR is a lot about *principles*, and requirements like selecting *appropriate* compliance measures yourself. On one hand, this means that you have some flexibility in your compliance approach, but it also means also that you can never be sure whether you're actually compliant. But this is also precisely why professional help can be valuable, since compliance professionals probably have a better overview of best practices, state of the art measures, and also potential pitfalls.\n\nIn some [other](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/83897) [answers](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/83565), I have written basic overviews/checklists to get started with a GDPR compliance effort.\n\nOn to your concrete questions:\n\n1. What is the best strategy to get started with GDPR compliance?\n\nThis is ultimately a business decision that you have to make. You have to consider how much compliance is worth to you, both in terms of time and money. Maybe you can DIY it, maybe you'll want to get professional help, maybe you'll just hope that no one ever sues you or lodges a complaint. There is no objective optimum, and only you know your particular situation.\n2. What are the consequences for unintentional infringement?\n\nNot being aware of the rules is not a valid defense (*ignorantia juris non excusat*).\n3. How are fines calculated?\n\nThe GDPR has two separate enforcement mechanisms: data subjects can sue you for compliance and damages, and the ICO can fine you.\n\nDamages are typically small compared to the cost of a lawsuit.\n\nWhen issuing fines, the ICO must consider a variety of factor per [Article 83](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/83), for example whether the infringement was willful or negligent. The ICO is not required to impose damages, and anecdotally many small problems can be resolved informally before it comes to a full investigation.\n\nIn particular, the [ICO's Regulatory Action Policy 2018](https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2259467/regulatory-action-policy.pdf) explains that \u201cwe will reserve our powers \\[to issue fines] for the most serious cases, representing the most severe breaches of information rights obligations. These will typically involve wilful, deliberate or negligent acts, or repeated breaches of information rights obligations, causing harm or damage to individuals.\u201d The policy also provides a 5\\-step process for arriving at fines: removing financial gain, accounting for scale and severity of the breach, considering aggravating factors, ensuring a deterrent for others, and considering mitigating factors.\n\nThis suggests that a good\\-faith effort to ensure compliance already goes a long way.\n4. When to get professional help?\n\nUnder some circumstances, the GDPR *requires* that you appoint a data protection officer, who doesn't have to be an employee. You mention that you do not process sensitive data, so that it is currently unlikely you'd be required to appoint a DPO (compare Art 37, but note that the list of sensitive categories of data in Art 9(1\\) does not match your examples). The requirement to appoint a DPO depends entirely on the kind and scale of your data processing activities, not on number of employees or revenue thresholds. However, some GDPR compliance obligations like Art 30 Records of Processing Activities can also trigger when you reach 250 employees.\n\nAside from that, it is a business decision whether and when to invest in compliance.\n\nNote that if your business offers goods or services to people in the EU/EEA, you may be required to appoint an EU representative. Some law firms offer package deals for DPOs \\+ EU/UK representatives.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small UK-based online business with a monthly turnover of \u00a31,500 is considering how to ensure GDPR compliance. Which of the following approaches is most likely to be both cost-effective and reasonably reliable for ensuring initial GDPR compliance?\n\nA) Immediately hiring a full-time GDPR legal advisor\nB) Ignoring GDPR requirements until the business grows larger\nC) Following online GDPR tutorials and using the ICO's guidance to implement basic compliance measures\nD) Appointing a Data Protection Officer from day one\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: For a small, new business with limited resources, following online GDPR tutorials and using the ICO's comprehensive guidance is a practical first step towards compliance. This approach allows the business to understand and implement basic compliance measures without the significant expense of hiring a full-time legal advisor or DPO, which would be disproportionate for a business of this size. \n\nOption A is excessive for a small business at this stage. Option B is risky and non-compliant, as ignorance of the law is not a valid defense. Option D is not necessary unless the business is processing sensitive data on a large scale or engaging in regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects, which doesn't seem to be the case here. \n\nThe ICO's guidance provides digestible information and checklists that can help small businesses achieve a reasonable level of compliance through a DIY approach.

The defendant has been put through an unreasonable amount of trouble. (Appealed through online system and confirmed in email, but the court lost the record. Had to make repeated requests in person for the case to be put in the system. Repeated requests for an interpreter, also confirmed by the court. However, when the defendant showed up, there was no interpreter and the judge reset the court date, multiple times. The prosecutors insisted on talking to the defendant prior to the trial and attacked the defendant with insults.)\n\nHaving done my homework, I am not sure: all I have found is that representation by a public defender is a possibility in criminal cases but not civil infraction.

They have phones for that purpose (among others). However, if the defendant accepts the invitation of the prosecutor or law enforcement to chat or agrees to the Prosecutor's request without understanding what he's agreeing too, that's not the failure of the process. You have a right to remain silent... but the prosecution has a right to keep on asking you questions and offering you deals anyway.\n\nHis attempts to get you to talk are not violations of your rights, cause you can always just shut up and you do not have to agree to any of his terms.

I am a software engineer, not a lawyer. Which is probably a good thing, otherwise I'd be confused out of my mind. Law is definitely not a science, because there are so many conditions in written legislation that conflict with one another! So if a software engineer tried to develop software to make a decision for any situation based on written law, the computer would start smoking from confusion.\n\nIs it safer to assume something is not allowed until you find enough evidence that it's allowed?

In other words, the law is a set of propositions which must *all* be true, and unlike actual execution of instructions in a sequence, law is to be interpreted simultaneously but hierarchically (that is: the order in which clauses are written is not significant). The appearance that the law is self\\-contradictory is largely illusory, though the resolution of the conflict may require a careful reading of the law and knowledge of jurisdictional hierarchy (federal law is superior to state law, which entails a particular resolution of the apparent conflict). Sometimes there are real conflicts, which usually result from using words in conflicting ways (note the practice of re\\-defining words \"in this chapter/section/title\").\n\nThe reason why law is not a science is that law is normative, not descriptive: it dictates what is allowed (a determination made through the political process), and does not attempt to discover what independently is. The reason why the legal process cannot be implemented in software is that software does not yet correctly interpret natural language, and law is written in natural language following interpretations based on judgments of what choices a reasonable would make.\n\nPerhaps if you propose a piece of law that you think is contradictory, it would be possible to show how the contradiction is illusory.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a new law student, you're trying to understand the fundamental approach to interpreting legislation.

Can one of the 18 identifiers be PHI by itself, without having any medical information attached to it? For example an first and last name from an EHR system. I have always thought you need some sort of medical information attached with the 18 identifiers to make it PHI, otherwise without the health information, it's PII. So a first and last name with the diagnosis of diabetes is PHI, but my first and last name is not PHI, only PII.\n2. Does it matter where the information originated from? For example if a person inputs their health information into a healthcare website, say weight and medical condition, is that different from a doctor inputting that same data into their EHR?\n3. The definition states that it's protected if the covered entity receives the information \\- but what if the patient gives health information (let's say weight and medical conditions) to a downstream business associate (with a signed BAA)? I thought HITECH extended liability to downstream associates as if they were the covered entity.\n\nIt's worth posting the definition of protected health information for reference.\n\n*Under HIPAA, protected health information is considered to be individually identifiable information relating to the past, present, or future health status of an individual that is created, collected, or transmitted, or maintained by a HIPAA\\-covered entity in relation to the provision of healthcare, payment for healthcare services, or use in healthcare operations (PHI healthcare business uses).\nHealth information such as diagnoses, treatment information, medical test results, and prescription information are considered protected health information under HIPAA, as are national identification numbers and demographic information such as birth dates, gender, ethnicity, and contact and emergency contact information. PHI relates to physical records, while ePHI is any PHI that is created, stored, transmitted, or received electronically.\nPHI only relates to information on patients or health plan members. It does not include information contained in educational and employment records, that includes health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in its capacity as an employer.\nPHI is only considered PHI when an individual could be identified from the information. If all identifiers are stripped from health data, it ceases to be protected health information and the HIPAA Privacy Rule\u2019s restrictions on uses and disclosures no longer apply.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Response to point 1:**\n\n1. Yes, it\u2019s true that for information to be classified as PHI, PII must be attached to the health information. If there is no health\\-related information that could be past, present or, future with the PII, it is only Personally Identifiable Information. E.g. if there is a web page with details like First Name, Last Name, Mobile No and health report attached, then the system is considered and PHI/ePHI. Secondly, all the health records have PII for traceability purposes.\n2. Secondly, First and Last Name also does not qualify to be PII, as it\u2019s generic information. I can\u2019t identify an individual basis First Name and Last Name; a 3rd attribute will be required.\n\n**Response to point 2:\\-** \n1\\. Not at all.\n2\\.

Even if the PHI is being collected by the Business Associate or downstream actors, it will still be classified as PHI.

The classification of information as Protected Health Information (PHI) under HIPAA depends on several factors:\n\n1. The nature of the information: It must include both personally identifiable information and health-related information.\n2. The entity handling the information: It must be a HIPAA-covered entity or their business associate.\n3.

You can take this and **do not need to sign anything**.\n\nHowever, sometimes companies make slightly more generous offers in exchange for you agreeing not to take them to tribunal/court or discuss/disclose certain matters. This would often involve more money and an agreed reference. **These agreements only have legal standing if you have taken legal advice from a person qualified to give it**.

This practice is increasingly common in the UK for dismissals, especially in cases of redundancy. The company is attempting to enter into what is now called a settlement agreement (formerly known as a compromise agreement). These agreements typically offer more generous terms than statutory redundancy pay in exchange for the employee agreeing not to take legal action against the company or disclose certain matters.

If the next of kin doesn\u2019t want to be involved, the funeral may be arranged through the government contractor.\n> * Where a person who dies in hospital has no next of kin or friends to arrange or pay for the funeral, and had no money or other assets, and the coroner is not involved, the hospital where they died must accept responsibility for arranging and paying for the funeral through the government contractor.\n> * If a person died at home, and has no next of kin or friends to arrange or pay for the funeral, had no money or other assets, and the coroner is not involved, when a doctor has issued a medical certificate of cause of death, the police will complete a burial/cremation of a \u2018Deceased Destitute Person\u2019 form P372, which is sent to the Director of Public Health Unit (PHU) of the relevant Health Service. The government contractor will be contacted by the PHU to organise a funeral. If a medical certificate of cause of death was not issued, the body is taken to the coroner\u2019s morgue.\n> * The coroner issues an \u2018Order for Disposal of a Destitute Person\u2019 and forwards it to the Director of the relevant Health Service\u2019s Public Health Unit (PHU). The PHU, in turn, contacts the government contractor who forwards the invoice to the PHU for payment by the Area Health Service. See the section on destitute funerals. If a Coroner\u2019s case involves a destitute person, and there are next of kin, the counsellors at the Department of Forensic Medicine can be approached by the family to assist with funeral arrangements.\n> * If the deceased has no next of kin, but did have money or assets, the case is referred to the NSW Trustee and Guardian who arranges and pays for a funeral from the estate.\n\n> **If someone dies with a will, but does not mention their body or how to dispose of it who decides what happens?**\n\nAs stated above, your requests in your will as to the disposal of your body are **not** binding on your executor. They must decide how to dispose of the body with consideration of their duties to the estate and beneficiaries. For example, if your will requests a funeral costing tens of thousands of dollars but your estate is worth only a few thousand then the executor is duty bound to ignore that request.\n\n> **a parent has two children and dies leaving no will, which of the siblings decides?**\n\nThey decide together. If they cannot agree then they will have to go to court. In general, in Australia, courts take a very pragmatic view of what should happen: quickest and lowest cost option on the table will generally win.\n\n> **Who pays for the result of that decision?**\n\nThe estate is responsible for funeral costs (and court costs in arguing about them). As a practical matter, funeral service providers (and lawyers) will require the person engaging their services to pay the bill; that person can then claim reimbursement as a creditor of the estate. In the event that the estate is insolvent (i.e. has more debts than assets) then their reimbursement will be less than their costs.\n\n> **If one sibling wants to have a huge funeral and the other wants to just toss the body in a dumpster does the cost for the funeral come out of the estate before it is split?**\n\nObserving that to \"just toss the body in a dumpster\" would be illegal; the costs of the funeral come from the estate as a creditor of the estate. The residual equity of the estate would then be divided in accordance with the will or the law if there is no will.\n\nIt is worth noting that joint assets (e.g. real property owned as joint tenants, joint bank accounts) pass directly to the surviving owner and never become assets of the estate.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, a wealthy businessman, dies unexpectedly without leaving a will.

While the 17-year-old friend consented, the law specifically states in subsection (5) that a person who takes or detains a child is treated as acting without the child's consent.

Therefore, the 18-year-old driver could potentially be charged with kidnapping, regardless of the 17-year-old's willingness to go.

In the US, under [35 USC 154(d)](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303482), if a claim in a published application is \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to a claim that eventually issues, a patent owner can get damages of at least a reasonable royalty on units produced between the publication and notice and the issue date.

Under what circumstances could TechInnovate potentially seek damages from RivalTech for the period between September 1, 2020 and March 1, 2022?\n\nA) TechInnovate can automatically seek damages for this entire period once the patent is granted.\nB) TechInnovate can seek damages only if they sent a cease and desist letter to RivalTech before the patent was granted.\nC) TechInnovate can seek damages if the granted patent claims are substantially identical to the published application claims, and RivalTech had actual notice of the published application.\nD) TechInnovate cannot seek any damages for the period before the patent was granted, regardless of circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. This scenario involves the concept of provisional rights under 35 USC 154(d). For TechInnovate to potentially seek damages for the period between the publication of their patent application (July 1, 2020) and the granting of the patent (March 1, 2022), two conditions must be met:\n\n1.

However, TechInnovate would have to wait until the patent is actually granted to enforce these rights.\n\nOption A is incorrect because provisional rights are not automatic and require specific conditions to be met. Option B is incorrect because sending a cease and desist letter is not a requirement for provisional rights, though it could serve as proof of actual notice.

According to the concept of apparent authority in agency law, if a reasonable person would believe that an individual has the authority to act on behalf of the principal (in this case, the landlord), then that individual is considered to have that authority.

Of the 300 crimes an individual can commit here, about 100 of them can also be done by a corporation. \n\nIt is hard to discover why these hundred crimes were chosen specifically.

It can commit *Threatening a public official* but not *Oppression*.\n\nI looked through the explanatory notes for the law and I discoved the reason: Strictly only those crimes were created for corporations that were required by higher european law, which only moves the question higher up. I did not look up what the European Parliament had to say about this.\n\nThere is one crime that was added specifically, later on, to the list, and that is [Usury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury).\n\nIn principle, all crimes committed by an individual can be done by a corporation, because a crime is considered to be committed by a corporation if the action is done by an employee in the name of the corporation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided about corporate criminal liability in Europe, specifically the Czech Republic, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) Corporations can be charged with all criminal offenses that individuals can commit.\nB) The list of crimes a corporation can commit is determined by logic and practical considerations.\nC) Corporations can be charged with approximately one-third of the criminal offenses applicable to individuals.\nD) The European Parliament directly specified which crimes corporations can commit in each member state.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

While the employee may be vulnerable to a lawsuit for potentially violating the non-disparagement agreement, the company would likely face challenges in quantifying damages if the agreement doesn't specify sanctions for violations. The concept of \"economic reality\" suggests that the company's name change doesn't necessarily invalidate the agreement.

But between different eras of Supreme courts I guess the present takes precedence over the past? What is the rationale for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The House of Lords declared themselves able to depart from their own precedents in 1966, [stating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_Statement) (emphasis added):\n\n> Their Lordships regard the use of precedent as an indispensable foundation upon which to decide what is the law and its application to individual cases. It provides at least some degree of certainty upon which individuals can rely in the conduct of their affairs, as well as a basis for orderly development of legal rules.\n> \n> \n> Their Lordships nevertheless recognise that **too rigid adherence to precedent may lead to injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development of the law**. They propose therefore, to modify their present practice and, while treating former decisions of this house as normally binding, to depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so.\n> In this connection they will bear in mind the danger of disturbing retrospectively the basis on which contracts, settlement of property, and fiscal arrangements have been entered into and also the especial need for certainty as to the criminal law.\n> This announcement is not intended to affect the use of precedent elsewhere than in this House.\n\nThis applies equally to the Supreme Court, which has replaced the judicial functions of the Lords. The Practice Statement of 1966 itself overturned *London Street Tramways v London County Council* \\[1898] AC 375, in which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, had said:\n\n> A decision of this House once given on a point of law is conclusive on this House afterwards.\n\nIn the modern understanding, it is in the interests of justice for the Supreme Court to always be able to say what the law is, even if that conflicts with the understanding of the past. As it is the final court of appeal, there is no other court which could review or overturn its decisions. Parliament *could*, and sometimes has, done so, but it is not always easy to express the desired effect in statutory language; and Parliament has many other demands on its time. It was felt that the court itself should be in a position to say that a past judgement was wrongly decided, or should no longer be considered binding for another reason.\n\nIn the Scottish tradition, this power has long been held to be inherent in that country's highest courts, the Court of Session / High Court of Justiciary. It is allied to the *nobile officium*, or equitable jurisdiction of those courts to provide a just remedy in the absence of any explicit law. Judicial precedent is not a barrier to justice either. As Lord Kames said (*Historical law\\-tracts*, 1758; tract 8\\),\n\n> No defect in the constitution of a state deserves greater reproach, than the giving license to wrong without affording redress. Upon this account, it is the province, one should imagine, of the sovereign, and supreme court, to redress wrongs of every kind, where a peculiar remedy is not provided.\n\nThose courts have not held themselves to a strict idea of *stare decisis* with respect to their own decisions, feeling instead that in the interests of justice they should be able to decide what a particular case demands. John Erskine explained (*An institute of the law of Scotland*, 1773; book 1, title 1, section 47\\):\n\n> Decisions therefore though they bind the parties litigating create no obligation on the judges to follow in the same tract if it shall appear to them contrary to law.\n\nEnglish courts, at least once in their roughly modern shape following the reforms of the late 19th century, have taken a stricter view of precedent, in the interests of predictability. The reform of 1966 was influenced by differences between English and Scottish practice, and represents something of a course\\-correction away from the strict position of the prior era.\n\nIn terms of the present and the past, \"precedent\" doesn't precisely mean that the past wins out. It would be better to say that a past decision is *presumed to be right*, up until proved otherwise, or made obsolete by events such as the passage of new statutes. The presumption is binding on lower courts, and merely \"very strong\" for the highest court.

In 1966, the House of Lords (now replaced by the Supreme Court in its judicial function) issued the Practice Statement, which allowed them to depart from their own precedents when it appeared right to do so. This change was influenced by the Scottish legal tradition, which had long held that strict adherence to precedent should not be a barrier to justice. The rationale was that \"too rigid adherence to precedent may lead to injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development of the law.\" This change aligned English practice more closely with the Scottish approach, recognizing that the highest court should have the flexibility to correct past mistakes or adapt to changing circumstances, while still treating precedent as normally binding.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the change was about the court's own power to depart from precedent, not about giving more power to Parliament. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the change only applied to the House of Lords (now Supreme Court), not to lower courts. \n\nOption D is the opposite of what the change actually did, as it gave the Supreme Court more flexibility to change its mind on previous decisions when necessary."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13626/what-benefits-to-the-freeholder-and-what-disadvantages-to-the-leaseholder-does-a", "docs_id": 13626, "title": "What benefits to the freeholder and what disadvantages to the leaseholder does a long (1000 year) lease have over the freehold?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am interested in a property and approximately 300 acres of associated land in the UK.

A number of exchanges have become very predictable:\n\n* **Q**: How do you feel about a past decision? **A**: It is precedent. **Q**: Sure, but precedent can be overturned based on judge's interpretations. How do *you* feel about it? **A**: I am a judge, I just follow precedent\u2014stare decisis, etc.\n* **Q**: How do you feel about a case currently in the court system, which might come before you? **A**: I cannot give hints as to how I will vote in pending cases.\n* **Q**: How do you feel about a case that might come up in the future? **A**: I cannot speak to hypotheticals.\n\nAs to the *why* he is not able to answer these questions, he says that he studied previous nomination proceedings and is following what these other judges did.

The questions I have are:\n\n1. What is the precedent for what a Supreme Court nominee can and cannot say? How different is his approach from what people have done in the past? For lack of a better phrasing, is Kavanaugh just saying this to dodge questions, or is there actually a tradition of precedent supporting his pattern non\\-answers?\n2. What are the consequences if he does not follow this precedent? It seems to me to be unlikely that there is any legal consequence\u2014the only negative consequence he could face for not following this precedent is just that the Senate would not vote to confirm him.\n3. If there is solid, non\\-partisan, defensible precedent for him not answering questions, then what is the point of questioning the nominee? If a nominee cannot comment on past decisions by others, says to \"read the opinion\" on their own previous decisions, cannot comment on current cases, and cannot comment on hypotheticals of future cases, then what is the point of a hearing in the first place? It seems naive to believe that a person is a machine that follows predecent.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> If a nominee cannot comment on past decisions by others, says to \"read\n>  the opinion\" on their own previous decisions, cannot comment on\n>  current cases, and cannot comment on hypotheticals of future cases,\n>  then what is the point of a hearing in the first place?\n\nMuch of what you describe constitutes improper evasion (please note that I have neither watched the hearings nor read any holdings by Kavanaugh, which I presume has prompted your question). A judge's mere answer that he would follow *stare decisis* is as useless as if a candidate for investment management simply answered that he would \"*buy low, sell high*\".\n\nNot all of that evasion is improper, though. For instance, the [Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct](http://courts.mi.gov/courts/michigansupremecourt/rules/documents/michigan%20code%20of%20judicial%20conduct.pdf) in its Canon 3\\.A(6\\) reads:\n\n> A judge should abstain from public comment about a pending or\n>  impending proceeding in any court, and should require a similar\n>  abstention on the part of court personnel subject to the judge's\n>  direction and control. This subsection does not prohibit a judge from\n>  making public statements in the course of official duties or from\n>  explaining for public information the procedures of the court or the\n>  judge's holdings or actions.\n\n(Note: I doubt the the federal equivalent of these rules would significantly differ. In this regard, the U.S. consists of many jurisdictions copying each other this type of rules. I would call it *jurisdictional rip\\-offs*. The term *rip\\-off* applies also from the standpoint that many judges flagrantly violate these rules, but I am digressing from the topic.)\n\nIn theory, the rationale for that \"Canon\" is that a judge's (or judicial candidate's/nominee's) public comments about pending or impending cases are very likely to disrupt litigation, exacerbate court\\-shopping, and is perceived as catering to certain lobbyists or groups of power, thereby heating the undeniable trafficking of influences in court. Moreover, that kind of comments would prejudice the party who is not favored by the comments and who has no equal access to the forum or media in order to refute those comments.\n\nHowever, you can see that the same item of that Canon allows a judge to explain \"*for public information \\[...] the judge's holdings or actions*\". Thus, principles of transparency should compel a judicial nominee to openly answer questions about his or her own decisions. Of course, for an examination to be effective, it is necessary that the legislators come prepared to the hearing by having read various opinions (decisions) released by that judge.\n\nFurthermore, the Canon does not prohibit to answer inquiries about hypothetical scenarios. As long as the hypotheticals do not resemble a pending or impending case, a judicial nominee (or candidate, where elected by public vote) should promptly give others a \\[non\\-conclusory] walk\\-through of his or her judicial rationale.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct, which of the following actions would be most appropriate for a judicial nominee during a confirmation hearing?\n\nA) Refusing to comment on any past decisions, citing stare decisis as the reason\nB) Providing detailed opinions on pending cases to demonstrate legal expertise\nC) Explaining the rationale behind their own previous judicial holdings\nD) Commenting extensively on hypothetical scenarios that closely resemble pending cases\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct, which is likely similar to federal guidelines, allows judges to explain \"for public information the procedures of the court or the judge's holdings or actions.\" This means that a judicial nominee can and should explain the rationale behind their own previous decisions. Option A is incorrect because simply citing stare decisis without explanation is described as \"useless\" evasion. Option B violates the rule against commenting on pending cases. Option D is problematic because hypotheticals that closely resemble pending cases could be seen as indirectly commenting on those cases, which is prohibited.

They could with a simple purchase of alternative hosting and a few commands deploy their webserver on an EU host. This would however have little effect on the access to the data, in that if US law enforcement turned up at the offices of Alice Inc. they could be required to hand over the data and their access to the data will not be changed in any way by the location of the web hosting.\n\nIf they did this, would this satisfy the particular aspect of the GDPR that was covered by the 'Schrems II' decision and the Meta fine?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Maybe this changes something, maybe not. But at first glance, yes, avoiding US\\-based vendors does help comply with Schrems II. They need not be EU\\-based.\n\nDefinition of an international data transfer\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe GDPR unfortunately does not define what an international transfer is, and just explains when they may be lawful:\n\n> Art 44: Any transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country \\[\u2026] shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from the third country \\[\u2026] to another third country \\[\u2026]. \\[\u2026]\n\nThis has been interpreted, in particular by the official EU SCCs and by [EDPB guidance](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052021-interplay-between-application-article-3_en), to imply two roles: the data exporter, and the data importer. Per those EDPB guidelines, a transfer occurs when three criteria are fulfilled together:\n\n1. The data exporter is subject to GDPR (e.g. as a controller via Art 3, or as a processor via an Art 28 data processing contract).\n2. The exporter discloses or makes available personal data to the importer.\n3. The importer is in a \"third country\" (for EU GDPR: anything outside the EU/EEA).\n\nNote that these importer/exporter aspects are independent from roles like \"controller\" or \"processor\". It also does not depend on where in the world the exporter is situated.\n\nApplying this to your scenario\n------------------------------\n\nHow does this apply to your scenario?\n\n* I am assuming Alice Inc is subject to the GDPR (criterion \\#1\\). Now, Alice Inc can process personal data, and **that's not an international transfer**, even if Alice Inc is in the US (or any other third country). The general GDPR rules apply, such as the requirement to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance and security of processing operations.\n* If Alice Inc engages data processors to process personal data on Alice Inc's behalf, then this would fulfil criterion \\#2 (disclosure to a third party). For example, hosting providers generally act as data processors. Any other kind of data sharing (e.g. to other data processors) would also fall under this category. Tricky in an US context: while employees would be agents of Alice Inc and would not be separate recipients, contractors/freelancers would also be potential data importers.\n* If those data importers are based in the EU/EEA, then criterion \\#3 is not fulfilled and **there's no international transfer**. For example, using an EU\\-based hosting providers would sidestep Chapter V of the GDPR completely.\n* If those data importers are based outside of the EU/EEA, **then criterion \\#3 is triggered and we have an international transfer**.\n\nLawfulness of international data transfers\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhen there is an international transfer, it must be adequately protected. In order of decreasing priority:\n\n* country has an EU adequacy decision\n* appropriate safeguards\n\t+ for a group of companies: Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)\n\t+ Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)\n* Art 49 specific situations\n\nWhat SCCs and BCRs do is to translate enough of the GDPR from statutory law into a contract to ensure adequate protection. But to be effective, they must actually be enforceable, and the data importer must actually be able to comply with those rules.\n\nIn Schrems II, the CJEU found that the US (at that time) did not offer an adequate level of data protection, and that SCCs are probably invalid as well since importers cannot comply with both the SCCs and with US surveillance laws. Before using SCCs, it is effectively necessary to perform a transfer impact assessment (TIA) analyzing, among other things, the legal context of the importer's country. It may be possible to defuse this, for example by using supplemental security measures like end\\-to\\-end that prevent unlawful use of the data even if it falls into the wrong hands. However, such measures also tend to prevent intended use, especially in a cloud context.\n\nIn the [DPC Ireland decision against Meta Ireland (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-05/final_for_issue_ov_transfers_decision_12-05-23.pdf), the DPC finds:\n\n> 7\\.202 In summary, therefore, I am satisfied (and I so find) that:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) US law does not provide a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to that provided by EU law;  \n> \n> (2\\) Neither the 2010 SCCs nor the 2021 SCCs can compensate for the inadequate protection provided by US law; and  \n> \n> (3\\) Meta Ireland does not have in place any supplemental measures which would\n> compensate for the inadequate protection provided by US law.\n> \n> \n> 7\\.203 Accordingly, in making the Data Transfers, I find that, subject to the analysis contained at Section 8 below, Meta Ireland is infringing Article 46(1\\) GDPR.\n\nImplications of using non\\-US vendors\n-------------------------------------\n\nAs already mentioned, using EU\\-based data processors avoids the international transfer problem due to the way how international transfers are defined.\n\nEven if an international transfer occurs, that might not be a problem.\n\n* Some countries have an EU adequacy decision, for example Canada, Israel, or South Korea. While there would nominally be an international data transfer that needs to be disclosed e.g. in a privacy notice, there is no additional bureaucracy required.\n* In other countries, transfer tools like SCCs might work. A TIA might show that that the issues discussed in the Schrems II decision and the DPC decision wouldn't apply there.\n\nBut isn't that a contradiction?\n-------------------------------\n\nYou correctly point out a problem with the GDPR's approach to data transfers:\n\n> This would however have little effect on the access to the data, in that if US law enforcement turned up at the offices of Alice Inc. they could be required to hand over the data and their access to the data will not be changed in any way by the location of the web hosting.\n\nYes, this is arguably a loophole.\n\nHowever:\n\n* If the US\\-based Alice Inc is a data processor in behalf of another controller, that controller would likely be violating the GDPR by transferring personal data to Alice.\n* If Alice Inc is a data controller: while this might not be a violation of the Chapter V rules on international data transfers, such a scenario could be argued to be an Art 24 or Art 32 violation instead (requirement to ensure compliance and security).\n* When Alice Inc transfers personal data to data importers, that is less visible to data subjects, and outside of their immediate control. However, when Alice Inc collects data on data subjects, that is more visible to data subjects, in particular through an Art 13 or Art 14 privacy notice. That notice must also contain the identity of the data controller, which would disclose that Alice is US\\-based, which may enable to data subjects to make more informed choices.\n\nThis won't help Meta\n--------------------\n\nWhile moving to non\\-US data processors can be a sensible compliance approach for many companies, it is less useful for multinationals like Meta. In this context, Meta is an Irish data controller who engages platform and development services from an American company. Even if Meta Ireland tries to perform all GDPR\\-covered processing activities outside the US, it's actual corporate structure situates some processing activities such as administration tasks in the US and other third countries.

The authors of the original mouse driver could claim that \"A contract for an illegal purpose is void\", therefore I did not give GPL rights to the user, and therefore did abide by the terms of the GPL, and therefore breached their copyright.\n\nIs there any merit in these claims? If not, are there any restrictions on such dual use tools?\n\nThis is hypothetical, so any jusritictions would be interesting. Most to me would be me in the UK and both authors in the US.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This sounds a bit far\\-fetched. There are laws against circumventing copy protection measures (DRM) but not against aimbotting (to the best of my knowledge). Thus, you cannot reasonably believe that a click\\-assist functionality would be used to break *laws*. It could definitely be used to break *private contracts* such as an EULA, but you are not a party to that contract and are not bound by its terms. Of course, when *you* use such click\\-assist tech in an online game, you might be breaking *your* contract with the game vendor or server provider. But this doesn't imply that a click\\-assist would be forbidden outside of that context.\n\nNote that assistive technologies sometimes have exceptions from laws, e.g. a permission to circumvent DRM if necessary for accessibility. In the US, the Librarian of Congress adopts exceptions for a duration of three years. While none of the [current exceptions](https://www.copyright.gov/title37/201/37cfr201-40.html) match your specific scenario involving video\\-games, it can be permissible to break DRM on e\\-books or videos for certain accessibility enhancements.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates a mouse driver with image analysis capabilities to assist users with tremors.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this software?\n\nA) The developer is likely to face successful legal action from FPS game authors for violating their EULA, as the software could be considered an \"aimbot.\"\n\nB) The original mouse driver authors could successfully claim that the developer breached their copyright by creating an illegal derivative work.\n\nC) The developer is legally protected as long as the software is marketed primarily as an assistive technology for users with tremors.\n\nD) The developer is unlikely to face successful legal action, as creating and distributing such software is not inherently illegal, even if it could potentially be used to violate game EULAs.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The software developer is unlikely to face successful legal action in this scenario. The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. Creating and distributing software that could potentially be used to violate a game's EULA is not inherently illegal. The developer is not a party to the EULA between the game company and its users.\n\n2. While the software could be used as an \"aimbot,\" it is primarily designed as an assistive technology for users with tremors, which could potentially fall under accessibility exceptions in some jurisdictions.\n\n3. The developer cannot be held as an accessory to breaking the law, as violating a game's EULA is a breach of contract, not a violation of law.\n\n4. The GPL licensing of the modified mouse driver is likely valid, as the purpose of the software (assistive technology) is not inherently illegal.\n\n5. Assistive technologies often have special considerations and exceptions in law, which could provide additional protection for the developer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because EULA violations are contract breaches, not law violations, and the developer is not bound by the EULA. Option B is incorrect because modifying and redistributing GPL software is allowed, and the purpose is not inherently illegal.

However, there is no count of how many requests I've used on a given day on the website or on my account page, nor in the API's response (in the response header or data). So, given a line of code that calls the API, there is no way for me to know whether running it will cost me money. When I ask the company, they say it's up to me to add a counter and keep track. So unless all my applications/environments tell each other how many requests I've used, then I have no means of tracking how many I have remaining. In addition, I don't know what time the count resets each day, or each minute.

Most functioning large\\-caliber and fully\\-automatic weapons are not allowed in civilian hands globally. The moment the ship leaves the 12 nautical miles zone, the country law of its flag applies, so unless you happen to start in the US with a duly registered curio/relic deck gun with proper stamps... you'll have a hard time being allowed to have the thing on board in the first place, and entering any other country's water is pretty much violating their gun control laws and gun import laws.\n\nShip hulls don't support them.\n------------------------------\n\nThat deck gun there is a type of [Bofors 40mm L/60 twin mounting \\- 40x311mmR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bofors_40_mm_L/60_gun). That means, its installation weighs upwards of half a ton, as that's the smallest carriage setup according to Wikipedia.

He can do this by requesting a Status Information Letter (SIL) from the Selective Service System, which will confirm his exempt status without disclosing the reason for exemption.\n\nA is incorrect because Sam is not required to register for Selective Service due to being assigned female at birth.\nC is incorrect as transgender status does not disqualify someone from receiving federal financial aid.\nD is incorrect because Sam doesn't need to wait until 26; he can apply for aid at any time, but needs to provide proof of exemption from Selective Service registration."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/47357/gdpr-dilemma-does-a-full-name-contained-in-a-url-constitute-pii-as-stated-by-go", "docs_id": 47357, "title": "GDPR dilemma: Does a full name contained in a URL constitute PII as stated by Google Analytics?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: But wait, it gets better: This full name belongs to person who was interviewed in an article under this URL.\n\n[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7686480?hl\\=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7686480?hl=en)\n\n> What Google considers PII: ... full names or usernames\n\nNow, probably the right question would be: Should common CMS's such as Wordpress censor names from URLs?\n\nPS: This is a rather food for thought question, I do not expect you to provide a correct answer, I am more interested in your point of view on this specific use case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are mixing your terms; [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) talks about personal data:\n\n> \u2018Personal data\u2019 means any information relating to an identified or\n>  identifiable natural person (\u2018data subject\u2019); an identifiable natural\n>  person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in\n>  particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an\n>  identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one\n>  or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,\n>  mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\n\nPII is more a US term, for which NIST says:\n\n> PII is any information about an individual maintained by an agency,\n>  including (1\\) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace\n>  an individual\u2018s identity, such as name, social security number, date\n>  and place of birth, mother\u2018s maiden name, or biometric records; and\n>  (2\\) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual,\n>  such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.\n\nEither way around, a name is clearly personal data.

The key is that such data must be processed appropriately.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while names in URLs are indeed personal data, their use is not always a violation that requires censorship. The example of Twitter URLs containing names demonstrates this.\n\nOption B is incorrect as personal data in URLs is not exempt from data protection regulations simply because it's public. The regulations still apply, but the context and manner of processing are important.\n\nOption D is incorrect because both GDPR and NIST explicitly include names as examples of personal data or PII, not just numeric identifiers.\n\nThe question highlights the nuanced approach required in data protection, where the presence of personal data doesn't automatically indicate a problem, but rather necessitates appropriate handling and consideration of context."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/93792/is-it-illegal-to-honk-at-a-police-officer-in-the-usa", "docs_id": 93792, "title": "Is it illegal to honk at a police officer in the USA?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose a police car is stopped at a green light and not moving.

But I can't find any reliable references to that. Can someone please provide me reliable information about any such laws or regulations that exist?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a couple of US laws that form the basis of effectively warrantless surveillance, including through tech companies:\n\n* Under Executive Order 12333, US intelligence agencies issue National Security Letters. These letters compel the recipient to provide requested data. These letters do not require a warrant, and typically include a gag order for the recipient.\n* Under Section 702 FISA, US intelligence agencies enjoy substantial powers for foreign surveillance. This surveillance has to be authorized by the FISA court, but it has been criticized for rubber\\-stamping requests. Proceedings at the FISA court are *ex parte* and lack representation for the surveillance subjects.\n* FISA and the National Security Letters mechanism where expanded through the Patriot Act.\n* US intelligence agencies often have creative interpretations of the governing laws. Judicial review tends to defer to executive branch interpretation if that interpretation is reasonable. Thus, there exists a secret body of quasi\\-law where intelligence agencies can interpret the existence of further powers.\n\nThese laws have very limited checks and balances. While Americans enjoy some protections, there are basically none for non\\-Americans. Subjects have extremely limited options to fight this surveillance in court. FISA has to be re\\-authorized every few years.\n\nThe true scope of surveillance under these laws became publicly known through the Snowden leaks. For example, intelligence agencies ran the PRISM program based on section 702 FISA that compelled companies to supply all data matching a \u201cselector\u201d.\n\nA bit of outside perspective: In 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled that EO 12333 and other laws mean that the United States do not have an adequate level of data protection, effectively forbidding further transfers of personal data into the US. While the EU's GDPR does recognize surveillance measures that are \u201cnecessary and proportionate in a democratic society\u201d, the lack of judicial remedies for surveillance subjects are especially troubling. The ECJ wrote in its judgement (case C\u2011311/18\\):\n\n> As regards judicial protection, the referring court states that EU citizens do not have the same remedies as US citizens in respect of the processing of personal data by the US authorities, since the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which constitutes, in United States law, the most important cause of action available to challenge unlawful surveillance, does not apply to EU citizens. In that regard, the referring court states that there are substantial obstacles in respect of the causes of action open to EU citizens, in particular that of *locus standi*, which it considers to be excessively difficult to satisfy. Furthermore, according to the findings of the referring court, the NSA\u2019s activities based on E.O. 12333 are not subject to judicial oversight and are not justiciable. \\[\u2026]\n> \n> \n> It follows therefore that neither Section 702 of the FISA, nor E.O. 12333, read in conjunction with PPD\u201128, correlates to the minimum safeguards resulting, under EU law, from the principle of proportionality, with the consequence that the surveillance programmes based on those provisions cannot be regarded as limited to what is strictly necessary.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal framework for government surveillance of digital communications in the United States?\n\nA) The government is required to obtain a warrant for all surveillance activities, with no exceptions.\n\nB) The USA PATRIOT Act completely replaced all previous surveillance laws and regulations.\n\nC) Executive Order 12333 and Section 702 of FISA provide broad surveillance powers with limited oversight.\n\nD) Tech companies are legally required to build backdoors into all their products for government access.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because Executive Order 12333 and Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) indeed provide broad surveillance powers to US intelligence agencies with limited oversight. These laws allow for practices such as National Security Letters and FISA court authorizations, which have been criticized for their lack of checks and balances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there are several mechanisms, such as National Security Letters, that allow for warrantless surveillance under certain circumstances.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the USA PATRIOT Act expanded surveillance powers, it did not completely replace previous laws.

You are the data controller, the third party analytics are usually a data processor who only process data on your behalf. You must ensure that the data processor is compliant. Even if they were a joint controller you'd be responsible for what happens on the website (relevant precedent is the Fashion ID case).\n* While ePrivacy originally had a fairly weak concept of consent (e.g. \u201cby continuing to use this site, you consent \u2026\u201d). However, the GDPR updated the definition of consent, so that valid consent must be freely given, informed, actively given, and specific. If you set cookies for different purposes in addition to analytics, users should be able to give or withhold consent for analytics independently from other purposes. Since consent must be actively given, consent is never the default, e.g. pre\\-ticked checkboxes are not compliant (relevant precedent is the Planet49 case).\n* Like Google, GoSquared stores data in the US. You are causing personal data to be transferred into the US, which is an international transfer. Before it was invalidated earlier in 2020, such transfers were easy to do under the Privacy Shield adequacy decision.

The correct answer reflects this broad authority, which applies regardless of whether the content creator owns or rents the property.

One reading of the circumstances is that you did not have a job offer, you went there on the assumption that you might get an official offer after being \"oriented\" and interviewed. The interview did not go well, so they did not give you the job. Time and travel expenses are often borne by the job candidate.\n\nThe alternative interpretation is that you had an actual job offer, and you traveled to the site as part of your employment (involving some training). In that first session, things went bad, and you got fired. If that is the case, then (a) you would be owed wages for that day and (b) there is a slim chance that the firing was not legal (there could be restrictions on firing employees in government jobs, in whatever jurisdiction this is).

The developer can sell apps as a \"natural person\" without necessarily forming a corporation. However, they will likely need to pay taxes on their app income in both the US (where the app stores are likely based) and in Mexico (their country of residence).

The FSF considers these two licenses compatible and it also means that when you combine code under these two licenses, the effective obligations that will apply are these of the Apache and GPL combined, including source code redistribution.\n\nBut why are the compatible?

Quite often, nations have consular offices outside the capital manned by locals with an interest in the sending nation, and they may carry out business in their own home.

If a reasonable person would infer a lack of intent to pay from Bob's actions, he may be found guilty.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of shoplifting laws, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the act of concealing merchandise within a store?\n\nA) Concealing merchandise always constitutes theft, regardless of intent to pay.\nB) Concealing merchandise is never considered a crime if the person intends to pay eventually.\nC) In some jurisdictions, willful concealment of merchandise may be considered a crime in itself, even without leaving the store.\nD) Intent to deprive the owner of property is the only factor considered in determining if theft occurred.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because theft generally requires both the act of taking control and the intent to deprive the owner.\nB is overly broad and not supported by the information given.\nC is correct because the passage states that some jurisdictions specifically codify willful concealment as a crime, even without leaving the premises.\nD is incorrect because while intent is crucial, it's not the only factor; the act of taking or concealing is also considered.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the nuances in shoplifting laws, particularly the concept of willful concealment and how it may be treated differently across jurisdictions."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11534/removal-of-defamatory-online-content", "docs_id": 11534, "title": "Removal of defamatory online content", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A former disgruntled employee wrote some defamatory comments about me two months ago, and listed them on a site which has a very strong ranking on google. The employee made false claims, and derogatory comments that are completely untrue and I contacted the employee about removing the content. \n\nThe employee apologized and attempted to remove the content, but the site will not remove it, and the website hides behind [Communications Decency Act or the \u201cCDA\u201d, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act).

I need a court order to have this site be removed by Google.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is, get a lawyer. The longer answer is that it is not clear how this works. There is evidence from The Interwebs that one can get a court order to remove defamatory online material such as [here](http://www.defamationremovalattorneysblog.com/2015/04/how-to-remove-a-defamatory-blog-post-or-site/). That discussion is centered on facts that don't hold here, e.g. a somewhat cooperative provider or an unknown defamer. It [seems](http://forum.freeadvice.com/libel-slander-defamation-88/how-can-i-get-court-order-remove-slanderous-comments-website-468705.html) that you file an ex parte motion to remove the content and identify the defamer (not sure if that is a required element of the motion). There is a [wealth of case law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act#Defamatory_information) supporting provider immunity. So, it is quite possible that the only remedy is to get the employee to sue the provider forcing them to take down the defamatory material. It would certainly be unjust for a provider to willfully put a customer in permanent legal peril (the threat of being sued). That doesn't mean that it is legally impossible for them to be stubborn.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An individual is facing defamatory comments posted online by a former employee who has since apologized and attempted to remove the content. The website hosting the comments refuses to remove them, citing protection under the Communications Decency Act. Which of the following is the most appropriate and legally sound course of action for the individual to take?\n\nA) Directly sue the website hosting the defamatory content for refusing to remove it\nB) File an ex parte motion to remove the content and identify the defamer\nC) Persuade the former employee to sue the website provider to force content removal\nD) Ignore the issue, as there is no legal recourse available under the Communications Decency Act\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most appropriate course of action. Filing an ex parte motion to remove the content and identify the defamer is a legal strategy that has been used in similar cases. While the Communications Decency Act does provide some immunity to website providers, a court order can potentially compel the removal of defamatory content.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the website is likely protected under the Communications Decency Act, making a direct lawsuit against them difficult to win.\n\nOption C, while creative, puts the burden on the former employee and may not be practical or effective, especially if the employee is overseas.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there are legal options available, even if they may be challenging to pursue.\n\nIt's important to note that the question specifically mentions the need for a court order to have Google remove the content, which aligns with the approach in option B.

(or having it as a closed source project)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes and no.\n\nThere's two situations to this.\n\n### You own all the copyright:\n\nIf you own all the copyright, then you're clear. you can license your software under the GPL, sell it, and bring it back to a closed source application later on. There's one detail: If someone has an open source copy of your software, they are entitled to use it subject to terms of the GPL. You can't take back their license.\n\n### You do not own all the copyright:\n\nYou can sell the product, however, everything has to be under the GPL, and you can't bring it closed source afterwards, especially if you continue to sell it.

This means:\n\n1. The developer can sell the app commercially.\n2. The source code for the entire app must be made available to anyone who receives the binary (compiled) version.\n3. The app cannot be made closed-source in the future as long as it incorporates the GNU library.\n4. Users who receive the app under the GPL terms retain the right to use, modify, and distribute it under the same terms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the GPL requirements. Option B is partially correct but doesn't mention the requirement to provide source code. Option D is incorrect because even if the developer owns all other copyrights, using the GNU library still requires compliance with the GPL for the entire application."}}
