So what is the minimum necessary for a tenant not to be charged with breaking and entering (or unlawfully living in the home) if the landlord decides to kick them out? For example if a person has already moved in without signing anything, and subsequently the landlord wants them to sign a lease, but the tenant refuses to do so, is the tenant still protected by tenancy laws or can the landlord phone the cops right away and have the \"trespasser\" removed from the house? As long as a person has demonstrated that they initially had permission to live in the property, do they have some claim to continue to do so until the eviction process is completed?\n\nThe worst case scenario I can think of is if the tenant moves in with a verbal agreement from the landlord that no lease will have to be signed, he hasn't paid rent yet, and hasn't received a key and the landlord says \"I changed my mind; you have to move out.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, they still have to go through the normal eviction process and must still provide the minimum number of days required by their local jurisdiction in order to vacate the property.

After the tenant has been living there for two weeks, the landlord changes their mind and wants the tenant to leave immediately. What is the correct legal procedure in this situation?\n\nA) The landlord can call the police to remove the tenant as a trespasser since there is no signed lease agreement.\n\nB) The tenant has no legal rights and must vacate the property immediately upon the landlord's request.\n\nC) The landlord must go through the formal eviction process, providing the tenant with the minimum notice period required by local laws.\n\nD) The tenant can stay indefinitely without a lease until they choose to leave voluntarily.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Even without a written lease, the tenant has established residency by moving in and living in the property for two weeks. This creates an implied lease agreement between the landlord and tenant. As a result, the landlord must follow the proper eviction procedures as required by local tenancy laws, including providing the minimum required notice period. The landlord cannot simply have the tenant removed as a trespasser or demand immediate vacation of the property. Option A is incorrect because the police would not remove the tenant as a trespasser in this situation. Option B is incorrect because the tenant does have legal rights as an established resident. Option D is incorrect because while the tenant has rights, they are not indefinite, and the landlord can still initiate eviction proceedings following proper legal procedures."

The crucial reasoning of this decision rests on the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\", and follows the reasoning in [Kyllo v United States, 533 US 27](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/533/27/) that there *is* a search when\n\n> \u201cthe individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the\n> object of the challenged search,\u201d and \u201csociety \\[is] willing to\n> recognize that expectation as reasonable.\u201d\n\n(citing [California v. Ciraollo](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13894501388713609672&q=California%20v.%20Ciraolo&hl=en&as_sdt=6,47), 476 US 207\\). The opinion observes that in some cases there is a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\", and in some cases there is not \u2013 relevant parameters include whether the location is a home, whether or not the observation was from an airplane or helicopter, the altitude of the observation etc, and in ordinary aircraft suveillance cases, \"defendants could not have reasonably expected the activities and items on their property to be protected from public or official observation made by a human being from the publicly navigable airspace\". In this case, though, photographs \"taken from the ground seem to establish a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy against at least casual observation from a non\\-aerial vantage point\". The final conclusion is that\n\n> much like the infrared imaging device discussed in Kyllo;\n> low\\-altitude, unmanned, specifically\\-targeted drone surveillance of a\n> private individual\u2019s property is qualitatively different from the\n> kinds of human\\-operated aircraft overflights permitted by Ciraolo and\n> Riley. We conclude that drone surveillance of this nature intrudes\n> into persons\u2019 reasonable expectations of privacy, so such surveillance\n> implicates the Fourth Amendment and is illegal without a warrant or a\n> traditional exception to the warrant requirement\n\n(it should be noted that the drone operated below the FAA regulated minimum altitude, which crucially bears on whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy \u2013 \"Persons may, absent extraordinary circumstances, reasonably expect the law to be\nfollowed, even if they know the law is readily capable of being violated\"). It is not that violating an FAA safety regulation violates the 4th Amendment, it is that such a violation bears on what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nThere is a [dissenting opinion](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/siteassets/case-documents/uploads/OPINIONS/FINAL/COA/20210318_C349230_48_349230D.OPN.PDF) in *Long Lake*, which does a reasonable job at picking at the majority opinion. As far as Michigan is concerned, the majority opinion is what counts, but we cannot conclude that the next time this issue comes up, another state will follow suit. On the third hand, many states have encoded this \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" when it comes to drone surveillance.",

Maxon in Michigan. This ruling, along with laws in several states, suggests that low-altitude, targeted drone surveillance may violate the Fourth Amendment if it intrudes on a reasonable expectation of privacy.

Maxon case explicitly states that drone surveillance is qualitatively different from human-operated aircraft overflights in terms of privacy expectations.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the FAA regulations on minimum flight altitudes do play a role in Fourth Amendment considerations. The Long Lake Township v. Maxon ruling noted that operating below FAA minimum altitudes affects what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What must a landlord do to (legally) withhold some or all of a past tenant's damage deposit (aka security deposit)? I've heard (from the tenancy office) that a landlord cannot arbitrarily withhold the damage deposit, but what does this actually mean?\n\nI guess my first question is: When is a tenant held financially responsible for damage? For example, if a rock is thrown from outside and breaks the window, it wouldn't be the tenant's fault. But if the tenant spills something that stains the carpet, then it may be (though even this might be a gray area if the carpets were so old as to be due for replacement anyway).\n\nWhen a tenant moves out, what prevents the landlord from breaking something himself and claiming it was the tenant; or putting a bunch of garbage into the house, claiming the tenant left it, and charging for the delivery to the dump? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A tenant can only be held liable for any damage that is caused during the course of the tenancy if not pre\\-existing (marked by notation in your lease, or photos upon move\\-in). If *you* cause damage you must pay reasonable cost to rectify the damage. I feel comfortable saying that as a rule, landlords are not typically piling trash in the house or breaking things to get your deposit. Logically, they'd still have to have the trash removed and fix any damages, even if they use your deposit, so there is not a whole lot to gain by doing that. Landlords tend to not want their properties damaged; they want the unit re\\-rented. Typically, compared to the monthly value of the unit, your deposit is small in comparison. I have heard people argue this type of thing in court and they inevitably lose.\n\nLandlords, however, cannot act arbitrarily in keeping your deposit. This just means they must be reasonable in what they keep, if anything. If there is a hole or two from nails, they cannot charge to re\\-paint. However, if you trash the walls or if you paint a wall hot pink, they can. If a neignbor kid breaks the window, you'd need to notify the landlord before the day you move out, and take actions to mitigate the damage (ie. speak to the parents of the kid, file a police report, or whatever else supports you landlord in getting it paid for by a third\\-party).\"Reasonable\" generally means that unless you caused damage to the apartment and you abide(d) by the terms of your rental agreement/lease, your landlord must refund your deposit along with interest from the day you moved in. \n\nKeep in mind, if you have a contract, that instrument will direct the terms of what you must do to ensure your deposit is returned. If you don't have a writing, local housing laws will dictate the terms of a tenancy\\-at\\-will. With these, the same rules apply to your deposit, except there are not special conditions except those set by the law, and you can move anytime with 30 days notice from the last paid rent. Otherwise, your rental term will determine when you can leave with no loss of deposit or other financial damages.\n\nSo long as you proceed both during tenancy and upon departure, in keeping with your agreement (which is controlling so long as it is in keeping with the laws), you are entitled to a full refund \\- usually in at maximum of 30 days, or earlier if your lease/agreement sets it out as such. Many landlords will return the deposit after the move\\-out walk through if you've completed the entire term of your lease and owe no back rent or late fees. Walkthrough is integral to getting your deposit back; be sure to take photos. \n\nIf you do have a lease and regardless, you leave early, there will be an early abandonment/termination fee \\- even with prior notice. The fee for this will usually be either a lump sum, or the amount due under the lease had you stayed; if you owe early termination fees your deposit can be kept to help fulfill this amount potentially due. If you have a pet, there may be a non\\-refundable pet deposit; some leases have a non\\-refundable cleaning fee regardless of pets; some require you leave the apartment broom\\-swept and generally clean; some leases charge storage or trash removal for anything left behind. No matter what happens, when your tenancy ends, you should walk through the apartment with your landlord, whereby he he goes through it with you and afterward he signs a statement that you walked through together and there were either no damages\\-or if there are, that they're determined and agreed to at that time. If there is one that you disagree on, mark it as such and try to negotiate how much you'll be charged for it, or if you can fix it yourself. If you cannot agree, he can keep the cost of fixing it, and then your only recourse is to sue to have it returned.\n\nIf your landlord keeps any portion of your deposit, he *must* send an itemized record of what what kept and *why*, and the costs for *each damage* individually itemized. With that, he must return any reminder.\nhere are things that a landlord can never do. Your deposit cannot be kept \"unreasonably\". It would be *unreasonable* to withhold any portion of your deposit if you've not damaged anything and owe no financial reparations. It would be unreasonable if you owe no money. \n\nThere are things that a landlord can never do so as not to keep your deposit \"unreasonably\". It would be *unreasonable* to withhold any portion of your deposit if you've not damaged anything and owe no financial reparations. It would be unreasonable if you owe no money on the lease. A landlord cannot use your deposit to refresh the apartment or for normal wear and tear that occurs under normal use and care. So, for example, if you live there for 5 years you cannot be charged for carpet or paint because it would've been worn with normal careful use \\- whereas, if those items are in bad shape and you moved in only only one year prior (assuming both were new or in great condition), well then your deposit could be used for those damages. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, if you can prove it (or any portion of it) was kept intentionally wrongfully (even if they just couldn't afford it) you can get treble damages (3x what is owed). But, you must show that you ou were due the money back and notice either wasn't given to keep it, or it misrepresented the damages \\- either way, that your money was not returned. The notice to keep any portion must come within the timeframe set out by agreement or housing law in your area.",

Could such a precent be used as a defense in conjunction with this agreement (\"They signed the agreement Your Honor, just like they did with Homer vs. The City of Springfield, 1985\")?\n\nIf it isn't possible, what law(s) prevent it? If it is possible, what would such a contract look like (note, I won't be the one to test this, just curious...)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Absolutely not.\n\n### Lack of authority\n\nLaw enforcement officers do not have the authority to grant immunity from prosecution. The decision to prosecute lies with the district attorney's office. Courts have sometimes held that a promise of immunity by a police officer can make resulting statements inadmissible, but that's it \\-\\- the state is not bound by the police officer's promise to not prosecute, except in *exceptional* cases. They can gather other evidence and prosecute anyway.\n\n### Prospective immunity\n\nThe contract claims to provide immunity against prosecution for *future* crimes. Contracts against public policy are void, and I'm having trouble thinking of something which is more against public policy than a license to commit crimes. *No one* can offer that immunity through contract. In a recent trial of a Boston mob boss, he attempted to claim that a federal prosecutor had given him immunity for any and all future crimes for some time period; the court did not accept that, because a license to break the law is not a valid contract.\n\n### Public authority\n\nThere is a situation in which certain officers can grant authority to break certain laws: to catch bigger criminals. However, for fairly obvious reasons, there are *extremely* strict rules on when this is valid, both on the government procedure side and the claiming\\-the\\-defense side. The defense can only work if the defendant *honestly* believed the government had authorized his actions, if the government actually *had* authorized them, or if he followed official government legal advice. In this case, the defendant has no idea if government officials have agreed to the terms; he would have approximately no chance of convincing anyone he legitimately thought that the government approved of his actions. They certainly wouldn't be actually properly authorized, and he hasn't sought advice from the government.\n\n### Other issues\n\nPolice aren't the only people on this site. An investigation tends to involve one or more non\\-government agents who provide testimony in court. No contract with a private party can stop them from testifying in a criminal trial; certain *relationships* mean testimony isn't allowed (e.g. a lawyer can't testify about dealings with their client without client permission), but regular users could be required to testify against the site operator (possibly on the basis of *actual* immunity).\n\n### Sources\n\nPublic authority stuff: [this Justice Department page](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-2055-public-authority-defense), plus some discussion in [this order](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371/pdf/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371-7.pdf). \n\nProspective immunity: [that same order](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371/pdf/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371-7.pdf).\n\nLack of authority: myriad readings.",

As with common law torts, the usual remedy for constitutional torts is monetary damages.\n\n```\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/constitutional_tort\n\n```\n\nWhile I think the definition is comparing \u00a7\u202f1983 with \u201cBivens actions.\u201d Are there specific laws regarding Bivens? It's not clear to me *why* there is such a distinction. I have followed the obvious links. Can anyone supply further reading regarding the range of torts that might fall under Bivens?\n\nI gather assault by the FBI would fall under Bivens. But my research would be for other non\\-violent torts.\n\nDoes Bivens require that racial discrimination be alleged? Would doing so (without having specific proof when filing) be an advantage? I am assuming a relevant racial difference exists to support an allegation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> It's not clear to me why there is such a distinction.\n\nSimple answer: [\u00a7\u202f1983 is restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan_Act#Section_1_(42_USC_%C2%A7_1983)) to acts by agents of US *States*. [Bivens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivens_v._Six_Unknown_Named_Agents) was added by SCOTUS as a sort of parallel remedy for the roughly analogous deeds of US *federal* agents.\n\nIf you need some kind of external validation for this basic claim: [https://uslawessentials.com/2014111what\\-are\\-the\\-differences\\-between\\-a\\-bivens\\-action\\-and\\-a\\-42\\-usc\\-1983/](https://uslawessentials.com/2014111what-are-the-differences-between-a-bivens-action-and-a-42-usc-1983/)\n\n> Does Bivens require that racial discrimination be alleged?\n\nNo. It's been \"extended\" \"in 1979 for gender discrimination and in 1980 for cruel and unusual punishment\". (It's also been restricted to not apply to Guantanamo.)\n\n> Would doing so (without having specific proof when filing) be an advantage? I am assuming a relevant racial difference exists to support an allegation.\n\nSeparate question. But roughly: if the complaint is not based on anything remotely factual it is easily dismissed early on. For the rest you may want to read about (evidence) [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)).",

This distinction arose because \u00a7 1983 was specifically restricted to acts by agents of U.S. states, and the Supreme Court later established Bivens as a parallel remedy for similar actions by federal agents. Option A is incorrect as it reverses the roles. Option B is incorrect as neither action requires racial discrimination to be alleged. Option C, while partially true, does not capture the key distinction based on the level of government involved."

And if I have, should I?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US Fifth Amendment right to silence has multiple consequences, one being that the police cannot beat a confession out of you, you cannot be compelled to testify against yourself, and if you refuse to testify, your refusal cannot be considered as evidence of your guilt. There is a related right (the Miranda right), that when arrested, police must inform you of your right to silence and an attorney.\nOn the topic of silence being held against you, that aspect of 5th Amendment rights does not exist in England and Wales, but it remains in Scotland. In fact, in the US there is a kind of \"exception\" to the rule that silence cannot be held against you, in the form of \"adoptive admissions\", where your failure to deny an accusation can be introduced as evidence against you in trial (you can overcome this exception by explicitly invoking your right to silence). The right to silence is generally recognized in common law jurisdictions, but is not historically part of inquisitorial systems (but has spread to such systems in the modern era). Even within common law jurisdictions, the foundation of this right varies. It is encoded in the US Constitution, but is not a constitutional right in Australia. Under French law, a suspect being questioned by a judge during an investigation must be informed of his right to silence, and at trial he can be compelled to testify, but he is free to say whatever he wants, including telling lies.\n\nAs for Indonesia, Ch. VI of the [Law of Criminal Procedure](http://defensewiki.ibj.org/images/6/62/Indonesia_Law_of_Criminal_Procedure.pdf) covers any supposed right to silence: Art 66 says that \"A suspect or an accused shall not bear the burden of proof\". However, Article 175 says \"If the accused declines to answer or refuses to answer a question addressed to him, the head judge at trial shall suggest that he answer and thereafter the examination shall be continued\". See also [this article](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/72000/asa210052006en.pdf) by Amnesty International which concludes that there is no formal right to silence in Indonesian law, and there is an obligation to answer questions.",

According to the information provided, Indonesia does not have a formal right to silence equivalent to the US Fifth Amendment. The Law of Criminal Procedure in Indonesia actually obligates suspects to answer questions during legal proceedings. Article 175 states that if an accused refuses to answer, the judge shall suggest that they answer and the examination will continue. Additionally, an Amnesty International report concludes that there is no formal right to silence in Indonesian law and there is an obligation to answer questions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Indonesia does not have a constitutional right to silence similar to the US Fifth Amendment. \n\nOption C is incorrect because Indonesia's approach to the right to silence is not stronger than the US; in fact, it's considerably weaker or non-existent.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while it's true that in England and Wales silence can be held against the accused, this is not the case in Indonesia. The Indonesian system simply doesn't recognize a formal right to silence, rather than allowing silence to be used as evidence against the accused."

The determination of liability then reduces to general principles of liability and negligence, which are very fact\\-centric. An example of a scenario where the driver is not at fault is when the driver is driving down the lane at an appropriate speed and a pedestrian leaps into the lane from behind a parked car (is obscured by the car) right in front of the car. The question that the courts would ask is whether the driver was using ordinary caution (watching for pedestrians or cars backing out), and could have reasonably stopped. See [People v. McLachlan](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2d/36/supp754.html), where some pedestrians had crossed the roadway and then the\n\n> pedestrians suddenly leaped backward to the west, directly in front of\n> defendant's car, which was then 20 feet from them\n\nand he hit them.

Even in a marked crosswalk on the roadway (where the driver bears all of the duty of care), there are scenarios where a hyper\\-cautious driver could not avoid hitting a pedestrian. See [Schmitt v. Henderson](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/1/460.html):\n\n> We do not declare that in no circumstances is a pedestrian crossing a\n> street under a duty to be alert to danger approaching him from behind\n\nciting the general rule\n\n> A pedestrian using a crosswalk in obedience to the signals placed\n> there for the government of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic is\n> entitled to rely upon others' obeying the law *until something occurs\n> which would place him on notice as a person of ordinary prudence that\n> the law is being or is about to be violated by another to his danger*",

He advised me to accomplish as much as I can myself before officially retaining him.\n\n> 1. **To the maximum extent as permissible under law**, the Landlord shall not be liable to the\n> Tenant, its employees, licensees or invitees in respect of any claim, loss (including but not\n> limited to loss of profits), damage or injury to person or property sustained by the Tenant\n> or any such other person caused by or through or in any way owing to:\n\n> (i) the adequacy or inadequacy of or any defect in or breakdown, failure, malfunction or\n> suspension of the lifts, escalators, fire services equipment, security, airconditioning\n> system or other facilities of the Building or the electricity, gas or\n> water supply or other building services provided to the Premises, the Building or the\n> Development; or\n\n> (ii) typhoon or other adverse weather condition or fire or the overflow or leakage or influx\n> of water including rain, storm or sea water or water of any other nature or other\n> substances from or into anywhere within the Building or the Premises or the escape of\n> fumes, smoke, fire or to activity of termites, cockroaches, pests, rats, mice or other\n> vermin in the Building or any part(s) thereof; or\n\n> (iii) the adequacy or inadequacy or otherwise of or any defect in any of the management\n> services (including security) rendered by the Landlord and/or the Building Manager or\n> the failure to render the same or the suspension or interruption thereof for whatever\n> reason; or\n\n> (iv) the closure of shopping mall of the Building or any part thereof by reason of any war,\n> hostilities (whether war be declared or not), invasion, act of foreign enemies,\n> revolution, insurrection, or military or usurped power, order or direction of any\n> Authority, riot, commotion, social unrest, strikes, industrial action, lock outs or\n> disorder, or threats of terrorism, or pandemic, or any other contingencies which, in\n> the opinion of the Landlord, may cause or threaten to cause damage or injury to the\n> Premises or the Building or any part thereof or injury or death of person;\n\n> (v) the letting or leasing of any part of the Building and the Development (except the\n> Premises) to any other party for any purpose whatsoever or any acts, omissions, neglect\n> or default of any other tenants, licensees or occupiers of or of any accident in the\n> Building and the Development.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, such clauses are precise and common.\n\nThe landlord wants to say: \u201cwe're not liable for anything\u201d. Unfortunately for them, they can't say that because the law might still recognize some liability.\n\nSo this construction achieves the next best thing: to the *maximum extent possible*, they will not be liable.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? If you want to sue them because you think they were liable for something, you won't be able to do that successfully \u2013 unless you can point to a liability they cannot disclaim. Yes, this might not always be entirely clear but that's why there are courts.\n\nOn to your concrete objections:\n\n> Firstly, it wrongly assumes that the \"law\" on exclusion clauses is settled and certain. Perhaps the case law is uncertain. Or there may not even be law.\n\nWhich is why this construction says: we don't know where precisely the maximum is, but whatever the maximum is: we want it.\n\n> Secondly, it wrongly assumes that \"the maximum extent\" can be handily identified. Perhaps Landlord and I disagree on what \"the maximum extent\" is.\n\nEither you can convince the landlord that they are liable and can settle this out of court. Or you go to court. Then, your opinion doesn't matter, only the court's judgement.\n\n> Thirdly, the \"law\" can change. Then what's \"the maximum extent\" or \"law\"?\n\nThis construction avoids this problem because it does not fix a certain list of liabilities that are included or excluded. Instead, it will disclaim maximum liability at any relevant point in time, which will likely be the time of the event giving rise to liability. If new laws are passed, they won't generally apply retroactively. However, new case law could update the interpretation of existing laws.\n\nWhat can you do? This is a business negotiation. You want that the landlord fulfils their duties, and they don't want to be on the hook if something bad happens. In particular, they don't want to be forced to pay for any missed profits or such. Maybe the clauses could be modified to ask for reasonable effort on the part of the landlord to mitigate certain events, in particular with regards to security.\n\nBut in reality: you will have to get insurance to cover the cases you are concerned about. And some risks are just business risks.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner is negotiating a commercial lease with a landlord in England. The lease contains a clause that states \"To the maximum extent as permissible under law, the Landlord shall not be liable...\" followed by a list of specific situations. The business owner is concerned about the vagueness of this clause. Which of the following best describes the legal implications and practical advice regarding this situation?\n\nA) The clause is too vague to be enforceable and should be entirely removed from the contract.\n\nB) The business owner should insist on a detailed list of specific liabilities that the landlord will accept, replacing the current clause.\n\nC) The clause is legally sound and common practice, but the business owner should negotiate for the landlord to exercise reasonable efforts in certain areas, particularly security.\n\nD) The business owner should refuse to sign the lease unless the landlord agrees to accept full liability for all potential issues mentioned in the clause.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The clause \"To the maximum extent as permissible under law\" is a common and legally sound construction in commercial leases. It allows the landlord to limit their liability to the fullest extent allowed by law, without having to specify exact limits that might change over time. While the business owner's concerns about vagueness are understandable, the clause is not inherently problematic from a legal standpoint.\n\nThe correct approach (C) acknowledges that such clauses are standard practice while suggesting a practical compromise. By negotiating for the landlord to exercise reasonable efforts in certain areas, particularly security, the business owner can potentially improve their position without demanding unrealistic changes to the standard form contract.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they suggest more drastic changes that are unlikely to be accepted and may not be necessary. Option D is unrealistic, as landlords are unlikely to accept full liability for all issues, and insisting on this could jeopardize the lease negotiation.\n\nThe advice to obtain insurance to cover concerns and recognize some risks as inherent to business operations is also prudent, as reflected in the correct answer."

Each of those concepts can become quite involved and complex. Fortunately, in the circumstances of the present case, it is neither necessary for me to seek to explain all their refinements to you, nor for you to understand all of those refinements.\n> \n> \n> However, to give you but the broadest of examples: if you were to buy, say, an expensive diamond from a jeweller, assuming that it was legally \\[his/hers] to sell to you in the first place, then, the moment you took physical delivery of it you would own it, have the control of it, and be in possession of it.\n> \n> \n> If, however, you proceeded to place it in a bank security box for safe keeping, you would, for some legal purposes anyway, cease to possess it, although you would still own it and be in control of it. If a robber broke into the bank and took your diamond, the robber would then be in possession of it, even though you would, in law, continue to be its owner.\n> \n> \n> When I direct you that the property must belong to someone other than the accused, all that is required is that, at the time of the taking, **it must be owned, controlled or possessed** by someone other than the accused.

The scenario describes a situation where Bob takes an item from Alice's possession without her consent, even though neither of them owns the item yet. In common law, larceny doesn't require outright ownership, but can apply to items under someone's control or possession. Alice had possession and control of the toilet paper in her cart, making Bob's action fit the definition of common law larceny.\n\nA) Petty theft is incorrect because it's a modern statutory term, while the question is best answered using common law concepts.\n\nB) Conversion typically involves a more permanent deprivation of property rights, which isn't clearly established in this brief interaction.\n\nD) Trespassing to chattels usually involves interfering with someone's personal property without taking it, which doesn't fully capture the act of removing the item from Alice's cart."

Do I have an analogous general Constitutional right to pay for and obtain other kinds of medical care despite local statutes or are my rights limited to abortion?**\n\nSo, the landmark US Supreme Court case *Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973\\)* found that there was a Constitutional right to abortion under many situations even if apparently banned by state law. In other words, many state abortion laws are unconstitutional.\n\nIs abortion the *only* medical procedure that people in the US currently have a Constitutional right to, or are there other medical procedures or interventions that are similarly protected under the US Constitution? If other medical procedures are protected, what principles apply to determine *which* interventions are Constitutionally protected and which are within the police power of states to ban or allow at their discretion?\n\nFor example, suppose Maine passes laws banning laser eye surgery, appendectomies, skin grafts, and all forms of addiction therapy. Is there precedent to indicate whether these laws would necessarily be Constitutionally infirm under the principles upholding Roe v. Wade?\n\nIn other words, is abortion exceptional among medical procedures in being Constitutionally protected or is there a general Constitutional right to reasonable health care despite statutes attempting to restrict it?\n\nRestated, I know that I have a Constitutional right to an abortion. Do I also have Constitutional rights to open\\-heart surgery, tumor removal, and Cognitive\\-Behavioral Therapy, or are my Constitutional health care rights limited to abortion only?\n\nThis is *not* an abortion debate thread. Please keep all answers within the scope of *present* Constituional law and principles, regardless of what might or might not happen later this year.\n\nTo be clear (and addressing user253751's comment), I am *omitting provider willingness and patient ability to pay from this question*. So (hypothetical), my doctor is willing to perform laser eye surgery, I am able to pay, but state law makes all eye surgery a felony. Is this law Constitutional?\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nIt is interesting that access to abortions is Constitutionally protected while access to medical cannabis is, apparently, not, even though both qualify as health care and are controversial enough to have been banned by statutes in more than one jurisdiction. What's the principle that determines why abortions are protected but cannabis is not?\n\nuser6726's mention of the right to refuse vaccines is the opposite of what I am asking. I'm asking more about the right to *receive* a vaccine despite the legislature or the executive saying I'm not allowed to. If I want the vaccine, I can find a provider willing and able to give it to me, and I can pay, do I have a liberty interest in getting the vaccine despite local law saying that the vaccine is only for small children?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, the most wide\\-spread proscription against a medical treatment (broadly construed) is that only 10 of 50 states allow physician\\-assisted suicide. In [Washington v. Glucksberg](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/702/) (one of the states that subsequently made such suicides legal), SCOTUS affirms that such a law does not violate the Due Process Clause. Given a historical analysis, the court concludes that an \"asserted 'right' to assistance in committing suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause\". O'Connor in her concurring opinion further states that \"There is no dispute that dying patients in Washington and New York can obtain palliative care, even when doing so would hasten their deaths\", but this falls short of a ruling that a person has a protected liberty interest in seeking medical care.\n\n[Cruzan v. Director](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/497/261/) affirms that \"\\[a] competent person has a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in refusing unwanted medical treatment\" (also noting that \"informed consent\" may derive from common law or specific state constitutions). Reciting prior reasoning on Due Process and medical treatment and referring to Jacobson v. Massachusetts (smallpox case), they note that \"the Court balanced an individual's liberty interest in declining an unwanted smallpox vaccine against the State's interest in preventing disease\". There seems to be a dearth of cases affirming a protected liberty interest in *seeking* a particular medical procedure.\n\nWere the court to announce a fundamental right to seek some medical treatment, that right could still be subordinated to the states compelling interest in preventing some harm associated with a medical procedure, with legal review being carried out under a strict scrutiny standard.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that Congress *does* limit access to drugs and devices, hence there is no constitutionally\\-protected right to take LSD as a treatment for mental problems. To the extent that a procedure relies on a (not\\-yet approved) device, that device must be approved by the FDA.",

The Supreme Court has not recognized a broad constitutional right to seek any medical treatment. However, certain medical decisions have been protected under the Due Process Clause. For example, Roe v. Wade established a right to abortion in certain circumstances, and Cruzan v. Director affirmed a liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no blanket constitutional guarantee for seeking any medical treatment.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the constitutional protection for abortion does not automatically extend to all other medical procedures.\n\nOption D is overly broad and incorrect. While states have significant authority to regulate medical procedures, this authority is not unrestricted. Constitutional principles, such as due process, can limit state power in this area.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the nuanced approach taken by U.S. courts, recognizing some protected medical decisions without establishing a universal right to all forms of medical treatment."

The plant's total electricity consumption is 150-200 kW continuously, meaning it never feeds power back into the public grid.

According to the interpretation of \u00a77(1) KWK-G and related EEG regulations, a system only qualifies for subsidies if it actually feeds power into the public grid. In this case, the CHP unit produces less power than the plant consumes, so no electricity is ever fed back to the grid. This classifies the plant as a self-producer (Eigenerzeuger) under the old EEG \u00a761e, which explicitly stated that self-producers who consume all their generated power are not eligible for the feed-in tariff. Even under current regulations, \"Einspeisung\" specifically refers to feeding power into the public grid, which this plant does not do. Therefore, it would be classified as a self-producer with no grid feed-in, making it ineligible for the subsidies described in \u00a77(1) KWK-G."

It seems like it shouldn't be (after all, you're not trying to hurt anybody, being neglectful, or doing illegal stuff), but law can be weird sometimes.\n\n**Is Homicide by Misadventure illegal?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> \u201chomicide by misadventure.\" . . . is when somebody accidentally\n> kills somebody else while engaged in a legal activity and without any\n> intent to cause harm.\n\nThere is a criminal offense sometimes called negligent homicide, and sometimes called [involuntary manslaughter](https://lawshelf.com/coursewarecontentview/involuntary-manslaughter) (in some jurisdictions this is limited to, for example, vehicular homicide and homicide caused with a deadly weapon or involving a child or vulnerable adult).\n\nWhere this offense is present, it requires a level of intent of at least \"criminal negligence\" which is roughly equivalent to \"gross negligence\" in civil lawsuits and is almost, but not quite recklessness.\n\nBut if the conduct causing the death involves merely ordinary negligence at a level providing a basis for a civil action for negligence, or only involves acts which unforeseeably cause death despite the fact that the person carrying out the act used the care of a reasonable person under the circumstances (in which case there is a basis for a civil lawsuit only in the rare circumstances where there is strict liability), this is not a crime.\n\nSometimes, however, the conduct involved may violate some other law (e.g. speeding or hunting after having already reached one's game kill limit) that is a lesser crime, even though it is not a homicide crime.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A hunter, John, is legally hunting during deer season with a valid license. He fires his rifle at what he believes to be a deer, but the bullet ricochets off a rock and accidentally kills another hunter, Mike, who was wearing camouflage. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's legal situation?\n\nA) John is guilty of involuntary manslaughter because he caused a death while engaged in a dangerous activity.\n\nB) John is not criminally liable as this is a clear case of homicide by misadventure with no criminal negligence involved.\n\nC) John is guilty of negligent homicide due to his failure to properly identify his target before shooting.\n\nD) John's legal liability depends on the specific jurisdiction and whether his actions meet the threshold of criminal negligence in that area.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of homicide by misadventure and the nuances of criminal negligence. Option A is incorrect because legal hunting isn't inherently considered a dangerous activity, and involuntary manslaughter typically requires a higher degree of negligence. Option B is incorrect because while this could be considered homicide by misadventure, that doesn't automatically preclude criminal liability. Option C is incorrect because negligent homicide requires more than just ordinary negligence; it typically requires criminal or gross negligence. Option D is correct because the legal outcome would indeed depend on the specific jurisdiction and whether John's actions meet that jurisdiction's definition of criminal negligence. Some areas might consider failing to properly identify a target as criminally negligent in a hunting context, while others might not. The question highlights the complexity of such cases and the importance of jurisdictional differences in criminal law."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I served as juror on a civil case last month. We've reached our verdict. After a month, I got a call from the losing party asking me to sign a declaration stating the facts about how we've reached our verdict and that I was involved and assisted with the calculations of the amount of compensation that the winning party was seeking. I believe they're going to file a motion. My question is, what does it mean with me signing the declaration? Is there a possibility of me getting involved again with the case? Will I be called to come in and explain? Can I let them know that I'm not comfortable signing it and they should reach out to other jury member? I was surprised that they reached out to me but I guess they got my number from the court.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can't say what it means for you personally, but there are some general rules around treating jurors as witnesses that you could learn about. They vary from one jurisdiction to the next, but most of them run largely parallel.\n\nOne important consideration is [Model Rule 3\\.5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/ethics/aba/current/ABA_CODE.HTM#Rule_3.5), which prohibits a lawyer from contacting a juror if:\n\n> (1\\) the communication is prohibited by law or court order;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the juror has made known to the lawyer a desire not to communicate; or\n> \n> \n> (3\\) the communication involves misrepresentation, coercion, duress or harassment.\n\nAssuming there is contact, [Evidence Rule 606(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_606) says that testimony from a juror is generally not admissible when it's about the jury's deliberations. There are some exceptions:\n\n> A juror may testify about whether:\n> \n> \n> (A) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention;\n> \n> \n> (B) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or\n> \n> \n> (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.\n\nGenerally speaking, courts seem to be very reluctant to entertain a losing party's attempt to revive litigation based on what happened in the jury room, so they seem to take a very narrow view of what it takes to meet one of those exceptions:\n\n* \"Extraneous prejudicial information\" is more likely to refer to a juror knowing that the defendant in a car crash case was a child molester, rather than a juror previously owning the same kind of car and knowing that it has a weird blind spot that could cause the accident.\n* \"An outside influence\" is more likely to refer to someone trying to bribe or threaten a juror, rather than a juror's husband pressuring him to wrap up deliberations and get home.\n* \"A mistake in entering the verdict on the verdict form,\" for instance, is more likely to involve circling \"yes\" instead of \"no,\" rather than a mathematical error in calculating the damages awarded to a plaintiff.\n\nSo unless something went seriously wrong, it seems unlikely that a juror would be called back into court to discuss anything that happened behind closed doors.\n\nThese rules, though, govern only whether the attorney may reach out and whether the juror's testimony may be admitted into court; they don't really say anything about whether a juror should be talking to the lawyer in the first place. On that question, the decision is the juror's. Generally speaking, the juror is not required to keep deliberations secret, but the juror is not required to answer questions about deliberations, either. A juror who believes that some injustice occurred in the deliberations may very well want to answer questions from the lawyer, or even reach out to the lawyer or the court herself.\n\nBut a juror who is confident that everything went right, or who thinks the losing party is just trying to escape liability, or who just wants to be left alone, may refuse to answer questions, sign statements, or otherwise reveal anything that happened. If that's the case, and the juror clearly tells the lawyer that he or she does not want to communicate about the case, the lawyer should leave the juror alone, or run the risk of serious trouble with the court in the event the juror lets the judge know about it.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A lawyer for the losing party in a civil case contacts a juror after the verdict, requesting them to sign a declaration about the jury's deliberations. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the juror's obligations and the admissibility of their testimony?\n\nA) The juror is legally required to sign the declaration and may be subpoenaed to testify about all aspects of the jury's deliberations.\n\nB) The juror can refuse to communicate with the lawyer, but if they choose to testify, their testimony about the deliberations will be fully admissible in court.\n\nC) The juror is free to refuse communication, and even if they agree to testify, their testimony about deliberations will generally be inadmissible except in specific circumstances outlined in Evidence Rule 606(b).\n\nD) The juror must report the lawyer's contact to the court immediately, as any post-verdict communication between lawyers and jurors is strictly prohibited.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, jurors are not obligated to communicate with lawyers after a verdict. Model Rule 3.5 prohibits lawyers from contacting jurors who have expressed a desire not to communicate. Furthermore, Evidence Rule 606(b) generally makes juror testimony about deliberations inadmissible, with limited exceptions for extraneous prejudicial information, improper outside influence, or mistakes in entering the verdict form. Option A is incorrect because jurors are not required to sign declarations or testify about deliberations. Option B is wrong because it overstates the admissibility of juror testimony. Option D is incorrect because while there are restrictions on lawyer-juror communications, they are not entirely prohibited, and immediate reporting to the court is not a requirement."

In the County Court, High Court, and Court of Appeal (Civil Division), the governing law is found in the [Civil Procedure Rules](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules). A good starting point is [Part 44](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs) (general rules about costs) and in particular Rule 44\\.2 which provides:\n\n> (1\\) The court has discretion as to \u2013\n> \n> \n> (a) whether costs are payable by one party to another;\n> \n> \n> (b) the amount of those costs; and\n> \n> \n> (c) when they are to be paid.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) If the court decides to make an order about costs \u2013\n> \n> \n> (a) the general rule is that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to\n> pay the costs of the successful party; but\n> \n> \n> (b) the court may make a different order.\n\nWhether or not you can recover costs (and how much) depends on many factors. See for example [Rule 44\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#rule44.4) which lists (among others) the following factors:\n\n* Whether the costs are proportionate.\n* Whether the costs are reasonably incurred.\n* Whether the costs are reasonable in amount.\n* The conduct of the parties including efforts made to settle.\n* The value of the case.\n* The importance of the matter to the parties.\n* The complexity of the case.\n* Time spent on the case.\n\nSettlement negotiations can also have specific cost implications, particularly if the formal [Part 36](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part36) procedure is followed:\n\n* [Rule 36\\.13](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part36#36.13) provides that a claimant can generally recover costs up to the point at which a Part 36 offer is accepted.\n* [Rule 36\\.17](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part36#36.17) provides for cost consequences for a party who refuses a Part 36 offer and subsequently fails to achieve a better outcome in the proceedings.\n\nNote that it is fairly common to be unable to recover *all* your costs even if you obtain a costs order in your favour.\n\nFor some types of case, you will generally be unable to recover costs at all, or only very limited costs. This applies to e.g. a case allocated to the Small Claims Track, pursuant to [Rule 27\\.14](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part27#27.14) and also to many types of Tribunal cases.\n\nQuestions asking for specific legal advice are off\\-topic on this site. If you want to understand the cost implications for your specific scenario, your best bet would be to find a solicitor who will provide an initial free consultation, and then raise the issue of costs during that consultation. Be warned however that you will be unlikely to be given a definitive answer on whether you will recover costs, for the reasons set out above.",

According to the Civil Procedure Rules, particularly Rule 44.2, the court has discretion in awarding costs. While there is a general rule that the unsuccessful party pays the costs of the successful party, the court may make a different order. The court considers various factors listed in Rule 44.4, including the conduct of parties, complexity of the case, proportionality of costs, and efforts made to settle. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because winning the case does not automatically result in full cost recovery. Answer B is wrong as the court does have discretion and is not bound by strict guidelines based solely on success. Answer D is incorrect because cost recovery is not guaranteed in all civil cases; for example, cases in the Small Claims Track generally do not allow for cost recovery except in very limited circumstances."

In a nutshell,\n\n> The VCS came into existence as a sovereign nation in 1929 with the signing of the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy. The signing effectively ended the \u201cRoman Question,\u201d the decades old tension between the Catholic Church and the nation of Italy. Prior to the treaty, the relationship between the Church and the country was governed by the Law of Papal Guarantees, an Italian law that allowed the Pope a certain amount of autonomy within the borders of Italy.\n> \n> \n> The Lateran Treaty consisted of three separate documents spread over twenty\\-seven articles and four annexes: an agreement acknowledging the Vatican as an independent state, also known as the Treaty of Conciliation; a concordat on church state relations between the city state and Italy; and a financial convention liquidating the financial claims of the Holy See against Italy. In signing the treaty, Italy ceded 108\\.7 acres of Rome to the Holy See, thus creating the world\u2019s smallest sovereign nation. At the signing, Pope Pius XI was represented by Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, papal secretary of state, while King Emanuel III was represented by Benito Mussolini, prime minister of Italy. The Lateran Treaty was incorporated into the Italian Constitution sixteen years later in 1947\\.\n> \n> \n> . . .\n> \n> \n> On the same day that the Lateran Treaty was signed, the VCS adopted a constitution in the form of six constitutional (or fundamental) laws: Fundamental Law of the City of the Vatican; Law of the Source of Laws; Law on the Rights of Citizenship and Sojourn; Law on Administrative Organization; Law on Economic, Commercial, and Professional Organization; and Law of Public Security. Under the second of these laws, the sources of VCS law were comprised of the Codex Iuris Canonici (Canon Law Code), and \u201c\\[t]he laws promulgated for the City of the Vatican by the Sovereign Pontiff or by any other authority delegated by him, as well as the regulations lawfully issued by the competent authority.\u201d Article 3 of this law also allowed for the use of Italian law as well as provincial and municipal Roman law when they did not conflict with canon law, the rules of the Lateran Treaty (and, later, the 1984 Concordat), or divine law.\n\n**The role of the Pope**\n\n> The VCS is a unique entity in that the state\u2019s monarch is also the spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic Church throughout the world. As the elected absolute temporal monarch of the state, the Pope has full legislative, executive, and judicial authority over the jurisdiction. The Pope delegates most of this authority to a variety of organs within the Vatican City, all of whose members may be appointed or removed at the discretion of the Pope. The powers and duties of these various organs are described in detail later in this article.\n\nIn other words, everybody answers to the Pope. He may not oversee this particular case, but he theoretically could. More specifically, though,\n\n> The judicial system of the VCS is organized as follows: a sole judge (Giudice Unico) presiding over a court of limited jurisdiction; a three\\-judge Tribunal (Tribunale); a four\\-member Court of Appeals (Corte d\u2019Appello); and, finally, the Supreme Court of Appeals (Corte di Cassazione). It is important to distinguish these judicial organs from those of the Roman Curia, which is the administrative arm of the Holy See. Cases from temporal VCS courts are not generally reported, but a listing of the types of cases tried before each of the courts is published in L\u2019Attivita della Santa Sede, the annual yearbook.",

Cryprus](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-57834) and [Pay v United Kingdom](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&id=001-88690&filename=001-88690.pdf), and am confused regarding the interaction of Article 8 private life \\& Article 10 freedom of expression.\n\nIn Modinos v Cyprus, it was held that criminalising homosexual relations is a violation of Article 8 of the ECHR. Meanwhile, in Pay v UK, it is suggested that publishing images of sexual acts may mean that the activity is not part of one's private life.\n\nWhat happens, however, when someone\u2019s expression (protected by article 10\\) leads to a lack of protection under article 8, resulting in criminalisation?\n\nFor example: Suppose a state criminalises homosexual activity.\nExpressing support for \\& educating regarding homosexual activity is protected by Article 10\\. Homosexual activity itself is protected by Article 8\\. \n\nWhat happens if one both engages in homosexual activity and publicly documents their engagement for advocacy purposes? Are they left without protection as a result of their free expression rendering their activity outside of the scope of private life? Or does Article 10 freedom of expression protect them from prosecution arising as a result of their speech, despite the underlying crime being actual homosexual activity (rather than speech), which is only prosecutable as a result of their otherwise\\-protected speech?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In *MODINOS v. CYPRUS* it was held that the mere existence of a law on the books criminalizing male homosexual conduct was a violation of article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and Article 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus. This finding was made although no prosecutions under such a law had been carried out in some years, and the policy of the Attorney\\-General of Cyprus was that there should be no such prosecutions.\n\nNote at the time of this case Mr Modinos held the position of 'President of the \"Liberation Movement of Homosexuals in Cyprus\"', so his sexual preferences were not exactly secret \\-\\- this being one reason he was fearful of future prosecution under the Cyprus law.\n\nThis publicity did not deprive him of he protection of ECHR article 8 or of the Cyprus Constitution article 15, both of which protect \"private life\". It would seem that ECHR article 8 is not being interpreted as a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, where publicity to one's sexual prefernces or acts would void its protection.\n\nThus it would seem, under that case, that publication of texts or images making a person's sexual activities or preferences clear would not deprive them of protection as an element of \"private life\". Whether actually having sex in public would be subject to prosecution I do not speculate.",

The Modinos v. Cyprus case established that criminalizing homosexual relations violates Article 8, and that public knowledge of one's sexual orientation does not negate this protection. Publishing a book about personal experiences, including private sexual encounters, would likely be considered both an expression of private life (Article 8) and freedom of expression (Article 10).\n\nOption A is likely not protected as it involves public sexual activity, which goes beyond the scope of private life.\n\nOption C, while potentially protected under Article 10, might be considered too public to fall under Article 8's protection of private life.\n\nOption D, while clearly protected under Article 10, does not directly involve the person's private life and thus may not invoke Article 8 protection."

Options A and B are incorrect because they overstate the likelihood of success in challenging the law, especially without legal representation. Option D is not mentioned in the given information and is likely not a valid way to bypass the legal requirement."

I would perhaps call it \"non\\- subject dependent circumstances\". But then the question could in some cases, does such exist? A challenge should be e.g. the difficulty/impossibility of displaying that someone is biased, because there's no objective instrument for it. And if it's a human judging it, then it cannot be unbiased.\n\nFor example, the particular wording in relation to discrimination in the Batson example there seems like it suggests that \"an objective observer would treat people equally\" or that \"it is unfair (to treat people unequally)\", which are biases themselves. Thus possibly lending to the idea that \"objective observer\" may be utilized for \"our bias, which we claim objective\".\n\n---\n\nRelated:\n\nMachine\\-learning jury\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The objective observer is not a [real person](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_on_the_Clapham_omnibus)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShe is one of a number of imaginary people who are used in law to inform judges and jurors how they should intellectually engage with a legal issue. We may not know or be a reasonable person or an objective observer but we know the characteristics they would have if they existed. The legal usage is not to prove a person is or isn\u2019t an objective observer, it\u2019s to establish the standard they would apply if they were.\n\nIt\u2019s worth quoting Lord Reed from *Healthcare at Home Limited v. The Common Services Agency* \\[2014] UKSC 49 at [1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_on_the_Clapham_omnibus)\\-\\[4]:\n\n> 1. The Clapham omnibus has many passengers. The most venerable is the reasonable man, who was born during the reign of Victoria but remains in vigorous health. Amongst the other passengers are the right\\-thinking member of society, familiar from the law of defamation, the officious bystander, the reasonable parent, the reasonable landlord, and **the fair\\-minded and informed observer**, all of whom have had season tickets for many years.\n> 2. The horse\\-drawn bus between Knightsbridge and Clapham, which Lord Bowen is thought to have had in mind, was real enough. But its most famous passenger, and the others I have mentioned, are [legal fictions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_fiction). **They belong to an intellectual tradition of defining a legal standard by reference to a hypothetical person**, which stretches back to the creation by Roman jurists of the figure of the bonus paterfamilias...\n> 3. It follows from the nature of the reasonable man, as a means of describing a standard applied by the court, that it would be misconceived for a party to seek to lead evidence from actual passengers on the Clapham omnibus as to how they would have acted in a given situation or what they would have foreseen, to establish how the reasonable man would have acted or what he would have foreseen. **Even if the party offered to prove that his witnesses were reasonable men, the evidence would be beside the point.** **The behaviour of the reasonable man is not established by the evidence of witnesses, but by the application of a legal standard by the court.** The court may require to be informed by evidence of circumstances which bear on its application of the standard of the reasonable man in any particular case; but it is then for the court to determine the outcome, in those circumstances, of applying that impersonal standard.\n> 4. In recent times, some additional passengers from the European Union have boarded the Clapham omnibus. This appeal is concerned with one of them: the reasonably well\\-informed and normally diligent tenderer.\n\nThe particular objective observer required in Washington jury selection has these characteristics:\n\n> \u2026 an objective observer is aware that implicit, institutional, and unconscious biases, in addition to purposeful discrimination, have resulted in the unfair exclusion of potential jurors in Washington State.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that you or I may not hold that view, the hypothetical objective observer **does** an therefore:\n\n> If the court determines that an objective observer could view race or ethnicity as a\n> factor in the use of the peremptory challenge, then the peremptory challenge shall be denied.\n\nSo, when the judge considers the challenge they have to view it in the light \u201cthat implicit, institutional, and unconscious biases, in addition to purposeful discrimination, have resulted in the unfair exclusion of potential jurors\u201d whether they believe that or not. If a person who held that view \u201ccould\u201d view the challenge as factoring in race or ethnicity then it must be denied.\n\nThis long\\-standing legal tradition is founded in human psychology: we\u2019re actually really good at imagining what other people will do if we make the effort. The hypothetical person is an idealised individual who doesn\u2019t have to worry about money, or children or what the neighbours think. By making an effort to think like they would diverse real humans can actually produce amazingly consistent responses.",

The relocation agreement, which specifies repayment if the employee leaves within 18 months, serves as this authorization. As the employee is leaving after 14 months, which is within the agreed 18-month period, the employer can legally withhold the relocation fee from the final paycheck. The law allows this withholding to resolve a debt or obligation to the employer, which this repayment represents. Options A and D are incorrect because withholding is permitted in this case. Option B is wrong because new authorization is not required if the original agreement is still in effect."

The phrase \"be and the same is\" serves to prevent any potential misinterpretation that might arise from using only the subjunctive mood (\"be changed\"), which could be seen as expressing a wish rather than enacting a change.

The specific situation that this character is in is that for all intents and purposes they have no prior history as a person, they will not be found in any government data base or on the internet. What they have going for them is a very wealthy benefactor, extensive physical trauma to the brain, and following their getting an identity this character will be comming into money due to the benefactor.\n\nSo far, I've looked at applying for asylum and outright buying citizenship in a country.\n\nEdit: To clarify the situation and add an alternate question. This character is a stateless person, would citizenship be needed to do business, have a bank account, etc?\n\nFor the first, this would stem from her feigning amnesia, knowing her name and how to do things but little else. It is enough for a search to be made and not find anyone matching her. To assist this she would have two gunshot wounds to the head that on a CT would confirm that she suffered extensive brain damage and survived it. So her claim isn't unreasonable. There are however issues assosciated with the plot that I would have to work around.\n\nThe second option I looked at is approaching countries where citizenship could be bought, such as in the case of Malta and others. However, I believe that the conventional \"buy citizenship in X country with an investment\" would require prior documentation, a background check, and you wouldnt just be allowed to get creative while filling in your information. For this I am entirely uncertain if a larger \"investment\" into said country would be sufficient for them to overlook the character having no prior documentation.\n\nUltimately this is Fiction, so there can be flexability and suspension of disbelief can be stretched a bit or the details left a bit ambiguous, however, I believe being grounded in realism is important to the immersion of the story. With that said, I'm looking for options from those more well versed in legal matters than me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main documents\\* needed to overcome money laundering regulations etc when opening a bank account are a passport and/or driving licence. Both have multiple anti\\-counterfeit safeguards so gone are the days of creating your own, and master forgers are the remit of organised crime groups.\n\nBy far the easiest way is to get a *Fraudulently Obtained Genuine Identity* (FOG\\-ID). Your character could find someone of a similar age who has never had a passport or licence and use their details to apply for them with her own photograph \\- colloquially called \"cukooing\". This means she would have the cuckoo's name and address and, depending on her moral compass and propensity to violence, she made need to \"remove\" the risk that someone could find out and expose her.\n\nNote that in [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\"), under the [Identity Documents Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/40/section/4?timeline=false), she may face up to 10 years' imprisonment for the unlawful possession of these documents.\n\nAlso, you could consider bribery and corruption. It's a fairly common trope that a corrupt government official can do almost anything by logging on to a computer but, to me, this stretches the realism too far as there are so many checks and balances and different people involved to be believable without the even more unbelievable conspiracy \"that goes all the way to the top\".\n\n\\*A National Insurance / Social Security Number would be helpful but not necessary if your character isn't on planning on seeking employment or state benefits \\- which I assume is the case if she is going to come in to a big pile of money.",

Additionally, the claim of amnesia might lead to extensive investigations that could complicate the plot.\n\nB) Purchasing citizenship through investment typically requires prior documentation and background checks, which the character lacks. It's unlikely that even a larger investment would allow for complete bypassing of these requirements.\n\nC) This is the most realistic option given the information provided. Obtaining a FOG-ID by using the details of someone who has never had a passport or license would provide the character with genuine documents that can pass anti-counterfeiting measures. This method would allow the character to open bank accounts and conduct business, although it carries legal risks.\n\nD) While this is a common trope in fiction, it stretches credibility too far given the numerous checks and balances in place in most government systems.

They would be either component, chassis, or whole vehicle scans.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most cars have a design that is protected by a [design patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_patent). The elements of that design are protected for the duration of the patent. In the U.S., design patents are valid for 14 years from the date of issue if filed prior to May 13, 2015, or 15 years from the date of issue if filed on or after May 13, 2015\\.\n\nSome components of the styling of a design may also be protected by trademarks, for example, the \"brand badge\", and the intellectual property rights in the trademarks would survive the expiration of the design patent indefinitely, so long as the trademark remains in force.\n\nThere is an argument that in addition to the design patent, that there would be a copyright protection for the design. Some objects, such as the Statue of Liberty were the subject of both a design patent and a copyright, back in the days when copyrights were fairly short lived. I haven't seen any modern case law concerning what copyright rights, if any, survive the expiration of a design patent under modern copyright law, and I don't know whether residual copyright protections are available under modern law for designs covered by expired design patents.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to sell high-quality 3D scans of modern vehicles and their components through an online marketplace. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this business model?\n\nA) This business model is completely legal as long as the scans are of high quality and accurately represent the vehicles.\n\nB) The business would only be legal if it exclusively scans vehicles that are over 15 years old.\n\nC) The business model is likely illegal due to design patent protections, and potentially trademark and copyright issues.\n\nD) The business would be legal if they obtain permission from vehicle manufacturers, but only for components, not whole vehicles.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. This business model is likely illegal due to several intellectual property protections:\n\n1. Design patents: Most modern vehicles are protected by design patents, which last for 14 or 15 years depending on when they were filed. Selling 3D scans of these designs would infringe on these patents.\n\n2. Trademarks: Certain elements of vehicle designs, such as brand badges, are protected by trademarks. These protections can last indefinitely as long as the trademark remains in force.\n\n3. Potential copyright issues: While not definitively stated in the provided information, there's a possibility that some aspects of vehicle designs could be protected by copyright, which would extend beyond the life of the design patent.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it doesn't consider any intellectual property issues. Answer B is partially correct in recognizing the time-limited nature of some protections, but it oversimplifies the issue and doesn't account for trademarks or potential copyright protections. Answer D is incorrect because while obtaining permission could potentially make the business legal, it's not limited to just components, and permission alone might not cover all intellectual property concerns."

The couple wanted to sign a contract saying that the resulting child would be legally theirs and he wouldn't file for child support etc. The individual claims he informed the couple that in his state there is already legal precedent that states these sort of contracts are unenforceable as void, but since the couple was insistent on signing the contract anyways he eventually agreed to do so, even while telling them it was not legally binding.\n\nHe claims he was sued for \"fraudulent contract activities\" (his exact words). Supposedly because he admitted he knew the contract was meaningless he was now guilty of fraud by signing it. However, he gained no benefit from the contract, as the same scenario would have happened exactly as it is without a contract, and he claims he clearly explained the contract was worthless. I find it odd that he could be charged with anything under such a situation. He makes it sound like this is a criminal charge, as opposed to some sort of civil case, and he says the judge chose to 'charge' him.\n\nAgain, common law, and contract in particular, has always seemed to apply common sense so I was a little skeptical. Of course the individual making the claim also has a history of questionable truthhoods as well, and is making claims that further his personal agenda, so I'm not quite willing to take his words as 100% true.\n\nWould this scenario warrant any kind of potential fraud charges, civil or criminal? The individual in question lives in Oklahoma so probably that's where the contract was signed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does signing a contract after explaining it was not legally binding\n>  count as contract fraud?\n\nNo. However, depending on the details of the contract, the circumstances, and the parties' subsequent conduct, the donor's ability to prove he actually disclosed it to the couple would strengthen his position.\n\nThe *prima facie* elements of fraud are listed in [*Key Finance, Inc. v. Koon*, 371 P.3d 1133, 1137 (2015\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/inokco20160427772):\n\n> (1\\) a material misrepresentation; (2\\) known to be false at the time\n>  made; (3\\) made with specific intent that a party would rely on it; and\n>  (4\\) reliance and resulting damage.\n\nThe donor's disclaimer to the couple \"*telling them \\[the contract] was not legally binding*\" strikes elements (1\\) and (2\\). That preempts the relevance of (3\\). No matter how bizarre it is that the donor eventually bowed to the couple's pressure, that does not change the fact that elements (1\\) and (2\\) are stricken.\n\nYour description does not reflect whether or how the couple incurred any losses, but the requirement of the couple's *reliance* is preempted by virtue of the donor's disclaimer. Furthermore, the donor's \"*history of questionable truthhoods*\" can only weaken the couple's position of \"reasonable\" reliance on any representation the donor makes (in case the couple shared back then your concept of donor's reliability).\n\nThe donor's questionable assertions \"*\\[to] further his personal agenda*\" seems to be irrelevant in this matter because, as you say, \"*he gained no benefit from the contract*\". Also, it is unclear from your description whether or not the donor has been sued/charged at all. The donor's mere allegation that he was sued has no legal effect \\-\\-such as defamation or malicious prosecution\\-\\- unless one adds intricate assumptions into this matter.\n\nAs for \"*he says the judge chose to 'charge' him*\", it is possible that he was charged for something else and he is (whether unintentionally or on purpose) mischaracterizing whatever proceedings in which he was involved.\n\nThe sole act of signing that contract upon proper disclaimer **does not** render the donor liable for fraud.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential fraud charges?\n\nA) The donor could be charged with criminal fraud for knowingly signing an unenforceable contract.\n\nB) The donor could face civil fraud charges if the couple suffered financial losses as a result of relying on the contract.\n\nC) The donor cannot be charged with fraud because he disclosed that the contract was not legally binding before signing.\n\nD) The donor would be liable for fraud only if he received financial benefit from signing the contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the donor cannot be charged with fraud because he clearly disclosed to the couple that the contract was not legally binding before signing it. This disclosure negates the first two elements of fraud in Oklahoma: a material misrepresentation and knowledge of falsehood. Even if the couple insisted on signing, the donor's prior disclosure prevents them from reasonably relying on the contract, which is another key element of fraud. \n\nOption A is incorrect because criminal fraud typically requires intent to deceive, which is absent here due to the donor's disclosure. \n\nOption B is incorrect because even if the couple suffered losses, they cannot claim reasonable reliance on the contract after being informed of its unenforceability. \n\nOption D is incorrect because while financial benefit can be a factor in fraud cases, it's not a necessary element, and the absence of benefit alone doesn't prevent fraud charges."

If the contract provides means for sustained survival on Mars for a significant period, even if eventual death is certain due to limited resources, it would be more analogous to a one-way ticket to a harsh but survivable destination on Earth.

They would stop at particular locations, and hold court together with the local judge of a district court as a two\\-judge court. Appeals from district court decisions were heard. Some were passed along to the full Supreme Court, particularly ones in which the Justice did not agree with the judge.\n\nEach Justice had a route, or \"circuit\" which that Justice covered once or twice a year on horseback (or by carriage) spending half or more of his time \"riding circuit\". The process was quite onerous, and was by far the larger part of the work of a Justice. It allowed decisions to be reviewed by a Supreme Court member at places physically closer to the original trials, and served as a filter on cases to be decided by the full court.\n\nThis practice was derived from the older English practice of having ***Justices in Iter*** (later known as circuit judges) who traveled through the country, judging cases that had been held awaiting their arrival. (The word \"Iter\" is related to \"Itinerary\", the list of places one is scheduled to visit.)\n\n*The Marshall Court and Cultural Change, 1815\\-1835* by G. Edward White (ISBN 978\\-0195070590\\) includes a detailed description of the process of circuit riding during the period of 1815\\-1835, and the way in which proceeding in the circuit courts influenced constitutional jurisprudence and how cases came to the Supreme Court. I recommend this extensive book for better understanding of the origins of many features of the US Judicial system.\n\nSome years after the US Civil war the Circuit Courts officially became the Courts of Appeals and Supreme Court justices stopped \"riding circuit\", but the geographical divisions continued to be called \"circuits\", and each circuit is still supervised by a single Justice, who rules on \"emergency\" applications, often for stays of judgement, or for injunctions.\n\nThe division of the US court system into circuits thus is due as much to historical inertia as to careful design, although an alternate design that was an improvement would not be easy to create.",

The circuit court system in the United States originated from the practice of Supreme Court Justices \"riding circuit.\" This involved Justices traveling to different locations across the country, where they would hold court together with local district court judges. This practice allowed for appeals to be heard closer to where the original trials took place and served as a filter for cases that might eventually reach the full Supreme Court.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the circuit system was not designed to create intentional legal disparities.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the official Courts of Appeals were established after the Civil War, the circuit system predated this and evolved from the earlier practice of circuit riding.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the U.S. system was influenced by the British practice of \"Justices in Iter,\" it was not directly imported without modifications.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I developed a chat app. I wanted to develop a good chat app and wanted a perspective from users. But I kind of stepped over the line and asked users of competing app for feedback. I went to their public group chat room on the app and asked users questions on how that app could be improved. I got various feedback about how they should have a 'like' button, GIF, threading, and etc. I decided to add a like button and comment section for social posting. I asked questions to users several times for two weeks. Then the developer of the app intervened and asked me not to do that. Even though the feedback was given in the public chat room and feedback was a good idea but not a game\\-changer, could this be an example of misappropriation due to the fact the info was obtained from their app? Could the developer also accuse me of unfair competition to Apple?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is not \"unfair competition\". You are allowed to ask people for their views and take them into account in designing software, even with the specific intent that it compete successfully with existing software. In the US you have a protected right to do that under the First Amendment.\n\nIf the chat site where you asked is run by the developer or owners of the app, they can ask you to avoid such question there, and even ban you from the site if they choose, because it is their site. But if you went onto a public site (like Stack Exchange, say, or Quora) the app owners would have no right to insist that you not ask for such opinions.\n\nThe degree to which the design or interface of an app or other software may be protected against imitation is a complex one, and depends on the country involved. But widely known and used features such as a 'like' button, message threading, or a comment section are almost surely not protectable. Listening to users of existing simile products and getting their ideas on what works well and what is lacking is generally a good idea, and is in no way \"unfair\".",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates a new chat application and seeks user feedback to improve it. They visit a public chat room of a competing app and ask users about potential improvements. The developer implements some of the suggested features, including a 'like' button and comment section. The competing app's developer asks them to stop seeking feedback in this manner. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The developer's actions constitute clear misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition.\n\nB) The developer can be sued for copyright infringement for implementing features suggested by users of the competing app.\n\nC) The developer's actions are protected under the First Amendment and do not constitute unfair competition, but they can be banned from the competing app's chat room.\n\nD) The developer must immediately remove all features suggested by users of the competing app to avoid legal consequences.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The developer's actions of seeking user feedback, even from users of a competing app, are protected under the First Amendment in the US and do not constitute unfair competition. Implementing common features like a 'like' button or comment section based on user suggestions is generally not protectable. However, if the chat room where feedback was sought is owned or operated by the competing app's developer, they have the right to ask the developer to stop seeking feedback there and can even ban them from the site. The other options are incorrect because: A) misrepresents the situation as misappropriation and unfair competition, which it is not; B) incorrectly suggests copyright infringement for implementing common features; and D) unnecessarily suggests removing features, which is not required legally in this scenario."

I misunderstood that a country can have multiple legal systems since its stated that my country (India) has a mixed legal system\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I understand that by \"civil law systems\" the OP means to refer to civil (vs criminal) cases, not to the civil law (vs common law) systems.\n\nThe standard for proof of \"guilt\" (which is not actually called \"guilt\") is indeed \"much lower\" in civil cases, but the reason for that is not that it has to be so, but that the standard of proof in criminal cases *has* to be much higher.\n\nIn civil cases none of the parties face criminal conviction. One party will just lose some money or property, will have to perform some work, will lose some opportunities etc. So, initially, both parties play the same game and each of them is in to lose it down to a similar level of peril.\n\nWhat follows is that, at the baseline, neither of the two parties should be in more advantageous position to prove their rightness than the other. In other words, if any of them proves that they are more than 50% likely to be right than the other, they should win.\n\nIndeed, why would one party have to prove their rightness beyond reasonable doubt?

In civil cases, the standard of proof is indeed lower than in criminal cases, typically based on a \"preponderance of evidence\" or \"more likely than not\" (over 50% likelihood). This is because civil cases involve disputes between parties where the outcomes usually result in financial or property-related consequences, rather than criminal penalties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the stakes may often be lower in civil cases, this is not the primary reason for the different standard of proof. The higher standard in criminal cases is necessitated by the potential loss of liberty and other severe consequences.\n\nOption B is false. The right against self-incrimination is available in both civil and criminal cases if testifying would risk criminal prosecution for the witness.\n\nOption C is incorrect. The \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard is specific to criminal cases and is not applied in civil matters, where a lower threshold of proof is sufficient.\n\nOption D correctly captures both the lower standard of proof in civil cases and the fact that protections against self-incrimination are still maintained, making it the most accurate statement among the options provided."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Background context\n------------------\n\nDate rape is said to occur when one person uses drugs to incapacitate another person and then engages in sexual intercourse without their consent.\n\nIt is generally understood that using pharmaceutical drugs to incapacitate someone for the purpose of sexual assault is a clear\\-cut case of date rape. However, what about the use of more common benign substances like alcohol? Can alcohol be considered a date\\-rape drug in certain situations?\n\nQuestion about this\n-------------------\n\n1. How does the law treat alcohol in cases of date rape? Is it treated in the same way as other pharmaceutical drugs, or is it handled differently?\n2. What happens in cases where both parties were under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of a sexual encounter, and the victim accuses the perpetrator of sexual assault?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [canada](/questions/tagged/canada \"show questions tagged 'canada'\")\n\nIn Canada, there are the separate offences of:\n\n* sexual assault (premised on lack of consent, no matter by what means consent is lacking; *R. v. G.F.*, [2021 SCC 20](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18884/index.do)) and\n* administering a stupefying substance.\n\nIf someone were to use a \"substance such as everyday alcohol\" (I would reject the premise that this is \"benign\") for the purpose of facilitating sexual assault, this would be an offence under [s. 246 of the *Criminal Code*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-35.html#docCont). Section 246 makes it an offence for a person, \"with intent to enable or assist himself or another person to commit an indictable offence\" to administer or cause any person to take a \"stupefying or overpowering drug, matter, or thing.\"\n\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario has accepted that the element of administering a stupefying thing could be established by oversupply of alcohol. They have said that alcohol is a \"stupefying substance\" (*R. v. Vant*, [2015 ONCA 481](https://canlii.ca/t/gjrjd)) and can support a conviction under s. 246\\.\n\n---\n\n\"Date rape\" has no legal significance and even criminologically, misframes the circumstances in which people experience sexual assualt. Further, your premise that intimate partner sexual assault \"usually happens when someone uses narcotics to drug another into an unconscious state\" is not supported by the evidence. While this is a criminological point, rather than a legal point, it is important context for understanding such crimes. This [2005 study](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/212000.pdf) estimated that 4\\.6% of intimate partner sexual assaults were facilitated by surreptitious drug use. These two fact sheets describe the variety of circumstances, completely unrelated to incapacitation by drugs, in which people experience intimate partner sexual assault/violence: [Fredericton Sexual Assault Crisis Centre Info Sheet](https://www.gnb.ca/0012/Womens-Issues/PDF/Fact%20Sheet-E2.pdf); [Centre for Research \\& Education on Violence Against Women \\& Children Backgrounder on Intimate Partner Sexual Violence](https://www.vawlearningnetwork.ca/our-work/issuebased_newsletters/issue-17/index.html).",

According to the information provided, in Canada, administering alcohol with the intent to facilitate sexual assault can be prosecuted under Section 246 of the Criminal Code. The Court of Appeal for Ontario has accepted that alcohol is a \"stupefying substance\" and that oversupply of alcohol could establish the element of administering a stupefying thing under this section.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Canadian courts have accepted alcohol as a \"stupefying substance.\"\nOption B is false because alcohol alone, without pharmaceutical drugs, can be considered in cases of sexual assault.\nOption D is incorrect because \"date rape\" has no specific legal significance in Canadian law.\n\nThis question tests understanding of how Canadian law treats alcohol in sexual assault cases, particularly its classification as a potential \"stupefying substance\" under certain circumstances."

For example, the other week my Father\\-in\\-law made a new doorway in the fenced storage area under the deck in our back yard, which I was not consulted about. I have tried discussing it with them on several occasions, but my protests seem to be falling on deaf ears.\n\nSo, I am wondering if I have any legal options to prevent them from unilaterally making modifications to the house?

But, if push comes to shove and the 'diplomatic' approach fails, I am thinking that a court summons or some type of official court order might have a 'wake up and smell the coffee' effect of showing them that I am dead serious about asserting and defending any legal rights that I (may) have, as a joint owner.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I jointly own a house, along with my wife and her parents\n> \n> \n> could I apply for a court injunction to prevent them making modifications without my express consent?\n\nImagine you were the only owner of the house but had split personality. Once in a while something would switch in your mind making you try to modify/sell/demolish the house. When it happens, a close friend would talk you back into your normal state. Scared of what you could have done, you apply for a court injunction to prevent *yourself* making modifications etc. to the house.

The analogy of split personality illustrates that seeking court intervention against oneself (or co-owners in this case) is not a viable legal option. The court would likely reject such an application unless there were issues of legal capacity. This implies that co-owners must resolve disputes internally, as they are considered a unified legal entity in property ownership matters.

John can file a police report in good faith without exposing himself to liability. However, the police are unlikely to pursue this as a criminal matter because breaking a contract is generally not considered a crime. It's important to note that while John may feel that Mark has \"stolen\" the money by not repaying it, this situation is typically treated as a civil matter rather than a criminal one. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because not repaying a loan is not automatically considered theft in a legal sense. \n\nAnswer B is too absolute; while it's true that this is likely to be treated as a civil matter, John is not prohibited from filing a police report if he genuinely believes a crime has occurred.\n\nAnswer D touches on an important point \u2013 if John had evidence that Mark never intended to repay the loan, it could potentially be considered fraud.

While passing the trial period does provide some job security, it does not make an employee immune to dismissal. \n\nOption A represents a clear case of professional misconduct and incompetence, which are valid grounds for dismissal under personal reasons. Consistently failing to perform work for the majority of the workday (6 out of 8 hours) would significantly impact the execution of work and could be considered a failure to fulfill job responsibilities.\n\nOptions B and C, while not ideal behaviors, are less severe and may not constitute \"real and serious grounds\" for dismissal on their own, especially if the employee is still completing their work satisfactorily.\n\nOption D describes an employee who is fulfilling their job responsibilities, and excessive socializing alone is unlikely to be grounds for dismissal unless it severely impacts productivity or creates a toxic work environment.\n\nTherefore, option A is the most likely scenario to justify fair dismissal under French labor law."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a California consumer arbitration, the business has been serially disqualifying arbitrators, causing significant delays. The consumer has already petitioned the court to appoint an arbitrator under CCP \u00a7 1281.6, and the court has appointed one. What is the consumer's best course of action if the business attempts to disqualify this court-appointed arbitrator?\n\nA) The consumer should immediately file a lawsuit in court, as the business's actions constitute an automatic waiver of the arbitration agreement.\n\nB) The consumer should wait for the business to disqualify the arbitrator, then petition the court to appoint another one.\n\nC) The consumer should object to the disqualification, arguing that the business has already exhausted its right to disqualify one court-appointed arbitrator without cause.\n\nD) The consumer should agree to the disqualification and propose a new arbitrator of their choosing.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to CCP \u00a7 1281.91, a party has the right to disqualify only one court-appointed arbitrator without cause in any single arbitration. After that, they may petition to disqualify subsequent appointees only upon a showing of cause. Therefore, if the business has already disqualified one court-appointed arbitrator without cause, they cannot do so again for subsequent court appointments without demonstrating a valid reason. The consumer's best course of action is to object to the disqualification, citing this legal limitation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the business's actions do not automatically constitute a waiver of the arbitration agreement. As noted in Lerner v. Masterson, waiver is not to be lightly inferred and requires substantial, unreasonable delay despite the claimant's own reasonable diligence.\n\nOption B is not the best course of action because it allows the business to continue delaying the process unnecessarily.\n\nOption D is not advisable because it unnecessarily prolongs the arbitrator selection process and may give the business an opportunity to object to the consumer's choice."

According to the provided information, the site owner would likely be immune from civil action based on users' conduct due to Section 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency Act. This act protects interactive computer service providers from being treated as the publisher or speaker of information provided by users.\n\nHowever, individual users could still be held liable for their actions.

The company's email went to great lengths to communicate the confidential nature of their agreement to reimburse my money, which they say (unverifiable) is a\\-typical of them. \n\nThey also included the data privacy regulations (which in essence says that they will retain the email correspondence as part of their data unless I tell them not to in 30 days).\n\nAs I am not a citizen or resident of the EU or Spain, is any such disclaimer of confidentiality binding on my part? I have agreed to let them return my money, but didn't sign any document giving away my rights regarding this agreement.\n\nIs there any risk to me sharing the nature of this communication with whom I choose?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a risk\n---------------\n\nThat is to say, you would (almost certainly) be breaking Spanish law and the law where you live (whichever actually applies) to the extent that the company could sue you and win if they chose to do so.\n\nReading between the lines, you ordered a service which they delivered and you paid for and which you say was delivered \u201cpoor\u201d. I will make an educated guess that there were some ToS provided by them which means with near certainty:\n\n1. The contract is almost certainly subject to Spanish law plus any non\\-excludable consumer protection laws of your country (assuming that is where the service was delivered)\n2. You aren\u2019t entitled to a refund, at least, not a full refund. A full refund is only a legal requirement when they have *totally* failed to provide their consideration (the service) under the contract.\n\nIt is clear that you and the company had a dispute over the contract. Whatever the legal merit of your position, the company made you an offer to settle this dispute. This offer was conditional on you keeping it confidential. In accepting their offer you accepted their condition and formed a new contract that includes a condition of confidentiality. If you break that condition you can be sued for breach of contract.\n\nNotwithstanding, even if you had rejected their offer, the fact that they made it was confidential and communicated to you in a way that informed you of its confidential nature. In a common law country, breaching this would be a tort: I don\u2019t know enough about Spanish law to know if they have equivalent provisions.\n\nTake the money and keep your mouth shut.\n\nThe data protection provisions have nothing to do with the offer, they relate to retention of personal information \\- they can keep the email indefinitely as it relates to a business transaction.",

By accepting the reimbursement offer, which was communicated as confidential, the customer has likely entered into a new contract that includes a confidentiality condition. Even without signing a separate document, accepting the offer and its conditions forms a new agreement. Breaching this confidentiality could result in legal action under Spanish law or the law of the customer's country. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the legal implications of the agreement are not nullified by the customer's non-EU status. Option B is incorrect as explicit signing is not always necessary to form a binding agreement. Option D is incorrect because the data privacy regulations are separate from and do not override the confidentiality of the reimbursement agreement."

Would delivering the code under an MIT license achieve this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes\n---\n\nAny non\\-exclusive license would allow this. However, I would strongly advise against the use of the MIT license for such a purpose. That license allows anyone to reuse or sell the software without further approval by you or payment to you. This is not what you want as as a contractor/consultant doing professional, custom contract. Moreover that license includes a prominent statement that:\n\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\nSuch a waiver of warranties and other liability probably conflicts with other terms of a consulting contract. Even if it does not, such a disclaimer is not likely to be looked on positively by the client.\nIn fact no open source contract is really appropriate for this kind of project, in my view.\n\nInstead such a contract should use a simple license that grants the client non\\-exclusive rights, either indefinitely (or for the tem of copyright), or for a specific limited term, possibly with a renewal fee after the end of that term. It shuld prohibit the client from selling or giving away copiers of the software, except as part of the sale of the client's business pr business unit. It should allow the client to make as many copies as are needed for the contemplated use of the software.\n\nThe software should include, and probably display, a copyright notice.\n\nIt would be wise to put the license in writing.\n\nIt would be even wiser to have a written consulting contract that specifies, clearly, that:\n\n1. You own and retain the copyright on all work done for the employer, that none of it is work\\-made\\-for\\-hire, nor is the copyright in any other way transferred to the client/employer.\n2. The employer will receive only a non\\-exclusive license to any software created under the contract.\n3. You anticipate reusing the software, or parts of it, in contracts with other clients.\n\nNote that the client (employer) may have given you confidential information for use in customizing the software specifically for the client. If so, the client may reasonably demand that you agree that any code or other software including such confidential information or trade secrets shall not be provided to anyone else without the client's permission. Such a provision should also be in writing, and should specify clearly what information is confidential, or how confidential information is to be marked or indicated. It should be part,of the consulting contrast, or if separate, should be mentioned in that contract.\n\nThe client may demand an exclusive license, if so, this becomes a point of negotiation, along with price and other terms.",

A simple non-exclusive license included in a written consulting contract allows the developer to retain rights for code reuse while also protecting the client's interests. This approach allows for clear terms, including non-exclusivity, duration of the license, and any limitations on code sharing. It also avoids the pitfalls of open-source licenses like MIT, which may be too permissive for custom contract work.\n\nOption A (MIT license) is incorrect because it's too permissive for custom contract work and includes liability waivers that may conflict with consulting terms.\n\nOption C is problematic because verbal agreements are not legally binding and transferring full copyright would prevent the developer from reusing the code.\n\nOption D is incorrect because open-source licenses are generally not suitable for custom contract work and may not provide the necessary protections for both parties."

The website cannot agree to changes they are unaware of, and most TOS include clauses stating that the agreement must be accepted in full, without modifications.

[The ICO says](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/right-of-access/how-should-we-supply-information-to-the-requester/#format) that\n\n> The right of access enables individuals to obtain their personal data rather than giving them a right to see copies of documents containing their personal data.\n\nIt might be valid to interpret the DPA / UKGDPR in a way that the relevant personal data undergoing processing in their system is the *existence* of the letters, but that you are not entitled to a *copy* of the letters. This is in line with the purpose of the right to access, that you can check what data they are processing about you and whether it is correct. If that argument holds and the data subject insists on receiving a copy of the letters, it might be legitimate to charge them a fee for these copies.\n\nBut in practice:\n\n* The data controller might not make this argument and just hand over the copies. It is worth a try.\n* A right to access founded in data protection might not be the only way to receive a copy of these materials. If the letters are relevant for legal proceedings, they could perhaps be requested during the disclosure process.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Bob sent a letter to ACME Inc. regarding potential damages, and ACME Inc. replied. Bob lost both letters and wants to retrieve copies. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Bob's ability to obtain these letters under the Data Protection Act 2018?\n\nA) Bob has an absolute right to receive copies of the letters under the DPA 2018, and ACME Inc. must provide them free of charge.\n\nB) Bob can request the letters under the DPA 2018, but ACME Inc. may argue that they only need to confirm the existence of the letters, not provide copies.\n\nC) The DPA 2018 does not apply to this situation, and Bob has no recourse to obtain the letters.\n\nD) Bob can only obtain copies of the letters through legal disclosure processes if he initiates formal legal proceedings against ACME Inc.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it most accurately reflects the nuanced situation described in the documentation. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) states that the right of access under data protection laws is primarily about obtaining personal data, not necessarily copies of documents. ACME Inc. could argue that confirming the existence of the letters satisfies the data access requirement without providing copies. However, ACME Inc. might still provide the copies if requested, making this the most balanced and accurate response. Options A and C are incorrect as they represent extreme positions not supported by the given information. Option D is not the best answer because while it mentions a valid alternative method to obtain the letters, it ignores the possibility of using the DPA 2018 and is too limiting."

Before you make the purchase, you must also be informed how the content operates with relevant hardware/software (interoperability) and about its functionality, including whether any geographical restrictions apply to the use of the content and if private copies are allowed.\n> \n> \n> You also enjoy the right of withdrawal within 14 days from concluding the contract for online digital content.

Not sure if it's true, but I think it's still quite disproportional with 4% of the worlds population.\n\nWill too many lawyers in a country reduce freedom for the people instead of increasing and securing it? Too many lawyers nitpicking and wasting time and money on unimportant issues that should better be resolved directly between people. Too many lawyers could stifle innovation and creative people doing things differently because they will worry \"is this or that allowed, will I be sued?\". It's a cultural thing. \"See you in court\" is a known American movie phrase that fascinates people around the world who's not used to lawyers being involved \"everywhere\" except for the most extreme cases. American doctors are afraid of being sued or afraid of having a too weak insurance against being sued. The whole health care insurance system is infected with lawyers, maybe even more of them than doctors? Threatening to sue is also many (not so) grown up bullies' favorite weapon of choice when things don't go their way. Will too many lawyers with too few real tasks threaten the freedom of a people instead of securing it? (Of course too few can also be a problem)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: this is probably going to be closed as opinion based, but here is an attempt at perspective.\n\n> Not sure if it's true,\n\nIt's blatantly wrong. There are 1\\.3 million lawyers in the US and there about 2 million lawyers in India alone. There are 180\\+ other countries with lawyers as well, so the claim that US has half of the world's lawyers is ridiculous.\n\nAn easier metric to look it is how many layer's per say, 100,000 people. That's about 400 in the US as compared 380 in Italy, 230 in the UK or 200 in Germany. So it's more in the US but not that much more.\n\nYou also seem to associate \"lawyer\" with lawsuit, crime and conflict. Most lawyers don't do any of this: they write contracts, do negotiations, close real estate, write patents, help you get a green card or write your will etc. They are just offering professional services for day to day administrative and business stuff.\n\nThere is a lot of country to country variation here as well: there are way more real estate lawyers in the US than in Germany: In the US the sale of house is handled by a lawyer, in Germany it's done by a Notary.\n\nI've been living both in the US and in Europe and never noticed a significant difference in every day life.\n\nSo you basically formed a question and hypothesis based on **BAD DATA** and **BAD ASSUMPTIONS**. Movies and TV shows are a TERRIBLE source of information. It's entertainments, not facts and has often nothing to with reality at all. Random quotes on the internet are a TERRIBLE source of information. It's click bates or agenda pushing, but not facts.\n\nFact checking is easy enough to do and stack exchange even has a website for that specific purpose. <https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/> I recommend doing some basic fact checking BEFORE forming your own theories.",

This \"adoptive admission\" was introduced as evidence against him. In order to prevent your silence from being used against you, you must invoke the 5th amendment. There are two exceptions to the rule that you must invoke the 5th to be protected by it. First, a criminal defendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at their own trial. Second, a witness\u2019s failure to invoke the privilege must be excused where governmental coercion makes their forfeiture of the privilege involuntary (Miranda).

The area in red depicts our property while the blue dots indicate a path that pedestrians often take to avoid the dangers of X 1\\-3\\.\n\n* X1 is a telephone pole right on the corner of our property and against a steep 3\\-4ft hillside. Industrial trucks attempting to make the sharp inside turn have (on multiple occasions) hit the telephone pole. It's also worth noting that consumer vehicles tend to drive too fast making that inside turn.\n* X2 is about 2ft between the side of the structure and the roadway.\n* X3 marks about how wide of a swing industrial trucks have while attempting to make that turn.\n\nQuestion\n========\n\nFor years, we've not prevented pedestrians from walking through the yard (without permission) to avoid the dangers of walking along the road around the tight corner of the house. However, with the property being vacant and having recently been broken into... we're needing to add some security cameras that we can monitor remotely and are also questioning liability concerns if people were to injure themselves while walking through our property.\n\n**We've considered 'No Trespassing' signs, but at the same time we don't wish to make the pedestrians walk the more dangerous path.** So...\n\n1. Do 'No Trespassing' signs protect us (the private property owners) from liability if individuals were to get injured on our property?\n2. If yes, would an 'Enter at Your Own Risk' or similar sign provide the private property owners with the same liability protections?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Overview\n--------\n\nThis is a somewhat complex issue. The presence of \"No Trespassing\" signs would make anyone who enters the property without a specific invitation a trespasser. So would the presence of a fence, even if there was a closed but unlocked gate. An \"Enter at your own risk\" sign probably would not make such people legally trespassers.\n\nIn West Virginia, a landowner or lessee or other lawful occupant owes a duty of \"reasonable care\" to invitees and other non\\-trespassers. No such duty is owed to trespassers. However, the owner or lawful occupant is expected to avoid dangerous conditions and reckless hazards, as well as intentional causes of harm (such as booby\\-traps). If through recklessness or serious negligance a dangerous condition exists and a person, even a trespasser, is injured or killed because of such a condition, the owner or lawful occupant is likely to be liable. However, if the danger is \"open and obvious\" or is as well known to the injured person as to the owner or occupant, there is no liability. A warning sign **might** make a danger \"open and obvious\".\n\nI do not see that video cameras will be relevant to the matter at all. Cameras do not warn a pedestrian not to enter, nor do they warn of any danger, nor do they prevent a pedestrian from being injured. They may help in detecting or even preventing crime, but will not affect liability for injury to a pedestrian.\n\nSources\n-------\n\n### West Virginia Code Code Sections\n\n[\u00a761\\-3B\\-3\\. (Trespass on property other than structure or conveyance.)](http://www.wvlegislature.gov/WVcode/ChapterEntire.cfm?chap=61&art=3B&section=3) of the West Virginia Code provides that:\n\n> (a) It is an unlawful trespass for any person to knowingly, and without being authorized, licensed or invited, to enter or remain on any property, other than a structure or conveyance, as to which notice against entering or remaining is either given by actual communication to such person or by posting, fencing or cultivation.\n\n[\u00a755\\-7\\-27\\.

E\\-T Enterprises, Ltd. P\u2019ship.* in which a WVa court abolished the \"open and obvious\" except to liability, imposing dameages for an \"open and obvious\" hazard, specifically an open stair without guardrails. The legislature then amended \u00a755\\-7\\-27\\. (a) to restore the exception.\n\nThe article also reads:\n\n> West Virginia state law requires property owners remove hazards from their property to reduce the risk of these injuries. The expectation is dependent on the type of person that is on the property. Previously, visitors were broken into one of four categories: invitee, licensee, social guest or trespasser. The duty of care owed to the visitor depended on the category under which the visitor qualified. Today, there are only two categories: trespasser and non\\-trespasser. The West Virginia Supreme Court, in *Mallet v. Pickens*, abolished the four categories mentioned above, and held that \u201clandowners or possessors now owe any non\\-trespassing entrant a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe article [\"Property owners may be liable for injuries to trespassers\"](https://www.farmerclinecampbell.com/blog/2017/01/property-owners-may-be-liable-for-injuries-to-trespassers/) from the law firm Farmer, Cline, \\& Campbell reads:\n\n> West Virginia homeowners are not obligated to protect those who trespass upon their property. However, they should be aware that they cannot willfully cause injury to any who do trespass. This law can become an issue for homeowners with frequent trespassers as they may find themselves liable for injuries any people, even the uninvited ones, sustain if their properties are left in an unsafe condition.\n> \n> \n> For example, homeowners and landowners could potentially face lawsuits if they purposefully made their properties unsafe. They may also be held liable if the condition of their properties could cause serious bodily harm or death. Further, landowners can also potentially face legal consequences if they fail to warn potential trespassers that there are hazards on their properties.\n\nThe article [\"Determining Duty in West Virginia Premises Liability Cases\"](https://www.colombolaw.com/west-virginia-blog/determining-duty-in-west-virginia-premises-liability-cases/) from Colombo Law reads:\n\n> Most states use three categories to determine whether a duty is owed to individuals who enter the property of another. These three categories are business invitee, licensee, and trespasser. In the past, West Virginia was one of the many states that followed this standard. However, in 1999 West Virginia abolished and replaced the three specific classifications with a new, more general standard of determining whether the individual is a trespasser or a nnon\\-trespasser\n> \n> \n> * Trespasser. A trespasser is an individual who enters the property of another without the permission of a landowner. An individual will be deemed a trespasser if they do not have either express or implied permission from the owner. In West Virginia, the courts offer little protection to those who are trespassers. As a trespasser, a landowner must only refrain from intentional or reckless conduct.\n> * Non\\-Trespassers. Contrary to trespassers, landowners owe a duty to anyone that is permitted to be on the property. If an individual enters private property with the express or implied permission of a landowner, the landowner must ensure that the premises are reasonably safe for those on the premises. To ensure you are meeting the standard of care, the landowner must inspect the premises to determine whether there are any dangerous conditions present on the property and repair and/or warn individuals of the danger.\n> \n> \n> Premises liability is the legal premise for which landowners are responsible for harm caused by unsafe conditions existing on the landowner\u2019s premises. Premises liability is a broad concept that may be raised for a variety of harms present. One main reason for personal injury actions stemming from premises liability include slip and fall accidents as a result of:\n> \n> \n> * Slippery floors\n> * Uneven sidewalks or pavement\n> * Objects protruding from carpeting , floorboards, or store shelves",

They can't kick you out for being black. They also can't kick you out for being white. But they can kick you out for not liking your face. \n\nNow the question is: Who can kick you out? The store owner obviously can. Anyone who is given the authority by the store owner can. Actually, anyone with the *apparent* authority can kick you out. However, everyone other than the store owner has been hired to work towards making profits. If throwing you out is bad for business, then whoever did it would have to answer to the store owner. \n\nSo the ex\\-friend can't go to court for throwing you out, but they might get into trouble with their boss about it. \n\nPS. I interpreted \"kicking out\" as saying \"Please leave our premises. If you don't leave then you will be trespassing and I will call the police\", not actually kicking the person with your foot which would be most likely assault.",

You say, \u201c**a** user gives and withdraws consent every second\u201d which is clearly stupid because a) a server based solution won\u2019t refresh that quickly, b) your user has nothing better (like sleeping, eating etc.) to do for a year than do this c) who does this? Further, you then apply this to **every** user.\n\nLet\u2019s assume something reasonable: there are 7 billion people in the world, half of them don\u2019t have internet access. Let\u2019s assume you have a wildly successful service and you reach just over half of these or 2 billion and, on average, they opt in and out twice a year so you need 1 kilobyte each (per year) and you keep your data on every user (active or not) for an absurdly long 10 years.

According to the documentation, the sublessee is responsible to the landlord for all obligations under the lease, including any unpaid bills from before their occupancy. This is because their sublease is derivative of the primary lease. If these bills are not paid, the landlord could potentially terminate the primary lease, which would also end the sublease. However, the sublessee has the right to sue the original tenant for any funds they had to pay for charges preceding their lease term. Options A and D are incorrect because the sublessee's responsibility to the landlord is not limited to their occupancy period.

(See [this law.SE question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41948/will-the-equal-rights-amendment-actually-have-an-effect-on-any-existing-statute) for discussion of the ERA's possible effects.)\n\nApproval by 3/4ths of the States would normally be enough to pass a Constitutional Amendment, but [there are apparently two problems](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/politics/equal-rights-amendment-virginia-democrats/index.html):\n\n> Even if Virginia acts as expected next year, there is no guarantee the amendment would take hold. A handful of the states that initially ratified the ERA have since rescinded those decisions and the most recent congressional deadline passed about four decades ago. Despite those roadblocks, activists believe they are well\\-positioned \\-\\- legally and politically \\-\\- to push the amendment, which was written by the suffragist Alice Paul in 1923, over the line.\n\n**1\\. Withdrawn ratifications**\n\nApparently [four states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment#Ratifications_rescinded) (Nebraska, Tennessee, Idaho, Kentucky) have \"rescinded\" their ratifications, after initially approving them, and one state (South Dakota), added a \"sunset\" provision to their ratification if it wasn't approved in whole by the original deadline.\n\nAre these \"take backs\" valid? Could they prevent the Amendment from going into effect? How would this question be adjudicated? Is there any relevant case law on the matter?\n\n**2\\. Congressionally\\-imposed Deadlines**\n\nThe original resolution by the 92nd Congress [included the following preface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment#Congressional_extension_of_ratification_deadline) (emphasis added):\n\n> Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two\\-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three\\-fourths of the several States **within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress**\n\nIn 1978 another resolution was passed, extending the deadline to 1982, although this extension was passed by simple and not 2/3rds majority.\n\nDespite these deadlines, the Amendment was ratified by Nevada in 2017 and Illinois in 2018\\. \n\nAre these post\\-deadline ratifications (and a hypothetical 2020 one from Virginia) valid? \n\nWould Congress simply need to pass a new (future) deadline, and all the past ratifications would take effect? \n\nWikipedia does list some purportedly [relevant case law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment#In_the_courts), can anyone help me understand how these might apply to these questions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The true answer is this is fundamentally unclear and ratification would definitely set up for a Supreme Court showdown.\n\nThe Supreme Court would in my opinion need to resolve 3 issues:\n\n1. Are Congressionally imposed deadlines in resolutions proposing an amendment to the States for ratification binding?\n2. Does a state withdrawal of its ratification of an amendment annul its ratification of the amendment?\n3. Who decides when an amendment is ratified?\n\nFor the first question this is perhaps the most unresolved question. Clearly if the deadline is imposed in the text of the amendment it is binding. For example, see the text of the 18th amendment, Section 3\\.\n\nWhat is not clear is what if any binding effect a deadline in the text of the resolution proposing an amendment has as to the validity of the proposed amendment. Article V makes no provision on such deadlines. In fact the most recent amendment ratified was submitted for ratification on September 25, 1789, but ratified May 5, 1992\\. In this instance the Archivist of the United States declared the amendment ratified, but Congress also acted to do so and several members scolded the Archivist for doing so before Congress acted. However, there was no resolution of who had to actually approve the ratification.\n\nFor the second question there is absolutely no answer to this question except Coleman v. Miller which suggests this is a political question. This essentially means that the question should be resolved by Congress, not the courts.\n\nLastly, for the third question see also my response to the first question. If Congress is indeed the ratifier, what happens if one Congress decides the amendment was not ratified, but a future one decides it was?\n\nHonestly, ratification of the ERA would open a whole can of worms and make it difficult to really resolve this issue. Probably the most direct method to force the Supreme Court to rule on this issue would be someone challenging their requirements to register with the Selective Service System.",

The ERA's ratification status remains legally ambiguous due to several unresolved issues:\n\n1. The binding nature of Congressionally imposed deadlines in amendment resolutions is unclear.\n2. The validity of state rescissions of previous ratifications is disputed.\n3. There's uncertainty about who has the authority to declare an amendment officially ratified.\n\nThese issues have not been definitively settled by the Supreme Court or Congress. While some states have ratified the ERA after the original deadline, and others have attempted to rescind their ratifications, the legal effect of these actions remains uncertain. This situation would likely require Supreme Court intervention to resolve if the ERA were to be declared ratified, potentially through a case challenging Selective Service registration requirements.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the complex legal situation. Option B is too definitive given the existing ambiguities in constitutional law regarding the amendment process."

Bananas are priced at \u00a30\\.50 each. Ben puts the banana on the counter and (a) hands Sam a \u00a31 coin. Sam then puts the coin in the till and (b) gives Ben a 50 pence coin.\n\n**Was the contract made and completed at point (a) or (b)? Or is the time of sale not legally defined so precisely?**\n\nPresumably if it was not made until (b), then Ben might not be entitled to walk away with (or eat) the banana without waiting for change.\n\nBut if it was made at (a), then Ben might not be entitled to change his mind and get his \u00a31 coin back if Sam was out of change and asked him to wait for five minutes.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Neither\n-------\n\nThe contract is *completed* when each party has totally fulfilled its obligations under the contract. In this case, it is when the purchaser has consumed or otherwise dealt with the banana to their satisfaction. The vendor has ongoing obligations under the contract until this happens. For example, obligations that the banana is of merchantable quality and fit for purpose. If the purchaser peels the banana and discovers that it is \"off\" or eats the banana and develops food poisoning then the vendor still has obligations and can be sued under the contract.\n\nYes, I realize that no one is going to sue anyone over a rotten banana but let's assume that \"banana\" is code for 54km of motorway construction and \u00a31 is actually \u00a31 billion.\n\nWhen is the contract *formed*?\n------------------------------\n\nThis is not a trivial determination and there are literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of lawsuits that have turned on this exact question. Once the contract is formed its binding on both parties; until then, either can walk away (subject to [estoppel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estoppel))\n\nThe traditional analysis involves [offer and acceptance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offer_and_acceptance).\n\nIn your banana scenario, the shop displaying \"Banana's: 50p/each\" (it's a fruit shop \\- they always have unnecessary apostrophes) is **not** an offer \\- it is an [invitation to treat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invitation_to_treat). An offer is made by Ben placing the banana on the counter and proffering the \u00a31, it is accepted by Sam taking the \u00a31\\. At this point, the sale is binding on both parties.\n\nBen has fulfilled all his obligations under the contract, Sam still has some. In addition to those discussed above, he owes Ben 50p. Strictly speaking, this is not an obligation under the contract but a debt due and payable.\n\nConsumer protection law\n-----------------------\n\nThe proceeding is a strict contract law interpretation \\- many jurisdictions have consumer protection legislation (and food safety laws for bananas) that impose additional protections and may change the contract law position.",

The shop's display of goods is merely an invitation to treat, not an offer. The buyer makes an offer by placing the item on the counter and proffering payment. The seller accepts this offer by taking the payment. Therefore, the contract is legally formed when the buyer hands over payment to the seller (option C).\n\nOption A is incorrect because picking up an item is not considered an offer or acceptance.\nOption B is incorrect because placing the item on the counter is part of making an offer, but the contract isn't formed until payment is proffered and accepted.\nOption D is incorrect because giving change occurs after the contract has already been formed and is not necessary for contract formation.\n\nIt's important to note that while the contract is formed at this point, it may not be fully completed until all obligations are fulfilled, which could extend beyond the immediate transaction."
