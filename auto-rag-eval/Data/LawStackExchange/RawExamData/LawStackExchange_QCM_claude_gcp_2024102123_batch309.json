        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer made a GDPR data access request to a major UK online retailer on December 12th. The retailer didn't provide the requested data or notify the consumer about a delay within 30 days. On January 11th, the retailer emailed saying the request was being processed. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the consumer's rights and the retailer's obligations under GDPR?\n\nA) The retailer has complied with GDPR requirements as long as they process the request eventually.\n\nB) The consumer can only file a complaint with the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) but cannot seek judicial remedy.\n\nC) The retailer has violated GDPR, and the consumer can both file a complaint with the ICO and seek judicial remedy, but cannot claim compensation for damages.\n\nD) The retailer has violated GDPR, and the consumer can file a complaint with the ICO, seek judicial remedy, and potentially claim compensation for damages, though proving damages may be challenging.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The retailer has indeed violated GDPR by not responding within 30 days or informing the consumer about a delay. According to the GDPR and ICO guidelines, the consumer has multiple options:\n\n1. File a complaint with the ICO or another supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR).\n2. Seek to enforce their rights through a judicial remedy (Art. 79 GDPR).\n3. Request compensation for damages (Art. 82 GDPR), although proving damages, especially non-material ones, can be difficult.\n\nOption D correctly encompasses all these rights while acknowledging the potential challenge in claiming compensation. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as they either misstate the retailer's compliance, limit the consumer's rights, or exclude the possibility of claiming compensation."

It is significantly regulated in most US jurisdictions where it is legal, often requiring a specific license.\n\nAnalyzing laws on this subject in all 50 US states would be beyond the scope of an answer here. This is definitional the sort of thing where consulting a local lawyer, experienced in this area of law, would be wise.\n\nMaryland law\n------------\n\nAs an example I will cite the specific laws which I think woulds apply to the situation described n the question in teh US state oof Maryland.\n\nThe Maryland criminal code [Section 12\\-201](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2010/criminal-law/title-12/subtitle-2/12-201/) provides that:\n\n> In this subtitle, \"lottery device\" means a policy, certificate, or other thing by which a person promises or guarantees that a number, character, ticket, or certificate will, when an event or contingency occurs, entitle the purchaser or holder to receive money, property, or evidence of debt.\n\nThus an entry or ticket issues by such an app, would be \"lottery device\" if winners were paid in money or things exchangeable for money or property, which would include gift cards.\n\n[Section 12\\-203](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2010/criminal-law/title-12/subtitle-2/12-203/) provides that:\n\n> (a) Prohibited.\\- A person may not:\n> \n> \n> (a) (1\\) hold a lottery in this State; or\n> \n> \n> (a) (2\\) sell a lottery device in the State for a lottery drawn in this State or elsewhere.\n\n[Section 12\\-205](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2010/criminal-law/title-12/subtitle-2/12-205/) provides that:\n\n> (b) Prohibited.\\- A person may not:\n\n> (b)(1\\) bring a lottery device into the State; or\n> \n> \n> (b)(2\\) possess a book, list, slip, or record of:\n> \n> \n> (b)(2\\)(i) the numbers drawn in a lottery in this State or another state or country;\n> \n> \n> (b)(2\\)(ii) a lottery device; or\n> \n> \n> (b)(2\\)(iii) money received or to be received from the sale of a lottery device.\n\n[Section 12\\-206](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2010/criminal-law/title-12/subtitle-2/12-206/) provides that:\n\n> b) Prohibited.\\- A person may not print, write, or publish an account of a lottery that describes:\n> \n> \n> (b)(1\\) when or where the lottery is to be drawn;\n> \n> \n> (b)(2\\) any prize available in the lottery;\n> \n> \n> (b)(3\\) the price of a lottery ticket or share of a lottery ticket; or\n> \n> \n> (b)(4\\) where a lottery ticket may be obtained.\n\nMost plausible ways to advertise an app as described in the question would seem to violate this section.\n\n[Section 12\\-208](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2010/criminal-law/title-12/subtitle-2/12-208/) provides that:\n\n> A court shall interpret \u00a7\u00a7 12\\-201 through 12\\-207 of this subtitle liberally to treat as a lottery ticket any ticket, part of a ticket, or lottery device by which money is paid or another item is delivered when, in the nature of a lottery, an event or contingency occurs.\n\nSo if it is arguably a lottery, the court will treat it as one.\n\n[Section 12\\-209](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2010/criminal-law/title-12/subtitle-2/12-209/) provides that:\n\n> A grant, bargain, or transfer of real estate, goods, a right of action, or personal property is void if it occurs while engaging in, or aiding or assisting in a lottery.\n\nSo winners cannot lawfully collect prizes.\n\nIn short any such app would seem to viol;ate several sections of Maryland law if it is used of promoted in Maryland",

These tickets enter users into a weekly drawing where winners receive cash prizes ranging from $10 to $100. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this app in Maryland?\n\nA) The app would be legal as long as users don't pay money for the tickets.\nB) The app would be considered a lottery and would violate multiple sections of Maryland's criminal code.\nC) The app would be legal if the prizes were changed from cash to non-monetary rewards.\nD) The app would only be illegal if it allowed users to purchase additional tickets with real money.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nB is correct because according to Maryland law, this app would likely be considered a lottery device. The Maryland criminal code defines a lottery device broadly, including any system where a person is promised money or property based on a contingent event. The app violates several sections of Maryland law:\n\n- Section 12-203 prohibits holding a lottery or selling lottery devices in the state.\n- Section 12-205 prohibits possessing records of lottery devices or money received from their sale.\n- Section 12-206 restricts publishing information about when and where lotteries are drawn or prizes available.\n- Section 12-209 voids any transfer of property occurring while engaging in a lottery.\n\nA is incorrect because the method of obtaining tickets (free through watching ads vs. paying) doesn't change its classification as a lottery under Maryland law.\n\nC is incorrect because the definition of a lottery device includes promises of both money and property, so changing to non-monetary rewards wouldn't make it legal.\n\nD is incorrect because the app would be illegal regardless of whether additional tickets could be purchased. The free distribution of tickets doesn't prevent it from being classified as a lottery."

PA law states that the landlord must give back the security deposit within 30 days or provide reasons for why they are withholding the money.\n\nThe lease mentions no fee for returning the security deposit, but the landlord is demanding a fee of $75 for direct wire transfer and $125 for overnight courier service\n\nCan my landlord charge a fee to return my security deposit?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This sounds improper if not expressly authorized by the lease, unless there is some option, for example, to send a check by ordinary mail or to have someone pick it up in person for you on your behalf, that is free. \n\nThose prices are also a large markup over actual cost. This fact might invalidate even an express lease provision in a lease that imposed this fee because \"penalties\" that impose a flat dollar fee as a liquidated damage amount that are far in excess of an amount that can easily be determined exactly are void as against public policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the amount in dispute is probably not large enough to make it cost effective to hire a lawyer and you probably aren't practically in a position to take the case to small claims court. There are many cases in the law where someone has violated your legal rights but it is not practical economically to seek a remedy for that violation.

While the landlord generally cannot impose additional fees not specified in the lease for returning a security deposit, they may offer expedited return options at a cost. However, they must provide a free option for returning the deposit, such as regular mail or in-person pickup. \n\nOption A is incorrect because fees should be disclosed in the lease agreement, not after signing. \n\nOption B is too absolute; while charging fees for returning deposits is generally improper, offering optional expedited services at a cost may be acceptable if a free option is also available. \n\nOption D is incorrect because even if a fee is specified in the lease, it could be invalidated if it's significantly higher than the actual cost, as it may be considered an unenforceable penalty.\n\nThis question tests understanding of landlord-tenant laws, the concept of reasonable fees vs. penalties, and the importance of lease terms in rental agreements."

And, the First Amendment protects the right to say truthful things pretty absolutely.\n\nArguably, if the sites provided the information without making clear that it might not be current because records were expunged or corrected, there might be a claim for negligent misrepresentation, false light, or even defamation, but I seriously doubt that even those claims would hold up.\n\nThe language in the order might cause sites to comply out of not legally justified concern, or just a desire to be accurate, even if it is not enforceable. So, it doesn't hurt to bring that information to the attention of such sites and ask them to take down the information. But, when push comes to shove, I very much doubt that you would prevail in court enforcing that order against them.\n\nCertainly, if you do nothing, they will do nothing, because they are not psychic and have no idea that the court order related to those records has been entered. Even a valid and enforceable order directed at a party over whom a court has jurisdiction is not effective until the person ordered to comply with it has notice of the order. And, there is no system that gives sites like that notice without you taking action to inform them of an order.",

The court's order is likely not legally enforceable against private online background search sites because:\n\n1. These sites were not parties to the expungement action, so the judge lacks jurisdiction over them.\n2. The First Amendment generally protects the right to publish truthful information.\n3.

One of the filtering categories is of course pornography, and once upon a time I decided I was going to develop a pornographic image detector/classifier. That is to say, the program would load the image, perform some analysis of the image and classify it accordingly.\n\nAnyone who has ever developed anything like this knows that you need a significant base of source material from which to derive your original classification models. So, I installed DownloadThemAll into Firefox and started punching in some nasty terms plus the words \"Tumblr\". Material collected.\n\nI ended up having thousands of images, both pornographic and non\\-pornographic so that the algorithm could extract features to make accurate classifications. However, after some time of developing and having never actually personally analyzed these thousands of images, my wife and I discussed the very real potential that something unspeakable may have been on one of these sites that I scripted to have all images dragged down from. So, I ceased development destroyed everything I had collected, deciding the risk of inadvertently having such filth was definitely not worth it.\n\nSo my question is, would I be liable if something had of been there?

By obtaining written approval from the Attorney General for the research project, the developer can avail themselves of the \"approved research\" defense mentioned in the documentation. This approach ensures that the research is conducted within a legal framework and minimizes the risk of liability.\n\nOption A is risky because it could lead to inadvertent possession of illegal material without proper safeguards. Option B would likely result in an ineffective classifier due to the lack of relevant training data. Option D may be safer than collecting images personally, but it doesn't provide the same level of legal protection as obtaining official approval for the research."

Instead, typically, a new lawsuit alleging misconduct by the parole board would be filed.\n\nIn some states, a parole board decision can be overridden by a Governor's decision to pardon an inmate or commute the inmate's sentence, but in many states that have parole boards the Governor's decision to pardon or parole someone must involve the parole board which is a board of pardons and paroles.\n\n> Are they legally trained?\n\nMost parole board members are not legally trained, but some may be. Legal training is generally not a requirement to serve on a parole board.\n\nOften parole board members will have a mix of backgrounds including law enforcement, corrections, and mental health services, as well as prominent members of the general public, such as current or former politicians.",

In common law jurisdictions, neither a pardon nor a criminal conviction can be used as evidence in a civil trial. The pardon only applies to the criminal charges within the jurisdiction that issued it and does not prevent civil litigation.

I know of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and the Security of Information Act, which are I assume are extremely similar to 18 USC 1831/1832/1837\\. Would they be equivalent? As in, if you stole trade secrets in Canada, would you be prosecuted under these acts or something?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as criminal acts are concerned, [sections 19 \\& 23](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-5/page-4.html#docCont) of the *Security of Information Act* are roughly equvalent to 18 USC \u00a7 1831\\. As for extraterritorial jurisdiction (18 USC \u00a7 1837\\), [section 26](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-5/page-5.html#h-12) is roughly equivalent, though if I'm reading the two laws correctly, the Canadian one goes further in subsection (d) as any alleged offender would immediately be liable upon entry into Canada.

With one exception [that employees must act in good faith](http://www.belmorelaw.com/ip-law/details/confidential-information-trade-secrets), trade secrets are not distinct from confidential information. Additionally, trade secrets fall under the exclusive domain of the provinces, not the federal level. Except for Quebec, they have not legislated on the issue and have generally left it up to common law. [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secrets_in_Canada#Civil_Remedial_Relief_-_Common_Law_Provinces), there are 5 types of actions within common law that can be used to protect trade secrets:\n\n> 1. breach of contract (expressed or implied provision),\n> 2. breach of confidence,\n> 3. breach of fiduciary duty,\n> 4. unjust enrichment and\n> 5. wrongful interference with the contractual relations of others.\n\nThat linked Wikipedia article provides a good starting point to further explore Canadian law on trade secrets.",

In Canada, trade secret protection involves a combination of federal criminal law and provincial civil law. The Security of Information Act provides some criminal provisions at the federal level, roughly equivalent to parts of the U.S. 18 USC \u00a7 1831 and \u00a7 1837.

Per ePD Art 6, traffic data may be used (1\\) for the purpose of the transmission/service or when the data has been anonymized, (2\\) for billing purposes, or (3\\) for marketing or value added services, when the user has given their consent. Information about the processing is only required under ePrivacy for cases (2\\) and (3\\), but not for processing that is strictly necessary.\n\nNow the tricky question is under what circumstances you can log (failed) log\\-in attempts or use tools like fail2ban. One argument is that such measures are strictly necessary to ensure the security of the communication, but these measures are evidently not necessary for performing the transmission in the sense of ePD. There are a few ways to resolve this:\n\n* necessity has to be interpreted more broadly, and security measures are indeed necessary. For example, ePD Art 6(5\\) mentions fraud detection, without authorizing it explicitly.\n* an IP address is effectively anonymized in the sense of the ePD since you do not realistically have means for linking the IP address to any particular person.\n\nThis is a fairly weak argument, but could be supported by GDPR Recital 26 which defines anonymous data.\nCounterpoint: IP addresses are online identifiers\nwhich are explicitly included in the definition of personal data in GDPR Art 4(1\\).\n* an IP address is not just traffic data that falls under the ePD,\nbut also personal data that falls under the GDPR.\nWhen the IP address is merely used to make a transmission,\nit is not processed as personal data and only ePD concerns apply.\nBut when we process it to ban the IP,\nit is processed as personal data under a legitimate interest.\nThis processing does not fall under any of the categories from ePD Art 6,\nso that only GDPR concerns apply.\nThese include a requirement to inform the data subject about the processing at the time in accordance with GDPR Art 13,\nwhich could be satisfied by displaying a link to a privacy policy in the course of the login process.\n\nFor a legitimate interest argument,\nit also depends on the expectations of the typical data subject.\nSince some security measures such as security logs are normal and should be expected, a legitimate interest argument is likely to be strong.\n\nI think this is the correct conclusion, even though the \u201cit's not traffic data, or at least doesn't fall under the ePD\u201d argument is quite weak. It hinges on the assumption that security measures are not \u201cvalue added services\u201d. This fits the intent of the ePD, but not the actual definition of value added services.\n\nIn any case, you do not need to ask for *consent* unless you're required to obtain consent e.g. under ePD Art 6(3\\) or because your processing of personal data relies on consent as the legal basis per GDPR Art 6\\.\n\nIt also has to be noted that ePD has no immediate effect, but has to be implemented by each EU member state in national law. These laws can provide more specific guidance.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive, when operating a publicly accessible SSH server for maintenance purposes, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the processing of IP addresses and login attempts?\n\nA) You must always display a privacy policy banner upon connection, regardless of how the data is used.\n\nB) You never need to inform users about data processing for an SSH server, as it's exempt from GDPR.\n\nC) You don't need to show a privacy policy if IP addresses are only used as strictly necessary for providing the service, but may need to if using them for security measures like banning IPs.\n\nD) You must obtain explicit consent from users before processing any data, including IP addresses, for any purpose.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, you don't need to show a privacy policy just for running a publicly accessible server if traffic data like IP addresses is only used as strictly necessary for the service. However, when using IP addresses for security measures like banning IPs, it may be considered processing of personal data under GDPR, which could require informing users, potentially through a privacy policy link during the login process. This is based on the interpretation that security measures might fall under GDPR rather than the ePrivacy Directive, triggering the need for user information under GDPR Article 13. Options A and D are too strict, as consent and blanket notification aren't always required. Option B is incorrect as SSH servers are not exempt from GDPR considerations."

If any person does not agree to be a claimant, they must be made a defendant. In this scenario, Carol doesn't want to be a claimant, so she should be made a defendant alongside Dave.

Just because the evidence came from a dual\\-networked system does not automatically mean it is unfair (it would be for the allegor to demonstrate that the evidence is unfair) and must be excluded, unless proven by expert evidence or other compelling facts.\n\nIn this case, I do not see the problem linking it with an existing IT network and consider that the company you've quoted is mistaken as to the law.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: ACME Shipping operates cargo ships that frequently travel through the High Risk Area (HRA) near the Horn of Africa. They want to employ armed guards on their UK-registered vessels to protect against piracy. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the firearms these guards would be allowed to carry under British law?\n\nA) The guards can only carry rifles and shotguns, as handguns and automatic weapons are strictly prohibited on all UK vessels.\n\nB) The guards can carry any type of firearm without restriction, as long as the vessel is in international waters.\n\nC) The guards can carry section 5 firearms (including handguns and automatic weapons) only if authorized by the Secretary of State and if the vessel meets specific criteria for operating in the HRA.\n\nD) The guards are limited to non-lethal weapons only, regardless of the risk level in the area of operation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, Private Maritime Security Companies (PMSCs) can be authorized to possess a range of firearms, including those requiring authority under section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 (which includes handguns and automatic weapons). However, this authorization is only granted under specific circumstances:\n\n1. The ship must be transiting the defined High Risk Area.\n2. Best Management Practices to deter piracy must be fully implemented but deemed insufficient.\n3. The use of armed guards must be assessed to reduce risk to those on board.\n4. The ship must be an internationally trading passenger or cargo ship of 500 gross tonnage or above.\n5. The PMSC must receive clearance via the Home Office section 5 authorization process.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct as it accurately reflects the legal requirements and possibilities for armed guards on UK-registered vessels in high-risk areas."

Neither approach is likely to succeed.\n\n### Because going without a mask is not recognized as \"expressive conduct,\" it is not protected by the Free Speech Clause\n\nA free\\-speech challenge would likely also fail for two reasons. As you correctly suggested, the First Amendment protects more than just speech, also protecting \"expressive conduct,\" such as flag burning, dancing, and wearing armbands. Of course, literally any conduct could have some secret expressive meaning in the mind of the person carrying out \\-\\- \"I shot him in the face to say I didn't like him\" \\-\\- so we have a question of where to draw the line between what expressive conduct does and does not receive the strong protection the First Amendment affords to speech.\n\nThe Supreme Court detailed that test in [*Texas v. Johnson*, 491 U.S. 397 (1989\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/491/397/), and it's now generally formulated as asking two questions:\n\n1. Did the speaker actually intend to convey a particularized message through his conduct?\n2. Are the people who see the conduct likely to understand that message?\n\nAt the Sturgis rally, or at the statehouse protests over COVID restrictions, or some similar event that is explicitly opposed to masks, refusing to wear a mask goes a long ways in communicating an opposition to the mask requirements.\n\nBut in the vast majority of cases, no one you run into in the normal course of daily life is likely to recognize that you are not wearing a mask because you are trying to communicate a message, let alone decipher what that message is. Do you believe that mask mandates are tyranny? That COVID\\-19 is a hoax? That life is meaningless and we should all welcome the hastening of human extinction?\n\nNone of that is clear to the average viewer, which is who the courts are going to be concerned with. Because refusing to wear a mask is generally insufficient to convey a specific message, I'd argue that it is not expressive conduct.\n\n### Because mask requirements are neutral as to religion and generally applicable, they do not violate the Free Exercise Clause.\n\nA religious challenge (\"My religion prohibits wearing masks\") is likely to fail because \"the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a 'valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).'\" [*Employment Div. v. Smith*, 494 U.S. 872, 879 (1990\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/494/872).\n\nThis means that if the mask ban generally applies to everyone and you just happen to belong to a religion that forbids mask\\-wearing, you can't use that affiliation to escape the law's requirements. (The outcome may be different when you run the problem through the [Religious Freedom Restoration Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000bb) or state\\-level analogues, which impose more stringent tests for infringements on religious liberty.)",

John, a local resident, refuses to wear a mask, claiming it violates his First Amendment rights. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the likely outcome of a legal challenge to this ordinance on First Amendment grounds?\n\nA) The ordinance would likely be struck down as a violation of John's free speech rights, as wearing or not wearing a mask is a form of expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment.\n\nB) John's challenge would likely succeed under the Free Exercise Clause if he claims that wearing a mask conflicts with his religious beliefs.\n\nC) The ordinance would likely be upheld, as not wearing a mask generally fails to meet the test for expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, and the law appears to be neutral and generally applicable.\n\nD) The ordinance would be deemed unconstitutional because public safety concerns cannot override First Amendment protections.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. The ordinance would likely be upheld for two main reasons:\n\n1. Not wearing a mask generally fails to meet the test for expressive conduct as outlined in Texas v. Johnson. In most cases, it doesn't convey a particularized message that would be understood by viewers, which is required for First Amendment protection of expressive conduct.\n\n2. Even if John were to claim religious exemption, the ordinance would likely be considered a \"valid and neutral law of general applicability\" as per Employment Div. v.

The employees discussed starting a competing business, and were fired as soon as management was made aware of the situation.\n\nAfter the employees were fired, the firm obtained screenshots of the conversations using the logged\\-in skype account on one of the company laptops.\n\nDuring these chats they also mentioned a former employee who was under a non\\-compete as being involved. The firm sued the former employee for breach of contract and the screenshots of the chat were entered as evidence.\n\nThe defendants have asserted that the screenshots are not admissible since they were obtained from a private skype account without the user's consent.\n\nAssuming the firm had no explicit use policy for the company laptops: Is there any case law that might inform the admissibility of the screenshots as evidence in civil litigation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer is rather complex. There are three legal concerns. First, was the evidence obtained illegally? If so, it might not be admissible given the \"exclusionary rule\". The second is whether the evidence is authentic; the third is whether it is hearsay. \n\nI mainly address the legality issue, since it is the most complex. Two things could make obtaining such evidence illegal (which is possibly relevant to whether the evidence is admissible). One would be if it was obtained by gaining unauthorized access to a computer (in violation of the [Stored Communications Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121)). Since the computers were not personal property of the employees and the accounts were not hacked into, there seems to be no violation of that law. The other way is that it might constitute \u201cillegal recording\u201d i.e. wiretapping. I will mostly cite [Texas wiretapping laws](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.16.htm#16.02), which are quite similar to federal laws.\n\nThe basic prohibition (16\\.02(b)) states\n\n> A person commits an offense if the person:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) intentionally *intercepts*, endeavors to intercept, or procures\n>  another person to intercept or endeavor to intercept a *wire, oral, or\n>  electronic communication*;\n\nThe word \u201cintercept\u201d is defined to mean\n\n> the aural or *other acquisition* of the contents of a wire, oral, or\n>  *electronic communication* through the use of an electronic, mechanical, or other device.\n\nTaking a screen shot of a message is acquisition of the content of a communication; it uses a device (a computer). So the message was intercepted, under a plain reading of the statute. (I will leave open the question of whether the \u201cinterception\u201d has to be contemporaneous with the act of communicating: there is case law about this issue alluded to in [United States v. Smith](http://openjurist.org/155/f3d/1051/united-states-v-smith), 155 F.3d 1051, but TMI).\n\nThe nature of the communication is important. A Skype text (but not a Skype voice transmission) is an electronic communication, defined as\n\n> a transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or\n>  intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire,\n>  radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic, or photo\\-optical system\n\nA Skype text is not an oral communication. This distinction is important, because the definition of \u201coral communication\u201d includes an escape clause that may allow recording. An \u201coral communication\u201d is defined as:\n\n> an oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation\n>  that the communication is not subject to interception under\n>  circumstances justifying that expectation. The term does not include\n>  an electronic communication.\n\n(where in the second instance i.e. the start of the block quote, \u201coral communication\u201d has its plain meaning). So even though the law generally forbids intercepting communication, in the case of *oral* communications, and *only* oral communications, the communication has to be made under circumstances where you would reasonably expect the communication to be private. By contrast, there is no such limit on what constitutes an electronic communication (nor a wire communication).\n\nAs noted in [this article](http://www.emilymiskel.com/blog/illegal-evidence-wiretapping-hacking-and-data-interception-laws), \u201cWire communications are protected against interception *regardless of the speaker\u2019s expectation of privacy*\u201d, citing [Briggs v. American Air Filter](http://openjurist.org/630/f2d/414/briggs-v-american-air-filter-co-inc-f-c-roby), 630 F.2d 414\\. That court reasoned that\n\n> Wire communications, unlike oral communications, are protected against\n>  interception by electronic, mechanical, and other devices regardless\n>  of the speaker's expectation of privacy. Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(1\\)\n>  with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(2\\)\n\nIt is important to notice what [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(1\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2510) actually says:\n\n> \u201cwire communication\u201d means any aural transfer made in whole or in part\n>  through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications\n>  by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point\n>  of origin and the point of reception (including the use of such\n>  connection in a switching station) furnished or operated by any person\n>  engaged in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission\n>  of interstate or foreign communications or communications affecting\n>  interstate or foreign commerce.\n\nThe court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cwire communications, unlike oral communications, are protected against interception\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that there is an *express* statement within the law saying effectively \u201ceven if you don\u2019t have a reasonable expectation of privacy, it\u2019s still not okay to intercept\u201d. Rather, that conclusion follows from the fact that there is a general prohibition against interception, plus there is no \u201cexpectation of privacy\u201d escape attached to the definition of wire communication, as there is in the case of oral communication. \n\nSo there is some merit to the argument that the message was illegally intercepted. But now we come to the \u201cso what\u201d part. There is an \u201cexclusionary rule\u201d, that evidence obtained illegally can\u2019t be used as evidence, but (quoting the article *supra*) \u201cnormal Texas law only prohibits the introduction of illegally\\-obtained evidence in criminal trials\u201d: per [Texas Code Crim. Proc. art. 38\\.23](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CR/htm/CR.38.htm).\n\n> (a) No evidence obtained by an officer or other person in violation\n>  of any provisions of the Constitution or laws of the State of Texas,\n>  or of the Constitution or laws of the United States of America, shall\n>  be admitted in evidence against the accused on the trial *of any\n>  criminal case*.\n\nYou can use illegally\\-obtained evidence in civil trials ([Baxter v. Tex. Dept. of Human Resources](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2437193/baxter-v-tex-dept-of-human-resources/), 678 S.W.2d 265, 267\\):\n\n> The exclusionary rule codified in Tex.Code Cr.P. art. 38\\.23\n>  (Supp.1984\\) is inapplicable to the present case because the Code of\n>  Criminal Procedure applies only to criminal actions, and this is a\n>  civil action arising under the Texas Family Code. Tex. Code Cr.P.Ann.\n>  art. 1\\.02 (1977\\)\n\nAlthough illegally\\-obtained evidence might admissible in a Texas civil trial, there is also an overriding exception at the federal level, whereby illegal evidence is excluded from *all* proceedings comes from the Wiretap Act, per [18 USC 2515](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2515). This states that intercepted wire or oral communications are broadly excluded:\n\n> Whenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part\n>  of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived\n>  therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other\n>  proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer,\n>  agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of\n>  the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof if the\n>  disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.\n\nIf an oral or wire communication is intercepted, it cannot be used in a civil case (or in any other official action). But this provision does not apply to electronic communications. The reason for the omission of electronic communication from this law is that [this particular section was enacted](http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=82&page=216) in 1968, when there was no such thing as electronic communication, but \u00a72511 was amended subsequently.\n\nSo, the bottom line is, the evidence is probably admissible, if it doesn't fail on authenticity or hearsay grounds.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the admissibility of this evidence?\n\nA) The screenshots are inadmissible because they violate the Texas wiretapping laws, which prohibit the interception of electronic communications without consent.\n\nB) The screenshots are admissible because company-owned laptops are not protected by privacy laws, regardless of the nature of the communication.\n\nC) The screenshots are inadmissible due to the federal Wiretap Act, which excludes illegally obtained wire or oral communications from all proceedings.\n\nD) The screenshots are likely admissible in a civil trial in Texas, despite potentially being obtained illegally, unless they fail on authenticity or hearsay grounds.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. While the screenshots may have been obtained in violation of wiretapping laws (as they could be considered an \"interception\" of electronic communications), this does not automatically make them inadmissible in a civil trial in Texas. The exclusionary rule for illegally obtained evidence typically applies only to criminal cases in Texas, not civil ones. Additionally, while the federal Wiretap Act (18 USC 2515) does exclude illegally intercepted wire or oral communications from all proceedings, it does not extend this protection to electronic communications like Skype texts. Therefore, even if the evidence was obtained illegally, it would likely still be admissible in a civil trial in Texas, provided it meets other evidentiary standards such as authenticity and not being considered hearsay."

What would happen if it did?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **There may be a purpose to have laws which are impossible to follow.**\n\n(I'm neither a lawyer nor a politician, following points are what I like to call *qualified hearsay* \\- they come from qualified people I know personally but were given as a remark or during a chat over a cup of coffee and therefore are not easily substantiable with rigorous sources. You can treat them as a hypothetical ideas for your thought experiments.)\n\n*Everybody is implicitly guilty*\n\nConfident citizens and transparent law is the worst enemy of totalitarian regime. You learn to live with ingrained feeling that there surely is something you are guilty of. Merely being addressed by police makes you nervous and malleable; should you stand up against oppression, it is easy for the state *apparat* to detain or convict you of one or more default offenses. \n\nA good example would be the law present in many, if not all, socialist bloc countries saying that knowing of a comrade having commited an offense or merely planing to and not reporting it to authorities is an offense in itself. Whether you did or did not know would be determined by the authorities.\n\n*Make your laws very strict with a hope thay they will be followed at least to a degree*\n\nNot laws in themselves, but standards (technical norms) regarding nuclear power stations in the former Soviet Union were strict to the point where they were technically impossible to follow given the state of the art. For example the standards for manufacture of high pressure pipes would state very low level of material impurities that when the actual manufactured material contained twice the level of impurities the pipe will still be very safe to operate. In a centrally planned economy with ever more ambitious production projections and declared zero need for contingency this was one of several ways how to create a bit of a wiggle room. (Source: I once worked for a nuclear power research institute supporting Soviet technology and was told this by an expert on stainless steel.)\n\nSo there you have a bit of an illustration what may happen if a law is intentionally impossible to follow. Since you labelled your question 'United States', I believe the follow\\-up question is *why would anyone want to propose such a law*.",

However, promoting transparency and confidence in the legal system (D) is explicitly stated as the \"worst enemy of totalitarian regime\" and goes against the described purposes of such impossible laws. Therefore, D is not a reason why a government might create impossible-to-follow laws, making it the correct answer to this question."

For example, they issued \u00a320 coins (made out of silver) but usually shops and banks don't accept them. They are legal tender, however.\n\nIf I was sued and had to pay a debt to someone in court, could I use my commemorative coins to pay off part of the debt?\n\nThe [Royal Mint website](https://www.royalmint.com/aboutus/policies-and-guidelines/legal-tender-guidelines/) says this:\n\n> Legal tender has a very narrow and technical meaning in the settlement of debts. It means that a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non\\-payment if he pays into court in legal tender. It does not mean that any ordinary transaction has to take place in legal tender or only within the amount denominated by the legislation. Both parties are free to agree to accept any form of payment whether legal tender or otherwise according to their wishes.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A debtor has been ordered by a court to pay \u00a31000 to a creditor. The debtor possesses a collection of commemorative \u00a320 silver coins issued by the Royal Mint. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the use of these coins for debt payment?\n\nA) The debtor can pay the entire \u00a31000 debt using 50 of the commemorative \u00a320 coins, and the creditor must accept this as full payment.\n\nB) The debtor can use the commemorative coins to pay part of the debt, but must combine them with standard currency to reach the exact amount owed.\n\nC) The debtor can pay the debt using the commemorative coins, but only if the creditor agrees to accept them as payment.\n\nD) The debtor can pay the \u00a31000 into court using 50 of the commemorative \u00a320 coins, and cannot be successfully sued for non-payment if they do so.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the Royal Mint's Legal Tender Guidelines, commemorative coins issued by the Royal Mint have legal tender status. The guidelines also state that \"a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non-payment if he pays into court in legal tender.\" Therefore, the debtor can use the commemorative \u00a320 coins to pay the debt into court, and this would constitute a valid payment that protects them from being successfully sued for non-payment. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the coins are legal tender, the creditor is not obligated to accept them directly. Option B is incorrect because there's no requirement to combine commemorative coins with standard currency. Option C is incorrect because the debtor's right to use legal tender for court payments doesn't depend on the creditor's agreement when paying into court."

Does the owner have any civil claim against me? Assume the scooter can be reassembled.\n\nAlso assume that I have no contract with Bird. I\u2019ve never even been on their website. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What laws do I break if I dismantle it?\n\nThat is an interesting question. As far as I can see, legally the scooter would be considered **lost property**. The owner (the company Bird Rides, Inc) presumably did not put it there (some user did), and they still want it back (so it is not abandoned property).\n\nExact rules vary, but usually you must make a **reasonable effort to return the item to the owner**.\n\n---\n\nWhat exactly that means will depend on local laws. Sometimes there is an official *Lost and found* office where you can deposit or report lost property, which absolves you of further responsibility. Sometimes you may even have to make a reasonable effort to find the owner yourself.\n\nIn Minnesota specifically, probably you would have to notify the owner. Not doing so *may* constitute theft under [article 609\\.515 of the Minnesota Statutes](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.52):\n\n> 609\\.52 THEFT\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> Subd. 2\\.Acts constituting theft.\n> \n> \n> (a) Whoever does any of the following commits theft and may be sentenced as provided in subdivision 3: \n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> (6\\) finds lost property and, knowing or having reasonable means of \n>  ascertaining the true owner, appropriates it to the finder's own use\n>  or to that of another not entitled thereto without first having made \n>  reasonable effort to find the owner and offer and surrender the property\n>  to the owner; or\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n\nSo you are not allowed to \"appropriate\" the scooter, without trying to contact the onwer. Just disassembling it and storing it is probably ok (but I'm not a laywer etc.).\n\nIt's not clear whether you are required to contact the owner if you don't \"appropriate\" the scooter. However, the [official recommendation of the Minneapolis Police Department](http://www.minneapolismn.gov/police/about/evidence/police_about_lost-stolen) is to do so:\n\n> Lost, Stolen and Found Property Check\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> For other found items, please take the item to the nearest Minneapolis\n>  Police Precinct and turn it in to the desk officer.\n\nSo to be on the safe side, you should probably report the scooter either to Bird Rides, Inc directly, or to your local police station.\n\n> Does the owner have any civil claim against me? Assume the scooter can be reassembled\n\nIf you do not damage the scooter in any way, then probably not. The only damage they could claim would be the cost of reassembly \\- however, a) this might be too trivial to be worth it for them, and b) you could claim you needed to disassemble it because otherwise you would not have had space to store it.\n\nAgain, to be on the safe side you should probably notify Bird Rides, Inc and ask them to collect the scooter within a certain timeframe. If you also notify them that you will disassemble the scooter if it is not collected until a certain time, I don't think they will have a claim against you later.",

You have no prior relationship with Bird. Which of the following actions would be LEAST likely to result in legal consequences?\n\nA) Immediately dismantling the scooter and selling the parts online\nB) Keeping the scooter in your garage for personal use without notifying anyone\nC) Notifying Bird of the scooter's location and dismantling it if not collected within a specified timeframe\nD) Throwing the scooter in the trash without attempting to contact the owner\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the least likely to result in legal consequences because it involves making a reasonable effort to return the lost property to its rightful owner (Bird) and giving them an opportunity to collect it. This aligns with legal requirements for handling lost property. Dismantling the scooter after a specified timeframe, if communicated to Bird, could be seen as a reasonable action for storage purposes.\n\nOption A would likely be considered theft and unauthorized sale of property. Option B could be seen as appropriating lost property without attempting to return it, which may constitute theft in some jurisdictions. Option D involves disposing of valuable property without attempting to contact the owner, which could lead to legal issues.\n\nThe correct approach balances the property owner's rights with the legal obligations regarding lost property, making it the safest choice from a legal standpoint."

The ship became subject to EU and UK laws, including sanctions against Syria, when it entered EU territorial waters. This is a fundamental principle of international maritime law - ships in the territorial waters of a state are subject to that state's laws and regulations. The ship's Panamanian flag or its non-EU origin do not exempt it from complying with local laws while in EU waters. Options A and D are incorrect because they misunderstand the application of maritime law. Option B is overly broad, as EU sanctions cannot be universally applied to all ships globally when outside EU jurisdiction."

Then, it's management's decision to toss it.\n\nI imagine that the twelfth time that management has to evaluate whether a used condom is personal property or trash, they will revise their ill\\-advised little letter.\n\nAdditionally, how does the guest know for certain that an item was actually left in room, and how does management know that a particular staff was the only one who could have encountered it? They'd have to implement key card logging or video cameras. i.e. the staff could simply deny that any items were found in the room, or perhaps they could demand that a manager must clear a room of possible guest property before entering.\n\nPut simply, how to prove a particular person had access to the room and exercised that access, AND that they encountered the wayward guest item?",

Congress can indeed pass laws that effectively overrule SCOTUS decisions, but this power is limited when it comes to decisions that interpret constitutional rights. For example, Congress could not simply pass a law to overturn a decision like Roe v. Wade, which defined a constitutional right to abortion. However, they could pass laws that overturn decisions based on statutory interpretation, like the Dobbs decision which overturned Roe.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Constitution explicitly states that SCOTUS is the \"supreme Court\" and any courts created by Congress are \"inferior.\" Option B overstates Congress's power, as it doesn't account for the limitation on overturning decisions interpreting constitutional rights. Option D understates Congress's power, as it does have some ability to affect SCOTUS decisions through legislation, just not in all cases."

Rule 195 of the Highway Code explicitly states that drivers should not use their horn to invite pedestrians across at zebra crossings, as this could be dangerous.\n\nB) Correct. According to Rule 112 of the Highway Code, you may use your horn while your vehicle is moving to warn other road users of your presence.\n\nC) Incorrect. Using the horn aggressively is never allowed, and this scenario doesn't involve warning of danger. Additionally, while 8:00 PM is outside the restricted nighttime hours (11:30 PM to 7:00 AM), using the horn in this manner would still be considered aggressive and unnecessary.\n\nD) Incorrect. The horn should only be used to warn of danger or your presence to other road users, not for social purposes or to get someone's attention when they're not on the road."

Particularly, does it protect \"green card\" holders from a positive drug test during the hiring process? Is it correct that withdrawing a job offer based on a test positive for THC products would be illegal by this legislation? If so, to what extent do employers feel bound by this act (currently, in Pennsylvania); i.e. whether in knowing or unknowing defiance of this act, would a company be likely to feel comfortable withdrawing a job offer after a positive test?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It works by prohibiting discrimination based on use of medical marijuana, thus it limits employer actions w.r.t. hiring, firing, and on the job treatment. It is *not* an absolute prohibition. \u00a72103(b)(3\\) states that\n\n> Nothing in this act shall require an employer to commit any act that\n> would put the employer or any person acting on its behalf in violation\n> of Federal law.\n\nSince employers may be subject to federal drug\\-free workplace rules, detectable usage of medical marijuana is a fireable offense on such jobs, until the federal regulations are eliminated. The law is also clear that this does not create a right to be under the influence while on the job, and [\u00a7510](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/uconsCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&yr=2016&sessInd=0&smthLwInd=0&act=16&chpt=5&sctn=10&subsctn=0) lists definite prohibitions against actions while under the influence.\n\nAs for the question of whether the law prohibits discrimination based on simple possession of a card but does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of actual use (leaving aside the preceding disclaimers), this has been decided in\n[Palmiter v. Commonwealth Health Systems, Inc.](https://casetext.com/case/palmiter-v-commonwealth-health-sys) \u2013 it's not just card\\-possession that is protected. Indeed, the hospital in this lawsuit did not contest the claim that the law protects employees who use medical marijuana, the dispute was over whether a cause of private action was created (can a fired employee sue? \"Yes\", says the court).

Which of the following actions would most likely be in compliance with Pennsylvania's Medical Marijuana Act?\n\nA) Withdraw the job offer, citing the company's zero-tolerance drug policy\nB) Hire the candidate but prohibit them from using medical marijuana, even outside of work hours\nC) Proceed with hiring the candidate, making reasonable accommodations for their medical marijuana use outside of work hours\nD) Hire the candidate only if they agree to more frequent drug testing than other employees\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the correct answer because it aligns with the Pennsylvania Medical Marijuana Act's protections against discrimination for certified medical marijuana users. The Act prohibits employers from discriminating against employees solely based on their status as medical marijuana users.\n\nOption A would likely violate the Act, as withdrawing a job offer based solely on a positive THC test for a registered medical marijuana user is considered discrimination.\n\nOption B is also problematic because it infringes on the employee's right to use their prescribed medication outside of work hours.\n\nOption D could be seen as discriminatory treatment, as it singles out the medical marijuana user for additional scrutiny without justification.\n\nThe key is that the position doesn't involve safety-sensitive duties or federal regulations, which might otherwise allow for exceptions to the protections. Employers must make reasonable accommodations for medical marijuana users, as long as the employee is not under the influence while at work."

A police officer came to the door of the house I was living in, and told us that someone had stolen a large theta from the front of a frat house, and that someone walking down our street at around 6:00am had seen the letter on the lawn in our front yard. Given that it was stolen property the police officer told us that he could get a search warrant for our house, and if we didn't let him in he would block our cars in with his car and wait for the search warrant. We had nothing to do with the stealing of the letter and woke up long after it was gone. We assumed someone had drunkenly stolen it and dropped it on our front lawn. One of my roommates ended up getting scared and letting the officer in so the point was moot, but I did not think the officer was being truthful in saying he could obtain a search warrant. The stolen property had been seen on our lawn, but there was no way anyone could prove (because it was false) that we had anything to do with stealing the letter, or that the letter was even still around.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Keep in mind that a warrant doesn't require proof that you stole the property or have the property. Instead, the warrant is just authorization to look for that proof.\n\nThe standard for securing a warrant is probable cause, which is a much lower bar to clear than people seem to think. It just requires that given everything the officer knows, there's a \"substantial probability\" that a piece of evidence will be in a given place at a given time.\n\nIf the officer swore to a judge that a reliable source had told him that the letter was stolen, then seen in your front yard, and not seen since, I wouldn't be at all surprised if the judge gave him a search warrant.",

As explained in the documentation, the standard for obtaining a search warrant is \"probable cause,\" which is a lower threshold than many people assume. Probable cause can be established if there's a \"substantial probability\" that evidence will be found in a particular location. In this case, a reliable source reporting that stolen property was seen on the premises, even if it's no longer visible, could be sufficient for a judge to grant a search warrant. The officer doesn't need to prove that the residents committed the crime or that the item is definitely still there.

If not, why? \n\n**Example:** I have a concealed pistol license (CPL) which, in my open\\-carry state, allows me to carry a pistol in most public places and private businesses unless prohibited by law (the Constitutionality of which is another debate) or designated by the business owner as \"gun free.\" My employer has specific rules against employees bringing weapons of any kind into the building or even into their parking lot.\n\nIf there is a violent situation at work, such as a mass shooter, and I get injured by that shooter, is there any recourse to be taken against my employer for failing to protect their employees from shooter themselves?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Employees of an employer aren't governed by a fault based liability regime in the United States (subject to some usually quite narrow exceptions that vary from state to state, which sometimes also limit tort liability).\n\nInstead, employers are required to have worker's compensation insurance policies in place, in exchange for not having any tort liability whatsoever to employees. (An employer who doesn't have worker's compensation in place is strictly liable to the worker for all injuries suffered by an employee whatsoever at work, without the prohibition of a worker's compensation insurance policy plan on paying things like pain and suffering damages as well.)\n\nWorker's compensation insurance provides coverage (in principle) for all medical costs incurred, all lost wages, and in the event of a death support for dependents if any and a modest death benefit sufficient to provide a funeral if there are no dependents. Often, in practice, worker's compensation insurance payments tend to be rather stingy.\n\nOne of the most common big worker's compensation claims these days, especially in office and retail workplaces, is for employees who are seriously injured or killed in crimes at work.\n\nOften, a worker's compensation insurer will give an employer a discount if they have a \"gun free\" zone, because, statistically, doing so greatly reduces the average amount of harm experienced by employees at work. The presence of employees with guns in the workplace, as an actuarial matter, greatly increases the insurance company's risk of having to pay claims.",

In the United States, employees are generally covered by workers' compensation insurance, which provides the exclusive remedy for work-related injuries. This system operates on a no-fault basis, meaning the employee doesn't need to prove the employer was negligent. In exchange for this guaranteed coverage, employees give up the right to sue their employer for workplace injuries in most cases. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the employer's policy of prohibiting firearms doesn't create liability for failing to protect employees. In fact, such policies often reduce insurance premiums.\n\nOption C is incorrect because private employers generally have the right to restrict firearms on their property, and this doesn't violate employees' Second Amendment rights.\n\nOption D is incorrect because employees typically cannot opt out of workers' compensation to pursue a personal injury lawsuit against their employer.

When an attorney uses the phrase \"no reason to believe\" in the face of seemingly strong evidence, they are likely employing a strategic legal maneuver. This statement goes beyond simply denying the truth of the allegations; it implies that the attorney is rejecting the validity or relevance of all supporting evidence presented. \n\nBy stating they have \"no reason to believe,\" the attorney is indirectly challenging the credibility, admissibility, or interpretation of the evidence that supports the allegations.

Instead, the key factor is \"enablement\" - whether the patent application provides sufficient information for others skilled in the field to implement the invention without undue experimentation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because success in one organism doesn't automatically grant rights to all organisms, especially if expression in other organisms would require significant additional research or novel techniques.\n\nOption B is too restrictive.

Not necessarily extrapolated to a large commercial operation involving more parties.\n\nAt some point it becomes a payment system and a financial enterprise that becomes subject to financial regulation.\n\n**Could her transfer be viewed as a donation as well?**\n\nThis is not a donation transaction and efforts to characterize it in that fashion would probably be disregarded by authorities.\n\n**Could they be viewed as money laundering?**\n\nThe core element of money laundering is an effort to conceal the source of the funds for some purpose. It isn't clear if that would or would not be a motive.\n\n**Other considerations**\n\nA fairly common way to handle this kind of situation that is similar to what you suggest is called correspondent banking. Each side has an account in Russia and an account in Germany. Most day to day transfers happen by directing that money go from one German account to another German account, or from one Russian account to another Russian account.\n\nThe big benefit of correspondent banking, aside from being transparent, is that it avoids currency exchange risks, fees and considerations for small, ordinary transactions.\n\nOf course, it simply isn't difficult or expensive to simply wire money from Russia to Germany, and vice versa, now and then. There are not strict currency controls, although there are some potential disclosure requirements. One reason for you, or authorities to worry about characterization of the transactions as money laundering is that if you have nothing to hide, simple wire transfers would be the usual and ordinary way of handling matters.",

The arrangement would likely be legal on a small scale between individuals, but could face regulatory issues if expanded to a large commercial operation. This aligns with the expert's statement that it would \"Probably [be legal] at this scale. Not necessarily extrapolated to a large commercial operation involving more parties.\" The expert also notes that at some point, such an arrangement could become subject to financial regulation as a payment system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the arrangement isn't necessarily money laundering, which requires an intent to conceal the source of funds. Option B is overly restrictive and mischaracterizes the nature of the transfers. Option D is too broad and doesn't account for potential regulatory issues or the simplicity of regular international wire transfers for small amounts."

The buildings have different lot numbers and owners. John runs his business from one building and uses the other for storage. He has maintained both properties, paid property taxes, and acted as if he owned them. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's potential claim of adverse possession?\n\nA) John can claim adverse possession for both buildings since he has used them continuously for over 15 years.\nB) John can only claim adverse possession for the building he runs his business from, as it demonstrates more substantial use.\nC) John cannot claim adverse possession for either building because they are commercial properties with different owners.\nD) John may be able to claim adverse possession for both buildings, but he must prove he met all legal requirements for each property separately.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because adverse possession can potentially apply to commercial buildings, and it's possible to claim adverse possession for multiple properties. However, John would need to prove that he met all the legal requirements for adverse possession for each property separately. These requirements typically include actual possession, open and notorious use, exclusive use, hostile possession (without permission), and continuous use for the statutory period. The fact that the buildings have different lot numbers and owners means that John would need to establish his claim for each property independently, as the circumstances and evidence may differ for each building."

[https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2445860982357574?id\\=1716638325041491](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2445860982357574?id=1716638325041491)\n\n> You can choose to share hashed email addresses and phone numbers. This information gets hashed before it\u2019s shared with us. We use the hashed information to more accurately determine which people took action in response to your ad. After matching, we promptly discard the hashed information.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, hashed emails are personal data under GDPR. Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data. Personal data that has been de\\-identified, encrypted or pseudonymised but can be used to re\\-identify a person remains personal data and falls within the scope of the GDPR. With the same logic, the matching of hashed emails is a processing of personal data and is likely to produce new personal data.\n\nReferences\n\n* Article 2, Article 4(1\\) and (5 and Recitals (14\\), (15\\), (26\\), (27\\), (29\\) and (30\\) of the GDPR\n* Article 29 Working Party Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data\n* Article 29 Working Party Opinion 05/2014 on Anonymisation Techniques\n\nSecond, you must determine under which conditions personal data is used. The type and amount of personal data a company/organisation may process depends on the reason for processing it (legal reason used) and the intended use. The company/organisation must respect several key rules, including, but not limited to:\n\n* personal data must be processed in a lawful and transparent manner, ensuring fairness towards the individuals whose personal data is being processed (\u2018lawfulness, fairness and transparency\u2019);\n* there must be specific purposes for processing the data and the company/organisation must indicate those purposes to individuals when collecting their personal data. A company/organisation can\u2019t simply collect personal data for undefined purposes (\u2018purpose limitation\u2019);\n* the company/organisation must collect and process only the personal data that is necessary to fulfill that purpose (\u2018data minimisation\u2019);\n* the company/organisation must ensure the personal data is accurate and up\\-to\\-date, having regard to the purposes for which it is processed, and correct it if not (\u2018accuracy\u2019);\n* the company /organisation can\u2019t further use the personal data for other purposes that aren\u2019t compatible with the original purpose;\n* the company/organisation must ensure that personal data is stored for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected (\u2018storage limitation\u2019);\n* the company/organisation must install appropriate technical and organisational safeguards that ensure the security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technology (\u2018integrity and confidentiality\u2019).\n\nReferences:\n\n* Article 5(1\\) and Recital (39\\) of the GDPR\n* Article 29 Working Party Opinion 03/2013 on purpose limitation (WP 203\\)\n\nYou have provided limited relevant information. I am assuming that your technical and organisational safeguards are best\\-in class. Even if I also assume that the consent of the data subject has been obtain in a lawful, fair, and transparent manner, the information provided does not allow me to determine whether the way your organisation is matching hashed emails is legit or not under GDPR. Especially, I do not understand whether the information in the box is a full and accurate extract of your company/organisation's T\\&C, or equivalent documentation. I do not see a full disclosure of the purpose of the matching process. To put it in non\\-legal terms, I also do not see a reference to Facebook as a \"data sub\\-processor\".

Even if the fault was not visible, for example if the product lasts only one year because of a faulty component. \n\nNow with modern electronics, it often happens that the manufacturer updates the software in the product long after the product is purchased. How does that work out legally if let's say I purchased a product 18 months ago, it worked fine because it was actually faultless when I purchased it, and the manufacturer updates the software on the product and breaks it? \n\nNormally if it breaks after 18 months I would have rights against the store where I bought. In this case the store is arguably without fault. So who has to fix this, and how do I get it fixed without going to court?\n\n(A recent example is many Bose headphones suddenly not working anymore after a firmware update).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The **Consumer Rights Act 2015** makes provision for consumers to obtain a\nrepair or replacement for an item on which a fault becomes apparant\nafter the consumer has accepted the goods. For six months after\npurchase, the onus is on the retailer to demonstrate that the fault\nwas *not* inherent at the time of purchase, while after six months the\nonus is on the consumer to demonstrate that it was. \n\nYou might argue the forced firmware update was an inherent design flaw in the product as sold. Like any goods supplied that stop working for whatever reason during their\nexpected life, the consumer's rights are against the retailer. \n\nThe CRA gives consumers no recourse against the manufacturer; their\ncontract (and all liability) is solely with the retailer. But, if \nthe item was fine when they bought it, they have no recourse against\nthe retailer if the fault was not inherent at time of purchase.\n\nAn action emedy against the manufacturer in tort might be more possible. If it is inherent in the purchase that the manufacturer will be supplying firmware updates this may create a duty of care for the manufacturer, stopping the device working is direct harm and it seems likely to be negligent to design firmware that does this. \n\nThe manufacturer might be subecj to a civil action taken under the **Computer Misuse Act** and it could well be criminal damage by whoever forced the faulty update.\n\nIf the manufacturer offers a guarantee in addition to the consumer's statutory rights, this may provide another avenue for remedy.\n\nSummarised from [uk.legal.moderated newsgroup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/uk.legal.moderated/-HVseYnFM44)",

After 18 months, the consumer's rights against the retailer under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 are limited, as it would be difficult to prove the fault was inherent at the time of purchase. However, the consumer may have grounds for a tort action against the manufacturer for negligence in designing faulty firmware that caused direct harm to the product. The manufacturer may have a duty of care when providing firmware updates, and failing to ensure the update doesn't break the product could be seen as negligent. Options A and B are not entirely accurate, as the retailer's liability is limited after 18 months, and the Computer Misuse Act is not the primary basis for consumer action in this case. Option C is incorrect because the consumer does have some potential legal recourse, particularly against the manufacturer."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In 2020, the NYPD reached a settlement with three Muslim women who were forced to remove their hijabs (which obscured their heads, but not their faces) for the purpose of having their mugshots taken ([https://ecbawm.com/wp\\-content/uploads/2020/11/ClarkSettlement.pdf](https://ecbawm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ClarkSettlement.pdf))\n\nAs a result, Muslim women in New York are no longer required to remove their hijabs during mugshots.\n\nAn obvious consequence of being able to cover one's head in a mugshot is that allows one to be less identifiable (to law enforcement, to the public who may see the mugshot on the news, etc) than someone whose entire head is visible. This may be advantageous for a number of reasons.\n\nDoes the equal protection clause grant anyone in New York city \\- atheistic men, for example \\- the right to cover their head in a mugshot so long as their face is visible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [order](https://casetext.com/case/clark-v-city-of-ny-14) certifying the class action and [the ruling](https://casetext.com/case/clark-v-city-of-new-york-8) provide circumstantial details that would bear on the applicability of that reasoning. The opinion frames the question as:\n\n> Does the United States Constitution permit the New York City Police\n> Department (the \"NYPD\") to require an observant Muslim woman to remove\n> her hijab when sitting for an arrest photo? The Court holds that it\n> does not.\n\nThe agreed\\-to settlement includes instructions to police that are broader:\n\n> A religious head covering worn pursuant to a sincerely held religious\n> belief can be retained by the prisoner while in the custody of the\n> Department. However, the religious head covering must be temporarily\n> removed when conducting the mandatory Department search for weapons\n> and/or contraband, but will be returned to the prisoner after that\n> search unless the head covering presents a risk to the safety of the\n> prisoner or others.\n\nThe First\\-Amendment part of the ruling is that\n\n> Clark and Aziz have no alternative means of exercising their right to\n> wear a hijab in public, at all times. The Policy, although sometimes\n> inconsistently applied, still requires that Clark and Aziz remove\n> their hijabs and makes their photographs available to men. The Court\n> agrees with Plaintiffs that permitting observant Muslim women to wear\n> a hijab while being photographed as part of booking procedure would\n> have reasonably accommodated their beliefs and also would be less\n> burdensome on the NYPD. Indeed, snapping a Booking Photograph of an\n> arrestee with her religiously compelled covering would expend fewer\n> resources than \u201crequir\\[ing] dialogue with arrestees and additional\n> time spent negotiating removal.\u201d\n\nThe First Amendment is equally available to males and females, and to Muslims and non\\-Muslims. This ruling cannot be interpreted to mean that only women or only Muslims have this right to religious expression.\n\nThe courts have also declined to engage in religion\\-evaluation whereby some beliefs are certified as \"true religion\" and others are \"false religion\". See [Schwarzentruber v. Gunite](https://casetext.com/case/swartzentruber-v-gunite-corp), where an employee was required to cover up his racist tattoos on the job, and sued on First Amendment accommodation grounds. The court states the relevant legal principle regarding such a suit:t\n\n> To establish a prima facie case of religious discrimination, a\n> plaintiff must show that (1\\) he has a sincere religious belief,\n> observance or practice that conflicts with an employment requirement;\n> (2\\) he informed his employer of the conflict; and (3\\) the religious\n> practice was the basis for the adverse employment decision.\n\nPlaintiff lost the case because he\n\n> cannot show that he holds a sincere religious belief that conflicts\n> with an employment requirement.\n\neven though he alleges that\n\n> the \"Firey Cross\" tattooed on his arm is one of that church's seven\n> sacred symbols\n\nThe crux of the defendant's failure is that he\n\n> does not present admissible evidence, or even contend without\n> evidence, that being required to cover up his tattoo at work conflicts\n> with his religious beliefs, or that he told Gunite about any conflict\n> with his beliefs and Gunite's demand that he cover his tattoo. Mr.\n> Swartzentruber doesn't satisfy the first and second elements of a\n> prima facie case.\n\nThe atheist male hat\\-wearer would at a minimum have to contend that he has a deep\\-seated belief about the nature of the universe that he must (whatever the claim is). It is settled First Amendment law that a \"religious belief\" does not have to be theistic. [This page](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1318/atheism) sets forth the case law and reasoning leading to the conclusion that atheism must be treated as a religion. See [Kaufman v. McCaughtry](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1467028.html) and citations therein. That court observes that\n\n> a religion, for purposes of the First Amendment, is distinct from a\n> \u201cway of life,\u201d even if that way of life is inspired by philosophical\n> beliefs or other secular concerns. A religion need not be based on a\n> belief in the existence of a supreme being (or beings, for\n> polytheistic faiths) nor must it be a mainstream faith\n> \n> \n> Without venturing too far into the realm of the philosophical, we have\n> suggested in the past that when a person sincerely holds beliefs\n> dealing with issues of \u201cultimate concern\u201d that for her occupy a \u201cplace\n> parallel to that filled by \u2024 God in traditionally religious persons,\u201d\n> those beliefs represent her religion. \u2002We have already indicated that\n> atheism may be considered, in this specialized sense, a religion. \u2002\n> See Reed v. Great Lakes Cos. (\u201cIf we think of religion as taking a\n> position on divinity, then atheism is indeed a form of religion.\u201d). \u2002\n> Kaufman claims that his atheist beliefs play a central role in his\n> life, and the defendants do not dispute that *his beliefs are deeply\n> and sincerely held*.\n\nThis sketches the claims that a person would have to make in order to rely on a Free Exercise exception to a general rule.",

Under what circumstances is he most likely to successfully argue that he should be allowed to keep his hat on, based on the precedent set by the hijab case?\n\nA) If he can prove that his hat-wearing is directly tied to his atheistic beliefs about the nature of the universe\nB) If he can show that removing the hat would cause him extreme emotional distress\nC) If he can demonstrate that his hat-wearing is a cultural tradition\nD) If he can prove that the hat has special significance to him personally, unrelated to any belief system\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The key to successfully arguing for religious accommodation, even for atheists, lies in demonstrating a sincerely held belief that occupies a place of \"ultimate concern\" in one's life, comparable to the role of God in traditionally religious persons. The courts have established that atheism can be treated as a religion for First Amendment purposes.\n\nOption A is correct because it most closely aligns with the legal precedent. If the atheist can show that his hat-wearing is intrinsically tied to his atheistic beliefs about the nature of the universe, it would be analogous to the Muslim women's argument about wearing hijabs.\n\nOption B, while potentially sympathetic, does not necessarily relate to a belief system and might not meet the \"ultimate concern\" threshold.\n\nOption C relates to culture rather than belief, which is distinct from religion in First Amendment considerations.\n\nOption D, like B, doesn't connect the hat-wearing to a broader belief system or worldview, which is crucial for this type of accommodation."

It also wouldn't really be relevant in a *Daubert* hearing which goes to the reliability of the field and methodologies relied upon in general, not to the way that a particular expert chooses to apply those methodologies to the particular facts of the case before the court.\n\nYou could argue that the evidence is more or less reliable as a result and explain why this is the case in non\\-technical terms to a trier of fact (i.e. to a jury in a jury trial, or a judge in a bench trial). One could also introduce discussion of these underlying factual issues or a frequentist analysis to impeach or rebut the testimony of an expert witness giving testimony on a frequentist basis about its accuracy.\n\nThe weight given to the admitted evidence is in the exclusive province of the trier of fact.\n\nA Bayes Theorem analysis would be inadmissible at trial because it would intrude on the authority of the trier of facts to be the sole person or persons weighing the evidence and determining its credibility. This is because Bayes Theorem is essentially a specific methodology for determining how much weight to give evidence based upon prior experience outside the circumstances upon which admissible evidence has been presented at trial that is used to generate a Bayesian prior.\n\nBut Bayes Theorem is not really within its domain of applicability in the context of something as global as a guilt/innocence determination in a criminal case which is too complex for that to be applied with the kind of scientific certainty that posing the question in that manner suggests. So, this rule is basically a wise one.\n\nWhen the law wants to apply something comparable to a Bayesian prior into a legal analysis, the usual form that this takes in legal doctrine is some sort of rebuttable legal presumption (e.g. the docrrine of *res ipsa loquitor* in tort law). These presumptions may either be established by statute, or arise at common law through a line of case law decisions, a method quite different from the way that Bayesian priors are developed in probability and statistics.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of using Bayesian analysis for forensic evidence in U.S. courts, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Bayes' Theorem can be directly introduced as evidence in criminal trials to determine the reliability of forensic evidence.\n\nB) While Bayes' Theorem cannot be introduced directly, it can be used in a Daubert hearing to establish the reliability of forensic methodologies.\n\nC) Bayesian analysis is inadmissible in trials because it would intrude on the trier of fact's authority to weigh evidence, but non-technical explanations of evidence reliability can be presented.\n\nD) U.S. courts regularly use Bayesian priors in legal doctrine, applying them in the same way as statistical analysis.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage states that Bayes' Theorem analysis would be inadmissible at trial because it would intrude on the authority of the trier of facts to weigh evidence and determine credibility. However, it also mentions that one could argue about evidence reliability in non-technical terms to a jury or judge. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that Bayesian analysis cannot be introduced as evidence in U.S. courts. \n\nOption B is also incorrect; the passage mentions that Bayesian analysis wouldn't be relevant in a Daubert hearing, which is about the general reliability of methodologies, not specific applications.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the legal system does use something comparable to Bayesian priors in the form of rebuttable legal presumptions, these are developed through statute or common law, not through statistical analysis as in true Bayesian priors."

All this happens via email communication with the court's clerk.\n\nThen, a judge, without any advance notice, considers the adjournment application alone in chambers and delivers decision out of the blue in which, although her Honour accepts Bob's reasoning re reason Y failing, nevertheless grants the adjournment application because...\n\n> \"the officers of X will be closed from December 23rd 2020 to 18th January 2021\\.

While the judge's actions in using information not presented in the application and not giving Bob a chance to respond may raise concerns about procedural fairness, this alone is unlikely to constitute actionable bias. Judges do have considerable discretion in scheduling matters, and using general knowledge about law firm practices (like holiday closures) isn't necessarily improper. However, it would have been better practice to allow both parties to address this information before making a decision.\n\nOption A is too extreme, as a single incident of questionable procedure doesn't automatically indicate bias requiring recusal. Option B overstates judicial discretion, which, while broad, is not unlimited and should still follow principles of procedural fairness. Option D presents a more ideal procedure, but failing to do so doesn't necessarily make the judge's conduct improper or biased, especially in a routine scheduling matter."

At least in some States. Is that correct?\n\nIf correct, how far in the process does it have to go before it applies? If a politician has simply announced an intention to stand for a certain party, can he then withdraw and stand as Independent?

See [the Wikipedia article \"Sore loser law\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_loser_law) for more detail on such laws.\n\nSome states achieve the same effect by having registrations for the general elections on the same date as for the primary, so that it is not possible for a candidate to know that s/he will lose the primary in time to file for the general election.

So here is our imaginary situation :\n\nA person is driving an SUV, and suddenly sees somebody lying on the road and not moving, as if he is either dead or passed out or drunk sleeping. It is too late to break. The driver could make a split second decision : either to immediately turn the steering wheel to the side to avoid running over the person on the ground, in which case he would damage his SUV by going off\\-road and hitting various obstacles, (but the speed is not so high to threaten the life of the driver himself), or \\- simply run over the person believing he is already dead, so why not at least save the damage to the SUV. The driver (who is kind of scumbag), loving his SUV, decides that the guy on the ground is already dead and runs him over.\n\nNow I will give some important \"rules\" in this case that I would like you to take as facts and answer as if they were true :\n\n* Once the person is run over with SUV, he is definitely dead now.\n* There is absolutely no way to establish forensically (or by any other means) whether the person was dead or passed out or drunk before he was ran over. (Lets forget that there is toxicology that could establish alcohol level and all that stuff \\- imagine simply that we just can't know whether he was dead already).\n* At the moment the person was ran over, he did not react in any way (in a sense that he did not scream or something similar, so we again, can not know whether he was already dead). There are no any kind of clues that suggest anything \\- how long has he been lying on the road, there are no alcohol bottles nearby, nobody knows him \\- he has no family/friends or anyone he called etc. \\- in other words again \\- we absolutely cannot establish or even guess in any way whether the person was already dead before being run over.\n* Driver explained perfectly honestly what happened, so the court/police/prosecutor know exactly what happened as I have described \\- they know everything you know reading this :)\n\nSo how would the driver be prosecuted for this \"potential murder\" ? If the court can not in any way establish whether the person was already dead or not, can driver be charged with murder ? Is there such thing as \"potential murder\" in law ? Or will the person be considered dead already, in which case the driver \"just\" mutilated the dead body of a man ?\n\n**Edit : some additional explanation about the question**\n\nThank you all for great and detailed answers. Just if you were curious, this question relates to some thoughts of my friend and myself, related to abortion actually. This is how we were thinking : if science can not give us a definitive answer (the definite scientific proof that is universally agreed upon) when the fetus becomes alive (at what week), and it is allowed for us to perform abortion at 12th week, then the abortion is like running over a person on the road in the above question, because :\n\n* Once the abortion is performed, the fetus is definitely dead (or not alive).\n* We cannot in any way be sure (universally agree \\- beyond reasonable doubt as you professionally put it) whether he was alive or not before the abortion.\n\nTherefore there is no crime in performing abortion while not knowing whether the fetus was alive before the abortion.\n\nWe were interested whether this would be something like \"potential murder\" as I called it in the question. Thanks to your answers I conclude that if it so happens that fetus was actually alive right before 12th week, than I guess something like \"unproveable involuntary manslaughter\" was committed since it can not be proven that fetus was actually alive (although it was) before abortion. This is equivalent in the question to running over alive person, who either passed out or was drunk, killing him, but without knowledge or evidence of him being killed. On the other hand, if fetus was not alive right before 12th week, that is equivalent to running over a guy that is already dead (or not alive), so no damage or crime whatsoever was done anyway.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No.\n===\n\nI'm going to assume we're talking about the US, where being convicted of a crime requires proof \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Thus, our hypothetical friend has NOT committed murder. Nor has he committed manslaughter (as this too requires that somebody die) or attempted murder or manslaughter (as that requires an intent that the person should die). If it could be proven that the person our hypothetical scumbag ran over died as a result of being run over, our hypothetical scumbag would likely have committed negligent homicide or involuntary manslaughter; however, as these imply a lack of intent, they lack \"attempted\" versions (see People v. Hernandez, [http://law.justia.com/cases/colorado/court\\-of\\-appeals/1980/76\\-813\\.html](http://law.justia.com/cases/colorado/court-of-appeals/1980/76-813.html) though state laws differ and some may be weird). In short, he has not committed any flavor of murder or manslaughter.\n\n**So, what other enterprising charge or legal proceeding might we be able to level against him? I'm sure one exists. ~~I'll edit it in once I find it.~~**\n\nCivil suit for wrongful death\n=============================\n\nNormally, our hypothetical scumbag would find himself on the receiving end of a wrongful death lawsuit. This would require that he **(1\\)** owed the dead man a duty of care (which he clearly did; all motorists are obliged to exhibit reasonable care in operating their motor vehicles) and that he **(2\\)** breached that duty (which he presumably did), but also that **(3\\)** this failure caused the death of the guy he ran over (which you have stipulated that we cannot \"even guess,\" which precludes a \"preponderance of the evidence\" (the standard for civil matters)) and that **(4\\)** that person's death has caused actual, quantifiable damages to the plaintiff (which it can't as \"nobody knows him\").\n\nReckless driving charge\n=======================\n\nIn most states, our hypothetical scumbag's behavior meets the threshold for reckless driving. For example, in VA law:\n\n> \\[In reckless driving cases, e]ither the driver is believed to have driven recklessly in a manner that threatened people or property, to have driven 20 miles per hour or more in excess of the speed limit, or to have exceeded 80 miles per hour, no matter the speed limit.\n\n[http://manassascriminalattorney.com/2015/10/can\\-reckless\\-driving\\-in\\-virginia\\-be\\-a\\-felony\\-charge/](http://manassascriminalattorney.com/2015/10/can-reckless-driving-in-virginia-be-a-felony-charge/)\n\nIn some states, this may be felony reckless driving; in others, it may be a mere misdemeanor.\n\nMisc links\n==========\n\n[https://www.virginia\\-criminallawyer.com/homicide\\-laws\\-virginia\\-code.html](https://www.virginia-criminallawyer.com/homicide-laws-virginia-code.html)\n[http://www.nolo.com/legal\\-encyclopedia/proving\\-wrongful\\-death\\-civil\\-case.html](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/proving-wrongful-death-civil-case.html)\n\nA forum discussion that (thank heaven) cited its sources:\n[http://www.top\\-law\\-schools.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t\\=155412](http://www.top-law-schools.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=155412)",

Given the circumstances described, where it's impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt whether the person was alive or dead before being hit, the driver cannot be charged with murder, manslaughter, or negligent homicide. These charges require proof that the driver's actions directly caused a death, which cannot be established in this scenario. However, the driver's decision to deliberately run over the person, regardless of their belief about the person's state, would likely meet the threshold for reckless driving in most states. This charge doesn't require proof of death but focuses on the driver's dangerous behavior. Options A and C are incorrect because they require proof of causing death, which is not possible in this scenario. Option B is incorrect because the driver's actions still constitute reckless behavior, even if a death cannot be proven."

This, along with the GDPR, are the key legislative references that relate to your question.\n\nOn 5th September 2017 the ECHR judged that it \"considers that States should ensure that, when an employer takes measures to monitor employees' communications, these measures are accompanied by adequate and sufficient safeguards against abuse\". This case set a precedent relevant to employee monitoring in Belgium.\n\nThis is most definitely a data protection or privacy law matter and the DPO should be consulted. If they have to do research, that shouldn't be your concern as that is their job. The company must support the DPO in what they need to do that job, as such is literally written into the GDPR. Furthermore, in this case it would, by my evaluation, be necessary to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for the monitoring activity, and if one has been done, it should document the recommendations and requirements or what is already in place.\n\nYou as an individual may also ask a question of the Data Protection Authority:\n\n* (NL) [https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/verzoek\\-klacht\\-indienen](https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/verzoek-klacht-indienen)\n* (FR) [https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/introduire\\-une\\-requete\\-une\\-plainte](https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/introduire-une-requete-une-plainte)\n\nYou might ask them about your position and liability as an employee, but I would be more concerned, if I were you, with verifying that your actions are above board rather than trying to cover your ass just in case they aren't. Do the right thing, even if that means questioning the direction you've been given.\n\nAD logons still identify the person logging on, and may include source IP, which is specifically listed in the GDPR as within the scope of 'personal data'. So while there may be a legitimate need to process such data, it needs to be gone about in the right way.\n\nActions taken by an employee are taken by the organisation in terms of processing personal data, so whatever you are asked or ordered to do, will be done by the company. If you are being offered no legal justification for doing so, you might document the direction you are given and question it respectfully, pointing out that if found to be unlawful, it is the company that would be in trouble, all while knowing that should there be for example an unfair dismissal, you have a record of who asked you to do what, how you challenged or questioned it, and what was the outcome.",

This is the most appropriate first step because:\n\n1. The documentation emphasizes that this is \"most definitely a data protection or privacy law matter and the DPO should be consulted.\"\n2. The GDPR and Belgian privacy laws require careful consideration of employee monitoring activities.\n3. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may be necessary, which the DPO would be responsible for conducting or overseeing.\n4. The DPO can provide guidance on the legal requirements and safeguards needed for such monitoring.\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediately providing the logs without proper legal consideration could violate privacy laws.\n\nOption C is inappropriate as personal investigations are not the role of a systems engineer and could lead to legal issues.\n\nOption D, while less invasive than full activity logs, still involves personal data and requires proper legal justification before being shared."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Overview:**  \n\nI purchased three new smartphones from a large, well\\-known, phone company on 11/27/2015\\. Each phone qualified to receive $300\\.00 in promotional credits after trading in a separate smartphone in good working condition. In this case, I'd receive $900\\.00 in credits after all was said and done.\n\nI've spent the past 6\\-7\\+ months trying to get these credits. I've talked with *literally* 50\\+ different respresentatives over 30\\+ separate days. My family and I have spent dozens of hours trying to work with the store, the phone reps, in chat, etc. and I'm burnt on putting more effort into this. This is a very cut\\-down synopsis of the chronology:\n\n* The first month was solely trying to receive the promotional codes after the phones were activated. Repeatedly calling/driving to the store to check on this and being told to wait. Eventually the codes had to be manually created since they agreed the codes were not actually processing.\n* The second/third month was various attempts to bring in phones to redeem the credits with. Multiple stores over multiple days couldn't get the codes to go through. Dozens of hours into calling to try and resolve this. Eventually, after the two months they agreed the codes were defective and that they'd manually credit the promotion to me after taking my three trade\\-in phones.\n* The fourth/fifth month was waiting out the billing cycles and keeping ahead of checking on my status. Nothing went through and I was even told they didn't have a record of where the phones I brought in were due to no tracking number.\n* The sixth month has been my ongoing attempt to voice my complains over how long this has taken. I've wrote a formal letter to their correspondence team and called multiple times to try and come to some kind of settlement before considering legal options. It's been two weeks and I haven't received any formal response to my letter or calls.\n\n**Questions:** \n\n* What, if any, legal boundary have they crossed by not having this resolved in a timely manner; or by having such issues with the entire process (still ongoing)?\n* Would punitive charges/compensation be possible if I brought this to small claims court? If not, would it be better to arbitrate/mediate to try for compensation?\n\nI hope these questions aren't too broad and that I was clear enough in my information. I'm ultimately trying to find the best way to move forward and recover. I've missed enough work over fighting this that even the $900\\.00 I'm trying to resolve doesn't cover the lost wages.\n\n**Update:** (06/03/2016\\)  \n\nI ended up calling and explaining the urgency on how I wanted to speak with someone about resolving this. I was told that the two weeks I waited wasn't a guarantee and I could send another letter directly addressing a specific team if I wanted a formal and quicker response.\n\n**Update:** (06/09/2016\\)\nAfter days of back\\-and\\-forth of trying to get in touch with their Executive Relations Team, they offered the $900\\.00 in promotional credits and a mere $100\\.00 credit as compensation for the, now, 40\\+ hours of time I've put in. I'm planning to go through arbitration to take advantage of their arbitration clause\u2014 if the arbitrator deems compensation higher than what was offered, the value is raised to a *minimum* of $5,000\\.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In light of the details you give, no bright legal lines have been crossed. Many legal lines are thin and dull, and can only be discerned by a practicing attorney, if then, and I would say that there's nothing we could add that wouldn't constitute the illegal practice of law, when it comes to the matter of you succeeding in a lawsuit. We also can't advise about the likelihood of punes in small claims court, but we can tell you what the law is. In [Gage v. Hagen](https://www.wicourts.gov/ca/opinion/DisplayDocument.html?content=html&seqNo=14832), Gage sued in small claims court asking for nominal damages of $1 and punitive damages of $4,999 (thus keeping it in the $5,000 small claims court threshold). The small claims court dismissed on a \"technicality\" which was not that they can't award punitive damages (the argument was \"one cannot sue for punitive damages if only nominal compensatory damages are found\"). The appeals court overturned that summary judgment. In Wisconsin, there isn't a specific limit on punitive damages and small claims court (and only a legal professional can advise you as to the likelihood of prevaling given your particular circumstance).\n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nUser662852's point about going as far up the food chain as you can is correct. Phone talk isn't much good, formal letters are. Phone support people frequently say things that they don't know. Put in writing what go gave them, what you were promised, provide as much proof as you can of this, say why you believe you are entitled to something (that is, don't treat it as obvious, *be explicit* as you would be, were you to file a case in court), and request action by a specific (reasonable) date \\-\\- 10 business days is a common reasonable time to act. Such correspondence is often sent registered or certified, which conveys the message \"this is serious business\".",

The answer suggests that pursuing arbitration or small claims court could be viable, depending on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction. The post also mentions that in some jurisdictions, like Wisconsin, punitive damages may be possible in small claims court. However, the likelihood of success would depend on the particular details of the case and would require professional legal advice. The answer also emphasizes the importance of formal written communication and escalating the issue within the company before pursuing legal action. Therefore, option C is the most accurate representation of the situation based on the information provided."

The law states that simply acting as an officer or employee is enough to constitute a crime, regardless of whether the person obtains anything of value.

According to the information provided, the \"not guilty\" verdict can be entered as evidence in the defamation case.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Ontario, Canada, a tenant has been renting a property for 18 months but has never received a receipt for their rent payments. The tenant now requests receipts for all past payments. According to Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act, what is the landlord legally required to do?\n\nA) Provide receipts for all 18 months of payments, free of charge\nB) Provide receipts only for the most recent 12 months of payments, free of charge\nC) Provide receipts for all 18 months, but can charge a reasonable fee\nD) Refuse to provide any receipts as too much time has passed\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Section 109 of Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act, a landlord must provide a receipt free of charge to a tenant or former tenant upon request. However, subsection (2) specifies that for former tenants, this only applies to requests made within 12 months after the tenancy terminated. While this tenant is still current, the same 12-month limitation would likely apply to past payments. Therefore, the landlord is legally required to provide receipts for the most recent 12 months of payments, free of charge. The landlord is not obligated to provide receipts for payments made more than 12 months ago, cannot charge for the receipts, and cannot refuse to provide any receipts at all."

One of the siblings (sibling A) has debts (relating to child support \\+ possibly others).\n\nThe parent (who currently owns \\+ lives in the house) is at a fairly old age.\n\nIn the event that the parent passes away and the house is left to be inherited, does the debt \\+ child support that (sibling A) owe to the government / state have any effect on the inheritance share of the remaining siblings (the other two)?\n\n**Where the siblings reside:** Two siblings including **sibling A** currently reside in Poland, while another sibling resides in another country (non EU).\n\n**Who lives in the house currently:** The remaining parent (still alive).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This will depend on the specific jurisdiction, but in general, if the house is left jointly to A, B, and C, an A has debts to the government which A cannot otherwise pay, A may be compelled to sell his or her share and use some or all of the proceeds to pay those debts. B \\& C's shares should not be affected. \n\nIf A has private debts and a judgment has been obtained against A, A's share may also need to be sold to help satisfy the judgment.\n\nHowever, if B \\& C want to retain the house rather than sell it, they may have to buy A's share. In that case it would be wise to obtain an independent appraisal of the house, or some other independent method of setting a value on it, as the government may not accept B\\&C's decision as to the value. (They may need to do this anyway, to value the house for tax purposes.)\n\nIn most US states, child support is primarily owed to the custodial parent, not to the government. However, if support is unpaid and the custodial parent has received governmental assistance, in some jurisdictions the government may take action against the non\\-custodial parent to collect and offset the cost of the benefits. In some jurisdictions, if support is unpaid, the government may act to collect it on behalf of the custodial parent.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of an inherited house in West Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland, left equally to three siblings (A, B, and C), where sibling A has outstanding debts including child support, what is the most likely outcome regarding the inheritance if the parent passes away?\n\nA) Sibling A's debts will be equally distributed among all three siblings, reducing each sibling's share of the inheritance.\n\nB) The government will seize the entire house to satisfy Sibling A's debts, leaving no inheritance for any of the siblings.\n\nC) Siblings B and C's shares will remain unaffected, but Sibling A may be compelled to sell their share to pay off debts.\n\nD) The inheritance will be frozen indefinitely until Sibling A's debts are paid off through other means.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, when property is inherited jointly, each heir's share is typically treated separately. In this case, Siblings B and C's shares should not be affected by Sibling A's debts. However, Sibling A may be compelled to sell their share of the inherited property to satisfy outstanding debts, including child support owed to the government. This allows for the debts to be addressed without impacting the inheritance rights of the other siblings. Options A and B are incorrect as they assume unfair consequences for the siblings without debts. Option D is also incorrect, as freezing the entire inheritance would unfairly impact all siblings and is not a standard practice in such situations."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Germany, what is the primary distinction between running a business as an individual and owning a company that runs a business, in terms of liability for business debts?\n\nA) There is no difference in liability between the two scenarios\nB) In both cases, the individual is fully protected from personal liability\nC) As an individual running a business, you have more protection from debts than as a company owner\nD) As an individual running a business, you are personally liable for all debts, while as a company owner, you generally have limited liability\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The key difference lies in personal liability. When running a business as an individual, you are personally responsible for all business debts. However, when you own a company that runs a business, you generally have limited liability, meaning your personal assets are protected from business debts, provided you've fulfilled your legal duties as an owner/director. This includes the responsibility to stop incurring debts when you know the company can't pay them. It's important to note that this protection isn't absolute, and professional legal and accounting advice is crucial in navigating business financial difficulties."

The right of residence of family members of a Union citizen who are not nationals of a Member State shall be evidenced by the issuing of a document called \u2018Residence card of a family member of a Union citizen\u2019 no later than six months from the date on which they submit the application. A certificate of application for the residence card shall be issued immediately.\n\nThe card is evidence of the right to reside (and, under Art. 23, to work). The card is not the source of that right. (This is why it's called a \"card\" rather than a \"permit.\") Rather, the source of the right is found in Chapter III, which is perhaps to lengthy to quote here, but it's worth noting that the right of residence for up to three months (Art. 6\\) exists even without any obligation to obtain a residence card.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, it may be difficult to find formal employment without the card for administrative reasons, but if you were to do work, for example informally, that should be lawful. This of course implies that you are legally permitted to look for work before you receive the card.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their right to work and seek employment?\n\nA) They must wait until they receive their physical residence card before they can legally look for work or attend job interviews.\n\nB) They can look for work and attend interviews, but cannot start working until they receive the physical residence card.\n\nC) They have the right to work and seek employment as soon as they arrive in Ireland with their EU spouse, regardless of whether they have received their physical residence card.\n\nD) They can only look for work but cannot attend interviews until they receive their physical residence card.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the EU Free Movement Directive (2004/38/EC), particularly Articles 10 and 23, the right to work for family members of EU citizens is independent of any physical document. The residence card is evidence of the right to reside and work, not the source of that right. The right exists as soon as the non-EU spouse arrives in Ireland with their EU spouse. While practical difficulties may arise in formal employment without the physical card, the legal right to work and seek employment exists from the moment of arrival. Therefore, not only can they look for work and attend interviews, but they technically have the right to work even before receiving the physical residence card."
