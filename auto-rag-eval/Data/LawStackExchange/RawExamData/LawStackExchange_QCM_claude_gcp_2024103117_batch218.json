This sounds equivalent to the famous case of [Katko v. Briney, 183 N.W.2d 657 (Iowa 1971\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katko_v._Briney). A shotgun trap was set up in an abandoned house owned by Edward and Bertha Briney. A thief broke in and was seriously injured.

Briney.\n\nD) The man would be protected from liability under the Castle Doctrine, which extends to vehicles in some states.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. This situation is comparable to the Katko v. Briney case, where property owners were held liable for injuries caused by a trap set for intruders. Even though the flashbang was intended to protect property, using such a device that can cause harm to others, even potential criminals, can result in civil liability. The property owner's right to protect their belongings does not extend to setting up potentially harmful traps. Options A and D are incorrect because they assume legal protections that don't typically apply in these situations. Option B is incorrect because the liability isn't dependent on whether the person was actually breaking in, but on the potential for harm to any person."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9669/is-there-a-law-in-the-us-that-requires-you-to-ask-someone-how-old-they-are-befor", "docs_id": 9669, "title": "Is there a law in the US that requires you to ask someone how old they are before asking them on a date?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If someone is at a bar/restaurant talking to someone, and they accidentally ask them to make plans not knowing they're under age, is there a law that requires them to know their age first (i.e. carding)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To my knowledge and having conducted a number of searches of databases of legislation using a variety of queries, there are no laws requiring persons in the US to ascertain the age of anyone prior to asking them on a date (and actually no laws relating to \"dates\" at all).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding legal requirements for ascertaining someone's age before asking them on a date in a bar or restaurant setting?\n\nA) There is a federal law requiring individuals to verify the age of a potential date before making plans, commonly known as the \"Date Responsibility Act.\"\n\nB) State laws vary, but most require individuals to ask for ID before requesting a date from someone who appears to be under 30 years old.\n\nC) There are no specific laws requiring age verification before asking someone on a date, but bartenders are legally obligated to inform patrons of the ages of all customers.\n\nD) There are no laws in the US that specifically require individuals to ascertain someone's age prior to asking them on a date in any setting, including bars and restaurants.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

Is it correct that failure of the Federal Constitution's Supremacy Clause to explicitly mention court decisions mean these do not form part of the \"Supreme law of the land\"?\n2. Is is correct that a Supreme Court decision only binds the parties to the case before it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> To what extent do the decisions of appellate courts in the US (both\n> Federal and State), and particularly decisions of the US Supreme\n> Court, bind those who were not parties to the case?\n\nA published opinion of a court regarding questions of law is binding precedent with respect to all issues necessarily decided by the court to resolve the issues presented to it in a case arising in a court whose decisions can be appealed to it (in a court whose decisions can be appealed to a court that can be appealed to it).\n\nThus, U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decisions are binding precedents for the U.S. District Courts in its circuit (and on the bankruptcy courts and bankruptcy appellate panels in its circuit). Bankruptcy appeal panel decisions are binding on U.S. District Courts and U.S. Bankruptcy Courts in the appellate circuit, but are inferior to U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decisions.\n\nState supreme court decisions are binding on all state courts. Intermediate state court of appeals decisions are binding on the state trial courts whose decisions may ultimately be appealed to intermediate state courts of appeal (all of them if there is one intermediate state court of appeal, but only some of them if there are multiple intermediate appellate court districts in that state) and all courts to which appeals are taken to state courts if appeals from those state courts in non\\-appellate cases may be appealed to intermediate state courts of appeal.\n\nA U.S. District Court, in one of the rare cases in which there is a direct appeal of right to the U.S. Supreme Court (e.g. election law cases) is still bound by the binding precedents of its circuit on any issue decided in the case upon which the circuit has binding precedents.\n\nSimilarly, for example, in Colorado courts of limited jurisdiction called county courts have their decisions appealed to courts of general jurisdiction called district courts, but further appellate review of a county court decision is made to the Colorado Supreme Court rather than to the Colorado Court of Appeals, an intermediate appellate court. But, despite that, Colorado Court of Appeals precedents are still binding in county courts in Colorado, because the District Courts to which it appeals are themselves required to treat Colorado Court of Appeals decisions as binding precedents.\n\nBut, federal court decisions on matters of state law (usually in diversity jurisdiction cases) are only persuasive precedents on these state law matters. Thus, if the (federal) U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado in a diversity case has to rule on a question of state law, a Colorado Supreme Court decision is more authoritative than a U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit decision on the same subject, even though either would be a binding precedent on the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado.\n\nConversely, a decision of a state's intermediate court of appeals is not binding upon federal courts on matters of state law, although they are highly persuasive. *See, e.g., Clark v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co.*, 319 F.3d 1234, 1240\\-1241 (10th Cir. 2003\\). A federal court may ignore an otherwise binding precedent of an intermediate state appellate court if the federal court concludes that the decision of that court was decided contrary to the likely holding of the state's highest court. *See, e.g., DigitalGlobe, Inc. v. Paladino*, 269 F. Supp. 3d 1112, 1122 (D. Colo. 2017\\). If a federal court is unsure how an issue of state law would be resolved in a state court, such as in a state law case of first impression upon which the state has no binding precedents, it can certify that legal issue to the state's highest court for a definitive resolution of the state law issue presented.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions are binding on all courts in the United States as to matters of federal law including interpretations of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDecisions of a court that does not have appellate authority over the court making the decision, unpublished decisions of a court, decisions of a court on issues not necessary for it to decide in the case before it which are called *dicta*, and authorities other than case decisions, statutes, and regulations, are merely persuasive authority. Some courts don't allow citations to unpublished decisions at all.\n\nThere are a few federal forums where this is particularly tricky. The National Labor Relations Board, the U.S. Tax Court, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (none of which are Article III federal courts), each serve as unified trial courts with a national territorial scope in their subject matter areas. But appeals from their decisions are to whichever of the twelve U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the case arises (D.C. and Circuits 1\\-11\\). In those forums, the question of which circuit's decisions are binding and which are merely persuasive authority for the NLRB, Tax Court or BIA depends upon where the particular case before it arose.\n\n> And to what extent are Federal Court decisions binding on state\n> officials and courts?\n\n*Precedents and Federalism*\n\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions on questions of federal law including federal constitutional law and treaties, are binding on all courts. Federal court decisions on matters of state law are not binding on anyone but the parties to the lawsuit.\n\nFederal court decisions on question of state law are not binding precedents on state courts.\n\nThe corollary of these rules, which is subtle, is that a decision of a U.S. District Court in a state, or of a U.S. Court of Appeals in a Circuit that includes a state, on a question of federal law, is not a binding precedent on state courts in that state or circuit on that question of federal law.\n\nFor example, suppose that the Colorado Supreme Court determines, without resorting to a separate state constitutional right, that the 4th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution's exclusionary rule for unlawful searches and seizures require physical evidence obtained in reliance on a lie from a law enforcement officers to be excluded from evidence at trial as an unlawful search, but the 10th Circuit in which Colorado is located reaches the opposite conclusion, and the U.S. Supreme Court has not ever made a ruling definitively resolving that issue. In that situation, the meaning of the 4th Amendment in state court criminal trials would be different from the meaning of the 4th Amendment in federal court criminal trials in the same state, even though this is a question of federal law.\n\nThis isn't to say that a binding 10th Circuit precedent on a question of federal law wouldn't be extremely persuasive authority to a state court on that issue of federal law in the State of Colorado (which is located in the 10th Circuit). But it still wouldn't be a truly binding precedent.\n\n*The Effect of Court Rulings On Parties To Federal Cases And Federalism*\n\nFederal court decisions on questions of federal or state law are binding on the state officials affiliated with the governmental official or entity that is a party to the federal court case.\n\nFor example, a decision of the federal U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado in a case to which a Denver policeman is a party (with respect to something done by him in his official capacity as opposed to his private life), is binding upon all officials in the City and County of Denver, and on the City and County of Denver as an entity, even if only the policeman is a party to the lawsuit in federal court. But that ruling wouldn't be binding on the State of Colorado or the City of Aurora, which are different governmental entities.\n\nDetermining whether a particular government official from an agency, or a particular agency, is part of a state government, or of a particular local government, or is an independent governmental entity in its own right (e.g. in the case of the C.U. Regents of the University of Colorado), is not always a self\\-evident question and often would require fact specific legal analysis to determine.\n\nIf someone is ordered to do irreconcilable things by both a federal court in an order binding that person, and a state court in an order binding that person, the federal court order prevails over the state court order.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A state supreme court has ruled that a certain search and seizure practice violates the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the application of these rulings?\n\nA) State courts must follow the federal circuit court's ruling on this 4th Amendment issue.\nB) Federal district courts in the state must follow the state supreme court's ruling on this 4th Amendment issue.\nC) State courts may continue to apply their supreme court's interpretation of the 4th Amendment in state cases.\nD) The state supreme court must reverse its decision to align with the federal circuit court.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. State courts may continue to apply their supreme court's interpretation of the 4th Amendment in state cases. This is because federal circuit court decisions on federal law issues are not binding precedents on state courts, even within that circuit. While the federal circuit court's decision would be highly persuasive, the state supreme court's interpretation of the U.S. Constitution can differ from that of the federal circuit court in the absence of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the specific issue. \n\nOption A is incorrect because state courts are not bound by federal circuit court decisions on federal law. \nOption B is incorrect because federal courts are not bound by state court interpretations of federal law. \nOption D is incorrect because the state supreme court is not required to reverse its decision to align with the federal circuit court, as the circuit court's decision is not binding on state courts for federal law issues."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/91586/is-a-copyright-claim-diminished-by-an-owners-refusal-to-publish", "docs_id": 91586, "title": "Is a copyright claim diminished by an owner&#39;s refusal to publish?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Alan is aware of an obscure old book that is out of print, and republishes it.\n\nBrenda Books, Inc. objects and sues Alan since they own the copyright.

And I usually get one of two answers:\n\n1. We're too busy to do something like that on contingency right now.\n2. We don't think the odds of prevailing and collecting merit the cost of pursuing that on contingency.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but I follow the industry well enough to know that there are a lot of lawyers lacking for work. If you're an unemployed lawyer, or a solo practitioner without a full caseload, then isn't *any* non\\-frivolous case with a positive potential payout worth pursuing? And if you're a firm with the sunk cost of offices, staff, subscriptions, etc., wouldn't you always want those assets working at 100% capacity?\n\nTherefore, why doesn't every practice *want* a queue of potentially profitable contingency cases that they can chip away at when they don't have a 100% paid workload? I can understand that if one took a contingency case into litigation, and then paid work came along, one wouldn't want the contingency case distracting from the paid work. But can't one accept a case on contingency *and* \"as time permits,\" so that in such an event one would simply drop the contingency case (or, if it looked promising, hand it off to some other lawyer in a slump)?\n\nAre there practical or professional reasons this is not standard practice?\n\nFrom an economic perspective this seems odd: As a client if I don't have the means to pursue a legitimate claim, then (on principle) I might be willing to give up to 100% of any winnings to a lawyer who does pursue it. As a lawyer, if I have a positive expected return to a contingency case, I'd like to have the option of picking that up when I can't find other work (to within some error term \u2013 perhaps the alternative of running a coffee shop out of my office, or taking a minimum\\-wage writing job.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two basic problems with your theory:\n\n1. You say:\n\n> can't one accept a case on contingency and \"as time permits,\" so that in such an event one would simply drop the contingency case (or, if it looked promising, hand it off to some other lawyer in a slump)?\n\nNo. you can't. If you take a case, then drop it because a more profitable case comes along, you might well be disbarred, not to mention sued by the client you just threw over. You might even spend a night in jail for contempt\\-\\-in many cases, you are not allowed to simply drop a case without the court's permission.\n\nSo if you accept a contingency case, you accept it until (1\\) the case is over, (2\\) the client fires you, (3\\) you, the client, and the judge all agree you can quit, or (4\\) you can convince the judge you should be allowed to quit regardless of the client's wishes. Until then, you are stuck with the time and expense involved with handling the case.\n\n2. \"Expense\" is the second problem. You seem to be under the impression that once you've paid for the office and the coffee maker, there's no downside in pursuing a contingency case.\n\nBut filing and pursuing a lawsuit cost money, not just time. Copying and coding documents costs money. Stenographers for depositions cost money. Just filing a lawsuit often costs a few hundred dollars. Hell, in a major lawsuit, you will probably spend a few hundred dollars just on postage. And a lot of commercial litigation now involves expert witnesses, whose fees start at a few hundred dollars an hour. Normally that all gets billed back to the client, but on a contingency case the lawyer often absorbs most or all of it.\n\nSo from a lawyer's perspective, even if he or she is not working right now, \"any positive payout\" isn't enough. It has to be enough of a payout, and enough of a chance of winning, that the expected reward is worth paying, potentially, the cost of a trial, and forgoing other work if things get busy again while you're trying to prep your contingency case for trial.\n\nThe fact is, for a lot of this sort of case\\-\\-even if it looks \"potentially profitable\" to a non\\-lawyer\\-\\-is going to be less profitable, in the long run, than spending the same amount of time playing golf with people who might actually pay you by the hour to do something.\n\nAlso, two quick notes:\n\n1.

It's a very broad law and covers everything from a flagpole or barbeque to airports and railways and has a hierarchy of controls from State Environmental Plans (SEP) down to Local Environmental Plans (LEP) and finally the Building Code of Australia (BCA) and Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA). Electricity and gas installations are covered by different laws.\n\nHowever, for housing, there is a SEP that allows them to be constructed without Development Consent providing they comply with all relevant LEPs and the BCA \\& PCA. These so\\-called Complying Developments (CD) must be notified to the council but do not need the Council's approval. If you want to break the rules, you can't use this process and must go for a full Development Approval (DA). For completeness, there are also Exepnt Developments and State Significant Developments but neither are relevant here.\n\nOnce you have your DA or CD, you need to engage a Principal Certifying Authority (PCA) \\- a private certifier who ensures that the work is in compliance with the DA/CD and the BCA. They will issue a Construction Certificate (CC) which details the work that needs to be done. When its all finished to their satisfaction, they will issue an Occupation Certificate (OC) and the building can now be used.\n\nYou state that you have a DA (or maybe a CD) for a house and shed but only the shed was built and then fitted out as a house. Prima facie, this isn't compliant because it isn't what was approved. I am willing to bet that there is no OC and possibly no CC.

Both parties will also attempt to demonstrate that their opponent's case is a crock of s\\*%t: that the evidence is inadmissible, that the admitted evidence doesn't support the facts alleged, that the law isn't as the other party says etc.\n\nThere are specific judicial procedures in each jurisdiction that dictate how this all happens.\n\nIf it is clear on the face of it that the plaintiff's case *is* a crock of s\\*%t the defendant will file a motion to dismiss and, if the court agrees, that's the end of it.\n\nIf the trial proceeds to completion then the trier of fact (jury or judge as applicable) will decide what weight to give the evidence presented and decide on the [Preponderance of the Evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)#Preponderance_of_the_evidence) (Balance of Probabilities) if the plaintiff has proved their case.

This makes me wonder what exactly keeps common law alive. I imagine many judges follow precedent because they have a personal respect for tradition or the merits of the common law system. But I also imagine many judges would want to ignore precedent to enact their own opinions.\n\nSo what prevents such judges from doing so? Are there local or state laws that require them to follow precedent? Can ignoring precedent get them fired? Or do they just fear backlash from the public or their peers if they break tradition?\n\nOr is the premise of my question flawed and judges break precedent all the time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Decisions that break with precedent do happen with some regularity, but far \"from all the time\" in the US. When they do happen, they are generally only at the top level of a state or federal court system, that is a State supreme Court (or equivalent, some states use a different term) or the US Supreme Court.\n\nThere are several factors which discourage judges from simply ignoring precedent.\n\nFirst of all, all the training a lawyer receives teaches him or her to respect precedent, and to find rules by examining past cases. precedent is literally the stuff with which a lawyer works, rather more than the wording of statutes (although those are also important).\n\nSecondly, as a lawyer works as a litigator, judges will usually ground their decisions on precedents, particularly in appellate cases, explaining their decisions largely in terms of how they conform to or extend precedents.\n\nThirdly, if a lower court judge fails to follow precedent, that judge will often be criticized by an appellate judge or justice, often in the course of an opinion overturning the lower\\-court judge's ruling. This does not feel pleasant to such a judge.\n\nFourthly, decision that fail to follow precedent are often (although not always) criticized by legal scholars, particularly in law review articles and treatises.\n\nFifthly, lower\\-court judges who often fail to follow precedents, are less likely to be recommended by senior judges for promotion to appellate positions. However, the actual appointments are controlled by politicians (in most cases) not other judges, so this factor may not be as strong it it would first seem.\n\nOnly once a judge gets to the level of the Supreme Court of a state, or the Federal Supreme Court, is that judge (now a Justice) expected to alter precedents as needed, and most justices have said that they make such changes only reluctantly.\n\nI am not aware of any US state or federal statute or regulation that specifically;y requires judges to follow precedent.\n\nThe most common way to alter precedent is not to overrule or ignore it, but to **distinguish** a prior case. This happens when a judge says something like:\n\n> In the previous case of *A v B* when had situation X which lead to outcome Q. But in this current case we have the very different situation X1\\. In the case of X1, the outcome should be S instead of Q.\n\nIf the new case becomes persuasive the old case *A v B* may apply to only one specific set of facts that almost never comes up, and the new rule apply to almost all other possible situations. The old case may cease to be cited or applied without ever being formally overruled.\n\nAnd, of course, where the rule is statutory, it may be changed if the legislature alters the law. If the rule is constitutional, it may be changed by a constitutional amendment. For example the 1830s case *Barron v Baltimore* held that the US bill of rights did not apply to the states, only to the Federal Government. But after the 1868 14th amendment, courts started to **incorporate** much of the bill of rights into the Due process clause of the 14th, and apply it against the states. This took place gradually, mostly during the period starting with 1898, up until about 1970, but with some incorporation coming as late as 2010 (*Heller*)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes how precedent is typically altered in the U.S. legal system?\n\nA) Judges at all levels regularly ignore precedent to enact their own opinions.\nB) Lower court judges frequently overrule existing precedents set by higher courts.\nC) Judges distinguish new cases from prior precedents by highlighting key differences in facts or circumstances.\nD) State legislatures pass laws requiring judges to follow or break specific precedents.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the most common way to alter precedent is not to overrule or ignore it, but to \"distinguish\" a prior case. This involves a judge explaining how the current case differs from a previous precedent in key aspects, potentially leading to a different outcome. This method allows for gradual evolution of legal principles without directly overturning established precedents.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while decisions that break with precedent do happen, they are not regular occurrences at all levels of the judiciary. Such breaks typically occur only at the highest levels of state or federal courts.\n\nOption B is incorrect as lower court judges are generally expected to follow precedents set by higher courts. Failing to do so could result in criticism from appellate judges and potentially harm their chances for career advancement.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage states that the author is not aware of any U.S. state or federal statute that specifically requires judges to follow precedent.

And who decides such things in general?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is there something in the language of the act that makes sexual\n>  harassment a civil rather than a criminal offence?\n\nYes. \n\nLaws that create criminal offenses have to have language to the effect of \"violation of this law is punishable by up to X years of imprisonment or a fine of up to $Y\", or \"violation of this law is a Class Z felony.\"\n\nSometimes it is not entirely clear if violation of a law can form a basis of a private civil lawsuit, or if it can only be enforced by government officials, from the language of the statute alone. When it is unclear the courts have to resolve that ambiguity.\n\nIn rare instances, it may be clear that some parts of a statute have criminal penalties, but due to unclear wording and punctuation in the statute, it is hard to tell precisely which parts of the statute these criminal penalties apply to, and in those cases, courts also have to resolve that ambiguity.\n\nThere is also some conduct that it is constitutional to punish with a civil penalty, but not as a crime that can result in incarceration. For example, it is unconstitutional in most states to incarcerate someone for failing to pay a debt, but there can be a civil penalty for failing to pay a debt. Courts decide if these constitutional limitations are violated.\n\nSimilarly, while Congress can enact both crimes and civil penalties, there are some governmental bodies, like school districts or water boards, that have the power to enact certain civil penalties, but do not have the authority to create new crimes.\n\n> Was that up to the lawmakers to decide, or is that just something that\n>  evolved out of the ways the courts and prosecutors responded to sexual\n>  harassment claims? And who decides such things in general?\n\nGenerally, this is decided by lawmakers. Obviously, however, anyone can lobby legislators to take one position or another.\n\nAlso, the fact that something has a civil penalty does not necessarily mean that prosecutors aren't the people who enforce the law. Sometimes violations of the law prosecuted by prosecutors have civil rather than criminal penalties. For example, many tax law violations are prosecuted by government lawyers with civil penalties, but only a small minority of tax law violations are prosecuted criminally.\n\nFurther, it isn't uncommon for a type of offense, like securities fraud, to have both civil penalties and criminal charges available as remedies that can be enforced by prosecutors. And, when that happens, prosecutors get to decide which tool to use.\n\nFor example, even if exactly the same conduct could be prosecuted with either a civil penalty or a criminal charge, prosecutors might prefer a civil penalty because the burden of proof is much lower, the 5th Amendment protection against self\\-incrimination does not apply (you can refuse to testify but that fact can be used against you in a civil penalty case), and a defendant in a civil penalty case doesn't have a right to a lawyer at government expense. Also, enforcing a civil penalty generates net revenue for the government most of the time, while criminal punishments normally cost the government more money to carry out than any revenue the government may receive from the person found guilty for fines and court costs.\n\nOn the other hand, trying to enforce a significant enough civil penalty to discourage misconduct against someone who has no money or property may be a futile effort, while criminal sanctions could discourage misconduct from other similarly situated people in the future.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes the nature of sexual harassment laws under the Civil Rights Act and the decision-making process for civil versus criminal offenses?\n\nA) Sexual harassment laws are inherently criminal, and courts decide whether to prosecute them civilly or criminally on a case-by-case basis.\n\nB) The language of the Civil Rights Act explicitly states that sexual harassment is a civil offense, leaving no room for interpretation by courts or prosecutors.\n\nC) Lawmakers determine whether an offense is civil or criminal through specific language in the statute, but prosecutors have discretion in choosing between civil and criminal charges when both options are available.\n\nD) The classification of sexual harassment as a civil offense evolved solely from court interpretations and prosecutorial decisions, without input from lawmakers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage explains that lawmakers generally decide whether an offense is civil or criminal through the language used in the statute. Laws creating criminal offenses typically include specific language about punishments like imprisonment or fines. However, when a law allows for both civil and criminal enforcement, prosecutors have the discretion to choose which route to take based on various factors, such as the burden of proof, constitutional protections, and the potential for revenue generation or deterrence. This answer accurately reflects the interplay between legislative intent and prosecutorial discretion described in the passage.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because sexual harassment laws are not inherently criminal, and courts do not decide on a case-by-case basis whether to treat them as civil or criminal.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the passage does not state that the Civil Rights Act explicitly classifies sexual harassment as a civil offense.

About 1\\.5 years ago, I decided to pay month\\-to\\-month since I entered the housing market in search of a house (of course, not knowing that it would take this long to find a house). I found a house and I'm closing next month (August 15\\). The last short\\-term lease I signed with the company has a clause in the contract that states I must guarantee the month of September even though the contract is only valid through August. Basically it states that if a tenant can be secured for the month of September, the additional fee will be waived (the fee is equal to 1 months rent which is approx $2,500\\) if not, I will be required to pay it.\n\nIs this legal? Would this hold up in court if I decide not to pay and let it go to small claims? This clause seems self fulfilling and unreasonable. Unreasonable b/c they are passing off the cost to the previous tenant because they can't find a tenant for the next month. Self\\-fulfilling b/c it is extremely unreasonable to assume that you can fill the apartment immediately for the next month since typically apartments are repainted, carpets cleaned/replaced, and not to mention the normal process of vetting and securing a new tenant (e.g. my contract expires August 31 and next month begins September 1; 1 day to clean, paint, replace carpets and find tenant). In addition, paying month\\-to\\-month comes with a 20% increase in rent.

It is an exception to the age of capacity to consent to sexual conduct, not an exception to the capacity to consent to a contract.\n\nWhen children are very young (typically in the range of 7 to 12 as set by statute of common law, it is 6 in North Carolina) they lack the capacity to commit a crime, which has to do with the age of the offender and not the mutual ages of those involved.\n\n> Is the principle described above called something? How old is it? Did\n> the Romans apply a similar concept? The medieval Catholic church?\n\nThe principle that you described is a misunderstanding of the law and is incorrect. No jurisdiction has adopted it in the sense that you articulate. When these instances are not punishable as crimes they are not punishable for different reasons. So, the question of \"how old is it?\" is a category error that has no answer.\n\nThe medieval Catholic church did not have any criminal or contract jurisprudence. Both of those domains were handled by secular officials, usually either feudal lords or the officials of a \"free city\". In the medieval period, feudal secular law was often arbitrary and often came down to the personal whims of the individual holding the title. As @hmvsm appropriately notes, however, it did have doctrine about when a child was morally responsible for sins, but final adjudication of whether you sinned or not was ultimately determined in the afterlife, and the church doctrine of forgiveness of sins made the issue moot to a great extent.\n\nThe Roman Empire, of course, did have secular laws, but its laws in the area of contractual capacity, which are largely replicated by modern European civil codes, didn't contain the principle that you propose. To the best of my knowledge, the modern concept of statutory rape was unknown in the Roman world. The lack of hard age based cutoffs was, in part, because vital statistics record keeping was nowhere near universal, so many people did not even know their exact age in a legally provable manner.

What are the points of view on this currently dominant among US judges, prosecutors and attorneys?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Like most common law jurisdictions there are 3 sources of US law: legislative, judicial and administrative (except Louisiana, it has a Civil Law system).\n\nI *think* you are focusing on legislative or statute law but I will briefly cover the others first.\n\nJudicial Law\n------------\n\nJudicial or judge made law occurs when a court makes a judgement on a case about what the law means. In a common law jurisdiction such decisions are [binding](http://definitions.uslegal.com/b/binding-precedent/) on lower courts in the same jurisdictional hierarchy and [persuasive](http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/persuasive-precedent/) on the same level and higher courts and foreign courts. In the US foreign courts normally means courts in other US states that lack a binding precedent on the matter but courts can look to decisions in other common law countries like Canada, Australia, the UK etc.\n\nBecause courts interpret the \"common law\" their judgments usually reflect (in some way) community expectations. However, judicial systems are, by their nature, slow to change and while they track community expectations they do so with a time lag, say 20\\-30 years: the lag in time between when the judges making decisions now had their views on society fixed during their college years.\n\nJudicial law, in theory, stretches back to Anglo\\-Norman law with decisions building on (and occasionally knocking over) what has come before. In practice, this chain has usually been severed at some point (usually more than once) by the intervention of the legislature to correct what they saw as a \"failure\" in the common law. Subsequent common law builds on that statute like barnacles on a ship's hull (but without the negative connotation ... maybe).\n\nBy your terminology, such laws are almost always descriptive.\n\nAdministrative Law\n------------------\n\nIs the law created by the administrative arm of government using the powers explicitly granted by the relevant constitution, delegated by the legislature or derived from common law powers. For example, if a statute authorizes the levying of taxes on the value of real estate, it is usually left to the administrative branch to determine how to collect and use the data needed to arrive at a given property's value.\n\nBy your terminology, such laws can go either way. Establishing the land tax system example would be prescriptive, modifying it to match changing social circumstances would be descriptive.\n\nLegislative Law\n---------------\n\nLegislative or statute law is the laws passed by the legislature by whatever name that is known. They can only make laws within the bounds permitted by their constitutions but within those limits they are free to do whatever they choose.\n\nMany of the laws they pass are simply to enable the other parts of government to get on with their jobs \\- like giving them the money to pay the army or the judges or whatever. I guess these would be descriptive \\- of course, passing a law to say you can't pay the army would be very, very prescriptive.\n\nAside from that, while legislatures *can* pass a law about anything they generally only intervene when there is some \"mischief\" in society that the current laws are not addressing or are addressing in an unjust way. This happens all the time because society does not stand still: we didn't need laws about cell phone use in cars until there were cell phones being implicated in accidents.

However, for a simple cash transfer of $45,000 to a newly incorporated business, it's likely an unnecessary and overly complex approach. The cost of $3,000 to perform the roll-over is disproportionate to the amount being transferred. In most cases, entrepreneurs can simply deposit cash into their corporation's bank account as a capital contribution without needing such a complex tax maneuver.

When unauthorized users install or access the game using the cracked credentials, they typically have to agree to the terms of service, forming a contract.

Defamation involves false statements that harm someone's reputation.

I mean, do you lose your right to defend yourself if you make it look like your house is uninhabited? Are you obligated to signal to would\\-be burglars that you will shoot them?\n\nIn the case of Bryan Smith case, has the prosecutor established that the removal of his truck is done solely for baiting burglars?\n\nOne controversy in the case is that after he shot a burglar, he finish the job.\n\nI do not know how much of this got into a jury. However, I would have done the same if I were him. Soldiers in wars double tap because enemies they think are death (not just injured in legs), may actually still be alive and kill. There are cases of people stop beating up robbers thinking he won, only to have the robbers' friend stab him in the back.\n\nFor all Bryan Smith knows, those teenagers could be assassins sent by gangs to kill him. The boy and the girl may bring life grenade they can activate for suicide bombing. It may not be. But how does he knows?\n\nThe probability is small. May be 1%, or 2%. Still, why should a home owner risk his life for life of two worthless burglars? The safest thing to do is to just kill the burglars.\n\nWhy take unnecessary risks when your life is in danger by some people that's obviously up to no good?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If I remember the case correctly, he didn't make his home look uninhabited (that is nobody is living there) but as if the inhabitants had left (gone shopping etc.) to make it look attractive to burglars. \n\nHe then waited inside, armed with a gun, with the intent of shooting any burglars that might arrive. He shot the first burglar in the legs, and then proceeded to kill the unarmed and now defenseless burglar, who was lying injured on the ground and was in no position anymore to hurt him. He then did the same with a second burglar, shooting her in the legs, then shooting her multiple times, and when he found she was still alive, he shot her point blank in the face while she was lying on the ground. \n\nYou are asking the wrong questions. You are asking \"is it illegal to remove a truck\". It's not. What is illegal is to intentionally create a situation where you shoot people and try to claim \"self defence\". It can very well be argued that by luring burglars into your home with the intent to kill them, they are not actually illegal in that home, because you *wanted* them to be there. You can do many things that are each completely innocent but add up to a crime. \n\nActually, for everyone interested, I posted a question maybe last week or the week before whether you can be convicted for both first degree murder and second degree murder for killing a person, and it was exactly this case that inspired the question. \n\nWhat should he have done? If he hadn't lured the burglars in, I believe the case would have still been a double murder, since he killed both unarmed teenagers when they were absolutely no threat. It might not have been first degree murder since it would not have been premeditated. But he intentionally lured them in, making it premeditated (first degree) murder. \n\nIf he had only injured them, the fact that he lured them in could very likely have made this an assault. \n\nYou asked: \"Now that the burglars are in his house, what should he have done? \" Well, he got himself into a dangerous situation. Remember, he was convicted for premeditated murder. So just before he shot the girl in the head, he should have instead put the gun away and called police and an ambulance. It would have been one murder instead of two. Just before he shot the boy, he should have put the gun away and called police and an ambulance. It would have been just attempted murder. When he heard the first person entering, he should have called the police and waited. When the burglar came in sight, he should not have shot and injured him. \n\nIt's a similar question to \"if I try a bank robbery and there is an armed guard, what should I do\". The only legal thing to do is to drop your weapon and wait to be arrested. \n\nIf an armed burglar had appeared instead of two unarmed teens, well, he would have put himself into a dangerous situation. Just as the burglar would have no right to shoot even if a home owner points a weapon at him, he had no right to shoot, no right to self defense, since he had intentionally created the situation. Tough shit. That's what you may get if you plan a murder. \n\nResponding to some comments: @J.Chang Are you being serious? You are not allowed to make your house inviting to burglars, while waiting inside with the intent of killing them. Self defense only applies when a reasonable person would believe they are in danger. Reasonable persons don't think that a burglar comes in with the intent of blowing themselves up and taking the home owner with them. And no, you don't get to \"assume the worst\". Not when the worst is something no *reasonable* person would expect. \n\nThanks to Dale for pointing out that even for soldiers in a war situation, where different rules apply, deliberately killing a helpless enemy combatant is murder.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of Byron Smith, who was convicted of first-degree murder for killing two teenage burglars, which of the following actions would have been most likely to result in a different legal outcome?\n\nA) Calling the police immediately after injuring the first burglar, instead of killing them\nB) Removing more vehicles from his property to make it look more uninhabited\nC) Warning the burglars verbally before shooting them\nD) Assuming the burglars were armed with explosives and acting accordingly\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Option A is the most likely to result in a different legal outcome.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal ownership and disposition of the computer?\n\nA) John can keep the computer since he added his own money to upgrade it.\nB) John must return the computer to Sarah, but she must reimburse him for the $500 in upgrades.\nC) John can keep the computer if he pays Sarah the difference between its current value and his $500 investment.\nD) John must return the computer to Sarah without any compensation for his upgrades.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Based on the information provided, this situation most likely falls under one of two scenarios: either Sarah lent John the computer with the expectation of its return, or it was provided as payment for work John agreed to perform. In both cases, John would be required to return the computer.\n\nIf it was a loan, Sarah remains the owner, and John's obligation to return it is not affected by his personal investments in upgrades. If it was payment for work, John's failure to complete the agreed-upon tasks means he is not entitled to keep the compensation (the computer).\n\nThe fact that John invested his own money in upgrades does not change the fundamental ownership or the obligation to return the computer. In legal terms, this could be seen as a voluntary improvement to someone else's property, which typically does not create an ownership interest or right to compensation.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they assume John has some right to keep the computer or be compensated for his upgrades, which is not supported by the legal principles outlined in the original answer."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/23307/to-whom-does-the-german-impressumspflicht-apply", "docs_id": 23307, "title": "To whom does the German &#39;Impressumspflicht&#39; apply?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: 'Impressumspflicht' is a law in Germany forcing people running a website to publish personal information like name, address, email, telephone number and so forth.

Quoted translations provided by Google Translate.*\n\nTurns out the question \"Do I need an *Impressum*?\" is complicated. I'll start with examining the case for companies, then work down to the average private citizen.\n\nImpressum requirement\n=====================\n\nThe requirement for an online *Impressum* comes from the [Telemediengesetz (TMG) \u00a7\u00a05](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__5.html):\n\n> 1\\) Service providers are obliged to keep the following information readily available, readily accessible and constantly available for commercial, usually paid telemedia:\n> \n> \n> 1. the name and address under which they are established \\[...]\n\nApplicability based on country of origin\n========================================\n\nThe applicability of the TMG is described in \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0[2a](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__2a.html), [3](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__3.html). Thankfully, there is a [2013 court case](http://www.stroemer.de/index.php/entscheidungen/wettbewerbsrecht/1455-olg-hamm-urt-v-17-12-13-i-4-u-100-13-kreuzfahrtangebote) focused on these sections, involving an Egyptian company marketing cruises and not having a proper *Impressum* on their website. Also thankful is that law firm [mth Tieben \\& Partner summarized](http://www.mth-partner.de/wettbewerbsrecht-anwalt/internetrecht-zur-frage-ob-auslaendische-diensteanbieter-ein-webseitenimpressum-nach-deutschen-vorschriften-vorweisen-muessen/) this decision, because as it turns out, I cannot read judicial German.\n\nSummarizing their summary, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02a, 3 sets the standard that the required information is based on a country of origin principle (*Herkunftslandprinzip*), where if that country of origin is Germany, \u00a7 5 applies. However, this principle is rooted in EU directives, and as such is not applicable to non\\-EU countries. For these, the law falls back on the older principle of market location (*Marktortprinzip*). If the non\\-EU company advertises in Germany and thus participates in the German market, then it must have a valid *Impressum*.\n\nI'll note that, the TMG considers Germany to be the \"country of origin\" if the company is either registered in or has significant operations in Germany (see the given sections for specifics). This is not the same \"country of origin\" as is found in copyright law.\n\nApplicability to private website hosts\n======================================\n\nAs it turns out, an *Impressum* is not required for private non\\-commercial websites. However, as pointed out by this [Anwalt article](https://www.anwalt.de/rechtstipps/impressumspflicht-auch-fuer-private-webseiten-und-blogs_105215.html), the wording of the TMG makes it such that omitting an *Impressum* may often be illegal. In particular, [the definitions section](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__2.html) of the TMG provides very broad definitions of \"Service provider\" (*Diensteanbieter*): \n\n> Service provider shall mean any natural or legal person who provides his own or third\\-party telemedia for use or provides access to use; in the case of audiovisual media services on demand, service providers shall mean any natural or legal person who effectively controls the selection and design of the content offered,\n\nand \"commercial communication\" (*kommerzielle Kommunikation*):\n\n> Commercial communication means any form of communication which serves the direct or indirect promotion of the sale of goods, services or the appearance of an undertaking, other organization or a natural person engaged in trade, trades or crafts or a liberal professions; \\[...]\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nIn terms of variables like the one you suggest, the proper \"variable\" for companies is the country of origin. For private web hosts, I would argue that residency is the closest analogue to country of origin as defined in TMG \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02a, 3\\.

In this case:\n\n1. The blogger's German citizenship is not a determining factor.\n2. The location of the server in Germany doesn't matter for the Impressum requirement.\n3.

He did so both on the federally managed grounds and on the ME easement.\n\nMy questions regard the legal limitations and boundaries *of a LEO's* jurisdiction and how *criminal conduct* color the rules for jurisdiction. When the LEO violently assaulted the citizen *on the easement* is he out of his jurisdiction? Suppose for the sake of argument, the LEO has jurisdiction limited to the property with the easement in question. Under the general question of where or not jurisdiction ends in an easement a few specific questions come to mind:\n\n1. If a LEO acts entirely on the easement, due to events that happened entirely on the easement, does that have *any* impact on the legal authority of the LEO?\n2. Is there any immediate or long term legal consequence for an officer committing crimes or doing so egregiously (with or without qualified immunity) *while out of his jurisdiction* as opposed to doing so in his jurisdiction?\n\n* For instance, could a civilian defend himself against violent assaults from an officer while *out of the LEO's jurisdiction* that he could not legally defend himself from while the LEO were fully in his jurisdiction?\n* Are other officers bound by law to arrest or stop other officers committing crimes outside of the jurisdiction when they are normally allowed discretion to allow fellow officers to flout the law?\n* Does an officer loose the qualified immunity defense or other legal defense when doing illegal things out of his jurisdiction?\n\nAre there any important nuances to jurisdiction and law enforcement by LEOs that a first amendment auditor should be aware of?\n\n\\*\\*\\* VIDEO CONTEXT\nThe video show a first amendment auditor and legal activist taking video of a federal facility, U.S. customs and border patrol. Before he can enter the facility or say a word to anyone he is threatened by his soon\\-to\\-be asailaint, a federal LEO. I know this is illegal for the LEO to do, and so does the first amendment auditor. This is a matter of clearly established law. At this point it is likely only a civil matter because the officer has given prior restraint to limit the auditor's *clearly established* legal rights.\n\nThe auditor says \"Don't touch me!\", then the belligerent LEO repeatedly shoves, slaps, and threatens with frightening words. While the assaults/batteries happen the auditor is trying to explain the law and give notice of the DHS memo that verifies the auditor's right to record and then he threatens legal action with phrases like 'You're going to get fired/loose qualified immunity/etc for this!'\n\nI'm taking it for granted that the cop knowingly broke the law even before the easement. Certainly, he *should* have known. It seems like a civil matter at this point, *before the easement*, because cops are given special privileges while on duty that allow them to commit certain crimes without obstruction from civilians. \\*I'm not merely saying cops are legally allowed to do things that civilians cannot legally do. \\* I'm also suggesting that cops effectively can break the laws even they are under, as there are often laws against resisting an *unlawful* arrest even if this is a privilege to temporarily break the law it is nonetheless permission to break the law in often egregious ways at least while acting under the color of law. As other officers witnessing the crimes of fellow LEOs often have discretion, this is effectively a license to commit crime at least for a while. I'm not debating the merits of this, but merely stating what I believe to be relevant facts leading up the question of whether or not civilians can ever restrain criminally acting violent LEOs in any lawful way in the context of easement law.\n\nThe LEO went beyond what is his *normal* lawful jurisdiction for protecting against criminals not just by committing crimes himself, but by going into the easement of the property and into the public street. He pushed the auditor into the public street or highway \\- I can't tell which. He then threw the auditors equipment into the street. The auditor claimed this easement was not his lawful jurisdiction. So now I'm interested to know if any LEO is ever restricted in jurisdiction by an easement *in any way* and if federal LEOs like this one, who are normally restricted to enforcing laws on a property, are restricted *in any way* by easement laws. As a concrete example related to the video content, could this LEO observe a person peacefully walking along the easement and then shove him into traffic while having the full protection of laws that prohibit obstruction of *unlawful* officer action or could the auditor or civilian observers *legally* have defended the auditor in this simplified example by responding in kind by for instance restraining the belligerent LEO? For the sake of understanding the law, let's consider just the example of an auditor that was on the easement of the property the LEO has jurisdiction on but not ever beyond that.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\n\n* I'm *not* asking about the violent assault *while within his jurisdiction* except to contrast to the assault within his jurisdiction.\n* I'm *not* asking what is *prudent* for either an average citizen or a seasoned first amendment auditor and legal activist to do in this situation. These are rather questions of de jure law.\n* I'm *not* asking about the jurisdiction for a citizen to effect a legal citizens arrest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> When the LEO violently assaulted the citizen on the easement is he out of his jurisdiction?\n\nNo. Federal law enforcement officers' jurisdiction generally\\* includes the entire US. Federal and state jurisdiction are said to be [concurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_jurisdiction) with one another. If the federal law enforcement officer has a lawful basis to effect an arrest, the arrest can be effected on a state\u2020 highway easement.\n\n> Is there any immediate or long term consequence for an officer committing crimes or doing so egregiously (with or without qualified immunity) out of his jurisdiction as opposed to doing so in his jurisdiction?\n\nIf the officer were outside his jurisdiction (which isn't the case here) then the officer is generally treated as any other private individual. In this case, \"outside his jurisdiction\" means \"in another country,\" which brings up all sorts of additional complications that aren't really in scope here, largely because the laws and legal systems of other countries are different from those in the US.\n\n> Are there any nuances to jurisdiction and law enforcement by LEOs that a first amendment auditor should be aware of?\n\nThere are plenty, but perhaps the most prominent one, if the internet is any guide, is that an officer is not required to articulate the basis for reasonable suspicion or probable cause at the time of a Terry stop or an arrest. The time for this is much later, after a judge is involved. Arguing with an officer on this score is just going to make things worse. Instead, one should *cooperate* while stating one's objections clearly and calmly, especially making it clear that cooperation does not imply consent.\n\n---\n\n\\* Some categories of officers do have more limited jurisdiction: thanks to cpast for the example of park rangers, whose jurisdiction is essentially restricted to national parks. The officers in this case are CBP field officers. There is a wide misconception that CBP officers' jurisdiction is limited to within 100 miles of the border, but that 100\\-mile limit only applies to their power to board and search vessels and vehicles without a warrant in order to prevent illegal entry into the US. Their power to make warrantless arrests \"for any offence against the United States\" committed in their presence is not geographically restricted.\n\n\u2020 The [original video](https://youtu.be/JqTBFfcTEBs) was filmed in South Portland, Maine, and the roadway is a municipal street, [Gannett Drive](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y5Kb46im7T1i17Fi8), to be precise.

Federal law enforcement officers, including those from CBP, generally have jurisdiction throughout the entire United States. Their authority is not limited to federal property, and stepping onto a public street or easement does not change their jurisdictional status. The common misconception about CBP's 100-mile border zone only applies to certain warrantless searches, not to their overall jurisdiction or ability to make arrests. Any unlawful actions committed by the officer would be evaluated under the same legal standards, regardless of whether they occurred on federal property or a public street. Qualified immunity considerations would also remain the same. The key factors in determining the legality of the officer's actions would be the circumstances of the incident and whether the officer's conduct violated clearly established constitutional rights, not the specific location where the incident occurred."}}
