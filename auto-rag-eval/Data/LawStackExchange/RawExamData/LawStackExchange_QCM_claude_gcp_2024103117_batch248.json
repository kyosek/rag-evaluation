In case it is a successful idea, I don't want anyone (including myself) to be able to patent it. I'm retired and I'd rather simply share the idea openly.\n\nFor mainly traditional reasons, the strings of almost every type of guitar fan out towards the bridge. I suggest that precisely parallel strings would be an improvement for some styles. In [the following question](https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/109186/a-guitar-or-bass-with-parallel-strings) I published my idea.\n\n> ... I am publishing this idea here. If I have invented the idea of a\n> parallel\\-stringed guitar, I don't want anyone to patent it (including\n> me). This will stop any particular manufacturer from benefitting over\n> others. I do not want any financial remuneration for myself if this\n> turns out to be a good idea. This would apply to classical, acoustic,\n> and electric guitars.\n\n**Question**\n\nIs the simple publishing of an idea online, sufficient to stop others patenting the idea?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This has been answered several times on SE patents (called Ask Patents). Yes, publishing an invention theoretically keeps anyone from patenting it in the future. It is theoretical because it only prevents a a patent being issued if the patent examiner finds it in their search. Also the publication must explain the invention to a detailed enough manner. In the U.S. this is expressed as enough detail for someone skilled in the art to make and use the invention.\n\nIf it is not found by an examiner it is possible you, or anyone else, to bring it to the attention of an examiner in most jurisdictions. This would require you monitoring patent application publications but doesn't cost much money to do. After a patent is issued your publication can be used to attempt to invalidate it in some jurisdictions and also used an infringement defense in all jurisdictions.\n\nThe question on Music SE may not be detailed enough to constitute a publication of an invention. How does it work? You mention Hawaiian guitar \\- do they do this already, how is your idea different?\n\nOne thing to consider is that it might have already been the subject of an application by someone else.

The information provided states that publishing an invention theoretically keeps anyone from patenting it in the future. However, this is not guaranteed as it depends on whether the patent examiner finds the publication during their search. Additionally, the publication must explain the invention in sufficient detail for someone skilled in the art to make and use it.

How can she ensure that Bob has authority to lease the house? Or how can she make payment on the lease in such a way that she is protected against loss if it turns out that Bob does not have authority?\n\nThere is a notion in contract law of \"apparent authority,\" which presumably would be satisfied if Bob can show Alice the house. But who is left with the loss if it turns out that Bob did not have authority? Just because someone has keys to a house doesn't mean they actually have authority to lease it.

(So imagine the house is actually owned by out\\-of\\-town Zed, and Bob collects lease payments from Alice, Charlie, and Doug before disappearing.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Real estate ownership is a matter of public record throughout the United States, unless there are exceptional jurisdictions I don't know about, usually at the city or county level. So Alice could go to the county clerk's office (or, these days, probably their website), whose records would show that the property is rightfully owned by Zed, and might also include a home address or other contact information for Zed. Alice could then contact Zed and verify that Bob is Zed's authorized agent. Alice may have to iterate through several layers of delegation, e.g. if Zed hired property manager Yolanda, who subcontracted to Xavier, etc, etc, until she reaches the person who actually hired Bob.\n\nOf course, if Zed hired a property manager specifically to avoid being bothered by tenants, they may not be too pleased about all this, which could hurt Alice's chances of being approved to rent the property.\n\nIt is also possible that the property is owned by some shell corporation (e.g. Zedcorp LLC) which Zed set up to insulate their rental business from their other assets.

During a scene of a movie where they're reading out another character's rap sheet they mention 'attempted manslaughter'. As I understand it manslaughter is the unlawful but unintentional killing of another person through some sort of criminal negligence. Calling it **attempted** manslaughter, in my eyes, implies some sort of intent thus *attempted* and *manslaughter* seem to contradict each other. I'm just wondering is this some sort of technical mistake in the movie or is there such a crime as attempted manslaughter?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes\n---\n\nFor example, [s270AB](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/clca1935262/s270ab.html) of the [south\\-australia](/questions/tagged/south-australia \"show questions tagged 'south-australia'\") *Criminal Law Consolidation Act* 1935 says:\n\n> (1\\) Where\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) a person attempts to kill another or is a party to an attempt to kill another; and\n> \n> \n> (b) he would, if the attempt had been successfully carried to completion, have been guilty of manslaughter rather than murder,\n> \n> \n> he shall be guilty of attempted manslaughter.\n\nRelevantly in SA, voluntary manslaughter occurs when a victim dies as the result of an offence that would otherwise amount to murder, but the defendant\u2019s liability is reduced because of the presence of mitigating circumstances, such as provocation.\n\nSo, in circumstances of provocation (say) where the accused shoots at the victim but misses, attempted manslaughter is a possible charge.

According to the information provided, there are generally no legal requirements for creditors (such as banks) to notify customers before sending debts to collections.

For condominium associations organized before July 1, 1990, Washington law did not require incorporation. Therefore, the association's ability to refile Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws without owner approval depends on the provisions in the original Bylaws. These Bylaws would dictate who has the power to make such decisions.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because 100% owner approval is not necessarily required; it depends on the Bylaws.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the legal requirement for incorporation only applies to associations organized after July 1, 1990.

Such proofs are called *combinators*. Premises can be proofs, and a combinator can apply one of its premises to another.\n\nToday, I'm curious about the BCI combinator calculus. This calculus has three axioms, called **B**, **C**, and **I**:\n\n* **B**: (y \u2192 z) \u2192 (x \u2192 y) \u2192 (x \u2192 z)\n* **C**: (x \u2192 (y \u2192 z)) \u2192 (y \u2192 (x \u2192 z))\n* **I**: x \u2192 x\n\nThe reader may recognize these; **B** is [modus ponens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens), **C** swaps two premises, and **I** is a [tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)). Now, it is well\\-known folklore in computer science that BCI is a complete basis for simple linear logic (e.g. see [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/combinatory+logic#LinearAndAffine)). In more familiar language, this means that for any proof which only uses each premise exactly once (\"linear logic\"), there is a term which only uses **B**, **C**, and **I** as its ingredients and faithfully represents that proof. For a demonstration, consider Algorithm B at [this interactive Web page](https://www.cantab.net/users/antoni.diller/brackets/intro.html); if the input only uses each letter once, then the output will only use **B**, **C**, and **I**.\n\nWhich terms, if any, are eligible for copyright? In particular, is there a smallest copyrightable term of BCI? I know that this is a jurisdiction\\-dependent question.\n\nIf this question seems silly, note that for the BI calculus (just containing **B** and **I**) the answer is hopefully \"none\" and for the SK calculus (which is equivalent to typical programming languages in expressive power) the answer is hopefully \"some\"; I figure that asking about a non\\-trivial intermediate calculus is interesting.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\nNo meaningful intellectual property protection is available for BCI calculus, BI calculus, or SK calculus.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\n### Copyright Protection\n\n> There are several categories of things that can\u2019t be copyrighted. A\n> common thread to most of them is that they lack the necessary\n> creativity to be eligible for copyright.\n> \n> \n> 1. Ideas This includes procedures, processes, systems, methods of operation, concepts, principles, or discoveries. Plans, methods, and\n> devices, are also not protectable. However the particular manner in\n> which they are expressed or described in a writing can be copyrighted.\n\n([Source](https://www.newmediarights.org/business_models/artist/what_can%E2%80%99t_be_copyrighted))\n\nCopyright can protect a particular expression of an idea (e.g. the layout and exact language of a page in a textbook about BCI calculus that is not the only possible way to present it), but not a concept or system like BCI calculus.\n\nThe same reasoning means that it is probably not possible to copyright BI calculus or SK calculus, even though a particular textbook expressing them in a particular way might be possible to protect with copyright.\n\nAlso, since BCI calculus is derived from publications in mathematics journals made in 1924 and 1930 by its two lead creators, anything derived from the original publications would probably be in the public domain by now.\n\nIn the United States:\n\n> every book and tale published before 1927 is in the public domain;\n> American copyrights last for 95 years for books originally published\n> between 1927 and 1978 if the copyright was properly registered and\n> maintained.\n\nIt is likely that the copyright for the 1930 journal article in question was not registered and maintained, as it was not routine practice for mathematical journals to do so at the time. Even if it was, the copyright for the 1930 paper would be almost spent and would expire in the year 2025\\.\n\n### The Alternative Of Patent Protection\n\nPatents can protect ideas of ways to implement something, but also has limitations that probably exclude BCI calculus as something that could be patented:\n\n> Certain things can never be patented, regardless of how well they meet\n> these four standards. They include the elements, theoretical plans,\n> laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas. So patenting\n> fire or the wheel is out, though some people have tried.\n\n([Source](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/business-and-contracts/intellectual-property/patents/legal-guide/why-cant-you-patent-an-idea))\n\nAny patent received for BCI calculus prior to the year 2002 would also have expired bringing the subject matter of the patent into the public domain.\n\nAlso, since BCI calculus is something that has already been disclosed to the public, it is barred from patentability as a form of existing prior art. The existence of prior art would also prevent BI calculus and SK calculus from being patented.\n\n### Trade Secret Protection Considered\n\nIt also probably isn't possible to protect BCI calculus (or BI calculus or SK calculus) as a trade secret, because it has been disclosed to the public and hence isn't secret.\n\n([Source](https://www.wipo.int/tradesecrets/en/tradesecrets_faqs.html))\n\n### Trade Mark Protection Considered\n\nIt might be possible to protect the name \"BCI calculus\" as a trademark under which services teaching people to use it are marketed, but that wouldn't protect the underlying system or concepts.\n\nBut there is a strong argument that this would not even qualify as a trademark because it is merely descriptive and does not have a \"secondary meaning\" particular to a particular user of the label for the system.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is correct regarding intellectual property protection for combinatory calculi like BCI, BI, and SK?\n\nA) BCI calculus can be copyrighted as a unique system of logical reasoning.\nB) The term \"BCI calculus\" could potentially be protected as a trademark for educational services.\nC) SK calculus, being more complex, is eligible for patent protection as a novel computational method.\nD) BI calculus terms can be copyrighted if they demonstrate sufficient creativity.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect.

In order words, if someone sued for copyright infringement and the person sued admits that they copied the copyright protected work, they can use these exceptions to avoid having legal liability.\n\nOne of the exceptions is the permission from the copyright owner to use the copyright work. This can be either in the form of affirmatively given permission to use the copyrighted work in a particular way (called an \"express license\" to use the copyrighted work), or in the form of permission to use the copyrighted work that can be inferred from context (called an \"implied license\" to use the copyrighted work).\n\nAnother of the main exceptions is \"fair use\". If the way a copy of a copyrighted work is used constitutes fair use, the person using the copyrighted work without an express or implied license to do so it not liable for copyright infringement.\n\nOf course, while you don't need more than one exception to the general rule to avoid liability for copyright infringement, you can have more than one.\n\nFor example, you can use copyrighted work in a way that would constitute \"fair use\" and not give rise to liability for that reason if you were sued, even if you can't be sued anyway because you already have been given permission by the owner of the copyright to use the copyright in the way that you did.\n\nIt isn't a case of a contradiction. It is a case of a general rule that has exceptions.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A university professor uses a short clip from a copyrighted film in her lecture without obtaining explicit permission from the copyright holder. The film's copyright terms explicitly state that no part of the film may be reproduced without written consent. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The professor has unequivocally violated copyright law and is liable for infringement.\n\nB) The professor's use of the clip is automatically protected under fair use, regardless of how it was used in the lecture.\n\nC) The professor's use may be protected under fair use, but this would need to be evaluated based on specific criteria, despite the copyright terms.\n\nD) The copyright terms override any possibility of fair use, making the professor's use illegal regardless of context.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because fair use is an exception to copyright infringement that exists independently of the copyright holder's stated terms. While the film's copyright terms explicitly prohibit reproduction without consent, fair use is a legal doctrine that can supersede these terms under specific circumstances.\n\nThe professor's use of the clip may be protected under fair use, but this would need to be evaluated based on the four factors of fair use: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for the copyrighted work.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of fair use. Answer B is overly broad, as not all educational uses automatically qualify as fair use. Answer D is incorrect because it misunderstands the relationship between copyright terms and fair use doctrine.

Someone will have more details, but for example in EU law if you move away from the place you last lived together, you can only file for divorce in the country where your partner is living (in this case, India). Annullment is a much more serious matter than divorce, so I doubt any American court would take this case: Annulment would mean that a US court would have to decide that an Indian registry office didn't do its job right. \n\nSecond, **A** needs convincing evidence. Frankly, \"masculine appearance\" and \"typical masculine voice\" are just opinions and therefore not evidence. Even if the court were convinced that **B** has a \"masculine appearance\" that's not evidence for being a male. **A** has to show the evidence, and as half of us know and the other half learned in their biology lessons, there is some pretty convincing evidence that someone is a man which **A** didnt' mention. And I'd ask anyone not to edit this out, because it is quite essential to the case. **B** doesn't have to visit a doctor and get a statement that she is a woman (which would destroy any case immediately), because based on the available evidence, **A** will lose the case anyway. \n\nOn the other hand, after that court case has finished, **B** can at any time (after appropriate waiting times according to US law) come to the USA and file for divorce.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the case of A seeking divorce from B, whom he married in India but now lives in the U.S., which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal proceedings?\n\nA) A U.S. court would likely take on the case and grant a divorce based on A's claims of B's masculine appearance.\n\nB) A can easily file for an annulment in the U.S. as the marriage was conducted in India under Hindu law.\n\nC) B does not need to provide any medical evidence to defend against A's claims, as the burden of proof lies with A.\n\nD) A can successfully file for divorce in any U.S. court regardless of jurisdiction issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Presumably, you will have to articulate some *legitimate interest* (Art 6(1\\)(f)) that outweighs the visitors privacy interests. Per the GDPR's data minimisation principle, you can only process the minimum data necessary to achieve the purpose of processing so you will have to find a good reason why auditing access to your portfolio is so important.

While a CV page may seem close to a purely personal purpose, the fact that it processes personal data from members of the public (not just family or close friends) means it likely falls under GDPR jurisdiction.

If the car stays in Texas it should be registered in Texas, but if the car is with you in PA it should be registered in PA.\n\nOne reason for this is that insurance coverage is based on the address where the car is normally kept. If the rates are lower at the place in Texas where your father lives, having it registered there could constitute insurance fraud. I once knew a person who registered his car at a family member's home in a different part of the same state where traffic was lower and insurance rates were less. When this came out he had to pay the difference in insurance rates plus a fine.\n\nMost states require that you register a car within a limited time after moving into the state with it.

In Texas, any town smaller than 5,000 population is a general law town. General law towns have very little authority to create laws, but they can have a police force to enforce state laws. A city in Texas with population larger than 5,000 people can enact a charter by popular vote and become a home rule city.

This is because the jury is only supposed to hear evidence in the courtroom during the trial, and so to decide facts based only on what they hear/see in there.\n\nIn [bench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_trial) (or \"judge\\-alone\") trials there is no jury; the trier of fact is the judge. Although more commonly used in civil cases, these trials often occur in criminal cases too \u2014 where the defendant wants it / consents to it. Judges, by nature of their job, see all the evidence, admissible or not, at various stages before the trial. The trial rarely gives them any new information about the alleged facts themselves \u2014 they're mostly occupied with testing whether the information is to be believed by seeing the witnesses say it and respond to cross\\-examination.\n\nThe procedure differences between jury and bench trials go beyond who the trier of fact is. Say, in New Zealand, in [judge\\-alone trials](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2011/0081/latest/DLM3360171.html), counsel are not allowed to make submissions as to how the facts are to be interpreted and as to what inferences are to be drawn \u2014 unless the judge out of the blue gives them the opportunity to. In [jury trials](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2011/0081/latest/link.aspx?id=DLM3360145), there is a requirement to file formal statements from the witnesses, and so on.\n\nScenario\n--------\n\nSomeone is charged with a crime which is comprised of 2 elements. That is, the charge is proved only if *both* the elements are proved.\n\nBefore the trial, a witness (**W**) for the prosecution (**P**) signs a formal document in which they say 2 statements (assertions) of fact: S1 and S2\\. *If* adduced at trial and accepted by the trier of fact, S1 proves the 1st element of the charge, S2 proves the 2nd.\n\nThe document is filed with the court and becomes what makes the case progress to the trial at all: a judge (**J**) sees the document, pays explicit attention to S1 and S2 and, based on them, rules that there *is* a [case to answer](https://www.defence-barrister.co.uk/submission-of-no-case-to-answer/).\n\nAt the trial, W gives oral evidence (there is no consent to written evidence\\-in\\-chief as s [83(1\\)(b)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2006/0069/latest/DLM393914.html) could allow). **P asks them questions to the effect that S1 is voiced but fails to ask them questions to elicit a proper voiced version of S2** (say, for some reason, it slips out of P's attention that W haven't yet properly voiced S2 \u2014 P closes their case fallaciously assuming W have already voiced S2\\).\n\nOn cross\\-examination, the defence (**D**) asks W about the document (but not, Heaven forbid, specifically about S2 in it). W confirms that the document only contains their true and correct statements and was indeed signed by them.\n\nThat said, W neither explicitly confirms nor denies S2 at the trial because no one asks them about it: P forgets to ask, D avoids to ask, and J does not bother to ask (even though they have [the power](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2006/0069/latest/DLM393931.html) to ask where they think justice requires so). S2 gets confirmed only indirectly \u2014 by virtue of W confirming that the document was indeed authorized by them.\n\nAt the end, J (the same one who previously saw S2 in the document which W has now been cross\\-examined about), rules that:\n\n* Sub\\-scenario A: the charge is proved as S2 was before the court in the formal document by W now confirmed by them as true as correct. The defendant is convicted; or\n* Sub\\-scenario B: the charge is not proved because W did not voice anything about S2\\. The defendant is acquitted.\n\nQuestion\n--------\n\n**Should the *written* S2 have been deemed adduced / put in evidence at the trial?**\n\nI can see it both ways but I can't find a solid citation in favour of either approach.\n\nFor a \"No\" answer, one could say:\n\n> Even if the written S2 was to be deemed admissible (which itself is a\n> question), it was not to be deemed *adduced* by default. This is because\n> the judge in a bench trial is to play like they're a real jury to the\n> fullest extent possible. This includes \"forgetting\" anything about the\n> case that they did not hear/see during the trial \u2014 even if that has\n> been filed with the court before them and would have been admissible\n> if explicitly brought before them during the trial.\n\nFor a \"Yes\" answer, one could say:\n\n> The written S2 was admissible: it was not hearsay because the person\n> who had made it *was* a witness on the stand and they were\n> cross\\-examined about the document containing it.

Mere paraphrasing of any of the two example answers above won't be useful.\n\n*Any* common law jurisdiction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In a criminal trial, any document that is admitted in evidence should be explicitly identified by the judge as an **exhibit**. In the given scenario, the witness statement did not become an exhibit, so S2 is not in evidence and D should be acquitted.\n\nIn modern litigation in common law jurisdictions, the usual practice is for evidence in chief to be given orally in criminal cases, and in writing in civil cases. Often there are statutory provisions authorising this, but the common law itself may be enough. Fundamentally, a witness statement is hearsay (evidence of a previous representation), and the parties can waive the hearsay rule in civil, but not criminal, cases.\n\nEven in a civil case, judges should confirm when documents have been admitted in evidence (as opposed to merely filed in court for some pre\\-trial purpose) by assigning exhibit numbers. Alternatively, for witness statements which consist of a written narrative in admissible form, the procedure described by Dale M should make it clear that the evidence has been admitted as though the witness had read it out orally. Because the rules of evidence are not applied as strictly in civil cases, there are sometimes cases where it is genuinely unclear whether a document on the court file was admitted in evidence.\n\nWhile the scenario posed in the question involves a mistake by the prosecutor, in criminal cases it is common for witnesses to fail to give oral evidence in accordance with their written statements. This may be described as the witness not **coming up to proof**, and it might allow for the witness statement to be admitted in evidence and assigned an exhibit number, as a [prior inconsistent statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_consistent_statements_and_prior_inconsistent_statements) (an exception to the hearsay rule).

When acting in that capacity, the directors and officers owe a duty of loyalty to the non\\-profit, and can't put the interests of other businesses with which they are involved above the interests of the non\\-profit.\n\nThe regulations are more specific, and there are some additional requirements that are imposed, in the case of a 501(c)(3\\) that is a \"[private foundation](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/private-foundations)\" (which is defined, more or less, as receiving most of its donations from a small number of big donors who aren't non\\-profits themselves).

Are they still \"Protected\" for a certain period of time? Generally, what happens?\n\nThe question is in context of a company that developed an old PC video game from 2004, which then dissolved itself back in 2015\\.\n\nI'm currently trying to figure out if the rights to use said \"Game Assets\" would be legal now, and if not, who to actually reach out to in the case of a company no longer existing or operating at all.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When a company stops existing for whatever reason, then its assets (physical, financial, intellectual or otherwise) don't stop existing. When the company dissolves voluntarily, those assets usually go to the owner(s) of the company. When the company got bought up and integrated into another company, the buying company will usually own them. When the company went bankrupt and got liquidated, then they will often get sold off to the highest bidder. \n\nAnd then there is the question of who actually owns the IP rights to a specific game asset. Often there is not just one legal person which worked on a game. In addition to the developer, there might also have been a separate publisher who might or might not own IP rights. There might have been investors in the background who financed the project and now own some copyrights. Sometimes there was more than one publisher. And sub\\-contractors might have been involved in the development who only licensed their assets but retained copyright.\n\nSo unfortunately it is often not really clear what happened to IP assets of a defunct company. People who *might* have the rights will often not care much about them until something happens which gives new commercial value to those assets. So even if you are unable to determine who owns the assets to a game, as soon as you start using them, someone might show up with a plausible claim to the IP rights and demand money from you. Such lawsuits can get really messy and really expensive.\n\nFor a good example for just how much of a goose chase you might be in for when you want to legally obtain the rights to a game from a defunct company, check out [the story of the re\\-release of No One Lives Forever](https://kotaku.com/the-sad-story-behind-a-dead-pc-game-that-cant-come-back-1688358811). tl;dr: multiple game companies said \"*Maybe* we have the rights to the game according to some contract buried in some file cabinet, but we don't care enough to find out.

When a company dissolves, its assets, including intellectual property like game assets, don't automatically become public domain. They are typically transferred to the company's owner(s), sold to other entities, or distributed among creditors in case of bankruptcy. However, for older games, the ownership situation can be complex due to multiple parties potentially having rights (developers, publishers, investors, subcontractors). As the example of \"No One Lives Forever\" shows, even the companies themselves may be unsure about who owns the rights. This makes it challenging, but important, to determine the current rights holder before using such assets to avoid potential legal issues.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because dissolution doesn't automatically place assets in the public domain. \nAnswer B is incorrect because there's no automatic 70-year protection period after company dissolution for such assets. \nAnswer D is incorrect because the CEO doesn't automatically gain ownership of company assets upon dissolution."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24527/is-running-tor-software-legal-in-europe", "docs_id": 24527, "title": "Is Running Tor software legal in Europe?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is the legality of doing the following, under European and, in particular, Spanish law?\n\n* Using the Tor browser\n* Setting up a Tor relay\n* Setting up a Tor exit node\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under Spanish law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of Tor technology?\n\nA) Using the Tor browser is legal, but setting up a Tor relay or exit node is prohibited.\nB) Setting up a Tor relay is legal, but using the Tor browser or setting up an exit node is illegal.\nC) All activities related to Tor (using the browser, setting up a relay, or setting up an exit node) are explicitly illegal.\nD) There are no specific laws prohibiting the use of Tor browser, setting up a Tor relay, or setting up a Tor exit node.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, there are no specific laws in Spain or under broader European legislation that prohibit the use of Tor browser, setting up a Tor relay, or setting up a Tor exit node.

If you want people to not use it, all you have to do is *not* license it and rely on [basic copyright](https://law.meta.stackexchange.com/q/541/4501). You can post source code on a web page, just as you can post an essay on a blog, and that is conventionally interpreted as granting permission to look. A license is needed to actively copy. The basic idea of a license is to state what actions you allow, so for instance if you allow people to download and read offline, and nothing else, they you would say that. If you want to allow people to compile (when applicable), say that. And so on. If the point is to disclaim liability for damage, you should read up on [warranty disclaimers](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1410/do-warranty-disclaimers-in-software-licenses-carry-any-legal-weight). The [CC license scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license) is popular because it allows you to fiddle with distinctions.

The question of which court a lawsuit should be filed in is often one of convenience when the lawsuit is filed; it is not that unusual for this to be a different jurisdiction than the natural jurisdiction when the contract was made. For instance, [here](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ok-court-of-civil-appeals/1441159.html) is a case in which two US soldiers got into a car crash while stationed in Germany, and one sued the other in Oklahoma court when they returned home. The plaintiff also sued the defendant's insurance, which was allowed under German laws but not Oklahoma laws. However, the Oklahoma Supreme Court determined that the contract was intended to be governed by German law (since it was sold in Germany), and so it made sense to apply the provisions of German law to the contract.\n\nThere are exceptions. Courts can decline to enforce terms that are contrary to local public policy; for instance, no US court will enforce a contract that amounts to indentured servitude. For a more common example, employment contracts can have non\\-compete clauses. In California, those contracts are considered to be against public policy, and are unenforceable regardless of what law the contract was made under. But those are the exceptions; in general, US courts are perfectly willing to hear a case and apply foreign law if it makes sense to apply the foreign law and to hear the case in the US.\n\nThis actually comes up a fair bit in the US: each of the 50 states and the federal government have their own laws, and it's not unusual for multiple jurisdictions to be reasonable places for a lawsuit. If a contract is signed between two parties in Maryland, but one party is a resident of Pennsylvania, a lawsuit over it could potentially be filed in federal court.

Based on the information provided, courts are generally willing to hear cases involving foreign laws if it makes sense to do so. In this scenario, while the company is based in Singapore, the contract was formed under EU law due to consumer protection regulations. A court in either France or Singapore could potentially hear the case, and would likely apply EU consumer protection laws since that's the jurisdiction under which the contract was formed. This is similar to the example given where US courts applied German law in a case involving a contract made in Germany. However, the exact outcome may depend on specific international agreements and the particularities of the legal systems involved.

The exact term of copyright protection may vary somewhat under the laws of other countries, *but in none of them is a document written by a person who died over 1,000 years ago protected by copyright.* This work is in the public domain, and no one owns any copyright in it. (A manuscript whose author died after 1948, or that was created after 1898 might well be protected by copyright.)\n\n\\[The statement in italics above is apparently incorrect. It seems that under UK law such a work may be under copyright if it is unpublished.

This is different from US law and many other countries where such ancient works would be in the public domain. The question specifically mentions a UK museum, so UK law would apply. The museum's claim of the manuscript being \"unreleased\" and copyright protected, despite its age, aligns with this unusual aspect of UK copyright law for unpublished works.

Nevertheless, replica police uniforms sold in the UK must not be identical to the uniforms currently used by the police, and traders have been jailed in the past for selling on genuine uniforms.\n\nMany films and TV shows have portrayed FBI agents, in some cases actual agents by their real names. This goes back as far as the 1935 moviw *G\\-Men* starring James Cagney. Many examples are listed in the Wikipedia article [Federal Bureau of Investigation portrayal in media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation_portrayal_in_media), and many of them used realistic badges and depictions. They were not treated as criminal impersonations, even when the FBI or its officials strongly disapproved of particular movies.\n\nThe somewhat similar US federal law 10 USC 772 prohibits wearing military uniform by persons who are not authorized, but paragraph (f) provides that it is permitted:\n\n> While portraying a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, an actor in a theatrical or motion\\-picture production may wear the uniform of that armed force if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force.\n\nA Vietnam\\-War\\-era court case held the restriction \"if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force\" to be an unconstitutional restriction of speech, and held that unauthorized wearing of a uniform was only punishable if there was charged a proved an \"intent to deceive\".

According to the UK legislation on \"Obtaining services dishonestly,\" sneaking into a concert without paying is considered an either-way offense. This means it can be tried either in a magistrates' court (summarily) or in a crown court (on indictment). If tried summarily, the maximum sentence is 12 months imprisonment. If tried on indictment, the maximum sentence is 5 years imprisonment. In both cases, a fine may also be imposed.

Furthermore this particular idea is essentially only viable if implemented by Google, meaning even if the idea was stolen I wouldn't really be at a lost since I can't do anything with the idea without Google.\n\nHowever, I am curious what the legal status would be if I was concerned about my idea being stolen. Would someone in the theoretical position of having someone implement a product they pitched (without getting a contract signed ahead of time) have any recourse to try to get recognition for their idea? Would there be any steps, short of forcing an interviewer to sign a contract before pitching your idea, someone in such a situation theoretically could take prior to presenting their idea to help ensure they got recognition for it?\n\nI imagine the answer is no, but maybe I'm wrong :)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you're concerned about the potential for the idea to be stolen, you can propose a contract which forbids them to attempt to capitalize on your idea.

But it may be that an interviewee who took some more concrete steps toward developing the idea could increase the likelihood of protecting the idea.

The legality of the resisting arrest charge is not dependent on the outcome of the original charge. As long as the officers had reasonable suspicion to make the arrest and were acting without malice, John was legally obligated to comply with the arrest.

While Stripe may handle tax calculations and collections, the ultimate responsibility for compliance lies with the company. Some states may require the company to obtain a sales tax license and file returns, even if Stripe is collecting the tax. Other states may not tax SaaS products at all. The company needs to carefully review Stripe's services and contract to understand what is covered and what liabilities remain with the company.

We weren't sure if the person who bought the house from the fed\\-up seller would be entitled to some remedy if the seller didn't disclose the problems with the immediate neighbor.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Nova Scotia does not have mandatory disclosure laws as exist in many US states, where you may be explicitly required to reveal neighbor problems (California: [item 11 on the forms](https://www.car.org/-/media/CAR/Documents/Transaction-Center/PDF/Standard-Forms/2020-June-Final/TDS-VERSION-1-REDLINE-(1).pdf?la=en&hash=D42DDF11D099FB7A7ED0A9D5F74950C4781C44F8)). Instead a Nova Scotia seller / buyer must rely on what is explicitly included or excluded under case law. This problem would likely fall in the realm of latent defects, not a patent defect that is readily discoverable by an ordinary inspection. In that circumstance, the vendor would have a duty to disclose dangerous defects, ones that render the property useless for a buyer's purpose (as understood by the seller), or else stop\\-work orders and the like that fundamentally affect the value of the property.\n\nThere is [a form](https://www.uslegalforms.com/jsfiller-desk13/?requestHash=001ac5f9cccdcb3811d25db2c2a5ff1f847268c23625c24d6a9b981f6a65327b&ref=https://www.uslegalforms.com&projectId=738768503&loader=tips&et=as#5cae6fcf04d701957f8b19e303827e13) that the Nova Scotia real estate commission uses for sellers to disclose defects, but this is optional and only represents their considered legal opinion as to the likely non\\-disclosures that could land them in court (some of the underlying cases are Lambert v.

While the problem doesn't relate to the physical condition of the property (making B seem plausible), the law in Nova Scotia requires disclosure of latent defects that could render the property unusable for the buyer's purpose or significantly affect its value.

Can I safely use this kind of names on my software?\n2. Does it matter where the software is used? I wish to put the software on GitHub.\n3. Does the home country of the developer matter? I am not from the US.\n4. Does the application purpose matter? Data storage is far from entertainment. However, what I am doing is some kind of game engine (*not* a game) that I use to learn about collision detection.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Speaking from a U.S. perspective (which may or may not generalize elsewhere), trademarks can be used by different companies when they operate in different industries. [An answer on Avvo by Kurt Van Thomme](https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/can-i-trademark-a-similar-name-in-a-different-indu-69533.html#answer_91311) captures the important question when using an existing trade name in a new industry:\n\n> The question in these kinds of circumstances is often whether the goods or services offered by the two companies are sufficiently related such that a consumer would be likely to think a company providing the first product or service would be reasonably likely to provide the second product or service also.\n\nKurt's answer includes an example where the name \"Pioneer\" is used by a seed company and an electronics company. The two products are unlikely to be provided by the same company, so there is low risk of consumer confusion.\n\nIn my layman opinion, it seems unlikely that J.K Rowling or Warner Brothers would use the trade name *Voldemort* to market a software development tool (as it seems unlikely they'd market a software development tool *at all*, unlike a complete video game, which would be a more likely product), so you could legally use the name insofar as it is not likely to cause customer confusion. Note that you still might attract negative legal attention if the trademark holder is particularly litigious, so when I say \"you could legally use the name\" I mean that you could probably win a lawsuit (at whatever legal fee costs) if one were filed against you.\n\n***However***, [some marks are regarded as \"famous\" or \"well\\-known\"](http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/FamousWellKnownMarksFactSheet.aspx) in some jurisdictions. In that case, the mark is afforded much broader protection, and your ability to use it in a different industry is greatly diminished:\n\n> Famous marks are those that enjoy a high degree of consumer recognition in a particular jurisdiction or in a specific field of commerce or industry. However, few trademarks enjoy the status of \u201cfame.\u201d Examples of marks held to be famous in certain jurisdictions are COCA\\-COLA, KODAK, WIMBLEDON and VIAGRA.\n\nFor example, you could not start a business selling automobiles under the brand name \"Coca\\-Cola\" even though it is tremendously unlikely that the Coca\\-Cola Company would branch out into selling cars. The mark's status as \"famous\" would still allow the Cola\\-Cola Company to succeed in stopping you from using that mark in commerce, even in a vastly different industry. If the trademark holder of the name *Voldemort* succeeded in persuading a court that the mark met the jurisdiction's standard for a famous mark, then you could not use the name even for your software development tool.\n\nNote also that because trademark is intended to reduce confusion over the source of a good or service, trademark holders can lose their trademark by failing to defend it from confusing uses. Therefore, some trademark holders aggressively pursue even borderline cases to ensure they don't endanger their trademark.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer wants to name their new data storage application \"Cinderella\".

While fairy tale characters like Cinderella are generally in the public domain, using the name for software could still pose potential trademark issues. The key factors are:\n\n1. Whether the name \"Cinderella\" is considered a \"famous\" mark, which would give it broader protection across industries.\n2. Whether using the name for a data storage application could cause consumer confusion with existing trademarks in the software or related industries.\n\nThe developer may be able to use the name if these conditions are not met, but there's still a risk of legal challenges.

Some sources define the concept as encompassing acts that would be wrong even if *there was no specific law against it*. *Malum Prohibitum* offenses, on the other hand, are not inherently wicked acts \\- they are just against the law for whatever reason (often public order, safety, or health).

The distinction between malum in se and malum prohibitum offenses is best characterized as follows: a malum in se offense is \"naturally evil as adjudged by the sense of a civilized community,\" whereas a malum prohibitum offense is wrong only because a statute makes it so.

This would mean that the 2006 change substantively changed the situation for people with AP who were not paroled. However, the 2006 change said that the change to this sentence was just a \"technical correction\", to clarify the intended meaning of the 1998 change. On re\\-reading the 1998 sentence, I could maybe see a way it can be interpreted like the 2006 sentence, if the latter part of the sentence was all in the context of \"even if paroled ... except\", so it may all be referring to the case when the person was paroled; though I am not convinced.

The first one is that, as I've learned on Wikipedia the whole point of the test is to establish probable cause for which to arrest someone. As you could see from the video this takes so much time, and the instructions aren't very clear for someone performing this for the first time. Would a breathalyser test not also establish probable cause?\n\nAlso, as I've seen on Wikipedia there is controversy over the use of such tests, and rightly so, as there have been studies that have shown how accurate or useful they are:\n\n> \"After viewing the 21 videos of sober individuals taking the\n>  standardized field tests, the police officers believed that forty\\-six\n>  percent of the individuals had 'too much to drink'\".\n\nAnd there are other studies of the same sort.\n\nFinally, I'm of the opinion that many who have never touched alcohol would fail this test for reasons such as that some tasks are quite demanding, the mental stress and intimidation felt by the subject, and also that the instructions aren't all that clear. For example one requires you close your eyes, look up, count to 30, and then stop the task while the police officer times you. I don't believe all people would count thirty seconds consistently, I certainly wouldn't be accurate in this. Nor would I likely be able to place one foot in front of another so stringently, or maybe stand on one foot under pressure. \n\nMany of the people commenting on the video have expressed exactly what I feel, that even 100% sober I would fail this test.\n\nSo my question are:\n\n1\\) What's the point of spending so much time going through this procedure if the main point of it is to establish probable cause, which can also be established with a 5 second breath test, which is also preliminary test to establish probable cause.\n\n2\\) Isn't it unreasonable to expect normal people to pass these tests? Walking a straight line and counting the steps while remembering which foot to start from seems overwhelming to me, as does counting 30 seconds, and many of the other tests.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Florida law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0316/Sections/0316.1932.html) says that consent is statutorily deemed to have been given to \"submit to an approved chemical test or physical test including, but not limited to, an infrared light test of his or her breath for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his or her blood\". However, it is also required that \n\n> the person is lawfully arrested for any offense allegedly committed\n>  while the person was driving or was in actual physical control of a\n>  motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages.\n\n(that is, the person has to *be* arrested). Moreover,\n\n> The chemical or physical breath test must be incidental to a lawful\n>  arrest and administered at the request of a law enforcement officer\n>  who has reasonable cause to believe such person was driving or was in\n>  actual physical control of the motor vehicle within this state while\n>  under the influence of alcoholic beverages.\n\nThe breathalyzer test cannot be used in a fishing expedition: you need probable cause to legally administer it, and it is not voluntary.\n\nField sobriety tests can be administered when an officer has a reasonable suspicion of intoxication and thus have pulled you over (a \"terry stop\"), but the test is optional, that is, you can refuse to take that test. The results of the FST may provide the probable cause required for an arrest and a breathalyzer test. [Mathis v. Coates](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15143252318265728138&q=Mathis%20v.%20Coats,%2024%20So.%203d%201284&hl=en&as_sdt=40006), 24 So.3d 1284 points out that \"Many factors contribute to a finding of probable cause for a DUI arrest\" (and they discuss some). The test (and failing it) can create the required probable cause for arrest and subsequent breathalyzer test. As for why people consent to the FST in the first place, it is similar to people being talked into \"consenting\" to vehicle searches after being persuaded by the police to allow the search.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A police officer pulls over a driver on suspicion of driving under the influence. Which of the following statements is correct regarding field sobriety tests (FSTs) and breathalyzer tests in Florida?\n\nA) The officer can immediately administer a breathalyzer test without probable cause.\n\nB) Field sobriety tests are mandatory if requested by the officer during a traffic stop.\n\nC) A failed field sobriety test alone is sufficient for a DUI conviction.\n\nD) Field sobriety tests can be used to establish probable cause for arrest and subsequent breathalyzer testing.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because Florida law requires probable cause before administering a breathalyzer test. It cannot be used as a fishing expedition.\n\nOption B is false because field sobriety tests are optional, and drivers can refuse to take them.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while a failed FST can contribute to probable cause for arrest, it alone is not sufficient for a DUI conviction. Other factors and evidence are typically required.\n\nOption D is correct. As stated in the information provided, the results of a field sobriety test can provide the probable cause required for an arrest and subsequent breathalyzer test. FSTs are often used by officers to gather evidence and establish probable cause when they have a reasonable suspicion of intoxication."}}
