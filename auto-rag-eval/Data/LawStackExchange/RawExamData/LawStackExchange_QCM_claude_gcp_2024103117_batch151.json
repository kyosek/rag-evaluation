The invoice mentioned the warranty but didn't provide details. After two weeks, a serious problem emerged. The seller now claims the warranty only covered tires. Which of the following best describes the buyer's legal position?\n\nA) The buyer has no recourse as private car sales offer limited protection to buyers.\n\nB) The buyer can only claim for tire-related issues as per the seller's statement.\n\nC) The buyer has a strong case for breach of contract due to the written warranty agreement.\n\nD) The buyer can only claim if they can prove the seller deliberately misled them about the car's condition.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The buyer has a strong case for breach of contract. The invoice, which serves as a written agreement, mentions a 6-month warranty for the car without specifying it was only for tires. The seller's claim that the warranty only covered tires contradicts the invoice and seems unreasonable given the price increase. The buyer should have a valid claim, especially if they can provide evidence of the original advertisement, mechanic reports confirming pre-existing issues, and any written communication with the seller about the warranty dispute.

The Canadian Copyright Act states that only in cases of employment under a \"contract of service\" does the employer automatically own the copyright.

Take Nick Sandman's case as a hypothetical example. If CNN paid him several million dollars, and Sandman spends it quickly, it will be obvious to everyone that CNN paid him. Sandman isn't otherwise wealthy, if he suddenly buys a Lamborghini or a private jet, that money must have come from CNN. So doesn't this violate his NDA?

Payment of a substantial sum is oftentimes the main or only incentive for the injured party to bind himself in an NDA. A prohibition to spend that money would *de facto* nullify the benefit without which the party would have declined the NDA.\n\n> Sandman isn't otherwise wealthy, if he suddenly buys a Lamborghini or a private jet, that money must have come from CNN.

However, such need on the payer's part seems rare, and the injured person is likelier to decline the NDA altogether if the clauses for management of the compensation are unreasonable.\n\n> What counts as disclosure with regards to Non\\-Disclosure Agreements?\n\nAny revelation, by the parties, that contravenes the terms and purpose of the NDA in that it would give non\\-parties information which cannot be ascertained from prior and/or independent publications and filings.

Are there changes to be made?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two relevant EU laws: GDPR and ePrivacy.\n\nUsing Google Analytics does not require consent as far as the GDPR is concerned. The processing can instead be based on legitimate interest, but you do have to offer opt\\-out and must use suitable security measures, for example by signing the data processing agreement with Google. Alternatively, an argument is possible that the collected data doesn't qualify as personal data \u2013 but I don't think that argument is correct.\n\nThe ePrivacy directive is more tricky. It is not directly enforceable law. Instead, directives are implemented through member state law. As a result, there can be subtle differences between member states. What one data protection authority allows is not necessarily relevant in another country.\n\nePrivacy requires you to collect consent when you access information on the user's device, for example when you read or write cookies or use similar technologies, regardless of whether the information is personal data in the sense of the GDPR. The only exception is when the access is strictly necessary for your application \u2013 but that doesn't cover analytics. This ePrivacy requirement is the source of all the cookie consent banners you see on the web.\n\nGoogle Analytics stores a Client ID on the user's device, which is used to combine separate events into a session or user profile. Optionally, this Client ID can be linked with a User ID, which lets you track a signed\\-in user across devices.\n\nBut storing/acessing this Client ID requires consent under ePrivacy.\n\nIf you want to avoid asking for consent, you must disable storage of the Client ID. On the web, this can be reached by setting `'storage': 'none'` for analytics.js or `'client_storage': 'none'` for gtag.js. I use this approach on my personal website, with the result that \u201cpageviews\u201d and \u201csessions\u201d are now synonymous. I am not sure what the equivalent would be on mobile, but the same concerns apply.\n\nI assume (but do not know for sure) that the consent requirement only applies to persistently stored data. Keeping a transient User ID in memory is likely fine. That would let you correlate events into a session while the app remains open, without having to ask for consent.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A mobile app developer wants to implement Google Analytics in their EU-based application without requiring user consent. Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate under EU privacy laws?\n\nA) Implement Google Analytics normally, as mobile apps are exempt from ePrivacy consent requirements\nB) Use Google Analytics with 'storage': 'none' setting to avoid storing the Client ID on the user's device\nC) Collect user consent before implementing any analytics, as it's always required for mobile apps in the EU\nD) Implement Google Analytics based on legitimate interest alone, without any modifications\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect. Mobile apps are not exempt from ePrivacy consent requirements. The same principles apply to both websites and mobile applications.\n\nB) Correct. By setting 'storage' to 'none' (or an equivalent setting for mobile), the app avoids storing the Client ID on the user's device. This approach doesn't require consent under ePrivacy, as it doesn't access or store information on the user's device. However, it limits the analytics capabilities to treating pageviews and sessions as synonymous.\n\nC) Incorrect. While collecting consent is a safe approach, it's not always necessary if proper measures are taken to avoid storing data on the user's device without consent.\n\nD) Incorrect. While legitimate interest can be a basis for processing under GDPR, it doesn't address the ePrivacy requirement for consent when accessing or storing information on the user's device. Simply relying on legitimate interest without modifying how Google Analytics stores data would not be compliant.\n\nThis question tests understanding of EU privacy laws (GDPR and ePrivacy), their application to mobile apps, and the specific requirements for implementing Google Analytics in a compliant manner."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/93978/is-uncensorship-in-japanese-porn-illegal", "docs_id": 93978, "title": "is uncensorship in japanese porn illegal", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to some laws in japan censorship is a must for adult films but why does uncensored porn in JAPANESE ADULT VIDEOS ,PORNHUB,ETC exist is that legal? of not what charges they could be facing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Article 175 of the [Criminal Code](https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3581/en) says:\n\n> A person who distributes, sells or displays in public an obscene document, drawing or other objects shall be punished by imprisonment with work for not more than 2 years, a fine of not more than 2,500,000 yen or a petty fine.

An assault is a threat or attempt to inflict offensive physical contact or bodily harm on a person which puts the person in immediate danger of or in apprehension of such harm or contact. Groping is an example of offensive contact that does not involve bodily harm. Assault is against the law in two ways. First, it is a tort, meaning that the victim can sue the assailant for the damage that was caused. Second, it is generally a crime, meaning that the assailant might be punished, if convicted. The Canadian law regarding the crime of assault is [\u00a7265 of the Criminal Code](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-265.html). The law says plainly that\n\n> A person commits an assault when (a) without the consent of another\n>  person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly\n>  or indirectly\n\nWhether or not the government will pursue the matter is difficult to say. The standard procedure is that the victim reports the event to the police, who will decide whether to investigate, and it could end up in court being prosecuted by the Crown.\n\nThe other path is a lawsuit, where the person harmed files a lawsuit and has his day in court. The victim files a complaint alleging that certain events took place (it has to match toe legal definition of assault), and that you were harmed in a way that can be redressed with an award of money. You would, of course, hire a lawyer to pursue this, because you can't just say to the court \"Make him pay, he punched me\". You might be awarded something for emotional distress. You might want to talk to a lawyer about the prospects for getting an award large enough to cover your legal bill.\n\nNeedless to say, punching as payback is *also* assault, which as I mentioned is a crime. It's quite possible that the police will decide not to pursue the first assault but would take a dimmer view of revenge assault and prosecute you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A student is repeatedly touched and lightly punched by a classmate during a school field trip, despite asking the classmate to stop.

Because of my 30\\+ years of professional IT services, he also asked me to do a variety of IT\\-related services for him already before he hired me for the financial services.

I created a proof of concept for him which he again paid promptly. We reviewed the POC together to verify that I was going in the direction he wanted. When he confirmed that, I said that finalizing this app (which it turned out to be) will be a lot more work. He said that's fine and did not ask any further questions. Since we saw each other almost every day, I kept him in the loop about me working on the app, that I spent a significant amount of time already, and that there is a lot more to do. He always responded with \"that's fine\".\n\nIn fact, he liked what I had done as POC so much that he said later that he had reached out to the patent office for filing copyright. There was never any agreement on transfer of intellectual property.\n\nLast Thursday I sent him another invoice since we had reached a milestone close to completion. He said this invoice was too high, and that he would not pay it. He would be willing to pay \"what's fair\" but not this.

In situations where the price is not agreed upon in advance, the client is obligated to pay a \"fair\" or \"reasonable\" price. This reasonable price is determined by considering various factors, including the amount of time invested in the project, the prevailing market rates for similar work, and the history of past dealings between the parties. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the contractor cannot unilaterally set any price they want without consideration of what's reasonable in the circumstances. \n\nAnswer B is wrong because the client still has an obligation to pay a fair price, even if they disagree with the specific invoice amount. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because a dispute over price doesn't give the contractor the right to terminate the contract or withhold work.

Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 150\\. But \u201ca statute which, while furthering \\[a] valid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman\u2019s choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 877 (plurality opinion), and \u201c\\[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right,\u201d id., at 878\\.\n\nJustice Ginsburg provided a separate concurring opinion in which she said:\n\n> ... Many medical procedures, including childbirth, are far more dangerous to patients, yet are not subject to ambulatory\\-surgical\\-center or hospital admitting\\-privileges requirements...\n> \n> \n> ...abortion \u201cis at least as safe as other medical procedures routinely performed in outpatient settings\u201d. Given those realities, it is beyond rational belief that H. B. 2 could genuinely protect the health of women, and certain that the law \u201cwould simply make it more difficult for them to obtain abortions.\u201d\n\nWhen the bill was passed in Texas in 2013, I recall some Texas lawmakers in support of the bill claiming that the law would help prevent some abortions, [for example](https://www.texastribune.org/2013/07/13/texas-abortion-regulations-debate-nears-climax/):\n\n> The regulations in HB 2 will end up saving many babies, he said, \"so that families can adopt them and love them and be able to cherish them.\u201d\n\nIt seems like the bill was struck down by the Supreme Court because the bill did exactly what it was supposed to do. Perhaps if the decision was 8\\-0 one could argue that the Texas lawmakers should have known better and were just wasting taxpayers' time and money, but there were 3 dissenting justices, which to me, legitimizes the attempt to pass the law. Yet, I'm not fully understanding the dissenting opinions.\n\nMy question: are the dissenting opinions claiming that Texas HB2 does not present a \"substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion\", or are they claiming that the premise is wrong and it should be OK for a law to present a \"substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion\", or something else entirely?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Justice Thomas's position is two\\-pronged. First, he argues that the court has taken the wrong approach to protecting abortion all along:\n\n> I remain fundamentally opposed to the Court\u2019s abortion\n>  jurisprudence.\n\nHe then argues that even taking *Casey* as precedent, the court has raised the standard that laws affecting access to abortions are judged by:\n\n> These precepts \\[...] transform the undue\\-burden test to\n>  something much more akin to strict scrutiny.\n\nMy takeaway is that he thinks jumping straight to a balancing test muddles the \"undue\\-burden\" and \"legitimate interest\" portions of the *Casey* test. He would have answered *first* whether these laws posed an undue burden upon women seeking abortions. If the answer there was \"no\", then the law only needs to pass a rational basis test. However, by immediately jumping to a test than balances the burden on women and legitimate interests of the state, he argues that a more heightened scrutiny is applied to these laws than *Casey* stands for.\n\nFurther, he argues that the clinics should not be able to sue to protect a right that they don't even claim belongs to them:\n\n> This suit is possible only because the Court has allowed\n>  abortion clinics and physicians to invoke a putative constitutional\n>  right that does not belong to them\u2014a woman\u2019s\n>  right to abortion.\n\nJustice Alito's position rests on *[res judicata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_judicata)*.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to Justice Thomas's dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court decision on Texas HB2, what is the primary issue with the majority's approach to evaluating abortion regulations?\n\nA) The majority ignores the state's legitimate interest in protecting women's health\nB) The majority applies a stricter standard than the undue-burden test established in Casey\nC) The majority fails to consider the potential benefits of the law for adoptive families\nD) The majority allows abortion clinics to invoke constitutional rights that don't belong to them\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Justice Thomas argues that the majority's approach \"transform[s] the undue-burden test to something much more akin to strict scrutiny.\" He believes that by immediately balancing the burden on women against the state's interests, the Court is applying a higher level of scrutiny than what was established in Casey.

If it is an *obligation*, you can't \"waive\" the obligation; but the right to free speech does not mean that you must speak, and the right to bear arms does not mean that you must bear arms. You may decline to exercise, or waive, a right.\n\nSternlight [16 Ohio St. J. On Disp. Resol. 669 (2001\\)](http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&context=facpub) in \"Mandatory Binding Arbitration and the Demise of the Seventh Amendment Right to a Jury Trial\" partially addresses this (the focus though is on binding arbitration). One thing to note is that the Seventh Amendment does not appear to apply to issues in state court (it is a separate and fascinating question to wonder what parts of The Constitution are incorporated against states, and why). All is not lost for the constitutional question, we just need a different constitution.\n\nBy the agreement terms, \"This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York\". Therefore, New York's Constitution (Article 1 Sect 2\\) is also applicable:\n\n> Trial by jury in all cases in which it has heretofore been guaranteed\n>  by constitutional provision shall remain inviolate forever; but *a jury\n>  trial may be waived by the parties in all civil cases in the manner to\n>  be prescribed by law*.\n\nThus, the right may be waived. Waiver of a right to jury trial is not the same as waiver of the right to trial: what the agreement says is that litigants would have a civil bench trial, where the judge determines whether there was a breach.\n\nIn New York, [NY CPLR \u00a7 4102](http://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/2012/cvp/article-41/4102) allows parties to waive civil trial by jury (and unlike [California](https://casetext.com/case/grafton-partners-v-superior-court-2)), such waiver terms have been [upheld](http://www.chadbourne.com/sites/default/files/publications/hall%20judge%20smith%20nylj%20reprint%2012%2009.pdf), but the courts have recognized that there is a problem, so it's not always obvious whether such waivers in contracts are legal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under New York state law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding contractual waivers of the right to a jury trial in civil cases?\n\nA) Such waivers are always unconstitutional and unenforceable.\nB) Such waivers are always constitutional and enforceable without limitation.\nC) Such waivers are generally upheld, but courts have recognized potential issues and may scrutinize them in certain circumstances.\nD) Such waivers are only enforceable if explicitly authorized by federal law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, New York courts have generally upheld contractual waivers of the right to a jury trial in civil cases, as permitted by the New York Constitution and NY CPLR \u00a7 4102. However, the passage also notes that \"courts have recognized that there is a problem, so it's not always obvious whether such waivers in contracts are legal.\" This suggests that while these waivers are generally enforceable, they may be subject to scrutiny and potential limitations in certain circumstances.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because such waivers are not always unconstitutional; they are explicitly allowed by the New York Constitution.\n\nAnswer B is overly broad; while these waivers are often upheld, they are not always enforceable without any limitations or scrutiny.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the enforceability of these waivers in New York state courts is based on state law, not federal law."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80008/what-is-still-considered-obscenity-in-the-united-states", "docs_id": 80008, "title": "What is still considered obscenity in the United States?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just skimmed the [Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_obscenity_law) on US obscenity law, and all the cases are from decades back.

I'm interested in what can still make something obscene without involving other crimes.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I can tell, the established category of \"obscene\" material is child pornography, and the most current relevant case is [US v. Williams](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/553/285/#tab-opinion-1962658), 553 U.S. 285\\. The relevant law is 18 USC 2252A which refers as a subcase to \"an obscene visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\".

Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/495/103/), 495 U.S. 103\\). Outside of the realm of child pornography laws, there don't appear to be any cases of tenable laws against \"obscenity\" from the past 25 years. The Miller test ([Miller v.

The passage states that outside of child pornography laws, there don't seem to be any cases of tenable laws against \"obscenity\" from the past 25 years.

You mention having a company email domain and associated email signature; that is certainly good practice and would go a long way towards creating a presumption that you were acting for a company. Also signing yourself with your job title or role (e.g. \"Joe Bloggs, Chief Bottlewasher\") makes it clear that you are speaking in your role as an employee.\n\nThe content of the communication also matters; if you use your company email address to order goods from a supplier that the company has used before then the recipient can reasonably assume that you are ordering on behalf of the company and a court is likely to agree.

As stated in the documentation, whether an action is attributed to an individual or a company is generally a question of fact that would be determined by considering multiple pieces of evidence. While using a personal email address and not identifying the company are factors that could suggest a personal action, they are not definitive.

That is if action is taken by the national Data Protection Authority (DPA).\n\nMy understanding is that DPAs mostly concentrate on large businesses and organizations. But it seems that there have been some actions involvign smaller offenders. The [GDPR Enforcement Tracker](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=GDPR+enforcement+actions+small+buisness) lists enforcement actions.\n\nListed actions include:\n\n| ID | Date | Type | Fine Amt (Euros) | Provision(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ETid\\-1550 | 2022\\-12\\-28 | Private individual | 600 | Art Art. 5 (1\\) c); Art 13 |\n| ETid\\-1545 | 2023\\-01\\-03 | HOA | 500 | Art. 5 (1\\) e) |\n| ETid\\-1536 | 2022\\-12\\-20 | Private individual | 3000 | Art. 6 (1\\) |\n| ETid\\-1534 | 2022\\-12\\-20 | Private individual | 1000 | Art. 5 (1\\) c) |\n\nThese are just a few recent instances in which individuals or small organizations are shown as having been fined.

The website has several GDPR compliance issues, including lack of cookie consent, use of third-party analytics without proper agreements, generic Terms of Service, and no warning about uploading copyrighted content. Based on the GDPR Enforcement Tracker data, what is the most likely outcome if these violations are reported to the Data Protection Authority?\n\nA) The business owner will face no consequences as DPAs only focus on large corporations.\nB) The business owner will immediately be sued by users for privacy violations.\nC) The business owner may be subject to a fine, potentially ranging from 500 to 3000 Euros.\nD) The business owner will be required to shut down the website immediately.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While DPAs tend to focus on larger businesses, the GDPR Enforcement Tracker shows that there have been enforcement actions against individuals and small organizations. The fines listed in the example range from 500 to 3000 Euros for various GDPR violations. This suggests that small business owners can face financial penalties for non-compliance, even if they're not the primary target of enforcement. Options A and D are incorrect as they represent extreme scenarios not supported by the given data.

However, it is not legal for a parent to cause serious injury to a child. The line between \"reasonable punishment\" and \"serious injury\" seems to not be well defined, and may have shifted over time due to changes in law, court decisions, or prosecutorial discretion.

However, because unemancipated minors cannot buy or sell property on their own, managing their stocks can be a hassle. For example, children need a guardian if they want to sell the stock.\n\nTo avoid these hassles, in many (most?) cases, the stock is owned through some legal entity that gives an adult control over that stock. These range from custodial IRAs to living trusts. In all of these, the stock belongs to the minor, but is managed by an adult. These entities differ in all sorts of ways, including when (if ever) the minor gets control of the stock, how the stock is taxed, what the stock can be used for, and so on.\n\nOne of the most popular entities is a [UTMA Account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utma.asp). These are named after the *Universal Transfer to Minors Act,* found at [Chap. 201A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleII/Chapter201a) of the *General Laws of Massachusetts*. These are custodial accounts designed specifically to allow minors to hold property, including stock. These accounts simplify the management of the minor\u2019s stock, and offer some tax breaks. In Massachusetts, the custodianship *[generally](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleII/Chapter201A/Section20)* terminates when the minor turns 21\\. At that point, she gets complete control of her stock.\n\nTo find out more about the advantages and disadvantages of the UTMA compared to other ways of holding property for children, see [here](https://www.thebalance.com/beginners-guide-to-ugma-and-utma-custodial-accounts-4060475), [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinefletcher/2019/12/12/why-utma-accounts-are-not-as-simple-as-they-seem/#74aeb79c7b34) and [here](https://southcoastestateplanning.com/when-can-my-child-get-the-money-in-the-utma-custodial-account-i-created-2/).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Massachusetts, a 16-year-old wants to own shares in a company.

The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States.\n\n...\n\n> To hold that the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution excludes from citizenship the children, born in the United States, of citizens or subjects of other countries would be to deny citizenship to thousands of persons of English, Scotch, Irish, German, or other European parentage who have always been considered and treated as citizens of the United States.\n\nIn short the phrase \u201cand subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d excludes three and only three groups of people:\n\n* Children born to foreign diplomats here on diplomatic business, who have diplomatic immunity to US Law;\n* Children of members of an invading army that has occupied and controlled some part of US territory, born on that occupied area, who are obviously not subject to US Law (which has rarely happened in the US, although Guam was occupied during WWII, and parts of Alaska, and small parts of Maine during the War of 1812\\); and\n* Members of Native American tribes, subject to the jurisdiction of their tribal governments, who do not pay US taxes. (This was true when the 14th amendment was passed, but it no longer is.

The case upheld the same principle that the constitutional phrase \"within the jurisdiction\" applies to the children of people who had entered the US illegally.\n\nAccording to [the Wikipedia article on the case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe):\n\n> Texas officials had argued that illegal aliens were not \"within the jurisdiction\" of the state and thus could not claim protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court majority rejected this claim, finding instead that \"no plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment 'jurisdiction' can be drawn between resident immigrants whose entry into the United States was lawful, and resident immigrants whose entry was unlawful.\" The dissenting opinion also rejected this claim, agreeing with the Court that \"the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to immigrants who, after their illegal entry into this country, are indeed physically 'within the jurisdiction' of a state.\"\n\nThus the question of whether such aliens were \"within the jurisdiction\" of the US was very much at issue in *Plyler v. Doe*\n\n**EDIT:**\nSince the [Indian Citizenship Act of 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Citizenship_Act) was passed, all Native Americans born within the US have been citizens by birth, and the third class of exceptions noted in the earlier cases non longer exists. Prior to this act Native Americans were in many ways treated as foreigners by the US. They were not citizens by birth, and their tribes had some but not all of the attributes of independent nations.\n\nThe text of the law is:\n\n> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That all non citizen Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States be, and they are hereby, declared to be citizens of the United States: Provided That the granting of such citizenship shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of any Indian to tribal or other property.\n\n(End edit on Indian Citizenship Act of 1924\\)\n\n**Edit**: On reading through the decision of the case of *Wong Kim Ark* I find one more small exclusion: persons born on board a foreign naval ship, even though present in US waters in time of peace, are not citizens of the US because of their birth location. This is apparently not a usual case, but is premised on the ground that a military vessel remains the territory of the nation it belongs to. Such persons might of course be citizens by inheritance if one or both parents are US citizens, and the statutory conditions are complied with.

The same shall apply to a person who commits sexual intercourse with a female under thirteen years of age.\n\nTherefore, someone who has sexual intercourse with another person while they are intoxicated may not be considered rape if the act did not involve violent force.\n\nIt is important to note that this definition has some limitations. For example, it does not account for victims who are violated while incapacitated in a medical setting, and it also does not consider the possibility of male victims.\n\nExample where rape charges requires non\\-voluntary intoxication:\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere have also been attempts within the legal system to distinguish between people who were unknowingly drugged and those who voluntarily consumed a large amount of alcohol and became intoxicated.\n\n> The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a person can\u2019t be found guilty of sexually assaulting someone, who is mentally incapacitated due to intoxication, if that person became intoxicated by voluntarily ingesting drugs or alcohol.\n\nIn Minnesota, for example, there was a requirement for non\\-voluntary intoxication.\n\n[A Minnesota man can\u2019t be charged with felony rape because the woman chose to drink beforehand, court rules \\- March 26, 2021](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/26/minnesota-rape-alcohol/)\n\nHowever, the Minnesota legislator has recently amended their legal codex for this.\n\n[New Minnesota Law Is 'Significant Victory' For Survivors Of Sexual Assaults While Intoxicated \\- September 14, 2021](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/new-minnesota-law-is-significant-victory-for-survivors-of-sexual-assaults-while-intoxicated/)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In which of the following legal scenarios would a sexual assault case be least likely to result in a conviction for the perpetrator?\n\nA) A woman in Japan is sexually assaulted while heavily intoxicated, but no physical violence is used.\nB) A man in Minnesota (prior to 2021) has sex with a woman who voluntarily consumed alcohol to the point of incapacitation.\nC) A person in Germany (after 2016) takes advantage of someone who is too drunk to give consent.\nD) An individual in the United States drugs someone's drink without their knowledge and then has sex with them.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nA) is correct because Japan's legal definition of rape requires \"assault or intimidation\" to forcibly commit sexual intercourse.

I note that [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States) isn't afraid to have *pictures* of the Great Seal on the webpage about it. Also, a modified Great Seal was used in the film *National Treasure: Book of Secrets* (although it purported to be a presidential seal). I also found an [instance](https://web.archive.org/web/20051028070028/http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/10/26/odd.onion.reut/index.html) where the White House officially asked the Onion to stop using the Presidential seal, but it's unclear what happened with that. The Onion did not immediately remove the seal, however, and I think we would have heard if they had been arrested. I do not believe that Wikipedia, the filmmakers, and the Onion would have done this if there was a serious risk of six months in prison. In each of those cases, there was a strong First Amendment speech/press use, and there was no risk of anyone thinking the seal was being used for a government endorsement.\n\nThere is an executive order (visible from the \"Notes\" section of the link to the law) regarding the use of the seals of the President and Vice President:\n\n> Section 1\\. Except as otherwise provided by law, the knowing\n>  manufacture, reproduction, sale, or purchase for resale of the Seals\n>  or Coats of Arms of the President or the Vice President of the United\n>  States, or any likeness or substantial part thereof, shall be\n>  permitted only for the following uses:\n> \n> \n> (a) Use by the President or Vice President of the United States;\n> \n> \n> (b) Use in encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, journals, pamphlets,\n>  periodicals, or magazines incident to a description or history of\n>  seals, coats of arms, heraldry, or the Presidency or Vice Presidency;\n> \n> \n> (c) Use in libraries, museums, or educational facilities incident to\n>  descriptions or exhibits relating to seals, coats of arms, heraldry,\n>  or the Presidency or Vice Presidency;\n> \n> \n> (d) Use as an architectural embellishment in libraries, museums, or\n>  archives established to house the papers or effects of former\n>  Presidents or Vice Presidents;\n> \n> \n> (e) Use on a monument to a former President or Vice President;\n> \n> \n> (f) Use by way of photographic or electronic visual reproduction in\n>  pictures, moving pictures, or telecasts of bona fide news content;\n> \n> \n> (g) Such other uses for exceptional historical, educational, or\n>  newsworthy purposes as may be authorized in writing by the Counsel to\n>  the President.\n\nThis provides several legal ways to use the Presidential seals.

The use of the Great Seal is regulated by 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 713, which prohibits its use in a manner that could convey a false impression of government sponsorship or approval. However, there are instances where modified versions of the seal have been used in media and satire without legal consequences, suggesting that a First Amendment argument could be made. The law's application in artistic or satirical contexts is not entirely clear, and precedents like The Onion's use of the Presidential seal indicate that there may be some flexibility in interpretation. While using the seal is not unrestricted (ruling out option A), it's also not strictly prohibited in all cases (ruling out option B). Option D is incorrect because it misapplies the conditions for using the seal of the United States Congress to the Great Seal.

Airpods cost about 150\u00a0\u20ac, so Sania is entitled to a Fider's reward of 7,50 \u20ac. Anything more would be at the discretion of Tam, accepting less is at Sania's discretion.\n\nDo note, that denial of the finder's reward at the moment that Sania hands over the item means, that they also deny their entitlement to the reward. In fact, it is upon Sania to demand the reward, and unless they do so, it is presumed that they do not want a finder's reward.\n\n**However** in making her entitlement to the reward known, Sania may not cross the line into coercion or blackmail (\u00a7\u00a7 240, 253 StGB). Should Sania say, without explanation \"I demand a payment of 100\u00a0\u20ac for the airpods\", that could be coercion, as she is not entitled to that.
