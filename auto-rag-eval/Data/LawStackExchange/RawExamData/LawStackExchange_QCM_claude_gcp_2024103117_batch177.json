Upon move\\-in we found several dead centipedes on the floor. Following that, we saw several live ones, and a cockroach in the stove.\n\nExterminators came and sprayed, and it seems that while that roach was errant (there were no signs of others having been there, and neighbors haven't seen any), the centipedes remain. I haven't seen a lot of them, but we'll see one crawling on a wall at night occasionally.\n\nThis isn't a big deal to me, but my wife has a phobia\\-level aversion to the critters. She can't even kill them with her shoe; she just runs. We talked to the apartment manager about this issue, and she escalated it to the management company. Turns out they'll waive the 6\\-month apartment transfer requirement, but still make us pay the $500 fee.\n\nThe only thing in the contract about bugs relates to bedbugs. There is something about transferring to a different apartment in the contract, but it just says \"a fee\" \\- no amount is stated.\n\nIs my only feasible solution here to pay?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am a licenced and bonded landlord and will answer from that perspective.\n\nYou do not say where you are, however, within the U.S. States that I operate in, there is little in the law about bugs with some obvious exceptions.\n\nOne exception is infestation. While there are varying degrees of concerns with infestations, the landlord has one obligation and that is to remedy the situation within a reasonable time using reasonable means. This often means hiring a licensed exterminator within a reasonable period of time and solving the problem within a reasonable time. This does not always work. For example, ants and termites may require additional expertise in solving the problem.\n\nCentipedes are often a result of moisture. While spraying is a start, the management may have other issues such as cracks in the foundation. Even small ones are enough. This is a prime example of requiring additional expertise. It may be that additional work is required. Centipede are common and largely harmless and often do not constitute an infestation. They are creepy for sure.\n\nRegardless of what the lease says, the law prevails here. Only a few rights can be waived by contract.\n\nThe landlord is required to use all reasonable means to solve the problem. Until it can be proven that the landlord has failed to solve the problem using reasonable means, you have no legal recourse.\n\nYou can certainly ask to have the fee waived. However, the landlord is under no obligation at this point and may choose not to. It is your choice. However, I would make sure you are not on the ground floor if you do switch apartments.\n\nOne other thing. There is no such thing as just one roach. The landlord should be spraying adjacent apartments including above and below. As well, assuming there is a basement, the landlord should be paying attention to cracks and gaps there too. Roaches require water and food. If another tenant is not clean then that is a problem that the landlord must solve also. This may not be too alarming of a problem since most roaches come from tenants moving. Higher turnover often means more problems including bed bugs. Proper periodic maintenance is required for larger apartment complexes.\n\nUse this answer as a standard by which to gauge the landlords response.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in an apartment complex discovers centipedes and a cockroach in their newly rented unit. The landlord sends exterminators to spray, but centipedes continue to appear occasionally. The tenant's spouse has a severe phobia of these insects. The landlord offers to waive the 6-month apartment transfer requirement but still charges a $500 fee. Based on this scenario and typical landlord-tenant laws, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The landlord is legally obligated to waive the $500 transfer fee due to the pest issue.\nB) The tenant can break the lease without penalty because of the continuing centipede problem.\nC) The landlord has fulfilled their legal obligations by sending exterminators and offering a transfer option.\nD) The tenant can withhold rent until the centipede issue is completely resolved.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The landlord has taken reasonable steps to address the pest issue by sending exterminators and offering a transfer option, even with a fee. Legally, landlords are required to use reasonable means to solve pest problems within a reasonable time frame. The presence of occasional centipedes, while unpleasant, may not constitute an infestation or a breach of habitability standards. The landlord is not obligated to waive fees or allow lease breaking for this issue, especially if they've made efforts to address it. Rent withholding is typically only allowed in severe habitability issues, which this situation likely doesn't meet.

Even were translation not specifically listed as one of the processes that creates a derivative work by statute, it would still fall under the general categorization of a derivative work.\n\nFirst, is it a new work? Something cannot be a derivative work if it's not a new work. The answer is clearly yes, your translation process certainly includes at least the minimal creative input required to create a new work.\n\nSecond, is this new work a derivative work of the original?

However, the answer would be no if you do not take enough copyrightable material from the original work.

According to the documentation, translating a work from one form to another (in this case, from one programming language to another) typically results in a derivative work. The key factors are:\n\n1. The translation process involves creative input, making it a new work.\n2. The new work (Java translation) likely contains sufficient protectable expression from the original work (Ruby on Rails).\n3. The change in programming language does not negate the derivative nature of the work.\n4. Even if the translation doesn't copy exact structure, it would still be considered derivative if it contains enough of the original's protectable expression.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because translation generally creates a derivative work, not an entirely new and unrelated work.

How can it be explained when non\\-exempt sales from different online sellers being shipped to a single address are all assessed different tax rates?\n\nSome states use an origin\\-based sales tax system. For in\\-state remote sales, the seller collects tax based on the rate in the seller's location. This would be similar as if you had collected the purchase yourself at their premises.\n\nThe opposite would be a destination\\-based sales tax system where the tax rate collected is based on the address the goods were shipped to. Out\\-of\\-state sales tax collection is almost always destination\\-based.\n\nStates with generally origin\\-based tax rates are Arizona, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia.

This includes checking official government email. However, you are not a government worker.\n\nNon\\-exempt (hourly) workers must be paid for all regular and expected duties that they are required or expected to fulfill, and being told to check email qualifies as work. [An employer is sometimes able to not record and pay for certain work done that is considered *de minimis*](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-exactly-is-de-minimis-how-to-73992/), but the legal standard here is that the work cannot be directed by the employer or be a regular part of the job, and the work must truly be short\\-term (seconds to a few minutes). Checking email off\\-the\\-clock counts as compensable work for non\\-exempt employees, and this establishes that checking email is considered work. However, as an exempt employee the pay provisions here do not apply.\n\nIn general, employers may or may not offer vacation time. If they do offer vacation time, they are not required to offer any specific kind of vacation time and may place reasonable restrictions on how and when vacation time can be used. There are some FLSA regulations on how and when vacation time may be counted, but these only apply to non\\-exempt employees.\n\nAs a result, because you are exempt, the main controlling factor here is your employment contract and what it says about vacation time. In West Virginia your employer is free to change their vacation time policy unilaterally, but they must honor any vacation time accrued under a previous policy without changes. If your employment contract says that you are required to check your email or otherwise stay in contact during vacation, then there's not a lot you can do here.\n\nThere are several more laws that apply specifically to some federal contractors under certain conditions, and [you can find a summary here](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/govtcontracts). Several of these require that federal contractors be paid at least minimum wage for work they perform, so if your vacation time is being used to avoid paying you for a day of work then your employer may be running afoul of the law here by requiring you to check your email.\n\nNote that the question of which account to bill hours to is an internal question and not regulated by law. Your employer has you assign billable hours so they can keep track of which government contract to charge your time to. This is done for their benefit, not for yours. They must still comply with your employment contract, including full pay and benefits, regardless of where you allocate your hours (unless the contract states otherwise).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An exempt employee working for a federal government contractor in West Virginia is required to use vacation time during a government shutdown.

(Reference for Loot Boxes and Booster Packs below). The main debate is whether or not these type of products are illegal lotteries.\n\nThe law at question is California Penal Code 319, and specifically the definition of a lottery:\n\n> 319. A lottery is any scheme for the disposal or distribution of property by chance, among persons who have paid or promised to pay any\n>  valuable consideration for the chance of obtaining such property or a\n>  portion of it, or for any share or any interest in such property, upon\n>  any agreement, understanding, or expectation that it is to be\n>  distributed or disposed of by lot or chance, whether called a lottery,\n>  raffle, or gift enterprise, or by whatever name the same may be known.\n\n**Does this constitute MTG Booster sales (physical sales) as a lottery?**\n\n**Please note:**\n\n* The definition makes no mention of receiving/losing \"value\" from any such property, only that you received it by chance. IMO, by purchasing a booster, you have purchased a chance at receiving individual cards on a statistical spectrum (rarity). The chance bit is all that matters, not even the value of the cards. Because there is no mention of inheriting some value, or the ability to obtain a greater monetary value after the lottery, then the argument around not acknowledging the secondary market is negated.\n* The definition makes no mention of receiving anything vs receiving nothing, thus the argument of \"everyone receives something\" is negated\n* The definition makes no distinguishment of such property having sole monetary value vs some other intrinsic value such as being able to play a competitive game.\n* However, I believe that the nuance in this law is the definition of such property. Does a range of cards on a statistical spectrum of rarity each constitute an individual property vs the booster itself as the individual property? But, couldn't this argument be made about a lottery ticket? Would wizards need to make every card the same rarity and distribute each evenly if this were true? How can we navigate around a booster pack being purchased to receive a chance at some cards?\n* One area I find difficult to research is Magic Repacks on eBay. Not sure if anyone has any thoughts on this?\n\n**For Magic Arena (electronic version of the game):**\n\n* The argument might stand that WOTC does not give up actual \"ownership\" of the cards, however, in the context of 319, there is no explicit mention of ownership. Only \"distribution\" of such property. The game aspect may not conceal the fact there exists a purchase of chance within the game.\n\nReference:\n\n[Booster Pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_pack)\n\n[Loot Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box)\n\n[California 319](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?chapter=9.&part=1.&lawCode=PEN&title=9.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So the way I understand the thinking, is that TCG Booster cards have a set number (lets say 11\\) per each pack and each pack costs a set value X. The producer of the card thus values all cards in the pack at a price x/11 \\= $cost to make \\+ $profits for work per card. That is the materials and packaging per card in pack is all valued at the same regardless of rarity. After the company sells the card, secondhand sales of the card are not factored into their valuation of the card. A rare card could potentially be valued much lower than a common card based on the games current meta and popular strategy and use, though usually, the rare cards tend to be more important to the game.\n\nThey also have a gareente that out of these 11 cards a subset of them will always be common, another subset will always be uncommon, and the remainder will be rare or super\\-rare. Usually it will be something like 7:3:1\\. There might be an additional \"Secret Rare\" card that will occur once per box of booster packs. Again, while the value of the cards on the secondary market is going to be wildly disparent based on the pack of cards, the manufactured value will always be x/11 per pack.\n\nAs far as the law is concerned, the fact that everyone gets the same amount of cards from the rarity and that all cards are valued the same is enough. The secondary market doesn't matter. They don't care if the rarist card you get isn't a good card in a meta\\-game or a popular character in the fandom (i.e. Charizard), so long as it's cost to the manufacturer is the same as the secret rare card that occurs once per shipped box.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation given, which of the following best describes why Trading Card Game (TCG) booster packs are generally not considered illegal lotteries under laws like California Penal Code 319?\n\nA) The secondary market value of individual cards is irrelevant to the manufacturer's pricing strategy.\n\nB) Rare cards are always more valuable than common cards.\n\nC) Players are guaranteed to receive a specific number of cards of each rarity in every pack.\n\nD) The law explicitly exempts TCG booster packs from being classified as lotteries.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key factor that distinguishes TCG booster packs from illegal lotteries is that they provide a guaranteed distribution of card rarities in each pack. This means that while the specific cards are random, the overall structure of what a buyer receives is consistent and predetermined. \n\nOption A, while true, is not the primary reason these packs avoid being classified as lotteries. The secondary market is indeed irrelevant to the manufacturer's pricing, but this alone doesn't address the element of chance.\n\nOption B is incorrect. The value of cards can vary regardless of rarity, especially considering game strategy and meta.\n\nOption D is false. The law doesn't specifically exempt TCG booster packs; rather, they avoid classification as lotteries due to their structure.\n\nThe guaranteed rarity distribution (e.g., 7 common, 3 uncommon, 1 rare) ensures that each pack provides a consistent product, even if the specific cards are random. This structure, combined with the manufacturer's uniform valuation of cards regardless of rarity, is what typically prevents TCG booster packs from being considered illegal lotteries under such laws."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87129/can-an-employer-enforce-arbitration-after-the-expiration-of-a-contract-in-nj", "docs_id": 87129, "title": "Can an Employer Enforce Arbitration After the Expiration of a Contract in NJ?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose an employer hires an employee for exactly one year and terminates the employee after the year is over.

The contract remains effective as to rights and obligations arising during the course of the employment covered by the contract.\n\n(This concept would also sometimes be described in terms along the lines of \"the right to a remedy for the workplace injury and the right to have disputes related to that resolved in arbitration are vested rights\" that are not modified when the contract term of employment ends.)\n\nThis concept isn't particular to the arbitration obligation.\n\nFor example, if contract of employment that did not contain an arbitration clause provided that the employee was paid $200 an hour for the first six months and $220 an hour for the second six months of a one year fixed term employment agreement, but the employer failed to adjust paychecks according after the first six months and continued paying the employee at $200 an hour instead (assume to avoid the issue of waiver that this wasn't readily apparent on the face of the paystubs provided to the employee), the employee could bring suit thirteen months after the employee's employment terminated for the $20 an hour not paid as agreed during the last six months of the contract even though the employment period had ended.\n\nThe contract still remains in force to govern the rights and obligations of the parties arising during the period of employment.\n\n**Examples Of Termination Of The Contract Itself**\n\nIn contrast, sometimes one contract is replaced, even retroactively, with another contract, in what is called a \"[novation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/novation.asp)\" of the original contract. This truly does terminate the old contract, so that only the replacement contract remains.\n\nSo, if, for example, the original employment contract contained an arbitration clause, but this was replaced by a new employment contract without an arbitration clause three months later (in the sample case, before the worker was injured\\<3\\>), then the arbitration clause would not apply because the contract, and not just the employment was terminated.\n\nSimilarly, support that the workplace injury was the second dispute between the employer and employee that had come up. The first was a dispute over the rate of pay received which was resolved by a settlement agreement negotiated by lawyers for the parties before either arbitration or litigation in court was commenced, which expressly terminated all rights, known and unknown, of the parties arising under the contract, and the second was the workplace injury for which the relationship of the injury to work was only discovered later on. In this case, the contract and not just the employment had been expressly terminated, and so the arbitration clause would not apply to the workplace injury dispute (which would be barred by the settlement agreement and which may or may not have had an arbitration clause of its own).\n\n**End Notes**\n\n\\<1\\> At least assuming that the dispute would have been subject to arbitration if a dispute were litigated while the employee was still employed. There can be circumstances when a workplace injury is not subject to arbitration even if the employer and employee undoubtedly agreed to an arbitration clause that applies to the dispute in question. For example, workplace injuries arising from sexual assault are not subject to arbitration in the United States. *See* 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401\\-402\\.\n\n\\<2\\> The severability principle usually concerns a determination of the enforceability of an arbitration clause in the face of certain kinds of arguments that the entire contract as a whole is voidable. It also does not apply in cases where there is a dispute over whether any contract of any kind was formed in the first place. For example, if someone presented the court with a contract containing an arbitration clause and sought to compel arbitration, and the defense to a motion to compel arbitration was that the defendant had never met or had any connection with or communication with the defendant or anyone related to the alleged contract.\n\n\\<3\\> The hard case, where the novation takes place after the injury, is complicated by legal doctrines regarding the conditions under which a vested legal right can be waived, which may or may not be met depending upon the circumstances under which the novation was entered into by the parties and presents conceptually distinct legal questions in addition to the legal questions already present in the simple case where the injury takes place after the novation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee was hired under a one-year contract that included an arbitration clause.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the applicability of the arbitration clause?\n\nA) The arbitration clause no longer applies because the contract has expired.\nB) The arbitration clause applies only if the employee files a claim within a reasonable time after contract expiration.\nC) The arbitration clause applies because the injury occurred during the contract period, regardless of when the claim is filed.\nD) The arbitration clause applies only if both parties mutually agree to continue its enforcement after contract expiration.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As explained in the documentation, what terminates when a period of employment ends is the employment itself, not the contract of employment. The contract remains effective as to rights and obligations arising during the course of the employment covered by the contract. This means that the arbitration clause would still apply to disputes arising from incidents that occurred during the contract period, even if the claim is filed after the contract has expired and employment has been terminated. The timing of the discovery of the injury or the filing of the claim does not affect the applicability of the arbitration clause, as long as the incident giving rise to the claim occurred during the contract period.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the expiration of the contract does not automatically nullify clauses related to disputes arising from the contract period. Answer B is incorrect because there is no mention of a \"reasonable time\" requirement in the given information.

However, I'm close to a situation that is after the fact, so to speak. Please bear with me for a minute and I'll explain, then ask my question. \n\nMy father\\-in\\-law passed away this past summer. He and his wife had several large properties, and most of the family (except my wife and I) live on one of those properties. My mother\\-in\\-law decided that the property is far too much for her to handle so she's signed over the trust deeds to three properties to her children, without specifying how the land is to be divided up. \n\nThere is a working ranch (I call it a hobby ranch because it's for their pleasure, not a real business) on the property where the family lives. The mother\\-in\\-law is leaving it up to the children to decided how the land will be divided up. She doesn't want to be the \"bad guy\". \n\nMy question is this. Given the circumstances described above, would the kind of thing fall under the category of \"estate planning\"? And if it does, will any attorney with estate planning experience be able to handle this kind of situation? Or do we need to look for specific expertise?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, this falls under the heading of **negotiation**. You will need a lawyer and probably an accountant because if this is done badly you will owe waaay more tax than you should. However, most general lawyers will have sufficient experience with property transfer to be able to help you.\n\nWhat will matter in this is how the properties were owned by your mother\\-in\\-law and how the transfer is structured to the children. The three children *can* just hold equal share in each of the properties but I gather that is not what you want.\n\nYou need to agree among yourselves who gets what property and in what proportion. This doesn't have to involve valuations and equal shares *unless you want it to*. So long as everyone is satisfied with the division, equality is irrelevant. A lawyer may help with negotiation but then, so could a good friend who is a cod fisherman.\n\nWhat you really, really want to avoid is having the property pass to the siblings and *then* redistributing it \\- this will trigger property taxes twice.

It advises that most general lawyers with property transfer experience can handle this, and an accountant may be needed for tax considerations. The answer emphasizes the importance of agreeing on property division among the siblings and structuring the transfer properly to avoid unnecessary taxes.

United States*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/320/81) case, the court had to determine whether imposing a curfew on those of Japanese descent was valid. The main constitutional issue ended up being the effectiveness of the [Fifth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) in providing for due process of law in times of war. In the end, the court decided that a curfew was indeed justified.\n\nFollowing this, the majority of the court found in [*Korematsu v. United States*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/214), that the exclusion of those with Japanese ancestry from certain military zones (in this case, the West coast) was also constitutional. In their decision, they heavily relied upon the *Hirabayashi* case.\n\nThe question of internment of people with Japanese ancestry was not actually decided constitutionally. Another case, a habeas corpus case, [*Ex parte Endo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_parte_Endo) might have resolved it, but the Court concluded this case in favor of Endo without going to the constitutional level. A day before this decision was announced, the government suspended Executive Order 9066, leaving the question unresolved.\n\nIn these cases, Justice Frank Murphy's opinions stand out. In *Hirabayashi*, he sternly warned of the racism involved, but felt that the curfew was indeed justified. However, in *Korematsu*, he evidently felt that the exclusion was without basis and dissented, calling the majority opinion \"legalization of racism.\"\n\nCurrent Law\n===========\n\nIn theory, these cases still stand. This is because they haven't been explicitly overruled, and the changes to the constitution since *Hirabayashi* aren't relevant: Amendments XXII and XXV have to do with procedural issues with the office of the President, amendments XXIII, XIV, and XXVI are related to voting rights, and XXVII addresses Congressional salaries. The constitution for the purpose of a similar order is thus unchanged, and so should theoretically be covered under *Korematsu* \\& *Hirabayashi*.\n\nHowever, its effective status as precedent is shaky. For one, it has been widely condemned, and courts would likely avoid using *Korematsu* \\& *Hirabayashi* if possible, or attempt to make a distinction from them given a slightly different order. Second, the convictions against Korematsu and Hirabayashi were overturned in the 1980s based on evidence being possibly concealed by the government. This was [confirmed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/blog/confession-error-solicitor-generals-mistakes-during-japanese-american-internment-cases) by the Department of Justice in 2011\\. However, this is an error of *fact*, and as such the *ratio decidendi* (legal reasoning) used would still technically stand as precedent.\n\n**Lengthy Update:** The Supreme Court has since declared *Korematsu* incorrect in *[Trump v. Hawaii](https://casetext.com/case/trump-v-hawaii-4)*. However in doing so, the court explicitly distinguished the two cases. Thus, many consider the declaration to be *obiter dictum*, i.e. an aside that is non\\-precedential. I'll quote the relevant portion so that readers may decide for themselves:\n\n> Finally, the dissent invokes *Korematsu v. United States*, 323 U.S. 214, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944\\). Whatever rhetorical advantage the dissent may see in doing so, *Korematsu* has nothing to do with this case. The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority. But it is wholly inapt to liken that morally repugnant order to a facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> The dissent's reference to *Korematsu*, however, affords this Court the opportunity to make express what is already obvious: *Korematsu* was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and\u2014to be clear\u2014\"has no place in law under the Constitution.\"\n\nAdditionally further muddying the issue is that the judgment directly moves from referencing *Korematsu* to referencing concentration camps. But as noted above, *Korematsu* dealt with exclusion, not internment in concentration camps as is often popularly believed (though Murphy's \\& Roberts's dissents dispute the distinction so the *Trump v. Hawaii* judgment may implicitly be validating this). *Korematsu* paragraph 20:\n\n> It is said that we are dealing here with the case of imprisonment of a citizen in a concentration camp solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition towards the United States. Our task would be simple, our duty clear, were this a case involving the imprisonment of a loyal citizen in a concentration camp because of racial prejudice. Regardless of the true nature of the assembly and relocation centers\u2014and we deem it unjustifiable to call them concentration camps with all the ugly connotations that term implies\u2014we are dealing specifically with nothing but an exclusion order.\n\nFuture Challenges\n=================\n\nIf another such order occurred, it would almost certainly reach the Supreme Court. The Court would then have to adhere to, reconcile with, or overrule *Korematsu* \\& *Hirabayashi*. In *Hirabayashi*, the following key piece of reasoning was given (and quoted in *Korematsu*):\n\n> Whatever views we may entertain regarding the loyalty to this country of the citizens of Japanese ancestry, we cannot reject as unfounded the judgment of the military authorities and of Congress that there were disloyal members of that population, whose number and strength could not be precisely and quickly ascertained. We cannot say that the war\\-making branches of the Government did not have ground for believing that in a critical hour such persons could not readily be isolated and separately dealt with, and constituted a menace to the national defense and safety, which demanded that prompt and adequate measures be taken to guard against it.\n\nRegardless of personal beliefs, it is hard to argue the logic behind this particular statement (mainly because it is so broad, in my opinion). However, these \"prompt and adequate measures\" would still have to be weighed against the Fifth Amendment. Additionally, we now have a historical example of what may happen if race\\-based exclusion were allowed, and this could inform the justices' decision.\n\nA completely different way that such an order could be ruled unconstitutional could be through separation of powers violations. It could be ruled that Congress [cannot constitutionally delegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondelegation_doctrine#United_States) the powers expressed in Executive Order 9066, but this is rare. It was mentioned in *Hirabayashi*, but the court did not consider this issue, saying that since Congress agreed with the order, this point was moot.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nThough the letter of the law suggests that another order like Executive Order 9066 is possible, in practice it would face significant hurdles. Such an order would likely face challenges based on the Fifth Amendment and almost certainly make its way to SCOTUS. Then, it would be up to them to decide.\n\nI'll end with this [quote](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/scalia_korematsu_was_wrong_but_you_are_kidding_yourself_if_you_think_it_won) from the late Justice Antonin Scalia:\n\n> Well, of course, *Korematsu* was wrong \\[...] But you are kidding yourself if you think the same thing will not happen again.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the current legal status of Executive Order 9066 and the Korematsu v. United States decision?\n\nA) Executive Order 9066 and the Korematsu decision have been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court case and are no longer valid precedents.\n\nB) The Korematsu decision remains fully intact as binding precedent and could be directly applied to justify similar executive orders today.\n\nC) While Korematsu has been widely criticized and its factual basis discredited, its legal reasoning has not been definitively overruled, leaving its precedential status ambiguous.\n\nD) The Supreme Court has conclusively ruled that any exclusion or internment based on race or national origin is unconstitutional under all circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it most accurately captures the nuanced legal status of Korematsu v. United States. While the case has been widely condemned and the convictions of Korematsu and Hirabayashi were overturned in the 1980s due to concealed evidence, the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled the legal reasoning in a binding decision. \n\nThe Trump v. Hawaii case did state that Korematsu was \"gravely wrong\" and has been \"overruled in the court of history,\" but this statement is considered by many to be obiter dictum (non-binding commentary) rather than a formal overruling. Additionally, the Court distinguished Trump v. Hawaii from Korematsu, further complicating its precedential status.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there hasn't been an explicit overruling in a binding decision. Option B is too strong, as Korematsu's status as precedent is indeed shaky and courts would likely be very reluctant to apply it directly. Option D goes too far in claiming a conclusive ruling against any race-based exclusion, which has not occurred in such absolute terms."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15042/what-legal-course-is-there-with-a-bad-neighbor", "docs_id": 15042, "title": "What legal course is there with a bad neighbor?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a very bad neighbor.

It may also be that each time the apartments contact him to voice their concern, he physically goes over there and basically has a tantrum, but without making direct threats. Most of the apartment staff are tiny women (shorter than 5ft).\n\nWhen I asked if I could install a hidden camera to watch my car, I was told by management they wouldn't give permission, but also weren't *not* giving permission, and wished me luck trying to catch him on film.\n\nIf I install a hidden camera, is it legal, and could I contact the police/evict him/file a restraining order?

To help you clarify a whole mish\\-mash of issues I will address each of your points.\n\n> 1. frequently calls false noise complaints on neighbors resulting in police action.\n\nIf the person genuinely believes that these complaints are valid, even if they do not end up being substantiated, he is within his rights to make such complaints. If you can document an ongoing pattern of unproven complaints this *might* amount to harassment and you could then seek a court order that he stop the harassing behaviour. However, if even a few of these complaints are proven this would become much harder.\n\n> 2. stands in front of the building in a menacing way as people enter/exit.\n\nHe is entitled to stand wherever he likes in whatever \"way\" he likes. This is only an issue if the person entering/exiting has a reasonable fear that he will he will visit actual harm upon them, o, of course, if he actually does visit physical harm upon them. If so, then this is assault and can be reported to the police or be the basis of a civil action.\n\n> 3. hates black people.\n\nSo, he's a bigot \\- this is not actually illegal. Discriminating against someone on the basis that they are black is illegal, hating them on that basis isn't.\n\n> 4. hates Middle Eastern people and Muslims.\n\nDitto.\n\n> 5. constantly pounds on the floor/walls/ceilings.\n\nIt can't be \"constantly\" \\- it might be often or even frequently, if you intent to take legal action hyperbolic language is not going to aid your case. To make a real complaint about this you would need to diarise each occurrence.\n\nNotwithstanding, unless he is damaging someone else's property or is violating a noise ordinance this is not illegal.\n\n> 6. screams curses at children.\n\nClearly reprehensible behaviour: not clearly illegal. Unless this is assault (see above) or qualifies as offensive behavior under the criminal code wherever you are (unlikely) then he can scream whatever he wants at whoever he likes. Again, a pattern of such behavior may constitute harassment.\n\n> 7. Continues to park in handicap parking despite not being handicap, and receiving very expensive parking tickets.\n\nThis is illegal and he is being punished for it. Unfortunately the expression [Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time.](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Don%27t%20do%20the%20crime%2C%20if%20you%20can%27t%20do%20the%20time.) has a corollary: if you are willing and able to take the punishment then you do as much crime as you want. \n\n> And to add to the list, I suspect he's been putting nails in my car tire, always on the same tire, on the inside wall of the tire; I just replaced my 5th tire in 3 months.\n\nThis is a crime. If you can get evidence to prove it then you can report him to the police and/or sue him for the damage.\n\nYou have stated in your comments that you will be asking another question specifically about filming him, so I won't address this here.\n\n> Is there some sort of legal incentive I've not clearly communicated to management to evict him?\n\nThat depends on if any of his actions are actually grounds for terminating his lease and, if they are, the landlord wants to do so. A remote landlord who is getting his rent on time and not having their property damaged has no incentive to evict a tenant: no matter how annoying they are to others.\n\nIt is possible, that you have a case for breaking your lease and/or suing your landlord for damages as you are not getting \"quiet enjoyment\" of the property. A suit along those lines may resolve the matter because either you or he will be evicted. Consult a lawyer.\n\n> If he actually is insane, what sort of liability for his actions does he have?\n\nThe same as anybody else.

They don't fit in my regular trash pickup, so I'd have to pay for either bulk pickup, or pay to take them to the local transfer station.\n\nI'm aware that goods delivered by mistake usually become the property of the recipient to do with whatever they please. But these goods are basically just trash that will cost me money to dispose of. Is there any recourse here to hold the sender responsible for the delivery?

Hickenlooper*](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20170505a91). The state requires a supermajority for tax or spending increases, and several lawmakers challenged the law as violating the Guarantee Clause, which guarantees each state a republican form of government.\n\nThe case has been going on for a long time. It's about seven years old now, and they're still arguing about who has standing to bring the lawsuit. The latest development is that [no one had standing](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20170505a91), but that decision is currently being appealed in the Tenth Circuit. \n\nA bigger problem than standing, though, may be justiciability. In [*Huddleston v. Sawyer*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/or-supreme-court/1485393.html), the Supreme Court of Oregon, rejected a challenge to supermajority requirements for reducing citizen\\-approved sentences for crimes, and in [*Lefkovits v. State Board of Elections*](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/400/1005/1367220/), the Northern District of Illinois did the same with respect to judicial retention votes. Both courts concluded that supermajority requirements were a political issue, not a legal one. \n\nThe justiciability concerns should be tempered by two considerations. First, there's an argument in Kerr that because taxes and spending are such core legislative functions, that it should be harder to uphold restrictions on the legislature's ability to vote on them. Second, there's U.S. Supreme Court precedent in [*New York v.

The investor does not need to be a dishonest person to decide that you might need to be demoted from CEO at some point, for example. You may differ on the need for future investments or the need to both accept dilution to bring in the investment. If you are the CEO they could legitimately worry that you will spend their money in an wasteful manner. \n\nUsually an angel is a minority shareholder and they need to protect themselves from you diluting or otherwise screwing them. They would insist on a shareholder agreement that protected them, usually worked out with the help of their attorney and yours. If the angel has a good reputation in the local start\\-up community you may be able to find an attorney to work for the company who will get paid by the company after the investment comes in.\n\nA note \\- an investor has a duty to themselves to protect their money.

According to the information provided, launch-to-orbit services are not automatically considered common carriers like FedEx or UPS. However, if SpaceX were found to have monopoly power in the launch market and was using that power to unfairly monopolize the satellite internet market by refusing to launch competitors' satellites, it could potentially be required to provide launch services to competitors like OneWeb.

I don't see any difference in the two sports other than the number of pins and a few minor differences in the rules and equipment, so I think any reason applicable to one should be applicable. Why wasn't ten\\-pin bowling banned, for the same reasons as nine\\-pin bowling? If the reasons were no longer applicable after ten\\-pin bowling was invented, why didn't most states re\\-allow nine\\-pin bowling?\n\nMy reference is [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFPJf-wKTd0), and the part of it that applies to this question starts at 4:39 and ends at 4:59:\n\n> When the game made its way over to America, nine\\-pin bowling was banned because it promoted gambling. The legend goes that people cleverly came up with ten\\-pin bowling to get around the law. Whoa, totally different game. Today in the US, nine\\-pin bowling is only played in Texas because it was the one state that didn't ban it, instead charging it tax.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Moral panic\n-----------\n\n[Nine\\-pin bowling](https://www.bowlingoverhaul.com/9-pin-bowling-the-game-once-considered-illegal/) was the [violent video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_and_video_games) of its age \\- the people who were in power didn\u2019t like it, didn\u2019t like the type of people who played it, linked it with vice \\- like gambling and laziness \\- and, therefore, banned it.\n\nIt\u2019s a perennial that older people, who tend to be the ones in power, despair over the dissipation of youth and the disintegration of society that will inevitably result. Or rich people, who also are the ones in power, despairing over the recreational activities of working\\-class people.\n\nIt\u2019s probable that there was gambling involved \\- people will bet on anything, and this was a game of skill and chance, a perfect vehicle for gambling. The games and gambling would not have been regulated, so there would almost surely be some criminals who got involved. However, the biggest driver was taking this grain of truth and then blowing it out of all proportion.\n\nAs other answers have pointed out, the laws usually did not specify the number of pins. Eventually, the moral panic declined, and the laws were repealed. However, times had changed, and the 10\\-pin form of the game is what came back backed by larger commercial interests rather than the artisan style of 9\\-pins. 10\\-pin bowling uses much bigger alleys with gutters and is suitable for mechanisation. a 9\\-pin alley can fit in a relatively small room, and standing the pins back up again is not much more demanding than pulling pool balls out of pockets.\n\nIt's not unusual that after government suppression is lifted, things come back different to the way they were before the suppression started.

Consumer protection laws in either the purchaser's country or the recipient's country could potentially override the platform's policy. If either country has strong consumer rights laws that require refunds for products that don't work as intended (in this case, a game that can't be activated due to undisclosed regional restrictions), the platform may be obligated to provide a refund regardless of its stated policy.

According to Wisconsin law, engaging in unlawful conduct does not completely eliminate the possibility of claiming self-defense, but it does raise the bar in certain circumstances. Specifically:\n\n1. If the unlawful conduct is \"of a type likely to provoke others to attack,\" the person must exhaust all other reasonable means of escape before using deadly force.\n\n2. Unlawful conduct removes certain presumptions in favor of the defendant when defending against unlawful entry to their property.\n\n3. If a person intentionally provokes an attack to use it as an excuse for causing death or great bodily harm, they cannot claim self-defense at all.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because unlawful conduct doesn't always eliminate self-defense claims.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the witness's ability to invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination?\n\nA) The witness must provide specific reasons to the judge for invoking the Fifth Amendment.\nB) The prosecution can remove the witness's Fifth Amendment protection by proving the testimony won't be incriminating.\nC) The witness can only invoke the Fifth Amendment if they know they have committed a crime related to the case.\nD) The witness can invoke the Fifth Amendment without specifying any particular crime or reason.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, a witness can invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination without having to specify any particular crime or reason. This protection extends to innocent individuals who may unknowingly incriminate themselves through truthful testimony. The Supreme Court has affirmed that the Fifth Amendment \"protects the innocent as well as the guilty\" and that even truthful responses from an innocent witness may provide incriminating evidence.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the witness does not have to reveal anything to the judge to enforce the protection, as doing so could be self-incriminating.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the prosecution cannot remove Fifth Amendment protection by proving the testimony won't be incriminating. In fact, proving such a negative is generally impossible.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the Fifth Amendment protection applies even if the witness is unaware of any specific crime they may have committed. The protection covers potential incrimination from \"random laws\" they might have unknowingly broken."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16857/abuse-of-power-official-capacity-misuse-of-authority-etc-financial-damage-mi", "docs_id": 16857, "title": "Abuse of power / official capacity / misuse of authority etc financial damage minimum?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A bit of context: Recently the Romanian Justice Ministry signed a executive order to change the penal code decriminalizing \"abuse of power\" if the damage is less than 200000 RON (Aprox: 50\\.000 USD / 45000 EURO) everything less than that is subject of labor law.\n\nIs it normal to have minimum financial damage value for such an act to become felony ?\n\nOnly thing I could find is Texas code where it becomes a state felony above 2\\.500 USD (and I'm not sure about that even, because it says \"value of thing misused\" which for me doesn't equate with damage)\n\nI'm not sure if abuse of power is the correct term (it's a literal translation from Romanian) so here is the definition: \nThe act of civil servant, who, in the exercise of his duties, knowingly, does not act or acts incorrectly and thereby causing harm legal interests of a person\n\nSome examples:\n\nPoliceman giving you I fine without real cause because he doesn't like you, your race or gender\n\nCity council member preferentially selecting streets to be repaired based on his own house location \n\nMayor hiring his own nephew and allowing him not work at all for the job he was hired to do\n\nTaking or giving bribe is another infraction, different from this one, at least in Romanian Penal Code. \n\nI appreciate any references to similar articles in any penal code, or even suggestions for google keywords.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Colorado has what is called a \"[gift ban](http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/info_center/laws/ArticleXXIX.html)\" which is a prohibition against giving anything of value to any state or local public official as a gift, whether or not there is any attempt to influence the official in his official capacity (subject to certain exceptions, for example, for family members giving normal family gifts). \n\nThe threshold for a gift to qualify under the gift ban is $50 (which makes $49\\.99 a popular price at expensive restaurants near the capital).

The question tests understanding of this specific limit. \n\nOption A ($45.00) is incorrect as it's below the actual threshold.\n\nOption B ($49.99) is a tricky choice because the passage mentions it as a popular price at restaurants near the capital, but it's not the actual legal limit.\n\nOption C ($50.00) is correct, as this is the exact threshold mentioned in the passage.\n\nOption D ($55.00) is incorrect.

Option B is incorrect because even though the font and the medication are in different industries, trademark protection can extend across product categories, especially for well-known brands. Option D is too absolute; while seeking permission might be advisable, it's not always legally required.\n\nOption C is the most accurate. The developer might face legal challenges under trademark law, even if the font is in a different industry from pharmaceuticals. The owners of the Tums trademark could potentially claim trademark infringement if they believe the use of the name could confuse consumers or dilute their brand. Additionally, they might pursue a \"passing off\" claim if they can prove reputation or goodwill in the trademark, misrepresentation leading to public confusion, and potential damage to their brand.

As the documentation suggests, the legal system doesn't have pre-existing laws for entities that don't yet exist, such as human clones. When faced with novel situations, the legal system typically adapts and develops new frameworks as needed. This approach would likely be similar to how it would handle other unprecedented scenarios, like the appearance of sentient aliens or plants.\n\nOption A is incorrect because automatic granting of full rights isn't guaranteed for novel entities. Option B is overly restrictive and likely unconstitutional in many jurisdictions. Option D is too extreme, as the clones themselves (as opposed to the act of cloning) wouldn't necessarily be illegal, and blanket denial of all rights would likely face legal challenges.\n\nThe correct approach (C) reflects the legal system's tendency to adapt to new situations, considering existing principles and developing new ones as necessary to address unique circumstances."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32362/can-a-user-request-the-deletion-of-their-ip-address-that-is-stored-for-moderatio", "docs_id": 32362, "title": "Can a user request the deletion of their IP address that is stored for moderation purposes?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: * An Internet forum logs their users' IP addresses for moderation purposes (fighting abusive sockpuppetry, temporary banning a dynamic IP address range in case of a spam attack, permanently banning static IP addresses in case of persistent toxic behaviors, etc)\n* An abusive user request the deletion of their IP address from the logs under GDPR\n* This seems to be in an effort to prevent the moderators from exercising the aforementioned tools, so that the user can abuse the forum undisturbed\n* Do I need to comply?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. [Art. 17(1\\) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/) lists conditions when erasure can be requested.

I believe that such occasions are rare, and that the court makes a significant effort to decide each case in the same term where certiorari is granted.\n\nOnce exception is when the Court has a vacancy and is waiting fora new Justice to be confirmed, and the Justices in office are tied.

However, there have been instances where cases were held over to the next term or re-argued, especially in situations like a 4-4 split due to a Court vacancy. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no legal requirement to decide cases within the same term. Option B is too extreme, as while there's no strict time limit, it's very rare for cases to remain undecided for extended periods. Option D is incorrect as there is no automatic dismissal rule for cases not decided within two terms.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the Court's typical practice while acknowledging the flexibility that exists in exceptional circumstances."}}
