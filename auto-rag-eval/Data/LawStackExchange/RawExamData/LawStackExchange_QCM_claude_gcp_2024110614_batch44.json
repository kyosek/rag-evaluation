The correct answer, D, is the most comprehensive approach to ensuring GDPR compliance.\n\nWhile option A (storing data within the EU) can be part of a compliance strategy, it's not always necessary or sufficient. GDPR allows data transfer outside the EU under certain conditions.\n\nOption B (encryption) is a good security practice but doesn't address all GDPR compliance issues, particularly regarding data transfer and storage location.\n\nOption C (geo-replication) could actually complicate compliance if not managed carefully, as it might lead to unintended data transfers to non-compliant regions.\n\nOption D is the most appropriate because:\n1. It acknowledges that Azure can be used in compliance with GDPR, as stated in the documentation.\n2. It requires verifying Azure's compliance certifications, which is a crucial step in due diligence.\n3. It mentions implementing appropriate data transfer mechanisms, which is necessary when transferring data outside the EU. This could include using Standard Contractual Clauses or ensuring data is only stored in countries with adequacy decisions.\n4. It implies a more holistic approach to compliance, considering both the cloud provider's responsibilities and the company's own measures.\n\nThis approach requires integrating multiple concepts from the documentation, including Azure's GDPR compliance statement, the need to consider legal requirements for cross-border transfers, and the importance of data residency.

The key elements to consider are:\n\n1. Consent obtained through fear: IPC Section 90 states that consent given under fear of injury is not valid consent. The threat of eviction, which would lead to homelessness, qualifies as a threat of \"injury\" under IPC's definition, which includes \"any harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in body, mind, reputation or property.\"\n\n2. IPC Section 375(3) specifically addresses rape scenarios where consent is obtained by putting the victim or someone they're interested in \"in fear of death or of hurt.\" The threat of eviction and subsequent homelessness can be interpreted as a threat of hurt, as it would cause harm to the person's body, mind, and property.\n\n3. The scenario doesn't require the victim to be under 18 (option D), nor is it limited to sexual harassment laws (option C). It's more severe than harassment and falls squarely within the rape statute.\n\n4. While the tenant did technically agree, option A is incorrect because IPC Section 90 invalidates consent given under fear or misconception.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of multiple IPC sections, integration of concepts like the definition of injury and consent, and understanding how these legal principles apply to a real-world scenario.

So don't have anything to do with the alleged theft of trade secrets.\n\nHowever, to my surprise, the other two defendants went to at least 3 different attorneys and neither was willing to take up the case (I don't know the reason yet \\- will discuss with them tomorrow). The tenants are young and have limited life experience and are totally at risk of default judgement if they don't take up the case themselves or still can't find attorney.

Here are my 2 defense arguments that I came up with to at least build defense against the trade secret misappropriation:\n\n1. Most hair salons attract new customers based on business' reputation that is readily accessible on public websites, like Yelp or Google. Contrary to secretive tech startups, beauty salon customers after receiving service are explicitly encouraged by the employee or employer to post public, non\\-anonymous reviews describing their experience without any restrictions. Which implies that customer list can't be a trade secret because there is no effort to hide customer identities.\n2. Most returning customers are usually seeking their favorite hair stylist. Which means that customer list alone can't be constructed as trade secret. It should be viewed as trade secret only in tandem with their favorite hairstylist that they are explicitly seeking. Which means that the moment their favorite hairstylist leaves the employer the information becomes incomplete and hence can't be a trade secret anymore.\n\n**Would, in your opinion, something written like above convince court?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The customer list is indeed a trade secret if the shop kept its customer list secret and has an advantage from having that customer list, while others don\u2019t have it. And I would think that is the case, because a competitor laying their hands on the list could for example send special offers to the customers in the list. \n\nThe question is whether your two hairdressers *took that customer list* and whether the store has reasonable evidence that they did. If customers find out where their favourite hairdresser moved to that\u2019s no legal problem. \n\nCan\u2019t understand why no attorney wants to take the case. To the attorney it doesn\u2019t make a difference whether they took the list or not. If they took the list then his or her job is to end the case with the smallest possible amount of damages being paid. \n\nPS. Just read in the comments that there is an accusation of \"intentional interference with economic relationship\". I would want a lawyer who knows the difference between perfectly legal competition which includes trying to get customers to move their business, and \"intentional interference with economic relationship\". \n\nPS. Really make sure that these guys appear in court. With a lawyer.

The defendant salon owner seeks your advice on building a defense strategy. Which of the following approaches would be most effective in challenging the trade secret claim in a California court?\n\nA) Argue that customer lists cannot be trade secrets because salon reviews on public websites like Yelp effectively reveal customer identities\nB) Claim that customer lists are only valuable when associated with specific stylists, and thus lose trade secret status when stylists leave\nC) Demonstrate that reasonable efforts were made to maintain the secrecy of the customer list and that it provides economic value from not being generally known\nD) Counter-sue the plaintiff for intentional interference with economic relationship based on their attempt to restrict competition\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of trade secret law concepts in the context of a real-world scenario. The correct answer, C, aligns with the legal definition of a trade secret in California, which requires that the information:\n\n1. Derives independent economic value from not being generally known, and\n2. Is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because public reviews don't necessarily reveal a comprehensive customer list or contact information. While some customers may be identifiable, a curated list still holds value.\n\nOption B misunderstands the nature of trade secrets. The value of a customer list isn't solely tied to individual stylists; it represents the salon's accumulated goodwill and customer relationships.\n\nOption D is a misapplication of the \"intentional interference with economic relationship\" concept and doesn't address the trade secret issue at hand.\n\nThe most effective defense strategy (C) would focus on challenging whether the plaintiff took reasonable measures to keep the list secret and whether it truly provides economic value from not being generally known. This approach directly addresses the legal requirements for trade secret protection in California, forcing the plaintiff to prove these elements rather than relying on weaker arguments that misinterpret the nature of trade secrets in this context."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37952/are-slogans-protected-under-trademark", "docs_id": 37952, "title": "Are slogans protected under trademark?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A US\\-based wine company created a slogan.

Could the U.S. company's used violate copyright or trademark?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Slogans, titles, and other short phrases are generally not subject to copyright protection. They can be subject to trademark protection.\n\nTrademark protection is limited in several ways. It is limited by industry. In this case, according to the question, the two companies are marketing the same sort of product, so the industry limitation would not apply. (A wine slogan might not be protected against use to promote a soda, and surely would not be protected against use to promote a computer brand.) In addition, trademark protection is limited to the geographic market area in which it is used. A slogan or trademark used to promote a grocery chain in upstate New York would not be protected against the use of the same slogan in northern California, for example. Separate countries are usually separate market areas, and in addition, have different trademark laws and trademark registration procedures. (Some countries require registration for any trademark protection to apply. The US does not, although it gives stronger protections to registered trademarks.)\n\n(Trademark protection is also limited to use in trade or commerce, but here both companies seem to be using the slogan in trade.)\n\nIf the US company used its slogan to sell wine in Canada, it might be subject to a lawsuit in Canada under Canadian law for infringing the Canadian company's mark. If the Canadian company had been selling wine using the slogan in the US, then it might have grounds for a US suit, under US law, for trademark infringement against the US company.\n\nIf the US company was the fist to use the slogan **in the US** and the Canadian company later started using the slogan in the US, then the US company might have grounds for a suit, as it would have the US rights to that slogan in the wine business. However, if the earlier Canadian use had included advertising that went across the border into the US, that might well reduce the US company's rights, especially if it was relying on use in trade alone, rather than relying on having registered the mark.\n\nIf the US company sold and advertised only in the US, and the Canadian company sold and advertised only in Canada, then neither would seem to have valid grounds for a trademark suit against the other.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. wine company creates a catchy slogan for its new line of wines, only to discover that a Canadian wine company has been using the same slogan for years.

Even though the U.S. company registered the trademark in the U.S., the Canadian company has been using the slogan in Canada. When the U.S. company expands into Canada, it would be entering a market where the Canadian company has established rights to the slogan through use, regardless of registration status.

But if an actor dressed like a monster just wanders around the street, especially around Halloween, and is attacked by someone, then the attacker is culpable, as no reasonable person would have thought the actor was a threat. (please correct me if I'm wrong)\n\nBut let's consider the following scenario:\n\n* **Alice** has a close relative, or boyfriend, or someone she cares deeply about, let's call him **Bob**.\n* Alice thinks Bob is too lazy, too comfortable, and wants to enact a scenario to thrill Bob up a little, and make him more self\\-confident and courageous.\n* So Alice hires **Darren** who is a well known stage illusionist / prankster / movie director, to put Bob through a scenario which seems dangerous (but is actually harmless), in order to instill some courage in him.\n* Darren creates an elaborate setup, for example fake news broadcasts made specifically for Bob, movie props, a big cast of actors, stage illusion tricks etc. to make it seem like there is an apocalyptic scenario, or that mythical monsters are real, or something similar, and the scenario is so professionally done that most reasonable people would be convinced it is real.\n* **Charlie** is one of the actors hired for the show, and is dressed up as a mythical monster (zombie, vampire, lich, whatever) which reasonable people in real life know not to exist, but due to the elaborate setup mentioned above, Bob is gradually convinced is real.\n* Bob attacks and kills Charlie, sincerely believing Charlie to be the aforementioned mythical monster. During this, Charlie wasn't actively attacking Bob, it's Bob who sought out and hunted down Charlie.\n* Neither Darren, nor Charlie, nor Alice intended this to happen. In fact Darren made all reasonable precautions to prevent such accidents, but despite all these precautions the tragedy still happened.

Generally, one cannot *hunt down* a hypothetical threat but one can *defend against* an actual threat or even a *mistakenly assumed* actual threat where no actual threat exists. **Alice** set it up so that **Bob** would feel threatened.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the **self\\-defense** defense for homicide rests on the state of the mind of the suspect, insofar as it can be determined, and failing that on a \"reasonable person\" standard.\n\n* Presumably **Bob** genuinely felt threatened by **Charlie** and says so afterwards. \"I thought he/it/whatever was trying to harm me. I didn't know it was a harmless actor.\" Just how much harm Bob needs to make self\\-defense stick varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It could be fear of imminent, serious bodily harm, or fear of being victimized in any sort of crime (*stand your ground* laws).  \n\nAs the comment by user6726 points out, just protraying a zombie or whatever isn't enough, there has to be threat to Bob.\n* **Bob** cannot hunt **Charlie** down because Charlie \"is\" an evil lich or whatever. Bob can defend himself against attacks by Charlie and (in some jurisdictions) against intrusions by Charlie in his property. So it makes a difference if Bob hunts in his own backyard or further afield.\n* The well\\-documented and extensive efforts by Alice and Darren to fool **Bob** should support Bob's statement. Say the court/jury believes that it was reasonable (or at least \"not entirely unreasonable\") for Bob to be afraid.\n* Since the perceived self\\-defense would apply *even if* Bob thought the attacker was human, thinking that it was non\\-human should make little difference. Except that it would further showcase the degree to which Bob was fooled to see a threat.\n* If the whole endeavor by **Alice** and **Darren** broke laws, the death *might* fall into felony homicide in some jurisdictions. This one could come to technicalities because Bob wasn't their accomplice.

Not having a phone line does not make a dwelling uninhabitable (unless your locale specifically says so). In [California](http://housing.ucsc.edu/cro/pdf/telephone.pdf), it is required that the landlord maintain at least one jack and working lines (this is a direct requirement, not expressed in terms of habitability).

Most commonly it refers to someone who owns something losing it because of their actions. In particular, a would\\-be buyer who puts down a deposit but breaches the conditions of the contract may forfeit the deposit, with it becoming the property of the would\\-be seller. This is perhaps the most common usage.\n\nA person who does not own something, but expects to, may forfeit that expectation. When a would\\-be buyer puts down a deposit as before, but the seller breaches the contract, the seller may forfeit the deposit, that is may lose the right to retain the deposit, with it going back to the would\\-be buyer instead.\n\nOne may also forfeit a right or privilege. Under the older US copyright law, for example, when a copyright holder failed to renew a copyright, the holder was said to forfeit the copyright. When a criminal defendant fails to assert a privilege, such as the privilege of medical confidentiality, the defendant is said to forfeit that privilege.\n\nA thing lost because of incorrect or improper conduct can be called a forfeit, in this case the word is a noun.\n\nIf a person does not pay property tax, the property may be forfeit to the state for lack of proper tax payments.\n\nAnd \"forfeit\" may be used as a verb to describe the legal process of causing someone to undergo a forfeiture. In this case it is a bit like \"foreclose\". In the first example above where a buyer puts down a deposit but breaches the contract, the seller may \"forfeit the deposit\" that is take legal action to secure legal ownership of the deposit, because of the buyer's failure to comply with the contract.\n\nIn all these cases something of value is lost because of some failure or improper act on the part of the person who loses it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A real estate developer has entered into a contract to purchase a large commercial property for $10 million, with a non-refundable deposit of $500,000. Due to unforeseen market conditions, the developer fails to complete the purchase by the agreed-upon date. The seller, citing \"time is of the essence\" clause, terminates the contract and retains the deposit. The developer sues for relief against forfeiture. Given the current legal principles, what is the most likely outcome of this case?\n\nA) The court will automatically grant relief against forfeiture, as the deposit exceeds 10% of the purchase price.\nB) The seller will be allowed to retain the full deposit, as \"time is of the essence\" was explicitly stated in the contract.\nC) The court will examine whether retaining the deposit is unconscionable, considering factors such as the proportion of the deposit to the purchase price and the actual losses incurred by the seller.\nD) The developer will be granted relief against forfeiture only if they can prove the seller intentionally miscalculated the completion date.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts from the provided documentation and tests critical thinking rather than mere memorization. The correct answer is C, based on the following analysis:\n\n1. The question involves the concept of forfeiture of a deposit in a real estate transaction, which is covered in the documentation.\n\n2. The use of \"forfeit\" by the seller is consistent with the legal usage explained in the documentation, where the seller can be said to \"forfeit\" (retain) the deposit.\n\n3. The documentation mentions that courts have an equitable jurisdiction to grant relief against forfeiture if allowing forfeiture would be unconscionable.\n\n4. The case of Union Eagle Ltd v Golden Achievement Ltd (1997) suggests that courts may uphold strict time conditions when \"time is of the essence\" is explicitly stated. However, this alone is not determinative.\n\n5. The Supreme Court in Cavendish Square Holdings BV v El Makdessi (2015) noted similarities between penalty clauses and forfeiture of deposits, suggesting a nuanced approach.\n\n6. The criterion for relief against forfeiture, as stated in Stockloser v Johnson (1954), is whether it would be \"oppressive and unconscionable\" for the defendant to retain the deposit.\n\nTherefore, the court would likely examine various factors to determine if retaining the deposit is unconscionable, including the proportion of the deposit to the purchase price, the actual losses incurred by the seller, and the circumstances of the breach. This approach balances the strict enforcement of contract terms with the equitable power of the court to prevent unfair outcomes.\n\nOptions A, B, and D represent common misconceptions or oversimplifications of the legal principles involved, making them plausible distractors that test the examinee's depth of understanding of the subject matter."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49733/can-one-tenant-consider-breaking-the-lease-on-the-part-of-management-if-a-neighb", "docs_id": 49733, "title": "Can one tenant consider breaking the lease on the part of management if a neighbor violates smoking policy in Texas?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a neighbor is being exposed to second hand smoke in an apartment complex and the other party doing the smoking is doing it in a way that breaks the lease, could that be grounds in Texas for the tenant being exposed to that smoke to break the lease with the leasing office?\n\nI am speaking of a scenario where the leasing office has verified that the smoking policy is the same for all leases.\n\nLet's say the leasing office has been notified but the behavior continues.\n\nAny case study out there comes to mind for the state of Texas?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Unless the \"other party\" in this scenario is you or your landlord, how can they be breaking your lease?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYour lease is the one between you and your landlord.

Indeed, you probably can't even deduct cost of goods sold. \n\nRevenue is the amount of money that a company brings in from selling goods and services (investment income is arguably more ambiguous, and loan proceeds would clearly not be revenue).\n\nIn the absence of other indications, a court would probably look the generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP) to define revenue, or perhaps definitions used by the U.S. Small Business Admnistration, or dictionary definitions, in the context of a contract. Whatever \"revenue\" means, it almost certainly doesn't mean \"profits\".\n\nRevenue makes more sense than profits in any case in this circumstance. They are trying to use a measure that is hard to manipulate, easy to determine from accounting records, easy to estimate in the absence of good record keeping, and that reflects the scale of the enterprise. \n\nRevenue is a standard measure of small v. large businesses for many purposes. \n\nProfit, in contrast, can be easily manipulated (e.g. through salaries paid to insiders and related party cost of goods sold contracts).

The United Kingdom was formed first by the personal union of monarchs from 1603 (under King James VI of Scotland a.k.a. King James I of England) followed by a federal style merger of governments approved by the Scottish and English parliaments in 1706\\-1707, rather than by conquest and it has much more government autonomy in generally applicable legislation and its judicial system than Wales does, and more than Ireland had when it was ruled by England. On the other hand, Scottish sentiment towards independence was not exactly unanimous in support of staying with the U.K. in the last referendum in 2014 when 44\\.7% of votes cast were for independence with 84\\.6% voter turnout (including voters as young as age 16\\).\n\nNorthern Ireland's story is a bit more complicated as Ireland had a legal status similar to Wales from a similar medieval era, but this was complicated by the Irish independence struggle ultimately leading to the creation of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The fine line and complexity of the situation in Northern Ireland is illustrated by this map, and strong autonomy was necessary to allow it to maintain the fragile Protestant\\-Roman Catholic balance in a divided society there:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdKM6.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdKM6.png)\n\nEach of the components of the United Kingdom has a separate and historically determined status that is not exactly parallel to any of the others. England has no national assembly of its own, sufficing to use the national parliament for its laws despite the fact that some seats in that parliament that govern it are selected in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Likewise, before the U.S. gained independence, different parts of the U.S. had distinct relationships to the U.K., as did the various colonial possessions of the U.K. (e.g. India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Kenya, Tanzania, Hong Kong).\n\nThe U.K. is an exemplary example of the philosophy that consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. To pluck out just one more random example of the English tendency, \"Scotland Yard\", the national police force headquarters in the City of Westminster within the City of Greater London in England, has jurisdiction over England and Wales, but not over Scotland.\n\nLegal Distinctions Between England And Wales\n============================================\n\nTo provide a few other examples in addition to the example of language related laws noted by @WeatherVane (noted on my recent visit to England and Wales) and to embellish on that point a little further, the Welsh language is resurgent in Wales where it is a mandatory subject in public schools (often in the North with Welsh as the primary language of instruction) with about 30% of the population (more than 800,000 people) who either speak it as a first language (which is common among the very old and among young people in Northern Wales) by people who are mostly bilingual with English (but may reach for an English word or two now and then) or as a fluent second language.\n\n* The Anglican Church is the established church in England, but not in Wales where it was disestablished in 1916\\. The legal implications of this are subtle, but not non\\-existent.\n* Government agencies are not required to hoist the British flag with primacy over the Welsh flag, and indeed, the British flag is rarely seen there.\n* Primary and secondary education are administered separately in England and Wales with attendant laws on issues like truancy, dress codes, financial arrangements, testing, and certain holidays. This distinction primarily exists to facilitate Welsh language instruction, which is the primary language of instruction in some schools, and a secondary language in others.\n* More generally, the manner in which many government services (e.g. public housing) is administered, and in which tax dollars are expended is not precisely the same between England and Wales.\n* Certain laws regulating immigrants (related to immigrant financial security and leases to immigrants, more or less) differ between England and Wales, although this is a temporary matter and the long term plan is for these laws to be integrated across the United Kingdom.\n* The Welsh Senedd (a.k.a. National Assembly for Wales, i.e. the regional parliament) has some independent legislative power, although honestly, the scope of its legislation is typically closer to what you might see in a U.S. home rule city or a school board, than in a U.S. state government. In [particular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government):\n\n> The 20 areas of responsibility devolved to the National Assembly for\n> Wales (and within which Welsh ministers exercise executive functions)\n> are:\n> \n> \n> * Agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development\n> * Ancient monuments and historical buildings\n> * Culture\n> * Economic development\n> * Education and training\n> * Environment\n> * Fire and rescue services and promotion of fire safety\n> * Food\n> * Health and social services\n> * Highways and transport\n> * Housing\n> * Local government\n> * National Assembly for Wales\n> * Public administration\n> * Social welfare\n> * Sport and recreation\n> * Tourism\n> * Town and country planning\n> * Water and flood defences\n> * Welsh language\n\n* I suspect, but do not know, that land use regulation and occupational and business licensing in Wales is less favorable to big businesses and franchises, based upon the fact that such businesses are far more common in England than in Wales, even controlling for places that are similar in population density.

The correct answer is B because language requirements would differ significantly between England and Wales due to the unique status of the Welsh language in Wales.\n\nThe documentation states that Welsh is a mandatory subject in Welsh public schools, with about 30% of the population speaking it either as a first or fluent second language. Moreover, it mentions that the Welsh language is one of the 20 areas of responsibility devolved to the National Assembly for Wales. This means that language policies, especially in customer service, would need to be distinctly different in Wales compared to England.\n\nOption A is incorrect because corporate tax strategies are generally governed by UK-wide legislation, not differing significantly between England and Wales.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while healthcare is mentioned as a devolved responsibility, the differences in employee benefit packages between England and Wales would likely be less pronounced than language requirements.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while there might be some differences in administrative procedures, these would be less significant than the language issue.

Option B is the best strategy because:\n\n1. It leverages Material.io components, which are explicitly offered by Google under the MIT open-source license. The documentation states: \"Material.io and the Material Components libraries are a special case: Google has developed a design language and offers components that implement this design language under the MIT license, an open source license.\"\n\n2.

It avoids directly copying protected assets (Option A), which the documentation explicitly forbids: \"You cannot copy or imitate assets that fall under copyright protection.\"\n\n4. It steers clear of closely imitating Google's site design (Option C), which could cause confusion: \"you cannot imitate their site design so closely that a reasonable visitor would think that your site was a Google site.\"\n\n5. It doesn't involve reverse-engineering design patents (Option D), which would likely infringe on Google's intellectual property rights.\n\nThis approach allows the startup to benefit from Google's design language while maintaining legal compliance and developing a unique identity.

Which of the following legal principles would most likely support a successful complaint against the organization's actions?\n\nA) The principle of promissory estoppel, as the organization implicitly promised equal treatment to all ticket holders\nB) The doctrine of unconscionability, as the compensation scheme is grossly unfair to two-day ticket holders\nC) The concept of unjust enrichment, as the organization benefits from retaining funds from two-day ticket holders\nD) Anti-discrimination laws, as the organization's actions constitute unfair treatment based on ticket type\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of legal concepts to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C, based on the concept of unjust enrichment. While the organization's actions seem unfair, the documentation clearly states that \"The law does not protect you from unfairness or discrimination\" unless it's based on protected classes, which ticket type is not.\n\nOption A is incorrect because promissory estoppel typically requires a clear promise, which isn't evident here. Option B is incorrect because unconscionability usually applies to contract formation, not post-formation actions. Option D is incorrect because, as explicitly stated, discrimination based on ticket type is not protected by law.\n\nThe concept of unjust enrichment could potentially be argued, as the organization is retaining funds from two-day ticket holders while offering compensation to one-day ticket holders.

The drug's mechanism, despite increasing twin births, does not involve the deliberate biomedical techniques associated with reproductive cloning.\n\nOption B is the correct answer because it misrepresents the nature of identical twins and could be seen as promoting a form of reproductive cloning.

It includes (emphasis mine):\n\n> 3. \"Firearm\" means (a) any pistol or revolver; or (b) a shotgun having\n> one or more barrels less than eighteen inches in length; or (c) a rifle\n> having one or more barrels less than sixteen inches in length; or (d)\n> any weapon made from a shotgun or rifle whether by alteration,\n> modification, or otherwise if such weapon as altered, modified, or\n> otherwise has an overall length of less than twenty\\-six inches; or (e)\n> an assault weapon. For the purpose of this subdivision the length of the\n> barrel on a shotgun or rifle shall be determined by measuring the\n> distance between the muzzle and the face of the bolt, breech, or\n> breechlock when closed and when the shotgun or rifle is cocked; the\n> overall length of a weapon made from a shotgun or rifle is the distance\n> between the extreme ends of the weapon measured along a line parallel to\n> the center line of the bore. **Firearm does not include an antique\n> firearm.**\n\n> 14. \"**Antique firearm**\" means:\n> Any **unloaded** muzzle loading pistol or revolver with a matchlock,\n> flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system, or a\n> pistol or revolver which uses fixed cartridges which are no longer\n> available in the ordinary channels of commercial trade.\n\nSo, under NY Law, a gun is **only** an antique if unloaded. Loading it makes it apparently no longer an antique, but a (normal) black powder firearm, with the normal firearms rules applying to carrying, transporting, and using them for legal or recreational purposes \\- which for NYC would mandate [a registration since 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_New_York#cite_note-42) and in 2010 would have required license\\-to\\-carry.\n\n> Opinions of the State Attorney General:P: \"December 19, 1977 (informal No. 77\\- 00\\): Unloaded replica muzzle loading percussion pistols may be sold, purchased and possessed without a license.

So as a result: you can have it, but not be able to load it or you need a firearms registration/license.

However, in a practical manner, it seems that the supply of black powder might be rather limited in NY and sometimes close to impossible without a license for explosives \\- at least that's what some half\\-hour of reading muzzleloader boards told me, but legally you could buy less than 5 lbs without a license as that would be not an explosive under the law.\n\n> \\[NYCL LAB]**\u00a7451 Definitions**\n> \n> \n> 1. \"Explosives\" means gunpowder, powders used for blasting, \\[...], smokeless powder, \\[...] but shall not include \\[...] quantities of black powder not exceeding five pounds for use in firing antique firearms or artifacts or replicas thereof.\n> \n> \n> **\u00a7458 Liceses \\& Certifications**\n> \n> \n> \\[You need a license to buy, handle or use any explosives as defined above]\n> \n> \n> 8.

On the other hand, you can't fire them without black powder, and that requires you to acquire a powder handling license to obtain the powder and be allowed to create the charges.\n\nProvided you have such a gun that requires powder and go to a shooting range, where one of the shooters has the license, he can weigh and prepare the powder tubes (you are not allowed to charge a gun from a powder bottle/flask that contains more than one charge of powder) or paper cartridges, then you can shoot it, even without a black powder handling license or a \"Waffenbesitzkarte\" (Gun license). But if you want to prepare the charges/paper cartridges yourself, you need that license. And afaik you need to be a gunsmith to make a gun yourself. And shooting ranges are required to require that you have \"Beschuss\" on your black powder weapons (proof test). The correct proof mark is Eagle over **SP** for \"schwarzpulver\". You would be technically allowed to get an Eagle over **N** (for Nitrocellulose) and shoot with black powder, but you are not allowed to load nitro into an SP. And you can't shoot projectiles from an Eagle over **B** as those are \"B\u00f6ller\".

The perpetrator claims they didn't need to register the weapon because it's a collectible. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal status of this situation?\n\nA) The perpetrator is correct; antique firearms are completely exempt from registration requirements in New York.\nB) The perpetrator is partially correct; unloaded antique firearms don't require registration, but using one in a crime negates this exemption.\nC) The perpetrator is incorrect; all firearms, including antiques, require registration in New York regardless of their status.\nD) The perpetrator's claim is irrelevant; the legality depends on whether the antique firearm was loaded at the time of acquisition, not its use in a crime.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The key to understanding this situation lies in New York's specific definition of an antique firearm. According to the documentation, an antique firearm is defined as \"Any unloaded muzzle loading pistol or revolver with a matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system, or a pistol or revolver which uses fixed cartridges which are no longer available in the ordinary channels of commercial trade.\"\n\nThe crucial point is that a firearm is only considered an antique if it is unloaded. The moment it is loaded, it ceases to be classified as an antique and becomes subject to normal firearms regulations. This means that the perpetrator's claim about not needing to register the weapon because it's a collectible is not the determining factor. Instead, the legal status depends on whether the firearm was loaded when it was acquired.\n\nIf the firearm was acquired in an unloaded state, it would have been considered an antique and exempt from registration. However, the act of loading it would have changed its legal status, requiring registration and adherence to standard firearm regulations. This is why the statement \"pretty smart to kill someone with one\" might be considered accurate from a forensic standpoint - antique firearms, especially non-rifled ones, may not leave easily identifiable marks on bullets, making forensic analysis more challenging.\n\nThis question requires integrating multiple concepts from the documentation, including the specific legal definition of antique firearms in New York, the implications of loading such a firearm, and the potential forensic advantages of using an antique weapon.

The correct answer is C because, according to the documentation, an assault occurs when a person intentionally or recklessly causes another to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. In this scenario, even though the influencer may not intend harm, their actions of suddenly approaching strangers and knocking off their hats could reasonably cause fear or apprehension of immediate unlawful contact.\n\nOption A is incorrect because grand larceny typically involves theft of high-value items with intent to permanently deprive, which doesn't fit this scenario.

Which of the following legal scenarios is most likely to unfold?\n\nA) The car owner will be solely liable for all damages due to vicarious liability laws.\nB) The friend will be personally liable, but the car owner may face a negligence claim for inadequate verification.\nC) The injured party can only seek compensation from the friend, with no recourse against the car owner.\nD) The car owner's insurance will automatically cover the damages, regardless of the contract terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves a complex interplay of contract law, negligence, and insurance requirements. The friend is primarily liable for driving without insurance, violating both the contract and New York state law. However, the car owner may face potential liability under a negligence theory.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while vicarious liability can apply to vehicle owners, the signed contract and specific instruction to obtain insurance may provide some protection for the owner.\n\nOption B is correct because it acknowledges the friend's primary liability while also recognizing the potential for a negligence claim against the owner. The owner's failure to verify insurance compliance could be seen as a failure to exercise reasonable care in entrusting the vehicle.\n\nOption C is overly simplistic and doesn't account for potential claims against the owner based on negligent entrustment theories.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the owner's insurance would typically not cover a driver explicitly excluded from the policy, especially when there's a contract specifying separate insurance requirements.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts, application to a real-world scenario, and consideration of potential arguments from different parties involved in the incident.

Does this entitle me to additional compensation, such as overtime?\n\nYes. [Section 1194](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=1194.) of the California Labor Code provides that:\n\n> Notwithstanding any agreement to work for a lesser wage, any employee\n>  receiving less than the legal minimum wage or the legal overtime\n>  compensation applicable to the employee is entitled to recover in a\n>  civil action the unpaid balance of the full amount of this minimum\n>  wage or overtime compensation, including interest thereon, reasonable\n>  attorney\u2019s fees, and costs of suit.\n\nThe contractual maximum of 20 weekly hours is stricken/superseded every time (1\\) your employer schedules you in excess of 20 hours in a week and (2\\) you accept it. Thus, you could pursue the recovery of unpaid wages under two legal theories. One of them is the aforementioned statute, since your *implied* contract \\-\\-pertaining to the excess of 20 weekly hours\\-\\- constitutes an *agreement to work for a lesser wage than the legal minimum wage*.\n\nThe other theory or claim under which you may proceed is *breach of contract*. Again, this refers to the *implied* agreements regarding any unpaid wages in excess of 20 weekly hours. Under this theory you would recover just the full wages (rather than only the minimum wage), whereas the statutory provision entitles you to *reasonable attorney's fees*.\n\nYou might want to get some acquaintance with the [California Labor Code](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?tocCode=LAB&division=2.&title=&part=&chapter=&article=), since it describes how to proceed and might also touch on other issues which might be applicable to your situation (and not mentioned in your post).\n\nIf your matter is filed in court, there is always a chance that your case might be presided by some [sick judge](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/2018/11/judge-carol-kuhnkes-imbecile.html) telling you [in court](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ck7HHqFkIaE/Wsoe0CGdR0I/AAAAAAAAARg/e0PQf_Llz44zb7yky476nU9rV7IVHYO9QCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/employers.jpg) that \"*The state loves insurance companies and it employers \\[...] and you have to \\[...] stay out of the way*\".

While all options have some merit, option B is the most effective strategy given the specific scenario.\n\nA) While a breach of contract claim is possible, it's less effective because the employee has been accepting the additional hours, creating an implied agreement that supersedes the original contract.\n\nB) This is the correct answer. California Labor Code Section 510 specifies that work in excess of 40 hours in a workweek entitles an employee to overtime pay. Since the employee is consistently working 30-35 hours, there's a high likelihood that they occasionally exceed 40 hours, entitling them to overtime compensation.\n\nC) While Section 1194 allows recovery of unpaid wages, it's less applicable here because the employer is paying for all hours worked, just not at an overtime rate when required.\n\nD) Negotiating a new contract doesn't address the past underpayment and doesn't leverage the legal protections available to the employee.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple legal concepts, understanding of labor laws, and application to a real-world scenario.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Under Section 1012 of the Companies Act 2006, when a company is dissolved, any remaining assets become bona vacantia, meaning they belong to the Crown.\n\n2.

While \"wasting police time\" might seem applicable, it's not explicitly mentioned as a charge in common law jurisdictions for this type of scenario, and would be difficult to prove if the magician didn't directly involve the police.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, while pretending to commit a crime is not always illegal, there are circumstances (as illustrated by the correct answer) where such actions could constitute a different offense.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and critically analyze potential outcomes based on the nuances of common law."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59796/are-websites-mandated-to-retain-i-p-addresses-fr-five-years-or-not-under-this-r", "docs_id": 59796, "title": "Are websites mandated to retain I.P. addresses fr five years or not under this regulation or id is a mis interpretation?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If one searches about [\"Indonesia data retention law 5 years\"](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=Indonesia+data+retention+law+5+years) one will find that there seems t be a regulation in Indonesia that states that one must retain ll collected data fr five years and it applies to personal data contollers.Now I.P. logs are generally considered personal data .Does this mean at must I.P. logs must be retain ed fr 5 years?On top of that generally I find websites delete I.P. addresses after few months and emails of inactive user after few years.

Prior to obtaining the consent of a personal data owner for the collection and utilization of their data, a data controller must inform the personal data owner of its retention period for the personal data. A data controller also is required to cease all processing of personal data once the retention period has lapsed.\n> \n> \n> Despite the above provisions, the PDP Draft Law is silent on how long a retention period should be. Lawmakers in the House have expressed concern that there will be no legal certainty if the duration of the retention period is not stipulated in the PDP Draft Law, resulting in a hodgepodge of retention period policies among companies. With input from lawmakers, the government may decide to stipulate a specific data retention period in the new law, although as far as we are aware the House has not suggested how long the retention period should be.\n\nThe term PDP Draft Law brought me further to [lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ad6c624f-975c-4ad0-ae87-78be636fb823), further detailing the proposed law.

The correct answer, B, aligns with the current Indonesian regulations as explained in the documentation:\n\n1.

It seems to be not unlike the GDPR or CCPA, althoguh different in detail. It requires consent for the collection and retention of personal information, requires that collection not be excessive, and requires that individuals be able to see what information a company holds about that person, and in many cases have it deleted.\n\nSpecifically, Rule 5 (1\\) provides that:\n\n> Body corporate or any person on its behalf shall obtain consent in writing through letter or Fax or email from the provider of the sensitive personal data or information regarding purpose of usage before collection of such information.\n\n(A \"body corporate\" appears to be simply a company or business firm.)\n\n\"sensitive personal data\" is defined in rule 3 to be any of a list of nine kinds of information, of which the first is a password.\n\nRule 5 (7\\) provides that:\n\n> Body corporate or any person on its behalf shall, prior to the collection of information including sensitive personal data or information, provide an option to the provider of the information to not to provide the data or information sought to be collected. The provider of information shall, at any time while availing the services or otherwise, also have an option to withdraw its consent given earlier to the body corporate. Such withdrawal of the consent shall be sent in writing to the body corporate.\n\nIt is not clear to me whether \"letter or Fax or email from the provider\" \\[from the information provider (aka the Data Subject)] could include a message automatically sent when a person using a web site clicks a button clearly indicating consent to collection of such information. It certainly does not require a letter mailed in the post. The provisions of sub\\-rule (7\\) clearly contemplate collection of information online as long as there is active consent and an option to withdraw consent.\n\nI find it hard to imagine that a separate, manual, communication mu8st be sent in advance under rule 5 (1\\), and that does not seem to be how this rule has been enforced over the past 10 years.

While copyright is reserved by default, copyright law contains many exceptions, and a disclaimer in a book's imprint cannot override them. What exceptions are available depends on national laws. The *fair use* exception is famous, but specific to U.S. law. German law instead provides a number of exceptions for specific situations. For example:\n\n* \u00a7 51 UrhG: publication of citations is legal, if the amount of cited material is justified by the specific context. In particular, including citations is justified in academic works that discuss the cited work.\n* \u00a7 53 Abs 1 UrhG: private copies are allowed, as long as the original was acquired in a manner that was not obviously illegal, and as long as the copy is not used directly or indirectly for commercial purposes. See the German Wikipedia Article [*Privatkopie*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie) for context. Limitation: entire books may only be duplicated by manual transcription.\n* \u00a7 53 Abs 2 UrhG: analogue (non\\-digital) copies for personal purposes are allowed in some additional circumstances.\n* And some specific exceptions for schools, teaching, research, and data mining.\n\nWhat does this mean for taking notes?\n\n* Notes that capture your own thoughts, or a summary of the copyrighted material in your own words, are not derivatives in the sense of copyright. (However, German copyright law doesn't have a 1:1 equivalent to the term \u201cderivative\u201d. Instead, \u201cadaptation\u201d might be a better fit for the German *Bearbeitung*.)\n* If these notes are purely personal, you can likely copy parts of the book into your notes. For example, this might cover a diary in which you write down poems that you like.\n* Quotes/citations can be allowed when necessary to discuss the book in your notes.

The correct answer, C, aligns with \u00a7 51 UrhG of German copyright law, which allows for the publication of citations if the amount is justified by the specific context, particularly in academic works discussing the cited material.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while purchasing legitimate copies is important, it doesn't grant the right to reproduce full chapters, which would likely exceed the scope of justified citation.\n\nOption B is a distractor based on the provision that entire books may only be duplicated by manual transcription for private copies (\u00a7 53 Abs 1 UrhG). However, this exception is for private use, not for publication in a new work.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while private digital copies might be allowed under certain circumstances, creating a comprehensive digital archive of entire works likely exceeds the scope of permissible private copying, especially if it involves circumventing any digital protections.\n\nThe correct approach (C) demonstrates an understanding of the citation exception, the need for justification in the context of analysis, and the importance of proper attribution.

There is no constitutional or statutory definition of \"Officer of the United States\", so we have to figure it out from case law. As noted in [Morrison v. Olson](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/487/654/case.html) 487 U.S. 654\n\n> The line between \"inferior\" and \"principal\" officers is one that is\n>  far from clear, and the Framers provided little guidance into where it\n>  should be drawn.\n\nOfficers of the US cannot be appointed by Congress ([Buckley v. Valeo](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html) 424 U.S. 1 (1976\\), so that narrows down the possibilities \u2013 if in fact an appointment can be made by Congress, that is not an inferior office (since Congress has no such authority). That court also said that\n\n> We think that the term \"Officers of the United States,\" as used in\n>  Art. II, defined to include \"all persons who can be said to hold an\n>  office under the government\" in United States v. Germaine, supra, is a\n>  term intended to have substantive meaning. We think its fair import is\n>  that *any appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the\n>  laws of the United States is an \"Officer of the United States,*\" and\n>  must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \u00a7 2, cl. 2,\n>  of that Article.\n\nTo take a specific example, \"special trial judges\", authorized in [26 USC 7443a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7443A) are an example of an officer. We know they are officers, because [Freytag v. Commissioner](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/868/case.html) 501 U.S. 868 says so (since they read Buckley):\n\n> A special trial judge is an \"inferior Office\\[r]\" whose appointment\n>  must conform to the Appointments Clause. Such a judge acts as an\n>  inferior officer who exercises independent authority in cases governed\n>  by subsections (b)(1\\), (2\\), and (3\\). The fact that in subsection\n>  (b)(4\\) cases he performs duties that may be performed by an employee\n>  not subject to the Appointments Clause does not transform his status.\n\nThe Dept. of Justice offers [an analysis](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2015/05/29/op-olc-v031-p0083.pdf) of \"Officer of the United States\". The main elements in their opinion are that the position must possess delegated sovereign authority of the Federal government, and the position must be continuing. There are other criteria possibly applicable (things that were invokes at some time) including method of appointment, having been established by law, taking an oath of office, an emolument (not a volunteer), and receiving a commission. Still, Congress authorizes (by law) the hiring of federal employees, and not all employees are \"officers\".\n\nAn earlier memorandum on the topic is [here](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/1996/05/31/op-olc-v020-p0124_0.pdf). Footnote 54 notes that \n\n> It is at least arguable, however, that the authority \n>  exercised by second lieutenants and ensigns is so limited and\n>  subordinate that their analogues in the civil sphere clearly \n>  would be employees.\n\nWarrant officers and non\\-commisioned officers would likewise have quite limited authority.\n\nSince the definition of \"Officer of the United States\" is up for grabs, there can't be a complete list of inferior officers, especially if all military officers are included. There is a long list of civilian officers under the executive branch published in [United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Government_Policy_and_Supporting_Positions), after each presidential election. The so\\-called Plum Book is [on a government web page here](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012/pdf/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012.pdf) in the 2012 version, and [here](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2016/pdf/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2016.pdf) for 2016\\.

Basically, you are allowed to change into the correct lane as long as the pavement markings permit it. The pavement markings at an intersection with a sign like the one you posted are generally solid white lines. These details are governed by the [Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ser-pubs.htm), published by the Federal Highway Administration. Their information on pavement markings is available both in PDF and [HTML format](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/services/publications/fhwaop02090/index.htm). Pertinently, it says:\n\n> A double white line indicates that lane changes are prohibited. A single white line indicates that lane changes are discouraged. A dashed white line indicates that lane changes are allowed.\n\nTherefore, if the lines separating the lanes are, as usual, solid white lines, you are encouraged to get into the correct lane before the beginning of the solid white line, but you are permitted to change lanes across the solid lines. An example of such marking is in the right\\-hand example in the given image:\n\n[![Intersection marking examples from the US Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KZRT.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KZRT.gif)\n\nOne point of possible contention is that the [New York State Driver's Manual](http://dmv.ny.gov/about-dmv/chapter-4-traffic-control-2#pav-mar) describes the meaning of the solid white line somewhat differently:\n\n> **One solid line:** You can pass other vehicles or change lanes, but you can only do so when obstructions in the road or traffic conditions make it necessary.\n\nI don't see any statutory basis for that description, but I may well have overlooked something.\n\nI suppose you know where the signs are specified, since you probably got the image from there, but for anyone reading this who does not know, they are specified in the publication [Standard Highway Signs](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ser-shs_millennium_eng.htm). This is available as a set of PDF files; the relevant file is the one containing [regulatory signs](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/SHSe/Regulatory.pdf); the sign in the question is 1\\-33, and it is in the midst of several similar signs.\n\nIf a police officer ticketed you for getting into the lane too late, I suppose you should find a lawyer who specializes in fighting traffic tickets, and ask whether there really is such a thing as \"too late.\" By my reading of the law, there isn't. (Of course, if it's dangerous to change lanes because of other vehicles, you shouldn't change lanes, but if you had, I would suppose the officer should have written a ticket for some other violation, like reckless driving.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A driver in New York City is approaching a busy intersection with lanes marked for specific directions.

Which of the following actions is most appropriate and legally defensible?\n\nA) Remain in the \"straight only\" lane and proceed straight through the intersection, then make a right turn at the next available opportunity.\nB) Signal and change lanes immediately, crossing the solid white line to enter the \"right turn only\" lane.\nC) Stop at the intersection, then make a right turn from the \"straight only\" lane when safe to do so.\nD) Change lanes before the solid white line begins, then proceed in the \"right turn only\" lane.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the provided documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is B, which may seem counterintuitive but is supported by the legal framework described.\n\nAccording to the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a71128(d), drivers are prohibited from crossing markings only when official markings indicate that doing so would be \"especially hazardous.\" The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) states that a single solid white line indicates that lane changes are discouraged, but not prohibited.\n\nWhile the New York State Driver's Manual suggests more restrictive interpretation of solid white lines, the statutory basis for this interpretation is not clear. The law itself does not explicitly prohibit crossing a solid white line.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it fails to accomplish the driver's goal of making a right turn at this intersection. Option C is likely illegal as it would interfere with the flow of traffic and potentially be dangerous. Option D, while seemingly the most cautious approach, is not necessarily required by law and may not always be possible in busy urban traffic conditions.\n\nThis question challenges the test-taker to integrate knowledge of traffic laws, official road markings, and practical driving scenarios. It also requires critical thinking about the hierarchy of traffic guidance (statutory law vs. driver's manual recommendations) and the real-world application of these rules in a complex urban environment."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79803/is-blocking-users-to-take-phone-backups-on-external-harddrive-by-apple-not-unlaw", "docs_id": 79803, "title": "Is blocking users to take phone backups on external harddrive by Apple not unlawful?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Over the past few weeks I am having some hard time restoring my backups from external harddrive after my iphone got bricked.\n\nI am using a new iPhone 12 Pro with 512gb space and I keep backing up my phone on external harddrive (since these phone comes with huge space \\- I have not enough space on my MacBook Pro to hold that much data).

The correct answer, C, best captures the nuanced reality of the situation. \n\nThe developer's use of an external hard drive for backups, while seemingly logical, falls outside Apple's officially supported backup methods (iCloud or direct to Mac/PC). This non-standard approach significantly limits the developer's legal recourse against Apple. The company explicitly supports and guarantees only certain backup methods, and users who choose alternatives do so at their own risk.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, despite the significant personal loss, Apple's liability is likely limited due to their clear communication about supported backup methods. Option B misplaces potential liability on the hard drive manufacturer, who isn't responsible for Apple's restore capabilities. Option D overstates the legal implications; while frustrating for the user, this situation doesn't clearly violate consumer protection laws given the availability of supported backup options.\n\nThis scenario highlights the critical importance of understanding and following manufacturer-recommended data management practices, especially for devices containing valuable personal and financial information.

What is the nature of obligation at international law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Austin's view: the command theory of law\u2014rules of a superior sovereign backed by force\n\nThe idea that law exists only if the rules are those of a superior sovereign and backed by force is an outdated conception whose most prominant proponent was [John Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Austin_(legal_philosopher)). This is known as the \"command\" theory of law. This clearly cannot explain obligation at international law. But nor can it explain many of the rules in domestic legal systems that we have no problem conceiving of as law (e.g. the law\\-making process itself, the system of adjudication, rules that confer power, etc.).\n\n### Modern views: internal sense of obligation\n\nThe command theory of law has largely been supplanted by other theories of obligation such as that of [H.L.A. Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._A._Hart). In this view, law does not require rules to be backed by threats of force, or to be imposed by a superior sovereign. Law can exist and sustain itself purely through a group's internal point of view: do the participants (states, in the case of international law) \"*use* the rules as standards for the appraisal of their own and others' behaviour\" and do they see them as imposing obligations?\n\nThis focus on the internal viewpoint is actually part of the test for recognizing a norm as customary international law. For something to be customary international law, it must be accomanied by *opinio juris*. This is a \"'psychological' element'\" (John H. Currie, *Public International Law*, p. 195\\). States need to behave as if a rule has legal obligation. International judicial bodies will look to evidence about how states explain their motives, including how they explain deviations from the rule.\n\nH.L.A. Hart explicitly noted the common question, \"How can international law be binding?\" (*The Concept of Law*, \"Chapter X: International Law\"). His answer:\n\n> there is something very confusing in this favourite form of question; and before we can deal with it we must face a prior question to which the answer is by no means clear. This prior question is: what is meant by saying of a whole system of law that it is 'binding'? The statement that a particular rule of a system is binding on a particular person is one familiar to lawyers and tolerably clear in meaning. We may paraphrase it by the assertion that the rule in question is a valid rule, and under it the person in question *has some obligation or duty*.\n\nHe recognizes that \"one source of doubt on this point is simply the absense from the system of centrally organized sanctions.\" But for all the reasons that this is not the criteria of what makes law law or creates the internal view of obligation, even in domestic systems, this fact does not undercut international law's status as law.\n\nHe describes nation states' expressed attitude towards the rules of international law:\n\n> Yet what these rules require is thought and spoken of as obligatory; there is general pressure for conformity to the rules; claims and admissions are based on them and their breach is held to justify not only insistent demands for compensation, but reprisals and counter\\-measures. When the rules are disregarded, *it is not on the footing that they are not binding; instead efforts are made to conceal the facts*.\n\n### In what sense is international law binding?\n\nWhen one makes the assertion that a rule is *binding* at international law, they are simply describing or predicting that the participants view the rule as generating obligation and duty, likely due to the rule's basis in treaty or customary international law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about international law, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A small island nation has consistently objected to a widely accepted customary international law regarding maritime boundaries.

The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced nature of international law obligations as described by H.L.A. Hart's theory. \n\nThe persistent objector doctrine allows a state to be exempt from a specific customary international law if it has consistently and openly dissented from the rule since its formation. This aligns with Hart's focus on the internal viewpoint and opinio juris in determining legal obligation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies enforcement in international law and misrepresents the UN Security Council's role. Option B reflects the outdated Austinian \"command theory\" of law, which the documentation explicitly rejects for international law. Option D is a common misconception about how customary international law forms and changes.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring candidates to apply theoretical concepts to a real-world scenario, considering the nature of obligation in international law, the formation of customary norms, and the balance between individual state sovereignty and global legal norms."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15328/do-government-incentives-for-males-to-change-gender-violate-human-rights-laws", "docs_id": 15328, "title": "Do government incentives for males to change gender violate human rights laws?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Please note the following:\n\n* I'm not seeking legal advice (already checked with a lawyer), rather I'd love to hear others thoughts/conclusions\n* For the sake of simplification I am using approximate USD at present exchange rates\n* While I am describing this from my perspective (since I'm affected by it) about 40,000 people are affected every year\n* I tried to obfuscate my country as I want to hear how it is handled/seen in your country\n\nThe human rights state:\n\n> All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\n\nMy understanding is that this statement is independent of gender.\n\nI also would like to quote our federal constitution:\n\n> Art. 8 Equality before the law\n> \n> \n> 1 Every person is equal before the law.\n> \n> \n> 2 No person may be discriminated against, in particular on grounds of origin, race, gender, age, language, social position, way of life, religious, ideological, or political convictions, or because of a physical, mental or psychological disability.\n> \n> \n> 3 Men and women have equal rights.

While this is still somehow acceptable (you also would want the ones who are best for the task, not just everyone) the tax for those who are not allowed (!) to do the service in my eyes is not.\n\nLike in my situation, it was that I went to military, but during service I got rejected because of my health. I am not even allowed to do civil service.\n\nLaw now requires me to pay 3% of my income, but at least 400USD every year \u2013 no matter if I live in this country or not.

Does this empathize that ALL woman are at least disabled by 40%?\n\n> male \\+ 40% disabled \\= female (who are all disabled).\n\nI know this sounds salty but somehow I cannot get rid of this equation.\n\nAnyway, we have a law for transsexuals that states that you don\u2019t need to pay anymore if you switched gender and:\n\n> A psychiatrist and a\n> endocrinologist\n> confirmed that you're not a male anymore and don't have a male body.\n\nIf you need to switch gender it is considered an illness (living the wrong body) and healthcare pays for your therapy and operations.\n\nThis makes becoming female free, staying male costs.

The correct answer is A because obtaining a license from a PRO is the most secure way to legally perform the copyrighted work.

This aligns with the legal precedent established in cases like ViChip Corp. v. Lee, where courts have recognized that willful destruction of data can be grounds for a civil lawsuit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because copyright infringement typically involves unauthorized copying or distribution of copyrighted material, not its destruction. Option B, while potentially applicable, is more focused on criminal prosecution rather than civil remedies for damages. Option D is less likely to succeed because breach of contract usually requires a specific contractual obligation, and company policies may not always constitute a binding contract in this context.\n\nThe case of ViChip Corp. v. Lee specifically dealt with the deletion of data and recognized it as a form of conversion. Additionally, the International Airport Centers, L.L.C. v.

Presumably you mean to ask if they can extradite someone even without a treaty, and the answer is: depends on their laws, but otherwise of course they can if they feel like it (which may require giving them something in return).\n\nAn extradition treaty just creates a formalized process for handling extradition requests, which may include the types of crimes that may be considered, who can be considered or exempted, and the specific procedures a country may go through to decide on whether or not to grant the extradition. \n\nThe existence of a treaty does not guarantee the request will be granted. US requests to extradite [Roman Polanski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case) from Poland, France, and Switzerland have all failed, despite the fact that the [US has extradition treaties with all of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition_law_in_the_United_States#International_extradition).

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The absence of an extradition treaty does not prevent Country B from arresting the accused. As stated in the documentation, \"Sure they can arrest them.\"\n\n2. The lack of a treaty doesn't mean Country B must automatically comply with Country A's request.

They may, however, have an institutional obligation to act in a particular way, which might include always email questions, or never emailing questions (the latter is most likely). Assuming someone filed an institutional grievance against you, you have some right to answer these charges \u2013 it will be spelled out in the institution's rules. The federal regulations are between the institution and the government, and the institution then creates rules to keep themselves in compliance.\n\nThe usual worst\\-case scenario is that someone files a grievance, which is reviewed by the institution. As the accused, you will be informed of the charges against you, and will have the opportunity to defend yourself at least by the \"committee decision\" phase. Prior to that point, the institution can gather any data deemed relevant, and may well require that all questioning be conducted in a face\\-to\\-face meeting. Universities generally have minimal specification of procedural requirements, until they run into a problem and impose rules. To determine a person's authority to require something of you, you can ask them to tell you the university rules that give them that authority. Your attorney can then compare their demand with their authority and advise you whether you must comply, or perhaps strategically should comply, or should refuse.\n\nThe federal regulation which drives this is [34 CFR 105 subpart A](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d94e05d2e1f31c95c2387b077955a23&mc=true&node=sp34.1.106.a&rgn=div6). The logic of this is that the institution cannot discriminate on the basis of sex, if they do, they can be punished, but they can also \"erase\" the discrimination if they \"overcome the effects\" of the discrimination. [\u00a7106\\.8](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d94e05d2e1f31c95c2387b077955a23&mc=true&node=sp34.1.106.a&rgn=div6#se34.1.106_18) requires the institution to have a coordinator who assures compliance and does what is necessary including investigating. There must also be a grievance procedure:\n\n> (b) A recipient shall adopt and publish grievance procedures providing\n>  for prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee complaints\n>  alleging any action which would be prohibited by this part.\n\nThere is absolutely no further federal specification as to what this coordinator can do, instead the government leaves it up the the institution to come up with procedures.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The documentation states that there is no federal obligation for the Title IX coordinator to email questions. Their authority stems from institutional policies.\n\n2. The student has the right to know the charges against them and defend themselves, but the specific procedures are determined by the institution's rules, not federal regulations.\n\n3.

Is the rule simply that any such charts must be introduced into evidence before the trial, or can explanatory charts be used in final arguments without having submitted them beforehand?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The kind of chart you are talking about is called a \"demonstrative exhibit\". The rule governing the use of demonstrative exhibits in states that follow the numbering scheme of the federal rules of evidence (which most states do) is Rule 1006 (Summaries) which states:\n\n> The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs which\n>  cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form\n>  of a chart, summary, or calculation. The originals or duplicates,\n>  shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other\n>  parties at reasonable time and place. The court may order that they be\n>  produced in court.\n\nBasically, this means that demonstrative exhibits are fine as long as they are supported by the evidence offered at trial, or are admitted in circumstances when the opposing party has an opportunity to review at trial their factual basis. A demonstrative exhibit for use in closing doesn't necessarily have to be introduced into evidence at trial, although it often would be used first in opening, then during trial and again in closing, as a matter of good trial litigation practice.\n\nA complication is that many state court rules (and federal courts) require that demonstrative exhibits be disclosed a certain number of days before trial as part of a trial management order designed to prevent undue surprise. This provisions are sometimes contained in Rules 16 or 26 of rules numbered similarly to the federal rules of civil procedure, and are sometimes set forth in a court specific case management order or trial management order tailored to a particular case or a particular judge's preferences. This would vary considerably from court to court, sometimes even within the same state. These disclosure requirements are less common in courts with limited civil jurisdiction, but are sometimes found even in those courts.\n\nAlso, while advanced arrangements would ordinarily not need to be made with respect to a chart in terms of court facilities, one would want to make sure that an easel was available to put the chart on as one was talking about it. \n\nSome discussion of the use of visual aids in a closing argument can be found [here](http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/judges/Inns%20Presentation--Closing%20Arguments.pdf), although that source is light on the technical steps that must be taken to use them.\n\nIf a more sophisticated arrangement (e.g. a power point presentation or a video) is desired, this can generally be permitted as well, but advanced consultation with the court and opposing counsel to arrange the logistics of getting the projector and screen set up, etc. must usually be made usually via the court's division clerk (i.e. the court clerk assigned to the particular courtroom or judge).\n\nThe main objection to a demonstrative exhibit is that it is not supported by facts offered at trial (if it was not itself admitted as an exhibit at trial with an offer to disclose the underlying facts), either because the facts were not introduced into evidence, or because it inaccurately states the facts offered at trial. Also, certain kinds of statements (e.g. an attorney stating that a particular witness was lying, rather than listing facts that show that the witness was lying, or referring to evidence that was kept out of the record at trial) are prohibited completely in an closing statement in any format.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about demonstrative exhibits in legal proceedings, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A defense attorney in a complex financial fraud case wants to use a detailed flowchart during closing arguments to illustrate the convoluted money trail.

The most appropriate action is C) Consult with the judge and opposing counsel well before closing arguments to arrange for the flowchart's use.\n\nWhile the flowchart is based on evidence presented during the trial (which aligns with Rule 1006's requirement that demonstrative exhibits be supported by evidence offered at trial), many courts have specific rules about disclosing demonstrative exhibits before trial or their use in closing arguments. The documentation mentions that \"many state court rules (and federal courts) require that demonstrative exhibits be disclosed a certain number of days before trial as part of a trial management order designed to prevent undue surprise.\"\n\nFurthermore, the documentation states that for more sophisticated presentations, \"advanced consultation with the court and opposing counsel to arrange the logistics... must usually be made usually via the court's division clerk.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it disregards potential court rules about disclosure and could lead to objections. Option B is likely too late, as many courts require disclosure well before trial. Option D is overly cautious, as demonstrative exhibits are generally permissible if proper procedures are followed.\n\nBy choosing C, the attorney ensures compliance with potential disclosure requirements, allows the opposing counsel to review the exhibit, and arranges any necessary logistics (like having an easel available).

I want use a friend who has no legal training as my \"counsel,\" do the police have any legal recourse from allowing me to talk to him prior to interrogation? E.g., can they insist that my counsel be a member of the bar in the state where I have been arrested?**\n\nYes. If they don't want you to, you cannot talk to a friend, only a lawyer. If you got an OUI, and you're not being a jerk, they will probably let you talk to whomever you want (within reason \u2013 it's not social hour). However, *they can* keep you from speaking to anyone but a lawyer as that person could gain information from you that can corrupt their investigation. (E.g., they arrest you with 10 lbs. of methamphetamine. They know it's \"fresh\" and likely came from a local lab that they suspect you of running. You cannot be allowed to talk to just anyone, as they could help get the lab broke down, moved, destroyed). In TV shows you see attorneys doing this type of illicit thing, but in reality that is very rare. When you enter the police station to speak with a client, you must present your bar card (license to practice). Friends are not allowed in, even if you value their counsel \u2013 they are not counselors!\n\n**2\\. I want to consult a \"team\" of qualified counselors. Are there legal grounds or regulations to limit the number of individuals I consult prior to interrogation, and who I have present during interrogation?** \n\nNo. You can have your entire legal team with you, while preparing for court, or while being questioned, within reason. They do not need to rent a conference room to fit your 30 person legal team, but if you want 3 or so lawyers in with you, and you can afford paying each $250\\-$500 per hour, then have at it. Most lawyers would counsel you against this, as it creates an undue impression of limitless (hence likely illegal) funds. (But if you're a hedge fund manager, and you can show your money is legally earned, it's really your choice.) I have had occasion to go in to meet a client with co\\-counsel numerous times (especially in early years of practice when there is a lead attorney and second chair, so to speak, even for interrogation (which means silence by the client).\n\nThey can \"impede\" access to some extent, though they typically don't. They can play games with your lawyer and make them wait and make you wait, but not while they are in with you, and only for so long. Once your lawyer arrives they should leave you alone. (Some courts say once you ask for counsel they need to leave you alone, but this only really matters if they get a confession from you (or any evidence) before you've (and this is what they're hoping for) recant your request for counsel and your right to remain silent.)\n\n**3\\. Can my contact with counsel be proscribed in any way? E.g., can the police limit the duration or schedule of contact with counsel? Can they impede or delay access to me by someone who claims to be my counsel?**\n\nOnce you've called your lawyer, they need to to let him or her meet with you for a reasonable amount of time before questioning. This is typically a quick meeting, just long enough to make sure you will not say a word. *Even completely innocent people should keep their mouth shut \u2013 innocent people do occasionally get arrested and convicted!* \n\nNo matter what the police say, there is *no* benefit, ever, from talking to them. Some police, who know it's their last shot to get a confession and know once your lawyer gets there will never talk to you again (and they have enough to go forward without your confession in the event you just start blabbing \"you did it\" before they can get you to invoke your rights) will keep talking to you and tell you not to comment, just to listen, even while your lawyer sits outside. They can say you're being processed, or there's a security issue, any number of reasons for short delays if they need it. They will then go on and on about \"how they can maybe *help you out* if you talk now, but once your lawyer arrives all bets are off.\" These are just tricks to get you to recant/revoke your rights and to obtain your confession. You will usually see your lawyer shortly after arrival.\n\n**Can they impede or delay access to me by someone who claims to be my counsel?** Yes, if your lawyer doesn't have adequate ID or cannot verify he is licensed in that state, or in another state and with local counsel. The police do not have a duty to research your lawyer's credentials, and don't have to go online and look your attorney up in the bar directory to make it easier for him or her to get to you. However, if they know the attorney, and he or she forgot his bar card, they would probably lose the confession if you confessed while they make him go get it. Most lawyers carry their bar card in their wallet, so this is not a typical problem.\n\n**4\\. What do police have to do to facilitate my access to my desired counselor(s)? E.g., how long can I be held after requesting an attorney without being allowed to attempt to contact one?**\n\nYou have a right to contact a lawyer. There is no explicit right to a phone call, although some form of contact is implied. Hence, you can usually be held 3 hours before they have to let you \"contact\" someone, and this is after processing. You can be held until your lawyer gets there or until your arraignment, whatever comes first. If your lawyer doesn't show up, you will be given another opportunity by the court to get your lawyer of choice there for arraignment. If you can't, and you don't want to go forward, a public defender will move to waive your right to a speedy trial and seek a continuance until you can get your counsel of choice there. If this happens, consider getting a new lawyer.\n\n**What means must I be granted to find and contact the counsel of my choice?**\n\nThis actually differs depending on where you are and what you did. Again, you have a right to counsel but they can determine how you get this done. Sometimes there are local laws that say you get any number, or 3, or 1 completed phone call to reach your counsel of choice. If there is an overriding risk that you will call someone to communicate information that could put the investigation in jeopardy or would be adversely impact their evidentiary value in some way, even when these laws exist the police can refuse you direct contact with anyone and may implement a strict \"they call\" policy, where they will call the lawyer and tell them, or call your family to let them know, and they can call the lawyer. They cannot hold you for a protracted amount of time without giving you some way to get word to a lawyer; it must be reasonable.

The suspect immediately requests to speak with their \"legal team\" consisting of a licensed attorney, a paralegal, and a family friend who is a retired judge. The arresting officers are concerned about potential information leaks that could compromise their ongoing investigation. What is the most legally appropriate course of action for the police in this scenario?\n\nA) Allow the suspect to meet with only the licensed attorney, citing security concerns for limiting access\nB) Permit the entire \"legal team\" to meet with the suspect, as requested, to avoid any potential rights violations\nC) Deny all access to counsel for up to 3 hours, citing the need to process the suspect first\nD) Allow phone contact with the licensed attorney only, but delay in-person meetings for a \"reasonable\" time\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided documentation. The correct answer is A for several reasons:\n\n1. The police are obligated to allow access to legal counsel, but they can limit this to actual licensed attorneys. As stated in the documentation, \"if they don't want you to, you cannot talk to a friend, only a lawyer.\" This applies to both the paralegal and the retired judge, regardless of their legal background.\n\n2. The police have legitimate concerns about potential information leaks that could compromise their investigation. The documentation mentions that they can restrict access to prevent someone from gaining \"information from you that can corrupt their investigation.\"\n\n3. While the suspect has the right to consult with a \"team\" of qualified counselors, the key word here is \"qualified.\" Only the licensed attorney meets this criterion in the eyes of the law for the purposes of initial consultation during arrest and interrogation.\n\n4. Option B is incorrect because it doesn't address the security concerns and allows non-attorneys access. Option C is incorrect because denying all access to counsel for 3 hours when an attorney is readily available would likely be seen as unreasonable.

I've read some questions about the GDPR on here and information from gdpr.eu and other websites, but it's still very unclear to me what is legal and what is not.\n\nI know that a EU regulation can be implemented and interpreted differently from country to country, and that a single court ruling in Germany doesn't even mean that the national law was correctly applied. From what I've read, I get the impression that this particular ruling was not unlikely to be overturned by a higher instance, if it came down to it.

For example, processing of personal data can also be lawful if it necessary to perform a contract, legally mandatory, or in the public interest.\n\nThe court decision acknowledges that but rules out another basis in this case because it considers that it is possible to serve fonts without relying on a third\\-party (*\\[\u2026] der Einsatz der Schriftarten auch m\u00f6glich ist, ohne dass eine Verbindung von Besuchern zu externen Servern hergestellt werden muss*). Confusingly, it only refers to article 6(1\\)(f) when it seems to me that (b) would also be plausible but maybe this wasn't raised during the proceedings?\n\nIf the data controller cannot invoke any other basis for the lawfulness of the processing then yes, the only thing left is asking for consent, i.e. invoking article 6(1\\)(a). But that doesn't mean that you should expect to be asked for consent each and every time your personal information is being used.\n\n> The consent form on the site also implicitly assumes consent, which I thought was also a violation.\n\nYes, implying consent doesn't really make sense under the GDPR definition (article 4, see also article 7\\):\n\n> \u2018consent\u2019 of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action\n\nEuropean data protection authorities have [issued guidelines](https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_202005_consent_en.pdf) that detail what that means and clearly reject \u201cbundling\u201d different data processing. The regulation also makes it clear that data subjects should be able to withdraw consent at any time, which does not seem possible with the fonts on golem.de\n\nMy reading of all this is that assuming consent because you are using a service (or even created an account or checked a box at some point) simply isn't valid consent. Either you don't need consent at all in the first place or what you need is freely given, specific consent and \u201cimplying\u201d consent or bundling it with a registration process achieves exactly nothing. But this is still extremely common and it might take some time before enforcement and case law definitively settle this question.\n\nSmart data controllers trying to avoid collecting consent (like Meta) have abandoned any claim that signing up to the their services would constitute consent (because that's transparently not the case) and try to bypass the issue entirely using another basis like contractual necessity. This is also being litigated.\n\n> I know that a EU regulation can be implemented and interpreted differently from country to country, and that a single court ruling in Germany doesn't even mean that the national law was correctly applied.

(I live in the UK).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm pretty sure that under GDPR, you can indeed request them to send all data they have on you. If it's a complex request, they may charge you something like \u00a310\\. If they have a lot of data on you, they may list the categories of data they have and ask you to pick one, rather than them having to collect and send everything. They should respond within one month, but iirc in the UK implementation, they can inform you (within that month) that they will respond within three months instead.\n\nFor the rest, I only know current Dutch law. GDPR is not that different from what we already had (in general terms) and in many cases it even extends it. Under our law (WBP), you can also request a correction of the data in case it is incorrect, or deletion if they no longer need it for the purpose for which it was collected and stored. I don't really know how that works out in practice though, as Facebook can of course claim that \"being able to connect you to your friends when you sign up for WhatsApp or Facebook with that number\" is a legitimate purpose (in their eyes).\n\nThey might also not have your full name and therefore not be able to connect your data to your request. Or, perhaps, they have *only* your full name (and there are probably more people with your name), so they'll have a hard time verifying that it's really your data which they would be handing over or deleting. The company is required to verify your identity before acting on your request. How they implement that is up to them. Under Dutch law, if I remember correctly, any data that can be connected to your person *by any party* is personally identifiable information (PII). While Facebook might not be able to find who's behind a phone number, your carrier most certainly can. Therefore, the data falls under PII protection laws and they will have to implement a way to verify you and get you your data.\n\nFinally, whether your local laws apply to Facebook, I don't know exactly. There's lots of information on this though, so you should be able to find it. Generally, countries say that if something happened within their territory (e.g. you signed up for WhatsApp while in the UK), their law applies. Companies, I've read, will instead try to claim that their main office is in SomeCountry and therefore SomeCountry's laws apply. But I'm pretty sure you'll be able to find a Facebook office somewhere where GDPR applies, so that's probably fine.\n\nWhile not an exact answer and while I am not sure about everything, I hope this gave you some pointers to go on!", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A privacy-conscious individual who has never used WhatsApp discovers that the app likely has data about them through their contacts' shared information.

If so, how do those rules mesh with federal laws of USA?**\n\n(I'm specifically talking about **formal rules**, NOT social norms where an outsider may simply be made to feel unwelcome enough that they would want to leave on their own).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Reservations aren't of or for a single tribe (meaning roughly \"ethnic group\"), they are for a particular Nation (whether or not that term is used in a specific case \\-\\- it could be \"Confederation\" or \"Band\"). In Washington state, the Yakama Nation is a confederation of people who are Klikitat, Palouse, Walla Walla, Wanapum, Wenatchee, Wishram, and Yakama; the Tulalip Tribes covers the northern Lushootseed tribes made up of the Duwamish, Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Skagit, Suiattle, Samish, and Stillaguamish. Only 2/3 of the recognized tribes have reservations. The key legal concept is not exactly being \"of a certain tribe\", it is \"being enrolled\". Ancestry relates to enrollment (and disenrollment) via individual rules about membership.\n\nFederal Indian law is encoded in [Title 25](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25). Let's just say that a question about what that title says is way to broad to ever answer. Generally speaking, there are two types of reservation land, trust land and fee land. The US government holds trust land in trust, which has various restrictions on transfer, and is exempt from taxation: transfers require higher approval (tribe, BIA). Fee land is land that the individual(s) own outright. In the case of fee land, anyone can purchase that land. The land that would be of interest for this question is trust land. The Yakama reservation, for instance, has open and closed areas, the latter being mostly trust land with use restricted to enrolled members.\n\nOn fee land located within a reservation, that does not mean that one is completely free of tribal rules. After all, off the reservation, you are still subject to the local government's land use rules (zoning restrictions, for example). The ruling of [Brendale v. Confederated Tribes, 492 U.S. 408](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/492/408/case.html) is very complex and says \"yes and no\". Tribes do *not* have authority to zone fee land on the reservation owned by non\\-members, but they do have authority to generally zone fee land on closed areas of the reservation. (Very roughly speaking, fee land is subject to general government\\-planning type restrictions on land use that we are all subject to; but there are limits on how discriminatory those rules can be. Above all, fee land is in fact owned by the individual, and a tribe cannot claw the land back, though they can buy it back).\n\nA Nation can set rules for membership which would be patently illegal in the general context of US law. In [Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/436/49/), the situation was that the rule of the Santa Clara Pueblo nation said that the children of a Pueblo woman who married outside the tribe (e.g. to a Navaho) may be denied tribal membership, but did not exclude children of a Pueblo man who married outside the tribe. The consequence is that the children of a woman lose the right to reside on that land after the mother dies (also can't vote, etc.) The short version is that SCOTUS held that this is legal.

Which of the following best describes the legal situation?\n\nA) The Navajo member has full rights to develop the land as they see fit, regardless of Yakama Nation zoning laws.\nB) The Yakama Nation has complete authority to enforce its zoning laws on the Navajo member's fee land.\nC) The Yakama Nation likely has the authority to enforce general zoning laws, but cannot discriminate based on tribal membership.\nD) The Bureau of Indian Affairs must mediate and make the final decision on land use in this case.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests critical thinking about the complex interplay between tribal sovereignty, land ownership, and federal law. The correct answer is C, based on several key points:\n\n1. The land in question is fee land within a reservation, which means it's owned outright by the individual, not held in trust by the government.\n\n2. The Brendale v. Confederated Tribes case established that tribes do have authority to generally zone fee land in closed areas of the reservation. This means the Yakama Nation can enforce some zoning laws.\n\n3. However, there are limits on how discriminatory these rules can be. The tribe cannot simply \"claw back\" fee land or completely prevent its use by non-members.\n\n4. The Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez case showed that tribes can have membership rules that would be discriminatory under general US law, but this applies more to tribal membership and benefits rather than to land use by non-members who have legally purchased fee land.\n\n5. The question specifically mentions a \"closed area,\" which, according to the documentation, is mostly trust land with use restricted to enrolled members. However, the fact that this is fee land within that area creates a complex legal situation.\n\nThis scenario requires analyzing the application of tribal authority in a nuanced real-world situation, considering the balance between tribal sovereignty and individual property rights, and understanding the limitations on tribal authority over non-members, even within reservation boundaries."}, "79": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25948/am-i-allowed-to-ask-a-company-to-sign-a-contract", "docs_id": 25948, "title": "Am I allowed to ask a company to sign a contract?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am an undergraduate student.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Trademarks owned by virtue of use, without registration, are protected only in the market area where actual use can be documented. The local bakery has established rights in their local market through five years of use.\n\n2. The national chain can use the name in other parts of the country where the local bakery hasn't established a market presence. This is because the prime purpose of a trademark is to prevent unfair competition and consumer confusion, which is not a concern in areas where the first user doesn't operate.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because nationwide protection is a benefit of federal registration, which the local bakery doesn't have.\n\n4. Option C is incorrect because it ignores the local bakery's established rights in their market area.\n\n5. Option D is incorrect because the scale of operations doesn't automatically confer superior rights, especially against an earlier user in a specific market.\n\nThis scenario is similar to the Burger King example mentioned in the documentation, where a small restaurant with a state-level trademark could exclude the large chain from a 20-mile radius.

I have recently submitted a Subject Access Request to my motor insurer, and as part of that they sent some data that the received from the [Motor Insurance Database (MID)](https://www.mib.org.uk/) and [Equifax](https://www.equifax.co.uk/). The Equifax data included policy numbers and dates over the last few years that I would have had access to at one point but to not know now, and the MID included three identifiers per row, two of which I have not seen before, and an encoded string that I am unable to decode but appears to encode data that I may have had access to. I have also used the internet, and as I understand it this involves a lot of passing around information about me between entities.\n\nWhat exactly triggers the requirement for a data controller to inform the subject under Article 14?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Simply put, Art 14 GDPR is often ignored. But also, it triggers less often than some might think.\n\nWhile Art 14 applies whenever the data controller processes personal data that weren't obtained (directly) from the data subject (see Art 14(1\\)), there are a bunch of exceptions to the notification obligation, such as Art 14(5\\)(a): no notification is necessary if the data subject already has the information in the Art 14 privacy notice.\n\nFor example, your motor insurer likely fulfilled its transparency obligations under Art 14 together with its Art 13 transparency obligations by providing a privacy notice when you signed up to your service, and making updated versions available subsequently. While a privacy notice must be \u201cprovided\u201d, it is not required to force you to actually read and comprehend this document. And it is not necessarily required to specifically notify you about Art 14 processing if you were already provided this information in a privacy notice.\n\nHowever, \u201cproviding\u201d the information implies a more active approach than merely making the privacy notice easily available on a website. The [ICO says](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/the-right-to-be-informed/when-should-we-provide-privacy-information/#when3) that data controllers \u201cmust proactively make individuals aware of this information and \\[\u2026] need to give them an easy way to access it\u201d.\n\nThe lack of notification from the MID or from Equifax must be viewed critically, but it could technically be that they are compliant if you were notified about their privacy notices by the data sources.\n\nSo this approach would be clearly compliant:\n\n* You open a bank account.\n* The bank provides its own privacy notice per Art 13 GDPR.\n* The bank sends data to Equifax.\n* Equifax notifies you about their processing per Art 14 GDPR.\n\nBut so would this:\n\n* You open a bank account.\n* The bank provides its own privacy notice per Art 13 GDPR.\n* The bank notifies you about Equifax' processing per Art 14 GDPR.\n* The bank sends data to Equifax, noting that they've already notified you.\n\nThere are of course some exceptions in Art 14(5\\), in particular that notification can be skipped if it would entail \u201cdisproportionate effort\u201d. There was a high\\-profile case about this [in Poland](https://uodo.gov.pl/en/553/1009):\n\n* A data controller had collected data from public registries, affecting an estimated 6 million data subjects. The data included contact information such as addresses, phone numbers, emails.\n* The data controller did notify those people for which they had an email address (about 90\u2009000 people, about 1\\.5%).\n* The data controller did not notify other data subjects, citing high costs for sending letters.\n* The Polish UODO (corresponds to the UK ICO) found that this wasn't disproportionate effort, and that the data controller failed to meet its Art 14 obligations.\n* If I remember correctly, the data controller decided to destroy the collected data instead of sending out notifications.\n\nA roughly similar UK case was the [ICO's 7\\.5M GBP fine against Clearview](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2022/05/ico-fines-facial-recognition-database-company-clearview-ai-inc/), though there the breach of transparency obligations was just one of many problems.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about GDPR Article 14, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A multinational company, DataCorp, acquires personal data about EU citizens from various third-party sources for market research.

The fact that data is public doesn't negate the need for transparent processing.\n\nOption B is the correct answer. Article 14(5)(b) provides an exemption when providing information would involve \"disproportionate effort, in particular for processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.\" The scenario describes processing for statistical purposes (market research) involving millions of data subjects, which could potentially qualify for this exemption. However, DataCorp would still need to take appropriate measures to protect data subjects' rights, such as making information publicly available.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a vague statement in a privacy policy is insufficient to meet GDPR transparency requirements. Article 14 requires specific information to be provided, and controllers must proactively inform data subjects.\n\nOption D is plausible but incorrect. While it's possible for one controller to provide Article 14 information on behalf of another, the scenario doesn't provide enough information to ensure this was done properly.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"you need to notify government about passport change.

The core prohibition is \u00a7539c, which says\n\n> Any person who is present or who is not present during a private\n> conversation and who wilfully uses any device to eavesdrop upon the\n> conversation without the consent of all parties thereto, or who\n> knowingly aids, employs or procures another person to do the same in\n> violation of this section, is guilty of a felony\n\nAn open faculty meeting is by law not a private conversation (however, a closed meeting is).

Otherwise, you have to apply to have your information registered first. The registration may need your civil status documents, i.e. birth certificates and documents related to marriages, divorces, changes in names, (translated, notarized and legalized if needed) and proof of your residency in Switzerland.\n\nYour name and gender, for civil purposes in Switzerland, then become what is recorded in the database.

We walk along the public road to get to the park, hike the trails, and return home via a wash (dry riverbed) that runs behind the park back towards the main road. We, and several other neighborhood residents, have been doing this for years.\n\nRecently we had an encounter with a nearby resident claiming that we were trespassing on private property as were walking through the wash. We checked the property records, and indeed, there are two parcels of private land through which we were crossing to get back on the main road. Both parcels are vacant, unmarked, not fenced, and not owned by any of the nearby residents.\n\nI'm not overly concerned with this person's claims as we aren't entering their property, but yesterday we found two posted signs in the wash at the park boundary stating: *Private property. No public access.* The signs were apparently installed by the county and seem legitimate with county seal and all. My question is, do these signs constitute reasonable notice (as described below) since they were not posted by the private landowners?\n\n[Arizona Revised Statute 13\\-1502](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/01502.htm) states (emphasis mine):\n\n> 13\\-1502\\. Criminal trespass in the third degree; classification\n> \n> \n> A. A person commits criminal trespass in the third degree by:\n> \n> \n> 1. Knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully on any real property after a reasonable request to leave by a law enforcement officer, the owner or any other person having lawful control over such property, or **reasonable notice prohibiting entry**.\n> 2. Knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully on the right\\-of\\-way for tracks, or the storage or switching yards or rolling stock of a railroad company.\n> \n> \n> B. Pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, a request to leave by a law enforcement officer acting at the request of the owner of the property or any other person having lawful control over the property has the same legal effect as a request made by the property owner or other person having lawful control of the property.\n> \n> \n> C. Criminal trespass in the third degree is a class 3 misdemeanor.\n\nThe words on the sign are clear enough, but can the county speak for the owner of the vacant lots who, as far as I'm aware, don't know or care about what's going on? Is there any room to interpret the sign as simply a park boundary leaving the owners of the adjacent property to post their own \"no trespassing\" signs as they feel necessary (or not)?\n\nFollow\\-up question: If the sign does constitute an enforceable, *reasonable notice*, would the private property owner(s) have to get involved for trespassing charges to be filed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The county can certainly post a sign on the edge of the county property, informing people that what lies beyond is private property, and no permission to pass has been granted. Unless this was endorsed by the property owner or the owner's agent, I don't think this would constitute the \"reasonable notice\" mentioned in 13\\-1502 A 1 (quoted above) needed to make entry count as criminal trespass. If the property owner authorizes the county to post notices, that is of course different.\n\nI don't see how the county can be considered a \"person having lawful control over such property\" but the law does not say that \"reasonable notice\" must be given by an owner or owner's agent, indeed it does not say who may or may not give such notice. I wonder if there is caselaw on the point.\n\nSince the law makes a request from a law enforcement officer, who could be acting with no authorization from the owner, one of the possible conditions for criminal trespass, I don't see that the owner would need to participate in a trespass action.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A local hiking group has been using a dry riverbed (wash) to access a county park for years.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Arizona Revised Statute 13-1502 requires \"reasonable notice prohibiting entry\" for criminal trespass, but doesn't specify who must provide this notice.\n2. The county, not being the property owner or having lawful control over the private lots, likely cannot provide legally binding \"reasonable notice\" on behalf of the property owners without their explicit authorization.\n3. The signs serve as information about the park boundary and adjacent private property but don't necessarily meet the legal standard for \"reasonable notice\" in terms of criminal trespass.\n4. The law doesn't explicitly state that only property owners can provide notice, but the context suggests that the notice should come from someone with authority over the property.\n5. Option A is incorrect because the county's authority to post binding notices on private property is questionable.\n6. Option B is too permissive, as the county signs shouldn't be completely ignored and could be seen as a form of notice, even if not legally binding for trespass.\n7.

Probate does not have the equivalent of the \"automatic stay\" in bankruptcy that prevents any creditors, secured or unsecured, from engaging in any collection activity against an estate, and probate estates are not allowed to file for bankruptcy either.\n\nIf you really wanted to play hardball and only needed the apartment for a few days in March, the estate could simply continue to occupy it for that period of time and they pay the landlord the extra month's rent but not the additional security deposit when it was done. The landlord can't begin a foreclosure proceeding until there is a default which can't happen sooner than the last day of February. Even if the landlord is really on his toes, the landlord will be hard pressed to get a notice to vacate served on the estate and then to prepare and serve an eviction lawsuit on the estate and get that case in front of a judge before the estate will be ready to move out anyway. The estate might incur some attorneys' fees in the process if it did that, but the attorneys' fees would be an unsecured claim of the landlord that would have to be collected through the claims process in the probate proceeding which is usually a fairly favorable forum for the estate, instead of the usual court where small landlord\\-tenant disputes are handled. The probate estate could simply deny his claim for attorneys' fees and then, if the landlord wanted them after making a claim, the landlord would have to bring a lawsuit on fairly tight deadlines in the probate court to have the disallowance of the claim overturned.\n\nIf you wanted to be even more aggressive, rather than paying the last month's rent, the estate could just holdover into March without paying rent or a new security deposit (vacating before the eviction process can run its course), effectively forcing the landlord to use the security deposit for March rent, and then forcing the landlord to use the probate claims process for both damages to the property claimed and for an attorneys' fees.

This action aligns with the legal requirement to use the \"least needed amount of force.\"\n\nOption A (shooting Bob) is clearly excessive force, as the documentation states that lethal force would only be justified if Alice was at immediate risk of death. Option B (threatening with a knife) is also likely to be considered disproportionate unless Alice's situation is extremely dire. Option D (waiting) fails to fulfill Eve's legal and moral obligation to render aid, as outlined in \u00a7323c StGB.\n\nMoreover, Bob's actions of obstructing Eve from helping Alice could make him liable under \u00a7323c StGB for hindering persons providing assistance.

You need to be clear whether you are to be an actual employee of B, or a hired contractor for B.

Are there to be restrictions, such as a ban on your doing things for A while at B's worksite?\n\nAbove all, you need to agree on who owns what rights to both the existing A code, and any new code will be held by you, and what rights will be held by B. \n\nAll the above should be in a written agreement, and you would be wise to have a lawyer draft or at least review the language. \n\nIf B will not agree to this, you will have a choice to make: put A on hold while working for B, or not accept B's offer.

Given the legal framework in Fiji, what is the most appropriate course of action for the tenant?\n\nA) Accept the landlord's offer to split the costs, as the dogs were providing a security service\nB) Demand full compensation from the landlord, citing The Dogs Act 1971\nC) File a claim with their own vehicle insurance and avoid confrontation with the landlord\nD) Propose a compromise where the tenant pays for cosmetic damage and the landlord covers structural repairs\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct course of action is to demand full compensation from the landlord, based on The Dogs Act 1971 of Fiji. This question requires analysis of the given scenario and application of the relevant law. Section 9 of The Dogs Act 1971 clearly states that the owner of a dog is liable for damages caused by unprovoked injuries inflicted by their dog. The Act specifically mentions that it's not necessary to prove previous mischievous behavior or the owner's knowledge of such behavior. \n\nThe landlord's arguments about not being able to control the dogs or their security function are irrelevant under this law. The Act imposes strict liability on dog owners, regardless of the circumstances or the dog's purpose. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the legal requirement for full compensation. Option C, while potentially avoiding conflict, would unfairly burden the tenant with costs and potential insurance premium increases for damage they're not legally responsible for.

If so, what would be the reason a lawyer can't ask a judge questions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question should not include France and Germany, and should be limited to common law jurisdictions that are similar to India, because the function of judges differs starkly between adversarial vs. inquisitorial systems.\n\nThe adversarial model pits two parties against each other, with the judge serving as the decider (of law, and perhaps of fact). The parties can offer witnesses, who can be compelled to respond to questions, and the attorney asking the question gets to control the question asked (subject to a possible objection by the other party, to be ruled on by the judge).\n\nThe judge can rule on requests (which are not questions) i.e. petitions by either party. Otherwise, the judge sits there more or less mute, soaking up the argumentation being presented. Appellate proceedings are somewhat special in that the justices may address questions to the attorney, in order to better understand the logic of the proffered argument. The burden is on the attorney to make the case. There is *no* direct burden on the justice to \"make a case\". The \"court of public opinion\" may be relevant in a jurisdiction where the justice is an elected office or is appointed for limited time. Or, the contrary opinion of a higher court may have some influence on a justice's rulings \u2013 this is not the case with a Supreme Court.\n\nIn other words, it would be highly dysfunctional within the adversarial system for a party to be allowed to interrogate a judge.

The correct answer is A, based on the following analysis:\n\n1. U-turns are generally allowed at intersections controlled by traffic lights in Ontario, as implied by the absence of a specific prohibition in the Highway Traffic Act and the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius.\n\n2. In Case 1 of the documentation, it's suggested that the U-turning vehicle would have the right of way over a vehicle turning right on a red light.\n\n3. However, the critical piece of information comes from the Insurance Act of Ontario, which states: \"The driver of automobile \"A\" is 100 per cent at fault and the driver of automobile \"B\" is not at fault for an incident that occurs, [...] when automobile \"A\" is making a U-turn.\"\n\n4. This insurance regulation supersedes the general right-of-way rules in determining fault for insurance purposes.\n\n5. While the right-turning vehicle had a responsibility to yield on the red light, the blanket assignment of fault to U-turning vehicles in the Insurance Act takes precedence in this situation.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of traffic rules, right-of-way concepts, and specific insurance regulations.
