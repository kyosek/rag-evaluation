However, its intended purpose is for sharing information about one's computer, including the username (which is sometimes PII). Under GDPR, is the site owner required to allow users to delete posts, even though there's no way to verify who posted? What if all posts are automatically deleted after one day or some other period of time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, there would still be an obligation to comply with erasure requests \u2013 if the data subject can be identified, and if the GDPR applies.\n\nThis is a case for Art 11 GDPR: processing which does not require identification.\n\n* The pastebin site is not required to collect identifying info just in order to facilitate later deletion.\n* If the site is unable to identify the data subjects, then the data subject rights (like access, rectification, erasure, restriction, or data portability) do not apply. Other rights like the right to be informed and the right to object do remain, though.\n* But if the data subject provides sufficient additional information that makes it possible to identify their records, then the data subject rights apply again.\n\nIn practice, this is likely going to mean that anyone with access to a paste will be able to request deletion, since the site would have no ability to verify the identity of the data subject beyond the information in the paste.\n\nNone of this absolves the site from implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of this data. Even though the pastes might not be directly identifying, they are personal data and are far from anonymous. Common practices like numbering pastes with a sequential ID or showing recent pastes on a homepage have to be viewed critically. My go\\-to recommendation is to assign a cryptographically random UUIDv4 ID to the post, so that it is practically impossible for anyone to find the paste unless they were given a link by the uploader.\n\nYour idea to delete pastes after a fairly short retention period is also good. This helps with security, and it is in line with the GDPR's data minimization and storage limitation principles: data may only be kept as long as necessary for its purpose. On the other hand, quick deletion might not be in line with the purpose of these pastes \u2013 it all depends on context.\n\nYou mention that this is an US\\-based site. If so, there's a question whether GDPR would even apply. GDPR will apply per Art 3(2\\) if the data controller is offering its services to people who are in Europe. Here, \u201coffering\u201d does not mean mere availability of the website, but that the data controller intends the service to be used by such people, in particular if the service is somehow targeted or marketed to such people.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A US-based pastebin site allows anonymous posting of computer-related information, including usernames. The site assigns random UUIDs to posts and automatically deletes them after 7 days. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the site's GDPR obligations?\n\nA) The site has no GDPR obligations as it's based in the US and allows anonymous posting.\n\nB) The site must implement a user verification system to comply with GDPR erasure requests.\n\nC) The site is exempt from GDPR as it deletes all posts after a short period.\n\nD) The site may have GDPR obligations, including honoring erasure requests from anyone with access to a paste, if it targets European users.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is D because:\n1. GDPR can apply to US-based sites if they target European users (Art 3(2) GDPR).\n2. The site processes personal data (usernames) even if posts are anonymous.\n3. Art 11 GDPR allows processing without identification, but erasure requests must still be honored if the data subject provides sufficient information to identify their post.\n4. The site's current practices (random UUIDs, automatic deletion) align with GDPR principles but don't exempt it from obligations.\n5. In practice, anyone with access to a paste could request deletion since the site can't verify the original poster.\n\nA is incorrect because GDPR can apply to non-EU sites targeting EU users. B is wrong as GDPR doesn't require implementing new identification systems. C is incorrect because short retention doesn't automatically exempt from GDPR obligations."

For example, in a tennancy agreement the landlord's obligations to the tenant are different from the tenant's obligations to the landlord.\n\nHistorically, marriage has been viewed in a similar way. The obligations of the husband to the wife are not the same as the obligations of the wife to the husband. The vows made by the husband differ from those made by the wife. In the traditional English marriage service (Book of Common Prayer) the groom's promise is to love, comfort, honour and keep the bride, whereas she promises to obey, serve, love, honour and keep him. There is also an explanation of the differing duties.\n\nMore recently marriage has been thought of as a relationship in which the duties of husband to wife are identical to the duties of wife to husband. In the modern alternative Church of England marriage service each promises to love, comfort, honour and protect the other. There is no difference.\n\nIs there a legal term or phrase for a contract where the commitments of each party are identical, as opposed to being different.\n\nI am not looking for a word like \"equal\" implying the status of the parties, or \"symmetrical\" implying, I gather, their relative bargaining strength.

As confidential information, the NDA states the Receiving Party is not allowed to disclose this information (be it intentionally or unintentionally) until the agreement expires nor is it allowed to patent the information.\n\nIn said NDA, there is a clause that states (in legalese), \"If the Receiving Party is to violate the Agreement by selling any confidential information mentioned in the Agreement, or use the confidential information to develop their own working device, all assets generated as a result of the confidential information (i.e. money gained by building and selling the device) shall become the property of the Disclosing Party.\"\n\nThere is *no* clause in the NDA that states anything like, \"the NDA is invalid if information labelled as confidential is leaked by the Receiving Party.\" The NDA only says that the Receiving Party shall be prosecuted for a breach of contract.

The lawyer drafted a contract with Asset Y (a totally different Asset) as indemnity. Further, he attached several Exhibits to the contract that don't clearly relate to either Asset X or Y, and only confuse the picture.\n\nCompany A failed to perform, but won't hand over Asset X, and my friend doesn't have the indemnity that he envisioned because of the way the contract was drafted. (A first year law student could probably have done better.) That's the causation. The harm comes from the fact that my friend now has to sue Company A, which might not be necessary if the contract was solid. The breach of duty comes from the disregard of instructions to \"securitize\" Asset X.\n\nDoes this constitute legal malpractice, and if so, what are the remedies? These questions relate to New York State.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Legal malpractice varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In many you'd need to show that there existed an: \n\n* Attorney\\-client relationship\n* Breach of duty\n* Causation\n* Harm\n\n[This](https://www.justia.com/injury/legal-malpractice/) is a more in depth summary of each of the elements. Each jurisdiction is going to put tests in place to determine whether the elements are actually met. So your firend's locality matters a good deal.\n\nThe ABA also has some aggregate statistics on the incidence of the various types of malpractice [here](http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_webonly_webonly07101.html). For example, it helps one to distinguish between clerical errors and failure to follow a client's instructions.\n\nEdit: for the state of NY (which applies the above rules), see:\n\n[NY State Bar Assoc.

The client now has to sue the other party due to this error. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) This case automatically constitutes legal malpractice because the lawyer made a clerical error.\n\nB) Legal malpractice cannot be claimed because the lawyer's error did not cause direct financial harm to the client.\n\nC) To prove legal malpractice, the client must demonstrate an attorney-client relationship, breach of duty, causation, and harm.\n\nD) The case can only be considered legal malpractice if the lawyer admits to intentionally disregarding the client's instructions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In New York State, as in many jurisdictions, proving legal malpractice requires demonstrating four key elements: an attorney-client relationship, breach of duty, causation, and harm. In this case, there was clearly an attorney-client relationship. The breach of duty occurred when the lawyer disregarded instructions to \"securitize\" Asset X. Causation is evident in the fact that the error led to an ineffective contract. Harm is demonstrated by the client now having to sue the other party, which might have been unnecessary with a properly drafted contract. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while a clerical error occurred, this alone does not automatically constitute malpractice; all four elements must be proven. Option B is wrong because there is harm, even if it's not direct financial harm at this stage. Option D is incorrect because the lawyer's intention is not a necessary factor in determining malpractice; negligence is sufficient if it meets the four criteria."

This type of clause is indeed commonly known as a \"reading down\" provision and is generally considered valid in contract law. It allows for the preservation of the contract's intent if a court finds certain terms unreasonable, by modifying those terms to be reasonable rather than voiding the entire agreement.

The tenant is [not totally free of responsibilities](http://www.ontariotenants.ca/law/act04.phtml#RTA33): \"The tenant is responsible for ordinary cleanliness of the rental unit, except to the extent that the tenancy agreement requires the landlord to clean it\". The act enumerates allowed terminations of a lease for cause, and while damaging a unit is a cause, violating the requirement to keep things clean is not, that is, it does not say that you can evict them for having a dirty place (assuming it is not an actual health or safety hazard). There is a [form (N\\-5\\)](http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/ltb/forms/#landlord-forms) which you would fill out to officially give notice to the tenant, indicating an intent to evict, but \"the place is dirty\" is not in the list of causes, and you are required to explain in detail the \"damage\" caused by the tenant.

Would that be like song or movie players, where the device is legal, but the file being downloaded or played might not be?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From the patent angle, you will need to make sure that you are not infringing on a patented swing. That should be pretty easy at present because golfers are not patenting their swings. [What Mowzer says](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/4060/10) about public disclosure probably has something to do with this. However, at least one golfer patented a swing:\n\n[![Image from swing patent](https://i.stack.imgur.com/f5pXU.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/f5pXU.jpg)\n\nI would be more concerned with the right of publicity of the golfers whose swings you are selling.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates a golf swing training app that uses data from professional golfers' swings recorded at public events. The app allows users to download and practice specific golfers' swings, such as \"Tiger Woods 5-iron\" or \"Bubba Watson 3-wood\". Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of selling this app?\n\nA) The app is completely legal to sell as long as the swings were recorded at public events.\n\nB) The app violates patent law if any of the golfers have patented their swings.\n\nC) The app likely violates the right of publicity of the named golfers unless their consent is obtained.\n\nD) The app is legal to sell, but individual swing files may be subject to copyright claims by the golfers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most accurate statement is C. The app likely violates the right of publicity of the named golfers unless their consent is obtained. The right of publicity protects individuals from the unauthorized commercial use of their name, likeness, or identity. By using specific golfers' names and their distinctive swings for commercial purposes without their consent, the app would likely infringe on their right of publicity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because public recording doesn't negate publicity rights. Option B is unlikely, as golfers rarely patent their swings, though it's theoretically possible. Option D mischaracterizes the legal issue, which is primarily about publicity rights rather than copyright."

Or does it not transfer until the buyer leaves the store?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer used to be handled by common law in common law countries (it is handled by statute in civil law jurisdictions such as Quebec), but in most jurisdictions, this has been superseded by specific statutes and treaties governing the sale of goods.\n\nU.S. Law\n========\n\nIn every U.S. state the answer to this question is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, which is substantially similar to this version as enacted in Colorado:\n\n> Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 4\\-2\\-401\\. Passing of title \\- reservation\n> for security \\- limited application of this section\n> \n> \n> Each provision of this article with regard to the rights, obligations,\n> and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers, or other third\n> parties applies irrespective of title to the goods, except where the\n> provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not covered\n> by the other provisions of this article and matters concerning title\n> become material, the following rules apply:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to\n> their identification to the contract (section 4\\-2\\-501 ), and unless\n> otherwise explicitly agreed, the buyer acquires by their\n> identification a special property as limited by this title. Any\n> retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in\n> goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a\n> reservation of a security interest. Subject to these provisions and to\n> the provisions of the article on secured transactions (article 9 of\n> this title), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any\n> manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) **Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, title passes to the buyer at\n> the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with\n> reference to the physical delivery of the goods,** despite any\n> reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title\n> is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and\n> despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading:\n> \n> \n> (a) If the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the\n> goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at\n> destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of\n> shipment; but\n> \n> \n> (b) If the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on\n> tender there.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, where delivery is to be made\n> without moving the goods:\n> \n> \n> (a) If the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title\n> passes at the time when and the place where the seller delivers such\n> documents, and if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of\n> title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or\n> \n> \n> (b) If the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and\n> no documents of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time\n> and place of contracting.\n> \n> \n> (4\\) A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the\n> goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of\n> acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting\n> occurs by operation of law and is not a \"sale\".\n> \n> \n> (5\\) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when\n> livestock have been delivered under a contract of sale, if on the\n> accompanying brand inspection certificate or memorandum of brand\n> inspection certificate the seller has conspicuously noted that payment\n> of the consideration for the sale has not been received, title does\n> not pass until payment is made.\n\nThe language in bold governs the scenario you post absent an agreement to the contrary, so ownership transferred when a successful payment is accepted at the till, and not when the buyer leaves the store.\n\nBut, suppose that you are buying a big cabinet. Then, title changes not when you check out at the register, but when the cabinet is moved from the loading dock at the furniture store to your pickup truck ten minutes later.\n\nAlso, the philosophy of the Uniform Commercial Code is to make many legal obligations that historically hinged upon title to the goods (i.e. ownership) instead have a statutory basis that doesn't refer to title. For example, the Uniform Commercial Code recognizes that risk of loss, or risk of insolvency, don't always coincide exactly with change in title. In the Uniform Commercial Code, title is a residual catchall that applies to the rights of the parties only in the absence of another express provision of the UCC.\n\nThe Uniform Commercial Code also has a number of exceptions to the general rule.\n\nOne is for identification as special property. For example, suppose that there are lots of granite slabs on a warehouse floor none of which is exactly the same. Then, title is transferred when someone slaps a \"sold\" sign on that slab or in the records of the store. (Something similar applies in the case of a layaway sale.)\n\nWhen goods are in a warehouse, title can change by transferring a warehouse receipt without physically moving the goods. For example, this is how most transaction in gold bars and grain are handled.\n\nA car changes title when the certificate of title is signed by the seller.\n\nWhen goods are shipped, the parties can decide where along the way title transfers by saying **F.O.B. \"location\"** which is an acronym for \"free on board\" and means that title shifts when the goods reach that location.\n\nThe CISG\n========\n\nWhat if you are a Canadian business and you've driven across the border to Detroit to buy some inventory for your business? What law applies then?\n\nIn that case, the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods applies, and not the Uniform Commercial Code and Articles 66\\-69 of the CISG apply.\n\nIn the simple situation you describe, the UCC rule and and CISG default rule under Article 66 are the same. Title passes when the \"the goods are handed over\" to the buyer or to the first person in the delivery change if the buyer is taking delivery of the goods through a courier or delivery service.\n\nCanada\n======\n\nI don't know what authority applies in Canada, although I suspect that the outcome in common law provinces would be the same in the simple scenario you pose.\n\nTraditionally, civil law jurisdictions, like Quebec and Germany, make more of a distinction between \"title\" and \"possession\" than common law jurisdictions did historically.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A customer purchases a large cabinet from a furniture store in Colorado. At what point does the legal title of the cabinet transfer to the customer?\n\nA) When the customer makes the payment at the cash register\nB) When the customer leaves the store with the cabinet\nC) When the cabinet is loaded onto the customer's vehicle at the store's loading dock\nD) When the customer signs a receipt for the cabinet\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in Colorado (Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 4-2-401), title to goods passes to the buyer \"at the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods.\" In the case of a large item like a cabinet, this would typically occur when the item is loaded onto the customer's vehicle at the store's loading dock. This is because the store's performance in terms of physical delivery is not complete until the cabinet is actually transferred to the customer's possession, which in this case happens at the loading dock. \n\nOption A is incorrect because merely paying at the register does not complete the physical delivery for a large item like a cabinet. \n\nOption B is incorrect because leaving the store is not relevant to the transfer of title under the UCC. \n\nOption D is incorrect because signing a receipt is not specifically mentioned in the UCC as a determining factor for title transfer.\n\nThis question tests understanding of how the UCC applies to the transfer of title in retail transactions, particularly for large items that require additional steps for delivery beyond the point of sale."

Specifically Subclause (5\\):\n\n> Despite subsection (2\\), a reproduction, for the purpose of research or study, of not more than a reasonable portion of a work or adaptation that is described in an item of the table and is not contained in an article in a periodical publication is taken to be a fair dealing with the work or adaptation for the purpose of research or study. For this purpose, reasonable portion means the amount described in the item.\n\nAnd the table is where your 10% or 1 chapter comes from.\n\nSo, what can your study group do?\n---------------------------------\n\nAssuming the study group consists of external students of one or more educational institutions (i.e. not staff) and the material is for study for their course.\n\n* If it doesn't copy more than a reasonable portion, there is definitely no copyright infringement (Subclause 1A).\n* If it is more than a reasonable portion, then there is no copyright infringement if it is fair dealing according to the test in Subclause 2\\.\n\n> For the purposes of this Act, the matters to which regard shall be had, in determining whether a dealing with a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work or with an adaptation of a literary, dramatic or musical work, being a dealing by way of reproducing the whole or a part of the work or adaptation, constitutes a fair dealing with the work or adaptation for the purpose of research or study include:\n> \n> \n> (a) the purpose and character of the dealing;\n> \n> \n> (b) the nature of the work or adaptation;\n> \n> \n> (c) the possibility of obtaining the work or adaptation within a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price;\n> \n> \n> (d) the effect of the dealing upon the potential market for, or value of, the work or adaptation; and\n> \n> \n> (e) in a case where part only of the work or adaptation is reproduced\u2014the amount and substantiality of the part copied taken in relation to the whole work or adaptation.\n\nGiving each other student a copy of the pdf is unlikely to be fair dealing since while the purpose is for education, the nature of the work is a textbook, it is trivial to buy copies in a reasonable time at a commercial price, the effect of the dealing is to directly reduce sales of the textbook and you are copying the whole of the work.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Both UK and Spanish laws apply to their respective jurisdictions (UK export laws, Spanish import laws).\n2. The choice of law clause specifying UK law will generally be honored for contractual interpretation.\n3.

Naturally the driver seat on an UK registered bus is on the right side, but when it entered France and then Belgium the driving lane was on the right side (and not in the left, as in UK). It seemed to me very accident\\-prone to drive on the *wrong* side of the road, but there were a lot of buses and also smaller vehicles.\n\nMy question is: was any traffic law infringed? Is it legal to drive a vehicle with the driver seat on the opposite side? I specifficaly mentioned France and Belgium, but I would be interested as well in other countries where this type of situation might happen due to proximity with neighbouring countries where the drive lane is on the opposite side.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: People can take their personal cars through the [Channel Tunnel](http://gouk.about.com/od/gettingtotheuk/p/ChannelTunnel.htm) from Great Britain to France. They don't actually drive their cars through the tunnel, but going by car is a perfectly normal way to travel between those two countries. That's probably the most well\\-known place where drivers will switch from driving on one side of the road to the other, but there are [many more](http://basementgeographer.com/crossing-from-right-hand-drive-countries-to-left-hand-drive-countries-and-vice-versa/) .\n\nIf driving with a car with the wheel on the \"wrong\" side were forbidden, these options would not exist, because at least one direction of travel would not work. Now, of course, that doesn't mean a country like Belgium, which does not have to direct way to Britain, couldn't forbid cars with the steering wheel on the right. But at least for EU states, that seems to be forbidden, as Poland and Lithuania learned when they tried to require cars that were to be registered there to have the steering wheel [repositioned to the left](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_CJE-14-37_en.htm)\n\n> Consequently, the Court holds that the position of the driver\u2019s seat, an integral part of the steering equipment of a vehicle, comes within the harmonisation established by Directives 2007/46 and 70/311, so that, in the context of the registration of a new vehicle in their territory, the Member States may not require, for reasons of safety, that the driver\u2019s seat of that vehicle be moved to the side opposite the direction of the traffic.\n> \n> \n> It notes in that regard that the legislation at issue provides for exceptions with regard to the use of vehicles equipped with a steering\\-wheel on the right by people who reside in other Member States, and travel to Poland and Lithuania for a limited period (for example, tourists). That fact shows, according to the Court, that the contested legislation tolerates the risk involved in such use.\n\nSo even those countries that tried to ensure that registered cars had the steering wheel on the \"right\" side made provisions for cars that were just traveling through. And the EU does not consider it a valid law to require wheels to be repositioned.",

According to the EU regulations mentioned in the text, member states cannot forbid the use of vehicles with the steering wheel on the \"wrong\" side for safety reasons. The European Court of Justice ruled against attempts by Poland and Lithuania to require repositioning of steering wheels, indicating that such requirements violate EU harmonization directives. Furthermore, the text mentions that taking personal cars through the Channel Tunnel is a common practice, and if driving with the wheel on the \"wrong\" side were forbidden, this option would not exist. Therefore, the British tourist can legally drive their right-hand drive car in both France and Belgium without any special permits or restrictions."

According to the information provided, if an individual performs the same work and is treated similarly to regular employees, they will be considered an employee for legal and tax purposes, regardless of any agreement to the contrary.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the developer's legal position?\n\nA) The developer must immediately discontinue their business and stop using the library.\nB) The developer can continue using the existing version of the library under the original license terms, provided the license didn't have a modification clause.\nC) The developer is legally obligated to adopt the new license terms for their existing product.\nD) The developer can continue using the library under any terms they choose, regardless of license changes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, unless the original license contained a clause allowing for future modifications, the developer can continue using the existing version of the software under the original license terms. This provides a level of protection for developers who rely on third-party libraries for their products.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because an immediate discontinuation is not necessary if the original license terms still apply to the version being used.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect as the developer is not obligated to adopt new license terms for their existing product if the original license didn't allow for such changes.\n\nAnswer D is overly permissive and doesn't accurately reflect the legal constraints of software licensing.\n\nThe question tests understanding of software licensing principles, the importance of version control in development, and the legal implications of using third-party libraries in commercial products."

It means that someone forgot to update their annual registration and pay the fee and could be resolved in half an hour with a small late fee payment. It is a sign of slight sloppiness, but is only sometimes evidence of something more serious. \n\nFor example, if a company moves to a new location without remembering to inform the Secretary of State, it might not get the annual report notice and thus fail to file. And, a company rarely has an occasion to double check that it is in good standing.\n\nUsually, the only legal consequence is that the company can't commence a lawsuit without bringing itself into good standing and that another company can steal its business name (if it can do so without violating a common law trademark arising from use of the name). It does not significantly change the rights of parties dealing with the company in terms of property ownership, contract rights, etc.\n\nThis said, closer scrutiny than a company without that issue might be in order and the fact that you are checking at all means that there might have been other reasons apart from this fact to be concerned.",

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications and appropriate course of action for the job seeker?\n\nA) The company is likely engaged in illegal activities, and the job seeker should immediately report them to authorities.\n\nB) This status has no significant legal consequences and can be easily resolved, but the job seeker should conduct additional due diligence before accepting the offer.\n\nC) The job seeker should decline the offer, as the company cannot legally enter into employment contracts in this state.\n\nD) The \"not in good standing\" status means the company's assets are frozen, and they cannot pay employees.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The \"not in good standing\" status often results from administrative oversights like forgetting to file an annual report or pay a fee. It has minimal legal consequences and can usually be resolved quickly. However, this status might indicate some level of organizational carelessness. While it's not necessarily a deal-breaker, it does suggest that the job seeker should perform additional research on the company before accepting the offer. This could include looking into the company's financial stability, reputation, and overall business practices.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the status doesn't imply illegal activities. Option C is false; the company can still enter into contracts and hire employees. Option D is also incorrect; the status doesn't affect the company's assets or ability to pay employees."

At a low\\-end fee of $10k per student per year, this means 300 students will cross the threshold.\n2. they\u2019re connected to a larger organisation (with an annual turnover of $3 million) \\- which captures most private education networks such as Catholic Education Australia.\n3. they supply a health service and hold health information, although this isn\u2019t their primary activity \\- which is unlikely to apply.\n\nConsent is required to collect [sensitive](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/what-is-personal-information/#SensitiveInfo) information or to disclose non\\-sensitive [personal](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/what-is-personal-information/) information for purposes other than for which it was collected. There is no age criterion on consent \\- an individual who can understand the concepts (as you clearly can) can give or withhold their own consent even if they are a child.\n\nGiven that they can monitor all activity, this may be sensitive information (e.g. political opinions or associations, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or associations, sexual orientation or practices) depending on what you use the computer for. If so, then consent is required. However, if the school prescribes the activities that you are allowed to use the computer for such that you are not *required* to disclose sensitive information; if you do so knowing that it was being collected this would be implied consent.\n\n**State Law**\n\n[new\\-south\\-wales](/questions/tagged/new-south-wales \"show questions tagged 'new-south-wales'\")\n\nNSW Education is subject to a specific [Code of Practice](https://www.ipc.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/file_manager/Privacy%20code%20of%20practice%20Dept%20Ed%20Training%20ggchild%2020121206_0.pdf) under the [*Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act*](https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-1998-133).\n\nConsent may or not be required depending on the purpose for the collection of the information.

Collection of non-sensitive personal information for the primary purpose it was collected (education) generally doesn't require explicit consent under the Privacy Act.\n\nB) Correct. The Privacy Act applies to private schools with an annual turnover over $3 million (which this school likely has).

The law recognizes that in public areas, individuals do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Even if someone claims to have a restraining order against another person, this does not create a blanket prohibition on being photographed in public. The only potential legal issues would arise if the photographs were used in a way that violated specific laws, such as knowingly assisting in the violation of a restraining order. However, the mere act of taking and possessing photographs taken in a public space is generally protected under First Amendment rights."

However, given the immense power in the modern world of corporations I'm curious as to whether any corporations have ever been indicted for torture.\n\nJurisdiction: Either Europe or the United States\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Civil lawsuits seeking damages for torture or similar grave misconduct by corporations outside the United States are often brought under the U.S. [Alien Tort Claims Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Tort_Statute) (a.k.a. ATS) in U.S. federal courts. Multiple cases brought under the Alien Tort Claims Act have involved claims that U.S. corporations, through their agents carrying out company policy, tortured people outside the U.S., or were complicit in conduct that caused someone to be tortured by a government.\n\nOne example is the case of *[Wang Xiaoning v. Yahoo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Tort_Statute)*\n\n> In 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights USA filed a lawsuit\n> against Yahoo! on behalf of Chinese dissidents Wang Xiaoning and Shi\n> Tao (Guao Quingsheng), claiming jurisdiction under the ATS. According\n> to the complaint, Wang and Shi Tao used Yahoo! accounts to share\n> pro\\-democracy material, and a Chinese subsidiary of Yahoo! gave the\n> Chinese government identifying information that allowed authorities to\n> identify and arrest them. The Complaint alleges that the plaintiffs\n> were subjected to \"torture, cruel, inhuman, or other degrading\n> treatment or punishment, arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention, and\n> forced labor.\"\n> \n> \n> Yahoo! settled the case in November 2007 for an undisclosed amount of\n> money, and it agreed to cover the plaintiff's legal costs as a part of\n> the settlement. In a statement released after the settlement was made\n> public, Yahoo! said that it would \"provide 'financial, humanitarian\n> and legal support to these families' and create a separate\n> 'humanitarian relief fund' for other dissidents and their families.\"\n\nCorporations can also be prosecuted criminally for crimes.\n\n*Pacific Gas \\& Electric* was [recently convicted of manslaughter in a California State Court](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-manslaughter.html) related to deaths caused by wildfires that were caused by reckless disregard to maintenance and safety by the corporation. The fines were largely waived in subsequent bankruptcy proceedings with the permission of the prosecution, in order to free up funds to pay compensatory damages to parties prevailing in civil lawsuits and funds to comply with orders from utility industry regulators in the state.\n\n*Arthur Anderson*, then one of the \"Big Six\" accounting firms in the United States was [convicted of fraud related criminal charges](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/31/business/justices-unanimously-overturn-conviction-of-arthur-andersen.html) in relation to the collapse of *Enron*, an oil company for which it was an accountant, that resulted in the demise of the firm, even though the conviction was ultimately reversed on appeal by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nI am not aware of a case in which a U.S. corporation has been prosecuted criminally for authorizing its agents to torture someone or being complicit in torture, but it certainly could be done (and probably has been done).\n\nThe federal [Racketeering and Corrupt Organizations Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act) (RICO) and parallel state statutes, are specifically designed to authorize both criminal and civil actions against corporation or *de facto* entities engaged in criminal activity. The statute was designed to target organized crime activities, particularly those involving corporations used as fronts for criminal activity, and in the criminal context, the focus of prosecutions has largely continued to be on old school mafia type organized crime gangs and cartels. But private civil actions authorized by RICO against companies engaged in a pattern of criminal activity usually involve allegations of a pattern of fraud and other forms of white collar crime. This would be a likely statute to invoke in a criminal case alleging that a company had engaged in a pattern and practice of torturing people.\n\nIn practice, the difference between a civil lawsuit in which compensatory and punitive damages may be imposed, and a criminal prosecution of a corporation, in which fines and restitution may be imposed, is subtle indeed when it comes to the remedies available in each case, even though procedurally, the two kinds of legal proceedings are very different, which is why usually a civil lawsuit, rather than a criminal conviction, would be the legal tool of choice when a corporation engaged in conduct, through its agents, which is criminal in nature.\n\nAlso, it is possible, but harder, to prosecute officers, employees and agents of corporations in addition to the corporations themselves, for criminal conduct. Indeed, this is the usual approach. But it is harder to convict an individual because you have to show that the individual had the requisite intent and was personally involved in the criminal conduct. This typically requires access to internal communications in a firm which can be difficult to obtain in a criminal proceeding that doesn't have as much pre\\-trial discovery, and can be difficult to establish because responsibility within a large corporation is often diffuse.\n\nGenerally speaking, prosecutors have seen the *Arthur Anderson* case as an unjust one and a cautionary tale that encourages them to think twice before prosecuting a major U.S. corporation criminally, rather than merely bringing a civil lawsuit against it.",

Yahoo! case\n\nC) State criminal courts, as shown in the Arthur Anderson fraud case related to Enron\n\nD) Federal criminal prosecution under specific torture statutes, as evidenced by numerous convictions of major U.S. corporations\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Alien Tort Claims Act (ATS) is the most commonly used legal mechanism in the U.S. for seeking damages against corporations for torture or grave misconduct committed outside the U.S. The Wang Xiaoning v. Yahoo! case is a prime example of its application. In this case, Chinese dissidents sued Yahoo! in U.S. federal court under the ATS, alleging that Yahoo!'s actions led to their arrest and subsequent torture by Chinese authorities. While the other options mention valid legal mechanisms or cases, they do not specifically address the question of corporations being held accountable for torture outside the U.S. Option A relates to domestic crimes, Option C refers to a domestic fraud case, and Option D is incorrect as there haven't been numerous convictions of major U.S. corporations for torture under federal criminal statutes."

In the case of taxation, unanimity was made a condition for that authority in [Art 113 TFEU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12016E113):\n\n> The Council shall, acting unanimously in accordance with a special legislative procedure and after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, adopt provisions for the harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation to the extent that such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market and to avoid distortion of competition.\n\nNote also that this authority is limited to certain kinds of taxes, in particular to harmonizing the European VAT system.\n\nTo be distinguished from tax laws affecting the Single Market, taxation of Member States (membership dues) also requires unanimity per Art 223 TFEU.\n\nAside from that, and aside from special rules to protect EU institutions and officials from inappropriate taxation, the EU has not been given authority over tax matters. In particular, there is currently no basis e.g. for an EU\\-wide income tax.

The EU's authority over taxation is limited and specific, primarily focusing on harmonizing certain types of taxes (such as VAT and excise duties) that affect the internal market. This authority is granted by Article 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

The matter was remitted to trial. But the trial court was not satisfied with the legislature's attempted improvements, so it substituted its own \"judicially crafted\" map. This is the map that would be used in electing members of the federal House of Representatives.\n\n### Issue\n\nThe issue is whether the Elections Clause of the United States Constitution (which says that the manner of federal elections shall \"be prescribed in each State *by the Legislature thereof*\") limits the role that a state judiciary can play in determining the boundaries of federal congressional districts.\n\n### Basic argument of the petitioner\n\nThe petitioner's argument is roughly that *only* the state legislature may play a role in federal districting and not any other state entity or the state as a whole. They also argue that the state constitution cannot impose additional constraints on federal districting by the state legislature: only federal constitutional limits apply.\n\n### Basic argument of the respondent\n\nThe respondents' argument is that legislated election regulations, including those that establish the district boundaries *are not immune from judicial review*. They argue that the legislated *process* chosen by the North Carolina General Assembly, *includes* a provision for judicial review. They also argue that state constitutions can provide standards and guidance for courts to apply.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Here's a scenario I've always been curious about.\n\nSuppose that a 15\\-year\\-old high school student in Oregon, USA, is called into the counselor's office because he was reported for having scars on his forearms. The counselor (who the student has no choice in going to see) requests/demands to see the student's arms.\n\nCan the student legally refrain from showing his forearms to the counselor?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A school official might have the legal right to search you (without a warrant), if, following [New Jersey v. T.L.O](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/469/325/case.html), they have a reasonable suspicion that the student has done something wrong (not necessarily a crime). However, students do have a reasonable expectation of privacy. The court ruled that schools do not have the same complete right to invade their child's privacy (likewise, schools do not have the same right to suppress speech of children). If the counselor has a reasonable suspicious of wrong\\-doing, a warrantless search would be legal.\n\nIt does not follow, though, that a student may resist such an order without consequences. The courts, and not the student, will determine whether the suspicion is reasonable. There does not appear to be case law establishing one way or the other whether the official must even articulate a reason for the search (students relent and sue later). A student can \"legally\" refuse the search (the official cannot batter the student to perform the search); but there probably is a rule that if you refuse a search request, you will be suspended (such a suspension was upheld in [DesRoches v. Caprio](https://openjurist.org/156/f3d/571/ii-v-caprio)). Picking [Portland](https://www.pps.net/cms/lib/OR01913224/Centricity/Domain/44/2017.18_SRR_MASTER_English.pdf) as a random district in Oregon, they do state that \"The school may search a student if the school has a reasonable suspicion that a prohibited or dangerous item will be found\". They also articulate disciplinary procedures for student violating the rules, and on p. 12 include a broad form of prohibited misbehavior, \"refusing to follow directions\". They are supposed to engage in lower\\-level discipline (\"conferences\", with school officials, which parents may attend) before imposing stiff penalties such as expulsion.\n\nSuppose a student had been in an accident years before and had disfiguring scars on his forearm. An official could not search the students arms to satisfy voyeuristic curiosity: there is no reasonable suspicious of wrongdoing. Suppose on the other hand the student had needle tracks on his arms from drug injections: a rumor to that effect would create a reasonable suspicion that the student was abusing drugs. You can sue to find out if their suspicion was reasonable.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old student in Oregon is called to the counselor's office after reports of suspicious marks on their arms. The counselor asks to see the student's arms. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the student's rights and the school's authority in this situation?\n\nA) The student has an absolute right to refuse the counselor's request without any consequences.\n\nB) The counselor must obtain a warrant before asking to see the student's arms.\n\nC) The school can perform the search without reasonable suspicion if it's for the student's safety.\n\nD) The student can refuse the search, but may face disciplinary action, and the reasonableness of the search can be challenged later in court.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate based on the information provided. While students do have privacy rights, school officials can conduct searches without a warrant if they have reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. The student can legally refuse the search (the counselor cannot forcibly examine the student's arms), but this refusal may result in disciplinary action such as suspension. The reasonableness of the search and any resulting disciplinary action can be challenged later in court. This aligns with the principles established in New Jersey v. T.L.O. and the practices described in the Portland school district example.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while students can refuse, they may face consequences for doing so. Option B is incorrect because school officials don't need a warrant for searches based on reasonable suspicion. Option C is incorrect because some level of reasonable suspicion is still required for a search, even if it's related to student safety."

It certainly cannot be for any technical reason.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Retaining video from the buffer period advances law\\-enforcement and accountability purposes by making it more likely that the camera will retain footage of whatever caused the officer to turn the camera on in the first place.\n\nIf a police officer says you ran a red light, the dash camera will show what actually happened if the officer turned it on within 30 seconds of you passing through the intersection. If a corrections officer says he had to use force because an inmate jumped him, the buffer period allows the camera to capture not just the officer hitting the inmate, but also whatever happened immediately prior.\n\n[According to Axon](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/7/17/18405204/cpd-supt-johnson-explains-why-no-audio-recovered-from-fatal-police-shooting#:%7E:text=Steve%20Tuttle%2C%20spokesman%20for%20Axon,an%20audio%2Dfree%20video%20buffer.), which seems to have largest market share in the BWC space, the lack of audio is meant to protect the officers' privacy:\n\n> Cops feared they might tell a joke or discuss a personal situation like a divorce before they double\\-pressed the large button on the device to activate it.

The primary purpose of the 30-second video buffer without audio is to capture context for incidents that prompt camera activation. This allows the camera to retain footage of whatever caused the officer to turn the camera on, providing valuable context for law enforcement and accountability purposes.\n\nA is incorrect because storage space is not mentioned as a concern in the documentation.\n\nB, while mentioned in the documentation as a benefit for officers, is not the primary purpose of the feature. It's a secondary consideration that explains why audio is not included in the buffer period.\n\nD is incorrect because there is no technical reason mentioned for the lack of audio in the buffer period. The documentation explicitly states that it \"certainly cannot be for any technical reason.\"\n\nThe buffer period serves to capture important visual context that might otherwise be missed, such as the moments leading up to a traffic violation or the initiation of a physical altercation, without compromising officers' privacy through audio recording during non-critical moments."

I called the prosecutor to ask him to drop the charges against my spouse. He said he would call me back with a decision. He did not. So, 4 days later, I called again to ask him. Instead, one of his assistants told me that I should not have contacted him, because that \"could make him a witness himself,\" whatever that means. His assistant told me that when the prosecutor has a chance to read the case, his office will contact me, and that I could come in, and with a third party present, talk to the prosecutor. I would rather just email the prosecutor than come in to talk to him. If I email him, listing the reasons that I want him to drop the case against my spouse, is that legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The prosecutor has valid concerns. What you're providing her is considered exculpatory or mitigating evidence under [Brady v. Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_v._Maryland), so she has a duty to disclose everything you told her to your spouse's attorney. There are a few circumstances where the prosecutor can be made a witness, like if you made an inconsistent statement to them, or told them you didn't want to prosecute, then didn't testify at trial. If there's a third party there, that third party can provide that evidence at trial.\n\nKeep in mind, the prosecutor doesn't have to drop or dismiss the case just because you don't want to proceed. In about half of all DV cases the victim doesn't want prosecution or is too scared to testify. Spousal abuse is rarely a one\\-time event and victims of domestic abuse are much, [much more likely to become murder victims.](http://ncadv.org/learn-more/statistics) It's critical to document past abuse and begin rehabilitative intervention counseling.\n\nThere's probably nothing illegal with you emailing the prosecutor, you're a victim in a case.",

What is this all about as I am new to this state? Honestly, unless they got a warrant I don't want anybody walking in my home. What is a general rule of thumb here, since my understanding is my relationship begins and ends with this document called a lease.

This right, however, stems from the courts and not statutes, and you could theoretically sue the landlord to prevent such an inspection (you would need a good attorney, to overcome the presumption that reasonable routine inspections with notice are allowed).",

The coroner may require additional information beyond the initial police statement to determine the cause and circumstances of death.\n\nB) A criminal trial is a potential proceeding, especially if further investigation reveals that the death was not a suicide but involved foul play. The discoverer's testimony could be crucial in establishing the scene and initial observations.\n\nC) A civil trial related to insurance claims is another possibility. The discoverer's testimony might be needed to confirm details about the death, which could affect insurance payouts.\n\nD) This is the correct answer because a parliamentary hearing on suicide prevention is not mentioned in the given information as a potential legal proceeding where the discoverer might be required to testify.

But in order to win a lawsuit, you have to have damages as a result of some action, AND you must prove that the action was done with intent to harm or was otherwise negligent.\n\nSo following your website example, a lot of things would have to happen:\n\n1. The website would have to be hacked.\n2. If the passwords are encrypted instead of hashed (which still qualifies as \"plain\\-text\" once they email it to you), the hacker would have to figure out how to decrypt the passwords.

The hacker would have to take those passwords and do something with them that causes damage to their owners.\n\nEven if all of those things happened, you would still also have to prove negligence on their part which would be pretty difficult to do because the flaw that was hacked would be the focus of negligence discussions moreso than what was stolen.\n\nThat being said, if your goal is simply to get them to fix the problem, rather than receive monetary damages, then you could still sue for an action to be taken. You'd have to pay by the hour for the attorney since they wouldn't have a chance of winning monetary damages. But in all likelihood the website owner, upon seeing the lawsuit, would fix the problem before it gets to court, so I could see that having the desired effect.

When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that\n> the unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer\u2019s role in the\n> matter, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct the\n> misunderstanding. **The lawyer shall not give legal advice to an\n> unrepresented person, other than the advice to secure counsel, *if the\n> lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the interests of such a\n> person are or have a reasonable possibility of being in conflict with\n> the interests of the client*.**\n\nSo, basically, if a lawyer gives legal advice to someone who isn't his client, the lawyer needs to be clear that both the person is not someone with a conflict of interest with his/her client, and that the lawyer provides the disclaimer that the lawyer does not have the third\\-party's interests at heart when giving the advice.\n\nIf the non\\-client is adverse to the lawyer's client, or otherwise is in a conflict of interest with the lawyer's client, the lawyer may not give that person legal advice other than to retain a lawyer of their own.\n\nA lawyer giving legal advice to a non\\-client is also subject to Rule of Professional Conduct 4\\.1 which requires the lawyer to be truthful in communications with third\\-parties. This rule states:\n\n> In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly:\n> \n> \n> (a) make a false statement of material fact **or law** to a third person;\n> or\n> \n> \n> (b) fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure\n> is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a\n> client, unless disclosure is prohibited by Rule 1\\.6\\.\n\nNote also that \"legal advice\" means applications of the law to a particular person's actual factual situation, for use by that person, and not merely provision of general educational information about the law.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An attorney, Sarah, is representing her client, John, in a contract dispute. During a social gathering, Sarah meets Lisa, who mentions she's having issues with a contract but can't afford a lawyer. Which of the following actions would be most appropriate for Sarah?\n\nA) Sarah can freely give Lisa detailed legal advice about her contract situation, as long as she clearly states she's not Lisa's lawyer.\n\nB) Sarah can provide Lisa with general information about contract law but should advise Lisa to seek her own legal counsel before giving any specific advice.\n\nC) Sarah can give Lisa legal advice about her contract situation only after confirming that Lisa's case has no potential conflict with John's interests.\n\nD) Sarah should refrain from giving Lisa any legal advice and only recommend that she seek her own legal counsel.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the Rules of Professional Conduct, particularly Rule 4.3, a lawyer should be very cautious when dealing with unrepresented persons. In this scenario, the most appropriate action for Sarah is to refrain from giving Lisa any legal advice and only recommend that she seek her own legal counsel (option D).\n\nOption A is incorrect because freely giving detailed legal advice to a non-client can easily create an unintended attorney-client relationship and may violate ethical rules.\n\nOption B, while better than A, still involves providing some legal information, which could be interpreted as advice and potentially create issues.\n\nOption C seems plausible but is incorrect. Even if there's no apparent conflict with John's interests, giving specific legal advice to Lisa could still create an unintended attorney-client relationship or lead to misunderstandings about Sarah's role.\n\nThe safest and most ethical course of action is for Sarah to simply advise Lisa to seek her own legal counsel, avoiding any risk of creating an attorney-client relationship or providing advice that could be misinterpreted or create conflicts."

Copyright is automatic (in most places), but there is a formal process if you want. Copyright happens the moment that the work is created. In the US, if you want to sue somebody for copyright infringement, you have to register your copyright, but you still have one regardless of registration. \n\nModifying the video is a derivative work and must be licensed/released from the original author/copyright holder.\n\nFrom [copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#register):\n\n> **When is my work protected?**  \n> \n>  Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\n> \n> \n> **Do I have to register with your office to be protected?**  \n> \n>  No. In general, registration is voluntary.

However, while the video is protected by copyright immediately, the creator (in this case, the real estate agent) cannot file a lawsuit for copyright infringement in the United States without first registering the work with the U.S. Copyright Office. This makes option B the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because formal registration is not required for copyright protection to exist. Option C is wrong because public availability doesn't negate copyright protection. Option D is false because displaying a copyright symbol is not necessary for copyright protection in the U.S., though it can be helpful in notifying others of your copyright claim."

We have explicitly said we do not authorize anyone entering our apartment without one of us being present, but this caused me to re\\-read parts of our contract related to this.\n\nThe bit I found interesting is this (emphasis mine):\n\n> To allow the Property **to be viewed** by prior mutually acceptable\n>  appointment, at reasonable times, during normal working hours and at\n>  weekends, and upon the Tenant being given at least 24 hours\u2019 notice in\n>  writing, following a request by any person who is (or is acting on\n>  behalf of) the Landlord or the Agent and who is accompanying a\n>  prospective purchaser or tenant of the Property.\n\nThe reason I found this phrasing strange is the fact a clause just above it (related to conducting repairs) specifically uses the word \"enter\":\n\n> To allow the Landlord, the Agent, any Superior Landlord, his agent,\n>  professional advisers, or authorised contractors to **enter the Property**\n>  with or without workmen and with all necessary equipment. \\[...]\n\n* Is there any difference between \"view\\[ing the Property]\" and \"enter\\[ing] the Property\" in this case? Or, more directly, why would they use different wording in two adjacent clauses?\n* The only requirement for a viewing seems to be a \"prior mutually acceptable appointment\" and, unlike the clause about repairs, it includes no subclauses related to when we are *required* to allow someone to enter. This seems to imply that, in theory, we could just keep not being able to find an agreeable time and they wouldn't be able to show our apartment to prospective tenants at all, which doesn't seem right. Am I missing something here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Without hunting through case law, \"viewing a property\" would probably be given its normal English usage \\- that is inspecting a property with the object of determining if you want to make an offer to lease or buy it. It would encompass all the normal things that this involves so it goes beyond merely looking at it \\- pest inspections, building inspections, valuations etc would all be involved.\n\nYes, you are missing something: you have an obligation under the contract to act reasonably \\- this is implicit in every contract, however, it *can* be explicitly excluded. A court would find that \"we could just keep not being able to find an agreeable time\" is unreasonable behaviour and that you are in breach of your contract.",

The legal interpretation provided emphasizes that there is an implicit obligation in every contract for parties to act reasonably, unless explicitly excluded. This means that even though the clause about viewings doesn't specify consequences for not agreeing to appointments, tenants are expected to cooperate reasonably with viewing requests. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the interpretation suggests that \"viewing\" would encompass normal activities associated with inspecting a property, which would likely include entering it.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because consistently failing to agree on a time would likely be considered unreasonable behavior and a breach of contract.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the agreement clearly states that viewings require prior mutually acceptable appointments and 24 hours' notice.\n\nAnswer D correctly captures the implicit contractual obligation to act reasonably, which applies even when not explicitly stated in the contract."

In some states, though (for example Minnesota), there is a board in charge of the process (made up, in Minnesota, of the Governor, Chief Justice and Attorney General).

Pennies, being U.S. coins, are legal tender \"for all debts\" according to 31 U.S.C. 5103. Despite the inconvenience, John must accept this as satisfaction of the debt if offered.\n\nC) While gold and silver have intrinsic value, they are not considered legal tender for debt satisfaction in the United States.

Your concern is not whether you are responsible, but are you liable? It depends on the details of your arrangement with the client. If you have a contract with them that specifies that you will keep their stuff secure against attacks and that you will make regular backups, then you probably are liable. If the contract says that the client is responsible for backups and security, they you probably aren't liable. You also need to look for disclaimer clauses in the contract; and in addition there is this third party, Wordpress. It's not actually clear from your description in what way this is \"his website\" and not yours (sort of provided as a gift). What exactly is he paying for, and what are you paying for (and who pays who)? What does seem to be the case is that you have a continuing relationship with the client in terms of this site, that is, you didn't just write code and drop it off for him to deal with. That can imply a broader duty to \"take care\" of the client.\n\nIf I get hacked, I would sue the hackers. But if I can't find the hackers, I might sue the host company if they were negligent (in knowingly allowing this potential for exploit to persist) \u2013 assuming I have some kind of legal relationship with them (i.e. a contract). But there might be some kind of \"we're not liable for anything\" clause, or maybe I contracted with you and you contracted with them. In which case I would sue you, in which case it comes down what you promised to do, and whether you were negligent in what you did do. It's not an unreasonable assumption that you should have made a backup copy. A lawyer would need to scrutinize the facts, but applying the sniff test to what you describe, I'd say that you can fix his problem, refund the money, or hire an attorney.",

The documentation emphasizes that liability depends on the details of the arrangement, such as whether the contract specifies responsibilities for security and backups. If the contract states that the firm is responsible for keeping the site secure and making regular backups, they may be liable. Conversely, if the contract places these responsibilities on the client, the firm may not be liable. The answer also considers the possibility of disclaimer clauses and the nature of the ongoing relationship between the firm and the client. Options A and B are incorrect because they make absolute statements without considering the contract terms. Option D is incorrect because it places an unrealistic burden on the firm and doesn't align with the contract-centric approach described in the documentation."

Similarly, [according to this source](https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/linking-copyrighted-materials): \"No court has ever found that deep linking to another website constitutes copyright or trademark infringement.\"\n\nThe [same source](https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/linking-copyrighted-materials) cautions, however, that: \"Contributory copyright infringement occurs by \"intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement\" of a copyrighted work. *Metro\\-Goldwyn\\-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd*, 545 U.S. 913 (2005\\).\" It goes on to explain that:\n\n> Fred vonLohman gives the following rules of thumb to help avoid\n> contributory copyright infringement (specifically with reference to\n> embedding videos):\"(1\\) don't embed videos that are obviously\n> infringing, and (2\\) consider removing embedded videos once you've been\n> notified by a copyright owner that they are infringing.\"\n> \n> \n> Relatedly, you may be able to protect yourself against claims of\n> contributory copyright infringement by complying with the\n> notice\\-and\\-takedown procedures of the DMCA.\n\nThe exception to the rule would be when the link is an act in furtherance of a larger conspiracy in which the person posting the link plays a part.\n\nFor example, suppose that you enter into an SEO (search engine optimization) partnership with a firm that streams illegal child pornography on a pay per view or advertising revenue basis, and you agree to post links to the illegal site in exchange for money compensation as part of an overall plan to promote the illegal content. In that circumstance, you could have criminal and civil liability for the underlying illegal conduct as a co\\-conspirator with the operator of the site engaged in illegal streaming.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are a random third\\-party who, with no communication or coordinating with the website streaming the illegal content, who posts a link to its existence gratuitously, this would not give rise to civil or criminal liability.\n\nIt isn't entirely clear, however, that contributory copyright infringement needs to rise to the level of full on civil or criminal conspiracy to give rise to liability if you are well aware of the infringement, although there are basically no cases actually imposing liability in that very bare bones fact pattern.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A popular streaming website, StreamMaster, is known to host copyrighted content without permission. John, a blogger, decides to post a link to StreamMaster on his blog for a 24-hour period during a major sporting event. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's potential legal liability?\n\nA) John is definitely committing copyright infringement by posting the link, regardless of his intent or knowledge of StreamMaster's illegal content.\n\nB) John cannot be held liable for any copyright infringement as long as he removes the link within 24 hours.\n\nC) John may be at risk of contributory copyright infringement if he knows StreamMaster hosts illegal content and intentionally posts the link to encourage infringement.\n\nD) John has no risk of legal liability whatsoever, as posting links to other websites is always protected under U.S. law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate based on the provided information. While generally linking to websites doesn't create legal liability, there are exceptions. If John knows StreamMaster hosts illegal content and intentionally posts the link to encourage infringement, he could be at risk of contributory copyright infringement. The documentation mentions that \"Contributory copyright infringement occurs by 'intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement' of a copyrighted work.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply posting a link doesn't automatically constitute copyright infringement. Option B is incorrect because the time frame of the link being up doesn't guarantee protection from liability if the intent is to encourage infringement. Option D is too absolute; while linking is generally protected, there are exceptions, especially when it comes to knowingly promoting illegal content."

After the first year the employee may continue working for the company, until terminated, as an at will employee (For simplicity, let\u2019s assume the contract explicitly contains a starting and ending date so there is no ambiguity as to the expiration of the contract).\n\nThe contract also specifies under what circumstances the employee maybe terminated and a specific protocol the company must follow to terminate the employee (for example, giving a certain number of days advance notice). Contract also contains a binding arbitration provision.\n\nSuppose the employee continues working for the firm for another 3 years after the initial one year term ends.\n\nAfter four years, the firm fires the employee. The employee argues that the company did not follow the termination protocol outlined in the contract and wishes to compel arbitration whereas the firm wishes to litigate the case in court.\n\nThe firm argues that it is no longer bound to arbitration since the contract (which contains the arbitration clause) was only binding during the first year and has thus expired.\n\nAlthough the employee agrees that the contract expired in a general sense he argues that the part of the contract that governs how the employee must be terminated is still governed by the contract. Although the employee acknowledges that the general agreement to arbitrate no longer exists (for example, if the employee sustains an injury on the job after the first year the employee would agree that the firm is not bound to arbitration) since the termination protocol clearly arise from the contract, the employee argues, the firm is still bound to arbitrate this specific dispute.\n\nWhat case precedent can be applied to this case (especially in NJ)?\n\nIs a firm required to arbitrate disputes arising after a contract expires if the contract specifically contains provisions that govern the phase of the employment after it expires?\n\nNote: The above scenario hypothetical. It is only intended to help illustrate the essence of the question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is a firm required to arbitrate disputes arising after the expiration of employment contract?\n\nThe wording of this question is problematic. From your description it is doubtful that the contract truly expired at the end of the first year. It is valid for a contract to encompass multiple phases with different provisions specific to each phase.\n\nProviding that \"*\\[a]fter the first year the employee may continue working for the company, until terminated, as an at will employee*\" is different from expiration of the contract at the end of the first year. The contract simply outlined what happens before and after that point in time. The employer's allegation that the contract expired at the end of the first year is inconsistent with outlining in that same contract the nature of the parties' continued relation after the first year. Said nature of the employment relation should have been outlined in a separate contract in order to preempt an interpretation of there being one same/ongoing contract.\n\nThe employer's allegation is vague and untenable also in a scenario where the employer terminates the employee within the first year. The employer's allegation seemingly implies that the employee's deadline for arbitration proceedings expires at the end of the first year. That would give the employer the opportunity to evade the arbitration clause by choosing a timing that *de facto* prevents its employee from enforcing the clause.\n\nQuestions regarding arbitration are unanswerable without knowing the exact terms of the relevant clause(s). Just like the contract provides a transition from *fixed term* employment to *at will* employment, it is possible \\-\\-but not necessarily the case\\-\\- that the arbitration provision is applicable only to some of the phases that the contract encompasses.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An employee is hired under a one-year contract that includes provisions for at-will employment after the first year, a specific termination protocol, and an arbitration clause. After working for four years, the employee is fired and claims the termination protocol wasn't followed. The company argues it's no longer bound by arbitration as the contract expired after one year. Which of the following statements is most likely correct?\n\nA) The arbitration clause is no longer valid because the contract explicitly expired after one year.\n\nB) The arbitration clause remains valid only for disputes arising from the first year of employment.\n\nC) The arbitration clause is likely still enforceable for disputes related to termination, as the contract outlined post-first-year employment terms.\n\nD) The arbitration clause is only enforceable if both parties agree to it after the first year.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the contract, despite specifying a one-year term, also outlined provisions for employment beyond that period. This suggests that the contract didn't truly \"expire\" after one year but rather transitioned into a different phase of employment. The termination protocol and arbitration clause related to this post-first-year phase would likely still be considered part of the ongoing contractual agreement. The employer's argument that the entire contract expired after one year is inconsistent with the contract's own provisions for continued employment. Therefore, it's most likely that the arbitration clause would still be enforceable for disputes related to termination, as this was a specific provision outlined in the original contract for the post-first-year employment period."

These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* The case is a low priority so resources are devoted elsewhere, and no one ever gets back around to dealing with it.\n* The case may implicate another ongoing undercover operation which the arrest would disrupt.\n* It is likely that if the police wait that they will be able to bring much more serious charges, when the conduct they have evidence for is not as serious if they wait and monitor the suspect for future criminal conduct or leads to more serious past conduct. For example, the police may only have evidence of a single incident of harassment but may think that if they wait and watch that they may get evidence of extortion or attempted murder.\n* There is a concern that prosecuting immediately would lead to community uproar that would undermine community safety or impair police operations generally. In the same vein, public opinion might produce a tainted or unfavorable jury if charges were pressed now, but the jury might be less likely to have pre\\-existing opinions or to consider the case a hot button issue once publicity around an incident has died off.\n* The police may intentionally be exercising discretion not to press charges because it seems unjust to do so, or the perpetrator had some justification, or otherwise deserves a second chance.\n* Pre\\-charge negotiations might be ongoing between prosecutors and defense counsel.\n* The perpetrator already faces more serious charges that are highly likely to result in his incarceration and the new charges would be served concurrently and not add to his sentence, so pressing charges is not a priority.\n* There are doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence or there is a belief that more evidence may be obtained soon (and nobody bothers to check back and try to press the case when that potential lead doesn't pan out).\n* A modest delay in pressing charges for any number of reasons causes a witness to become unavailable or evidence to be lost.\n\nGenerally speaking, law enforcement has wide discretion to decide which cases to focus on and try to have prosecuted, and which cases the leave be. No law enforcement agency has the resources to prosecute (with prosecuting attorney assistance) every possible case that they could prove.",

Interestingly, [we also have specific protection against foreign libel judgments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPEECH_Act), so I'll just be focusing on American law.\n\nOn the other hand, [it does happen](http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/law-order-faces-a-case-of-libel-in-fiction) (NB: In New York, the \"State Supreme Court\" is the *lowest* court in the state). For our purposes, here is the most relevant paragraph:\n\n> Mr. Batra filed his lawsuit under a doctrine known as libel\\-in\\-fiction. To win his case, he must demonstrate that the identities of the real and fictional characters \u201cmust be so complete that the defamatory material\u201d becomes a \u201cplausible aspect\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s real life, Justice Shafer wrote in her ruling, quoting case law.\n\nIt seems to me that a composite character could not pass that test. But it's less clear to me that this standard is in use across the entire US (what case is the judge quoting from?). And frankly, you don't really want to be in court arguing over this sort of thing unless you're very clearly in the right. In this case, NBC has already lost, because they now need to go through discovery and probably a full trial. That's expensive. (Actually, this happened back in 2008, but I haven't been able to find any further information about this case via cursory Googling. I imagine they quietly settled, but I can't confirm that. If anyone has a more recent link, it would really help.)\n\nI found that link in [this blog post](http://www.rightsofwriters.com/2010/12/could-i-be-liable-for-libel-in-fiction.html), which seems to be very detailed and well\\-referenced. I would suggest consulting it for further information.\n\nIf you look at the copyright page of a book, you may see a [notice](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsAWorkOfFiction) like this one:\n\n> This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents either are products of the author\u2019s imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.\n\nI find it rather hard to believe you can actually disclaim liability with a notice buried in part of the book which no one reads (unlike contract law, the reader never explicitly \"agrees\" to this disclaimer), but it probably doesn't hurt.\n\n**In short**: Talk to your publisher, your editor, and their lawyer(s). They've dealt with this issue before and have a vested interest in helping you. If you're self\\-publishing, it's probably a good idea to discuss this and other legal issues (such as copyright registration) with a lawyer, since doing all those things by yourself can get rather complicated.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a libel-in-fiction case in the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of composite characters?\n\nA) Composite characters provide complete protection against libel claims, as they cannot be tied to a single real person.\n\nB) The use of composite characters automatically signals that a work is fiction, preventing any libel claims.\n\nC) Composite characters likely reduce the risk of a successful libel claim, as it's harder to prove a \"complete\" identity match.\n\nD) Composite characters have no impact on libel-in-fiction cases, as courts only consider the content of the statements.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, composite characters likely reduce the risk of a successful libel claim in fiction. This is because, according to the cited court ruling, to win a libel-in-fiction case, the plaintiff must demonstrate that \"the identities of the real and fictional characters must be so complete that the defamatory material becomes a plausible aspect of the plaintiff's real life.\" \n\nUsing composite characters makes it more difficult to establish this \"complete\" identity match, as the fictional character draws elements from multiple real people. This doesn't provide absolute protection (option A is incorrect), nor does it automatically signal fiction (B is incorrect). The impact of composite characters is relevant in these cases, contrary to option D.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this doesn't guarantee protection against lawsuits, and the specific standards may vary across jurisdictions. The question also highlights the complexity of libel-in-fiction cases and the importance of seeking legal advice when dealing with such issues in writing."

If this law is passed in December 2023, for which tax year would it first apply?\n\nA) The 2023 tax year, as the law was proposed and passed in 2023\nB) The 2024 tax year, as it's the first full year after the law's passage\nC) The 2025 tax year, due to Norway's constitutional provisions\nD) It would apply retroactively to the 2022 tax year to maximize government revenue\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C) The 2025 tax year, due to Norway's constitutional provisions. This is based on two key points from Norway's constitution:\n\n1. Article 75 states that taxes \"shall not, however, remain operative beyond 31 December of the succeeding year, unless they are expressly renewed by a new Storting.\" This means that tax laws passed in one year cannot take effect until at least the year after the next.\n\n2. Article 97 explicitly prohibits retroactive laws: \"No law must be given retroactive effect.\"\n\nGiven these provisions, a tax law passed in December 2023 could not apply to the 2023 tax year (which would be filed in 2024), nor to the 2024 tax year. The earliest it could take effect would be for the 2025 tax year.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it would violate the prohibition on retroactive laws. Option B is incorrect because it doesn't account for the constitutional provision about taxes not remaining operative beyond the succeeding year. Option D is incorrect because it would be a clear violation of the prohibition on retroactive laws."

Judge ruled complainant has no standing](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18603/no-probable-cause-found-in-nj-for-citizen-complaint-of-official-misconduct-by-ch)*\n\nI forget the exact terminology, but the judge essentially said that the citizen complainant's \"proximity\" to the crime was too far removed to be substantially injured by it. He therefore had no standing to bring forth the complaint, forcing a determination of no probable cause.\n\nHere is the beginning of the [NJ Official Misconduct statute](https://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/criminal/charges/offmisc1.pdf):\n\n> A public servant is guilty of official misconduct when, with purpose to obtain a benefit for himself or another or to injure or to deprive another of a benefit:\n> \n> \n> a. He commits an act relating to his office but constituting an unauthorized exercise of his official functions, knowing that such act is unauthorized or he is committing such act in an unauthorized manner; or\n> \n> \n> b. He knowingly refrains from performing a duty which is imposed upon him by law or is clearly inherent in the nature of his office.\n\nand here is the the Citizen's Complaint rule (7\\.2\\.a.1, on page 4 of [this document](https://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/rule_7_2.pdf)):\n\n> 7:2\\-2\\. Issuance of Complaint\\-Warrant (CDR\\-2\\) or Summons\n> \n> \n> (a) Authorization for Process\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Citizen Complaint. A Complaint\\-Warrant (CDR\\-2\\) or a summons charging any offense made by a private citizen may be issued only by a judge or, if authorized by the judge, by a municipal court administrator or deputy court administrator of a court with jurisdiction in the municipality where the offense is alleged to have been committed within the statutory time limitation. The complaint\\-warrant (CDR\\-2\\) or summons may be issued only if it appears to the judicial officer from the complaint, affidavit, certification or testimony that there is probable cause to believe that an offense was committed, the defendant committed it, and a Complaint\\-Warrant (CDR\\-2\\) or summons can be issued. The judicial officer's finding of probable cause shall be noted on the face of the summons or warrant and shall be confirmed by the judicial officer's signature issuing the Complaint\\-Warrant (CDR\\-2\\) or summons. If, however, the municipal court administrator or deputy court administrator finds that no probable cause exists to issue a Complaint\\-Warrant (CDR\\-2\\) or summons, or that the applicable statutory time limitation to issue the Complaint\\-Warrant (CDR\\-2\\) or summons has expired, that finding shall be reviewed by the judge. A judge finding no probable cause to believe that an offense occurred or that the statutory time limitation to issue a Complaint\\-Warrant (CDR\\-2\\) or summons has expired shall dismiss the complaint.\n\nAs best I understand it, proximity does not seem to be addressed in the Citizen's Complaint rule at all.\n\nRegarding the Official Misconduct statute, it seems to say that the misconduct itself is the crime, not the criminal actions underneath it. This would imply that all citizens are equally injured by the misconduct, so long as they were under the official\u2019s jurisdiction. In the case of the state Port Authority, this means every New Jersey citizen.\n\nIf, alternatively, the specific crimes underlying the misconduct is what's most important, then only a select few citizens would be substantially injured by it. The crime was mainly the extortion of United Airlines for a custom weekly flight in exchange for a new hangar at Newark International Airport; implying a very small percentage of NJ citizens were personally injured.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n* Does the official misconduct statute refer to the underlying criminal activities or simply \"the act of misconduct\"? (This is [somewhat answered](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/18604/4295) in the original question)\n* Given the context of a probable cause determination as brought forth by a citizen complaint.... Where in these two rules (or elsewhere) is \"proximity\" defined as a characteristic that should be a deciding factor for standing?\n\nNote that [Common Law was abolished](http://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2013/title-2c/section-2c-1-5/) in New Jersey [in 1979](http://www.hoffmandimuzio.com/blog/crime-and-punishment-how-new-jersey-defines-the-seriousness-of-crimes-and-their-penalties/).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your questions are premised on two assumptions:\n\n1. \"all citizens are equally injured by the misconduct, so long as they were under the official\u2019s jurisdiction\", and\n2. \"Common Law was abolished in New Jersey in 1979\"\n\n**These are both *false*!**\n\n**False assumption 1: equal damage**\n\nThe onus is on the plaintiff or complainant to prove to the court that they have standing to bring their claim. That is that they have (or will be) sufficiently damaged by the wrongful act that the court should spend its time hearing their claim.\n\nWe will use the referenced case as an example, as I understand it the official corruptly received a benefit in the form of the creation of a new air route in order to permit United Airlines to build a hanger at Newark Airport. \n\nIt should be obvious on the face of it that United Airlines and Newark Airport were both affected more than \"all citizens\". The Architects, Engineers and Construction workers who were delayed in working on the hanger were also more affected. All of these people word have a greater chance of having [standing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_(law)) then a generic citizen.\n\nNow, some citizens of New Jersey, specifically those who took advantage of the new air route (including but not limited to the corrupt official) *benefited* from the misconduct: they would not have standing as they were not damaged. \n\nThat is not to say that a broad class of people who are each individually affected slightly but as a group are substantially affected cannot have standing. [KELSEY CASCADIA ROSE JULIANA et al v UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, et al](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/571d109b04426270152febe0/t/5824e85e6a49638292ddd1c9/1478813795912/Order+MTD.Aiken.pdf) being a case on point.\n\n**Common law was *not* abolished in New Jersey: common law *crimes* were**\n\n[Common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) is still going strong in New Jersey: I can sue for the tort of negligence, trespass and deceit, I can seek equitable remedies like an injunction and estoppel and I can also sue for breach of contract. \n\nHowever, I cannot be prosecuted for the common law crime of murder which was inherited from the English common law crime: I have to be prosecuted for the statutory crime of murder detailed in [NJ Rev Stat \u00a7 2C:11\\-3 (2013\\)](http://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2013/title-2c/section-2c-11-3/) and the case law that it has generated. \n\nIn ye olden days, there was no Act of Parliament that made murder a crime: it was a crime under the common law of England which became the common law of New Jersey (I know that the US Constitution *specifically* preserved common law and I would not be surprised if New Jersey's did as well). This common law crime can trace its roots back to the thirteenth century and even earlier into Anglo\\-Saxon law \\- the King didn't make it illegal, it just was, and the courts decided what the punishment should be (death usually). \n\nIn 1979, the New Jersey legislature decided to codify their crimes and *as a starting point* they abolished all the common law crimes (not just murder) and wrote down, nice and succinctly, what a murder is , what defenses there are for doing it and what the punishment should be. Now doubt this was informed by the 700 years of common law history about that crime and the current state of case law around it but it probably also simplified and streamlined the law (we hope).\n\n**The abolition of common law crimes has *zero* impact on the common law of standing.**",

While common law crimes were replaced with statutory crimes, other aspects of common law, including principles of standing, remain in effect. The statement that all citizens are equally injured by official misconduct is incorrect, as the degree of injury can vary significantly among different individuals or groups. Standing is still a relevant and important concept in New Jersey law, including cases of official misconduct. The correct answer emphasizes that the abolition of common law crimes specifically did not impact the common law principles of standing."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When paying for software, the EULA often contains the clause \"This software is licensed, not sold.\" I'm confused on what this clause actually means regarding one's ownership of the software. I have heard two possible interpretations of this clause:\n\n1. You own the copy of software that you paid for but you don't own the copyright to it. This is the same kind of ownership you have over a book you buy at the book store. Among other things, the first sale doctrine would apply to your copy of the software. However, you can't produce new copies and sell them as you don't own the copyright. This is the interpretation expressed at 10:30 into [this video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tUAX0gnZ3Nw).\n2. You don't even own the copy of software you paid for. You are being granted limited, controlled permission to use this software. As you don't have ownership rights over it, among other things, the first sale doctrine would not apply. This interpretation is expressed in [this post](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3515/why-is-it-legal-to-give-away-for-free-a-physical-copy-of-copyrighted-material-th/3516#3516) on the site.\n\nWhich interpretation is valid?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Choice 2 is what the writers of the license have in mind. You own the physical media on which the copy is delivered, such as a DVD or floppy disk (if there was physical media). But you do not own the copy of the software, you merely have purchased a license to use it, which may be revocable under specified circumstances.\n\nThis is different from the law in the case of a book. Why you buy a book, you own a copy of the book, although you do **not** own the copyright to the book, and may not make additional copies.\n\nThe license model was adopted by commercial software distributors for several reasons, but largely to avoid the \"first sale doctrine\". When you buy a copy of a copyrighted work, you have the right (under US law at least) to lend, rent, sell, or give\\-away that copy. You do not need the permission of the copyright holder to do any of these. Those in the commercial software business did not want customers to be able to do those things legally. By making the software subject to a license, which is a contract, they could write that license to restrict or prohibit those rights. \n\nSellers also wanted to prohibit reverse engineering of the software, and to restrict use of the software. (For example, to limit the user to installing it on a single computer.)\n\nThere was at first much dispute over the enforcability of such license agreements. But most US courts now accept them as valid and enforceable, and copyright law has been modified to take account of them. Specifically, 17 USC 109 (2\\)(b)(1\\)(A) seems to include a legislative acceptance of this rule.",

What is the primary legal implication of this clause?\n\nA) The user owns the physical media but not the copyright to the software.\nB) The user has full ownership rights over their copy of the software, including the right to resell it.\nC) The user is granted limited permission to use the software without ownership rights, avoiding the first sale doctrine.\nD) The user owns the copy of the software in the same way they would own a purchased book.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The clause \"This software is licensed, not sold\" is primarily used to avoid the first sale doctrine and limit users' rights. It means that users don't own the copy of the software they paid for, but instead are granted limited, controlled permission to use it. This allows software companies to restrict activities like reselling, lending, or renting the software, which would otherwise be permitted under the first sale doctrine if the software were sold like a book.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while users may own the physical media, the clause goes beyond just distinguishing between owning the media and the copyright.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it contradicts the purpose of the licensing model, which is to limit ownership rights.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the licensing model for software is specifically designed to be different from the ownership model that applies to books."

The parents of the girl give pre\\-approval for the couple to marry when she is age 16, and in a state that allows a minor to marry at age 16 with parents approval. In other words, everything is on the \"up and up\" as far as legality.\n\nThe main question is how is the man supposed to \"test\\-drive\" his wife to be, since she is still a minor? I suspect it would be legal for them to sex AFTER they are married, but I suspect not before. I have a problem with that law because that is like saying you have to buy a car without test driving it and that is risky. Would they be allowed to date but not engage in sex? For example, if they went to a movie together hand in hand and a cop saw them maybe in the theater lobby all cuddly, could he do anything about them like ask her age?\n\nSuppose they couldn't wait and \"cheated\" 1 day before they were married. Could the man go to prison for that but if he had waited until his wedding night he would be fine? Something doesn't seem quite right here. They might be saying a married minor CAN give consent but an unmarried one cannot. But what if they are engaged and only a short time away from marriage. Why is there no stipulation in the law for that? What if they find out later they are not sexually compatible then it is \"too late\". Allowing the \"test drive\" could help solve that problem. Perhaps they would need some special court paperwork to allow a \"pre\\-consummation\" perhaps no more than 3 months before their intended wedding date and only if the younger person is at least already age 16\\.\n\nI understand the law is to help protect young girls from pregnancy, and I feel the minimum age should be about 17 or whatever the data shows is the youngest age that their bodies can handle the stress of childbirth. Perhaps even \"pad\" (pun intended) it with an extra year just to be \"safe\" so age 18\\.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The law does not recognize marital test\\-drive rights. I assume you are speaking of the US (you said \"state\"). If sex between a 15 year old and a 40 year old is illegal outside of marriage (I have not done a 50 state survey, but I assume it is illegal), then it is illegal until the couple are legally married. Generally, any sex with a minor is a crime, but \"Romeo and Juliet\" clauses were enacted specifically to cover the case of two teens having sex when the parties are \"close enough\" in age (as defined by the state's law). As far as I know, no state has a law that sets age of consent at 15 ([Wiki sez so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_the_United_States#State_laws)). This BTW holds of adult females and juvenile males, as well.\nThe law does provide a sort of lemon\\-law: divorce.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently signed a one year lease for an apartment that came almost completely furnished as it was previously a short\\-term rental unit. Prior to moving in the landlord stated that we could use whatever we wanted and that they would remove the unused items. Some of the stuff is great and I am very happy to use it (TV, full bedroom set) but some items I specified I would not be using (I have my own mattress and have no need for another). Additionally, there is a large closet area that was filled with chairs, an additional mattress, and other various pieces of furniture that the landlord mentioned would be removed.\n\nOn move in, only a table had been removed from the kitchen area. My roommates had moved the mattresses/other undesirable furniture to the storage closet so it is now completely filled with items that we do not want in the apartment. I have emailed the landlord twice, asking what to do with the items and if there is a plan to remove them but have not received a response.\n\nThere is no reference in the lease to use of the storage space or the apartment being furnished, only that the \"Tenant takes the Apartment **as is**\".\n\nI am planning on going to their office to see if they have simply been too busy up until now. I would like to remain on good terms with the landlord as they have been helpful and the apartment is rather nice, but there simply is not enough space for us to store unused furniture. If they do not agree to remove the furniture from the apartment, am I allowed to remove the furniture myself?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Stuff done \u201cprior to signing\u201d is unenforceable1\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe contract says \u201cas is, so as is it is.\n\nIf you want to use the closet, providing you move and store the stuff safely (e.g. by hiring a storage locker at your expense or keeping it in your dad\u2019s garage) and return it at the end of the lease, you can do that.\n\n1 subject to some very narrow, technical doctrines which don\u2019t seem applicable.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant signs a one-year lease for a furnished apartment. The landlord verbally agreed before signing to remove unwanted furniture, but didn't do so. The lease states the tenant takes the apartment \"as is\" with no mention of furnishings. What is the tenant's best legal option regarding the unwanted furniture?\n\nA) The tenant can legally dispose of the furniture since the landlord broke their verbal agreement\nB) The tenant must keep all furniture in the apartment as specified by the \"as is\" clause\nC) The tenant can safely store the furniture elsewhere at their own expense, returning it at the end of the lease\nD) The tenant can withhold rent until the landlord removes the unwanted furniture\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, verbal agreements made prior to signing the lease are generally unenforceable. The lease's \"as is\" clause takes precedence. However, the tenant has the right to use the apartment, including storage spaces. They can move and safely store the unwanted furniture at their own expense, as long as they return it at the end of the lease. Options A and D would likely violate the lease terms. Option B is overly restrictive and doesn't account for the tenant's right to use the entire rented space."
