Both are now deceased. My grandmother survived both of them until Jan 2019\\. \n\nIn the state of Pennsylvania, there is a specific Intestate Succession that dictates grandchildren come before Siblings in inheritance.\n\nI filled out beneficiary paperwork and submitted to MetLife, and spoke with MetLife several times by phone. \n\nI was told by MetLife that in the case of pre\\-deceased Beneficiaries MetLife applies Federal inheritance law, thus Siblings come before: Will statements or Intestate Succession. \n\nWe have an Estate open as well as an original Will. The only mentioned of any Sibling inheritance was only for a sister I really know of that is also now deceased. \n\nI told MetLife I cannot legally confirm if my grandma has other siblings although there is a lady that started coming around when my grandma became ill that said she was her sister.\n\nI am concerned some unwelcome Siblings or \u201csister\u201d are going to inherit this Life Insurance totally undeserving because of MetLife whack policy. And my grandma is not here to defend herself, so I am doing all I can. \n\nIs there anything MetLife is doing that is not kosher?\n\nDo I have any rights in state law that can override their \u201cFederal\u201d rules.\n\nAny other tactics or thoughts that I can look at to help remedy this?\n\nI am calling their records dept on Monday to request documents that provide my grandmas signature stating the PA Succession is overridden and she agreed to that when the policy was opened. Not sure if they will provide. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Benefits from life insurance can go directly to a named beneficiary: there can be primary and secondary beneficiaries, and co\\-beneficiaries. If all of the primary beneficiaries are all dead, the company will check on the secondary beneficiaries. If there are no surviving secondary beneficiaries, the benefits go to the estate and are subject to probate. If a person is not specifically named as a beneficiary, the insurance company does not get involved in figuring out who gets the money. So then, as part of the estate, the benefit (and anything else) would go to whoever the state's intestacy laws dictate. Collateral heirs (sibling, parents, aunts, grandparents) are elegible only if there are no surviving descendants.\n\nIf (as it appears) this is not regular life insurance but rather an [ERISA\\-regulated employment benefit](https://www.buchanandisability.com/helpful-resourcesandarticles/how-to-tell-if-an-insurance-claim/), the situation changes. That law explicitly supersedes all state laws related to employee benefit plan. However, it explicitly does not supersede state law pertaining to insurance. One path would be to make the insurer prove in court that this is an ERISA plan (the burden is on the insurer, *Zavora v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.*, 145 F.3d 1118\\). If it is an ERISA plan, then you have to get a lawyer to challenge their finding. You should know that you have to submit all of the evidence to the insurance company first, and the legal presumption (\"deference\") is that the insurer is correct. There is a [very long article](https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1248&context=lawreview) which addresses the legal matter of entitlement to survivor benefits under ERISA. Nothing therein suggests that the federal government dictates an order of succession. [This report to the Sec'y. of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/about-ebsa/about-us/erisa-advisory-council/2012-current-challenges-and-best-practices-concerning-beneficiary-designations-in-retirement-and-life-insurance-plans.pdf), about beneficiary designations under ERISA, noting that \"The complexity of the rules under ERISA may, in some cases, lead to beneficiary designations that do not accurately reflect the participant\u2019s intent\". The document (which reports on common practice in the industry) notes that\n\n> If no beneficiary designation is made, the beneficiary is usually\n>  determined by the terms of the plan document. Retirement plan\n>  documents typically include default beneficiary provisions that apply\n>  in the event the retirement account owner fails to designate a\n>  beneficiary. The most common order used for a default is the current\n>  spouse, children, parents, siblings and the estate.\n\nIt is therefore possible that the *insurance company* included language in the plan that places siblings before the estate. Federal involvement could be a provision in the law that allows an insurer to specify default beneficiary provisions in case the insured's elections are deceased. (It is also possible that the insured made these elections decades ago and didn't understand the consequences of not mentioning grandchildren). Assuming that siblings precede grandchildren according to the language of the plan, then this is required by federal law in the sense that that is what the plan says, and the law requires the insurer to follow the plan (since the insured is assumed to have read and understood the plan, even though that is often not actually the case).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a situation where an ERISA-regulated life insurance policy has named beneficiaries who are deceased, and the policy holder has also passed away, what is the correct order of determining who receives the benefits?\n\nA) The insurance company must follow state intestacy laws to determine beneficiaries.\nB) The insurance company can apply their own \"Federal inheritance law\" that overrides state laws.\nC) The insurance company must follow the specific beneficiary designation order outlined in the plan document.\nD) The insurance company must automatically distribute the benefits to the estate for probate.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect.

While this may happen if there are no surviving named beneficiaries and no default provisions in the plan, it's not the automatic first step.\n\nThe key point is that ERISA plans must follow their own documented rules, which may include a default beneficiary order.

Based on the case law cited in Eriline Co. S.A. v. Johnson, 440 F.3d 648, 653 (4th Cir. 2006), the appellate court would likely have jurisdiction to review the dismissal of the state-law claims.

You might be able to persuade them that they stand no realistic chance of winning the case, by proving that the alleged wrong was committed by a person acting on behalf of the program, and that you have absolutely no real connection to said program, other than being listed erroneously in a business directory. In the complaint that they file with the court, you can see what reasons they present for naming you as a defendant. They may just say that you are the president of the club. That would be something that they have to prove in court.\n\nYour denial of any connection to the club would not be sufficient, in the face of their concrete evidence that you *are* the president, so you would need to muster more\\-powerful evidence to refute their claim. The obvious best way to do that is to provide more persuasive evidence that Bill Jones is the president, and has been for 5 years.\n\nThe procedure, if you are sued or have good reason to think that you are about to be sued, is that you hire an attorney who will attempt to persuade the attorney that they made a mistake in naming you as defendant, that you have no connection at all to the club; and if they cannot persuade them to amend the complain, he will defend you (filing an appropriate motion).\n\nIn the realm of preemptive actions, you could also contact the directory and get them to voluntarily change the entry.

The Terms of Service and AUP state clearly that they are not to access the server or data contained within without a work authorization or valid legal request.\n\nThey also provide an internet connection to said servers, as well as several public IP addresses for use on these servers.\n\nThrough testing and diagnosis, I have determined (and their support team has confirmed) the existance of a device that intercepts outgoing SMTP traffic from said servers. This device acts as a man in the middle device, and rewrites said traffic to strip out the STARTTLS ESMTP capability (i.e. disables encryption), meaning that all ougoing email communications are either unencrypted, or fail (if encryption is set to be required).\n\nTheir reasoning for the presence of such a device is to prevent abuse of their network.\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2510 defines a wiretap device as such:\n\n> 5\\.\n>  \"electronic, mechanical, or other device\" means any device or apparatus which can be used to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication other than\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof,  \n> \n>  (i) furnished to the subscriber or user by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of its business and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business or furnished by such subscriber or user for connection to the facilities of such service and used in the ordinary course of its business; or  \n> \n>  (ii) being used by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of its business, or by an investigative or law enforcement officer in the ordinary course of his duties;\n\nThis leads to two questions:\n\n1. Does the usage of this device fall under the classification of \"ordinary course of its business,\" given that it is not providing email service, but internet service?\n2. If not, does such action constitute illegal wiretap, or is there some other law or regulation that makes such action legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The hosting provider could indeed argue that disabling encryption of your SMTP to protect their network does fall under the category of \"being used...in the ordinary course of its business\". They are also \"the provider of electronic communication\", both of which give them a huge argument of immunity granted by section 5(a)(2\\).\n\n> 5. other than\u2014 \n>  (a)(ii) being used by a provider of wire or electronic\n>  communication service in the ordinary course of its business, or by an\n>  investigative or law enforcement officer in the ordinary course of his\n>  duties;\n\nIt would be on you to prove that deencrypting your data in this way is not ordinary in the course of its business. This of course would likely be very difficult, though not impossible depending on how its argued. \n\nIf your contract does state that \"they are not to access the server or data contained within without a work authorization or valid legal request\", then you could argue that they are indeed technically breaking the contract. Intercepting your SMTP emails and deencrypting them is \"accessing\" data contained on the server. If they are intercepting this data, then they could easily be recording it and there is likely no way for either party to prove whether its being recorded or not. \n\nAs a result, it does seem like you could win for breach of contract. Proving wiretapping could be incredibly difficult on your end without a great legal argument. You would have to be able to show that changing your SMTP data in this way is not an ordinary practice in their business. Their initial argument would probably be that data leaving their servers is deencrypted because they want to make sure that they aren't liable for sending out illegal data, or data that could harm their business such as bulk spam emails that could cause their IP address to get banned by email providers. If that's their defense, it would be on you to prove why this deencryption method of theirs is not \"ordinary\".\n\nI think your best argument is the breaking of the contract. As they are indeed accessing your data through interception and deencryption. Their perception of this clause is probably that they won't login to your servers and read your files, code and software. It's considered normal practice for hosting providers and telecommunications companies to be able to read all outbound traffic that is leaving their servers. For them to be deencrypting your code, they either figured out how to crack your encryption on their own, or they accessed your servers and are deencrypting it before its sent out through their internet service, or they stole the encryption keys from your server and are deencrypting it that way. How they are successfully able to deencrypt your data could play a large role in this case, as it may be difficult to prove wrongdoing by simply reading the data sent from their servers to requests by web clients.\n\nIf you really wanted to go after wiretapping or another class under Federal law, you would have to prove that deencryption of your code is code breaking/hacking/code cracking. And that it's perfectly normal for tech companies to send encrypted data over their network (which it is). Deencryption of your data could possibly be considered illegal under various hacking laws, if you felt that you wanted to build your case around that.\n\nTo summarize my thoughts:\n\nAs far as wiretapping, the hosting provider will likely be found allowed to read data that it sends from it servers as an ordinary practice of its business. This includes encrypted data.\n\nChanging the data to a deencrypted state could be classified as hacking/code cracking.

The customer likely has a strong case for breach of contract, as the provider's actions could be seen as \"accessing\" data without authorization, violating their terms of service. However, proving illegal wiretapping would be challenging because the provider could argue their actions fall under \"ordinary course of business\" for protecting their network.

The person decides that he wants to testify in Tigrinya, so he gives his testimony in Tigrinya. He does not demand that questions be posed in Tigrinya, he simply opts to respond in Tigrinya for \"artistic\" reasons. Is there a statutory or case law basis in the US on which the court can compel him to testify in English? Various provisions whereby people who don't speak English have a right to an interpreter don't apply, since he *does* speak English. Tigrinya court interpreters are common enough that this would not impose an overwhelming burden on the court. Does the answer change if the language is Karuk, for which interpreters are unavailable? I am specifically interested in the substantive basis for the conclusion.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can you be compelled to testify in English?\n\nYes insofar as the witness's reasons for not testifying in English are merely \"artistic\".\n\nCourts allegedly procure efficiency, economy, and *ease of access*. Translation costs and the possibility of translation inaccuracies (or perhaps witness's pretenses thereof) contravene these criteria. The witness's fluency in English makes it highly doubtful that allowing him to testify in a foreign language would improve at all the ease of access to evidence. Furthermore, the witness's \"artistic reasons\" are very likely to be perceived as vexatious.\n\n[*Duha v. Agrium, Inc.*, 448 F.3d 867, 876 (2006\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/20061315448f3d86711312) points out that \"*\\[c]ases involving foreign language documents normally consider their impact and perhaps the cost of translation in the balance of convenience*\" (citing cases). Although this issue generally is a factor for deciding whether a U.S. court is *forum non conveniens*, various court decisions serve as guidance on what approach to adopt on your question.\n\nFor instance, [*Re Nine West Holdings, Inc*., (U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Apr. 2020\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/inbco20200413301) makes the remark that \"*communications between the parties were conducted in English*\", whence there seems to be no actual impediment for testimony in English. Also the \"*inconvenien\\[ce] to either party to have to litigate \\[...] in a foreign language*\", *Id.*, implicitly weakens the witness's \"artistic reasons\" for testifying in the U.S. in that foreign language. Conversely, see [*Takiguchi v. MRI International, Inc.*, (U.S. Dist.

This is based on several factors:\n\n1. Courts prioritize efficiency, economy, and ease of access to evidence.\n2.

The ruling becomes binding within the federal court system, but state courts are not obligated to follow it. The statute remains potentially enforceable in state courts until a higher authority, such as the state Supreme Court or the U.S. Supreme Court, makes a definitive ruling.\n\nOption A is incorrect because courts, including federal courts, cannot compel legislatures to repeal statutes.

This means that if user A uploads a file, and then user B uploads the same file, the file will exist only once but under two distinct aliases chosen individually by each user. This also means that if user B deletes their file (or more precisely their alias to the file), then the file will still be present in the storage service until user A also deletes it.\n\nA common sense counter\\-argument for this would be that without deduplication, in a system where each file is always distinct, if there are duplicate files then if one user requests erasure then we would not also delete all duplicates of the file which might belong to other users. Is there any reason for this to not extend to deduplicated files with aliases?\n\nAccording to section 65 of the GDPR[1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679), personal data can be kept for as long as it is needed for its intended purpose. Is the purpose that it is needed for other users to be able to access their data valid?\n\nI would really appreciate any insight on this and any good resources to further my understanding of GDPR.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think there are a couple of different ways to look at this.\n\nDeduplication is a technical detail that's irrelevant here\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile the data may be deduplicated on a technical level, the files remain logically distinct.\nIf users 1 and 2 upload identical files, and then one user edits or deletes their file, this will not affect the other user's data.\nUsers cannot tell whether their files are duplicates of someone else. From the user's perspective, it makes no difference whether or not the storage uses deduplication, except perhaps via the cost of the service.\n\nBecause there is no user\\-perceptible difference, it would be difficult to interpret some GDPR significance into this scenario.\n\nWhose personal data is it anyway?\n---------------------------------\n\nPersonal data is any information that relates to an identifiable data subject. The files here are likely to be their uploader's personal data. Thus, the uploaders would also have a right to have their uploaded files erased. In case of deduplicated storage, this would affect their logical copy.\n\nThe contents of the uploaded files might also be personal data relating to a third party. Then that third party might have a right to get the file contents erased. But this right must be invoked with the data controller for that processing activity, which might be company A, company B, or the uploaders, depending on context. Which leads us to the next aspect:\n\nCompany A is not responsible for handling erasures\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom your description, it sounds like company A is a data processor providing services on behalf of company B. In turn, B might be a processor acting on behalf of the uploaders. In any case, it seems that A would not be the data controller for these processing activities. Data subject rights like erasure must be invoked against the controller, as only the controller can understand whether such a request should be granted. The right to erasure is not absolute, and depends a lot on *why* that data is being processed. In particular:\n\nPersonal data need not be erased if it is still necessary\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, a person might very well be the data subject of some of these files, and might then ask for erasure. But if the files are being stored because they are going to be needed as evidence in legal proceedings, the data subject can't use this GDPR right to destroy evidence. The data controller would be allowed to refuse a request in such cases.\n\nIt could now happen that two different users of this deduplicated storage are storing the same file, but for entirely different purposes. Blanket deletion of all copies of a file could be quite problematic. Note that deletion is also a \"processing activity\" and needs a legal basis under the GDPR. Unexpected data loss could be a data breach. One user's erasure could be another user's reportable data breach incident.\n\nThus, I would strongly expect such requests to be handled on a logical file level, not on the deduplicated storage level.\n\nCaveat: public access and cloned files\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf the (logical) file is made available to the public who can then clone or copy this file, and if the \"original\" is taken down due to an erasure request (or copyright takedown notice), it might be appropriate to remove logical clones as well.

My idea is to use the user password to hash a salt to create a identify hash and track the user through this. Theoretically, the only way that I can return from hash identify to user is if I know his password, but it is a thing that only he know, by premise. So, it's considered anonymous or pseudonymised for GDPR?\n\\\\\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR has a fairly broad concept of what it means for a data subject to be identifiable. The details are given in Recital 26:\n\n> To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments.\n\nThe good news is that this mandates a risk\\-based approach to identifiability. You don't have to prevent re\\-identification with absolute certainty, but you must make sure that re\\-identification is not \u201creasonably likely\u201d.\n\nThe bad news is that \u201cidentify\u201d does not just mean \u201cfiguring out the real\\-world identity of the data subject\u201d, but also \u201cbeing able to single out the data subject\u201d.\n\nHashes of personal data are still personal data.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe hashed password still allows you to single out data subject, since the hash now serves as an identifier that links multiple records. Equivalently, a random ID would serve as an identifier. Depending on the information in the linked records, this could reasonably likely also allow linking to a real\\-world identity. I'll also point out that the GDPR explicitly notes that \u201conline identifiers \u2026 such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers\u201d enable profiling and identification, and are thus a kind of personal data.\n\nNote that it seems you have a user database that includes a password hash.\nThis database includes rich links between the password hash and other, more directly identifying, data. Alternatively, consider that the software that collects tracking information along with this tracking identifier would also receive other information about the data subject that could allow re\\-identification, such as the data subject's current IP address. It would be reasonably likely that such additional information could be used to identify or single out the data subject. For this analysis, it is irrelevant whether you have any *intention* of singling out users \u2013 it only matters whether, under an objective analysis, the relevant means to do so exist.\n\nRelated: EDPB thinks hashed phone numbers are personal data.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere has been recent debate by regulatory bodies on the question whether hashed phone numbers are personal data. This debate was published by the [EDPB binding decision regarding the Irish DPC's fine against WhatsApp](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/binding-decision-board-art-65/binding-decision-12021-dispute-arisen_en), which uses hashed telephone numbers to intersect user's address books. The question in the context of the fine was whether this represents processing of personal data of users who are not WhatsApp users themselves. Originally, the Irish DPC argued that such hashes were not personal data.\n\nHowever, the German, French, Portuguese, and Dutch supervisory authorities pointed out that the specific hashing approach used by WhatsApp does not provide anonymization, for example because there still is contextual information (such as the user's social graph) that would allow indirect identification (and because their hashing was pretty weak and reversible with reasonable effort). Such hashing would only be pseudonymization, not anonymization.\nThe Hungarian supervisory authority makes the argument that WhatsApp could always re\\-create the hash from the original data, thus permitting re\\-identification of the hash. This is in line with my above argument that the hash allows singling out. Again, the hash should be considered pseudonymous, not anonymous. The EDPB upheld all these objections against the Irish interpretation as \u201crelevant and reasoned\u201d, and largely agreed with their merits.\n\nSome parts of the resulting analysis are specific to issues around phone numbers, in particular that there are comparatively few phone numbers. However, a recurring point is that the hashed data cannot be viewed in isolation. It must be viewed in the context of how it is created and used, and in the context of other data that the data controller has.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIt is possible that in some cases the hash could serve as an anonymous token. But this would require careful analysis about how the hash is created and used, and about what other data you have available and could potentially link or correlate with this token. Unless you are extremely sure that there are no means that could be reasonably likely used to perform re\\-identification or singling out, you should consider such tokens to be pseudonymous data. Pseudonymization is a great security measure, but such data is still personal data. I suggest reading the [WP29 opinion 05/2014 on Anonymization Techniques (WP216\\) (PDF link)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp216_en.pdf). It predates the GDPR and is slightly outdated in both legal and technical matters, but still contains highly relevant guidance on the matter of proper anonymization in the European data protection context.\n\nAside from identifiability issues, I am concerned about using the password (or derived hashes) for anything other than authentication.

Meng*, [2020 BCSC 785](https://canlii.ca/t/j7x3n).\n\nThe authority to extradite is via the extraditing state's treaty with the U.S. and its domestic implementing legislation. In Canada, this is the *Extradition Act*. Extradition requires consent of the extraditing state and for the requesting state to follow the extraditing state's domestic procedure.\n\nThe question you raise is how sanctions of requesting state affect the interpretation of the domestic offence for the purpose of establishing the *double criminality* requirement.\n\nCritical in this case was that the charged offence was fraud against HSBC (albeit based on alleged concealment of sanctions violations).\n\nSee para. 23:\n\n> The double criminality question in the committal hearing is therefore whether Ms. Meng\u2019s alleged conduct, had it occurred in Canada, would have amounted to fraud contrary to s. 380(1\\)(a) of the Criminal Code.\n\nMs. Meng argued:\n\n> that the conduct cannot amount to fraud because in essence the proposed prosecution is to enforce US sanctions laws against Iran, measures that are not part of Canadian law and which, indeed, Canada has expressly rejected.\n\nThe Attorney General argued:\n\n> that the double criminality analysis may properly take the US sanctions into account as part of the foreign legal backdrop against which the essential conduct is to be understood.\n\nThe court agreed with the Attorney General:\n\n> The effects of the US sanctions may properly play a role in the double criminality analysis as part of the background or context against which the alleged conduct is examined.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of United States v.

While US sanctions were part of the context, they were not the key factor in meeting the double criminality requirement.\n\nB) Correct. The critical element was that the charged offense was fraud against HSBC, even though it was based on alleged concealment of sanctions violations. The court focused on whether this conduct would amount to fraud in Canada, rather than on the sanctions themselves.\n\nC) Incorrect. While the extradition treaty is important for the overall process, it wasn't the key factor in determining double criminality in this specific case.\n\nD) Incorrect. The sale of telecommunications equipment to Iran was part of the background, but not the key factor in meeting the double criminality requirement.\n\nThe court agreed with the Attorney General that the US sanctions could be considered as part of the background context, but the central issue for double criminality was whether the alleged conduct would amount to fraud under Canadian law."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64605/what-happens-if-someone-steals-an-apple-juice-from-a-supermarket", "docs_id": 64605, "title": "What happens if someone steals an apple juice from a supermarket?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to know what is the risk if someone gets caught stealing a cheap item worth $1, such as an apple juice from a supermarket.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume that you committed the crime in [nevada](/questions/tagged/nevada \"show questions tagged 'nevada'\").

I say that because [summary judgment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_56) motions often come after the discovery phase (not always, but the rule is one must be filed within 30 days of the conclusion of the discovery phase), which may take a significant amount of time. Perhaps, of course, the judge becomes aware of new information unrelated to discovery. Nonetheless, if the dismissal were on jurisdiction grounds or some other issue that was known ahead of time, it is unlikely he or she would wait to dismiss. \n\nThat said, courts may act *[sua sponte](https://legaldictionary.net/sua-sponte/)*, which means on its own / absent a motion by the parties. \n\nWith respect to a new trial or not, an example of being dismissed without prejudice and, thus, allowing the trial to begin again, may be a major error in the plaintiffs filing.

When a judge dismisses a case sua sponte (on their own initiative) due to a jurisdictional issue, it is typically dismissed without prejudice.

Thornton](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17556563688641585277&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr), 514 US 779, the Supreme Court recites the constitutional requirements for holding national office as representative or senator, which pertain to age and citizenship\\+residence. The court held that an Arkansas law \"prohibiting the name of an otherwise\\-eligible candidate for Congress from appearing on the general election ballot if that candidate has already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate\" was unconstitutional, and \"Allowing individual States to adopt their own qualifications for congressional service would be inconsistent with the Framers' vision of a uniform National Legislature representing the people of the United States\". The same reasoning would hold for setting qualifications for the office of President. However, in [Bush v. Gore](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/98/), 531 U.S. 98, the court pointed out that \"The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the electoral college\", noting that \"The State, of course, after granting the franchise in the special context of Article II, can take back the power to appoint electors\".\n\nIt is uncontroversial that states have the right to impose conditions on ballot access, and that a person does not have an automatic right to be on the ballot simply by applying for candidacy. You might argue that being required to 20,000 signatures on a petition constitutes imposing an unconstitutional qualification on a candidate, but the Supreme Court has so far not clearly found such ballot access provisions to be unconstitutional.\nStill, there is some room for argumentation. [This page](https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/ballot/supreme.htm) lists the 11 decisions regarding ballot access. In the first case, [Williams v. Rhodes](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/393/23/), 393 U.S. 23, the court overturned a requirement to garner 15% of the total votes in the last gubernatorial election for a new party to be on the ballot, finding that the laws \"are invidiously discriminatory and violate the Equal Protection Clause\", but later decisions tended to accept requirements with later filing dates or lower percentages. Filing fees are generally seen as an unconstitutional burden ([Bullock v. Carter](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/405/134/), 405 U.S. 134, [Lubin v. Panish](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/415/709/), 415 U.S. 709\\). It is hard to see how requiring a candidate to submit their tax returns could be seen as an unconstitutional burden.\n\nWhen it comes to state elections, there is even less of an argument that a state cannot impose such requirements (on dog\\-catcher, legislator, or governor).

Based on the information provided, states have more latitude in setting requirements for state-level elections compared to federal elections. The Supreme Court has ruled that states cannot add qualifications for federal offices beyond those specified in the U.S. Constitution (ruling out option A for federal elections). However, for state-level positions like governor, states have more freedom to set ballot access requirements.\n\nOption C is incorrect because requiring the release of tax returns is not analogous to imposing a filing fee, which has been ruled unconstitutional.

However, we should set aside the emotional elements of a jury trial and focus on legal principles. The basic question is whether a person has the right to use force to [defend against an unlawful battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense_(United_States)): \"a person is privileged to use such force as reasonably appears necessary to defend him or herself against an apparent threat of unlawful and immediate violence from another\". This right to defense also extends to defense of others. But it has to appear to be to unlawful, which is to say, you have to reasonably believe that the force used against the victim is unlawful. If a couple of thugs try to drag a person away, then an observer probably has a reasonable belief that this is an unlawful battery. But if a couple of police officers are observed dragging a person away (arresting him), apparently acting officially, the force used (up to a point) is apparently lawful and would not constitute battery of the victim. For defensive force against police to be lawful, the forced used by the police must be excessive.\n\nThe outcome then depends on what a reasonable person would conclude (this is where the jury or judge makes a rather subjective decision). If a reasonable person would conclude that the assailants are acting lawfully in arresting the person, then a higher bar must be clear to justifiably use force in defense of others. Wearing a jacket that says \"Police\" favors the \"appears lawful\" side (though if you happened to know for a fact that the person wearing the jacket is *not* a police officer, then the \"police exception\" would not be applicable). In the relevant case, the facts point to the appearance of a lawful arrest (even if were to turn out to be judged unlawful).\n\nIn the case that this is an apparent arrest, it would have to be the case that a reasonable person would find the force used to be excessive. Generally speaking, force used by officers is held to be reasonable, except in some cases where it is not. See for example the matter of [Eric Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner), where the officers involved were not indicted. On the third hand, in this case, it might matter what the actual legal status of the \"officers\" is (they are not Chicago police).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A passenger on a commercial flight witnesses what appears to be security personnel forcibly removing another passenger from the plane.

[Judges seem to be progressively taking a harsher stance against descendants who refuse to do their part](http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/nini-ocde-pension-audiencia-tribunal_supremo_0_536146504.html). The article quotes the case of a 19 years old guy whose claim to the pension was denied.\n\nAs a side note, rejecting to pay *alimentos* is another of the causes that would cause the person doing it to lose any right to inheritance from the *alimentista*.\n\nIf for whatever the reason you do not qualify for *alimentos*, the details of the agreement between your father and your grandfather for the home become relevant5:\n\n* If your father has formally rented the house then your grandfather position is not relevant, as your father has all of the rights6.\n* If your grandfather allows your father to live in the house without paying rent, then it is your grandfather rights as owner against your father rights as an occupant. No idea about the outcome of that situation.\n\n**UPDATE:**\nYou still do not tell about your grandfather stance about the issue, which is important. If your grandfather agrees with your father7 then the only way to stay at home is that of *alimentos*.\n\nWhat you describe is a situation of either [*precario* or *comodato*](https://www.mundojuridico.info/diferencia-entre-precario-y-comodato/), where your grandfather allows the use of the home without compensation. The differences are:\n\n* *precario* is for an undefined time.\n* *comodato* is for a defined time/use (e.g. for X years).\n\nNow, I have to suppose that you are not part of the agreement so it is just between your father and grandfather. That makes it your father's dwelling, and beyond *alimentos* he cannot be forced to share his dwelling with you.\n\nBut if this is a situation of *precario* (which is what most often happens) your grandfather has the \"nuclear option\"8 of threatening to evict your father, as it is a relatively easy (in the legal sense, not the personal one) procedure. In a situation of *comodato* your grandfather could not evict your father until the conditions of the cession expire, making threats somewhat weaker.\n\nAs a final note, and given how specific this answer has become:\n\n* I am not a lawyer, you have not provided enough specific info, and this is not legal advice. Talk to a lawyer. Maybe a lawyer will check the agreement and it will turn out that your father is paying rent by performing some service, voiding the *precario* aspect. Maybe with the details provided the lawyer can find a way to an agreement that is more amenable to all. Talk to a lawyer.\n* Shut up. The issue at hand may be stressful, and sometimes it might be tempting to boast to your father about the issues of *alimentos* or *precario*. Don't. If there is something to be said about that, let your lawyer do the talking. Try to stay calm.\n* Consider the effect of your actions before taking them. While there is nothing wrong with talking to a lawyer, going beyond that and beginning a legal battle with members of your own family is most of the times an ugly affair. It could easily have an effect for a very long time in your relationship with most of your family, even with those who are not directly implied.

The following answer is specific to US law.*\n\nUnder US law, the copyright of a \"work for hire\" belongs to the party paying for it, not the creator. However, to be considered as a work for hire, the creator must either be an employee or have a signed a written contract stating that this is a work for hire:\n\n> A \u201cwork made for hire\u201d is\u2014\n> \n> \n> 1. a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or\n> 2. a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.\n\nWhether or not the creator is an employee of the company hinges upon many factors; see [Community for Creative Non\\-Violence v. Reid (1989\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_for_Creative_Non-Violence_v._Reid) for more details. But if the work was not a \"work for hire\", then the creator generally retains copyright.\n\nThat said, it is also likely that if someone does work for a company without a contract, that company gains an [implied license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_license) to use the work for the originally intended purposes. Moreover, if the creator receives \"consideration\" (i.e., anything else of value) for the work, this license is irrevocable. In [Asset Marketing Systems, Inc. v. Gagnon (2008\\),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_Marketing_Systems,_Inc._v._Gagnon)\na contractor tried to revoke his permission for a company to use code that he had written. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that if a company pays a creator to create a work, the work is delivered to the company, and the creator intends for the company to copy \\& distribute that work, then the company has an implied, non\\-exclusive, irrevocable license to distribute the work.\n\nIf this situation applies, then a creator probably can't force the company to stop using the work for the originally intended purposes. However, if the company started using it for substantially different purposes, the creator might be able to stop them from doing that. Establishing what counts as \"substantially different\", and what was \"originally intended\" in the case of a verbal contract, is something that gets established in court on a case\\-by\\-case basis; that's why lawyers get the big money.\n\nETA, after seeing your comment: nothing in what I've said is specific to \"companies\" licensing and/or owning copyright in the work.

Second, the license agreement / copyright transfer contains an indemnification clause whereby the author vows that they have the sole right to authorize publication of the material, and the author agrees to legally protect the publisher (pay their legal costs and any judgments, etc) in case their have infringes copyright, or any other legal harm that could arise from publishing the author's contribution.

The author is responsible for the content they create and submit, while the publisher has a duty to inspect and verify the legality of the material they publish. Even if the infringement was unintentional, both parties can still be held legally responsible.\n\nPublishers typically protect themselves through review procedures and indemnification clauses in their agreements with authors. However, these measures do not absolve them of responsibility; they merely help mitigate risk.\n\nIt's important to note that copyright infringement is about using copyrighted material without permission, regardless of attribution. Lack of attribution is more related to plagiarism, which is a separate ethical issue.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the publisher's responsibility.

The law recognizes the property right which a person has when they create a thing, such as a font, and that right is encoded in the law of copyright. The relevant US federal code is contained in [Title 17](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17), which you can read (essentially identical laws exist in virtually or perhaps actually all countries). The important thing to understand is that there is not a distinction between \"privately\" trespassing on a person's property and \"publicly\" trespassing on a person's property. The violation of the owner's property rights comes from taking the material without consent.\n\nThere is a legally\\-recognized exception to the owner's rights, in the form of \"[fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/7683/4501)\", which is widely misunderstood to mean \"if it's not for profit, the property owner has no legal protection\".

According to copyright law, downloading and using a font without permission is a violation of the creator's intellectual property rights, regardless of how it is used. The law does not distinguish between private and public use, or between commercial and non-commercial use when it comes to copyright infringement. Even using the font for personal, non-distributed documents (option A) is still illegal.\n\nOption B is not legal because the initial creation of the document using the illegally downloaded font is still a violation of copyright, even if the font is changed before distribution.\n\nOption C, using the font for internal memos, is also illegal as it still involves using copyrighted material without permission, regardless of the limited distribution.\n\nThe concept of \"fair use\" does not apply to simply using copyrighted material without permission, even if it's for non-commercial purposes.

Eg. I have a billing module for issuing invoices, keeping records of my finances, etc. This software is solely for my own personal use, there is no way I will ever give anyone access or source codes to run their own instances.\nNow, the backbone of this software is obviously a comprehensive database with such records as people and companies.\n\nAnd I wonder, how legal this technically is? This database obviously contains a lot of personal information/data, information entered exclusively by me. This information is accessible only by me, it's not and will not ever be used for any commercial purposes (I won't ever sell the information itself, nor the information metadata).\n\nSo, am I technically breaking any laws/regulations just by having such software?\n\nFor instance, intuitively it seems to me that having a directory with people, their phone numbers, emails, addresses, etc. clearly breaks GDPR rules. However, on second thought, this is precisely what the contacts app on my phone is \\- a directory of people with their personal information. So is this the same thing, or does the exact same concept break different rules when it's implemented in the phone vs. custom software?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not illegal to have such software. The question is how you use it. Some uses of your phone's contact app can be a GDPR violation as well.\n\nThe GDPR has an exemption for \u201cpurely personal or household purposes\u201d. When an ordinary user uses some software for managing their personal or family life, that is not subject to GDPR. E.g. I have a contact list with friends and acquaintances and that is not subject to GDPR at all.\n\nYou are mentioning invoices. Issuing invoices is not a purely personal activity. It affects people outside your friends and family. Your understanding of the term \u201cpersonal\u201d (the software is custom\\-tailored for your needs) is different from the GDPR's concept of \u201cpurely personal\u201d.\n\nWith respect to processing activities that you perform e.g. as a freelancer, you must consider the GDPR. For all such processing activities, you need a legal basis. For invoices this is simple because you're legally required to issue correct invoices. But if your software has aspects of a customer relationship management system, things would be a bit more tricky. The GDPR offers a choice of legal basis, but here there might be a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d to keep track of people with whom you have a business relationship. But it is not the features of the software that are relevant here, but which processing activities you're going to carry out with that data via the software. Mere storage of information is already a processing activity in the sense of the GDPR, though.\n\nIf you're using the same systems for purely personal activities and business activities, it might be difficult to understand your obligations with respect to your data. If possible, it is best to keep your private life separate from business activities so that no confusion arises. For example with a contacts app, it could make sense to use different user accounts for personal and business use.\n\nTypical GDPR issues with a contact information database could be:\n\n* not having a clear purpose for which this data is being stored and used\n* storing the information for longer than necessary\n* storing information about people with whom you do not have an appropriate relationship\n* sharing the data with others, without a proper legal basis\n* unsolicited marketing to people, though some kinds of direct marketing are allowed by the laws in your country", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A freelance web developer creates custom software for managing their business, including a database of client information. Which of the following scenarios is most likely to comply with GDPR regulations?\n\nA) The developer stores all client data indefinitely, arguing that it's for personal use since it's their own custom software.\n\nB) The developer uses the same database for both personal contacts and business clients, but only accesses it from their personal devices.\n\nC) The developer maintains separate databases for personal and business contacts, stores only necessary client information, and has a clear purpose for data collection related to invoicing and project management.\n\nD) The developer shares the client database with other freelancers in their network to help generate more business opportunities.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most GDPR-compliant scenario. It addresses several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. It separates personal and business data, which helps avoid confusion about GDPR obligations.\n2. It implies a clear purpose for data collection (invoicing and project management), which is a GDPR requirement.\n3. Storing only necessary information aligns with data minimization principles.\n\nOption A incorrectly assumes that custom software for business use falls under the \"purely personal or household purposes\" exemption. Option B fails to separate personal and business data, which can lead to confusion about GDPR obligations. Option D likely violates GDPR by sharing personal data without a proper legal basis."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45245/although-there-are-conflicting-claims-about-what-happened-on-june-4th-1989-in-t", "docs_id": 45245, "title": "Although there are conflicting claims about what happened on June 4th, 1989 in Tiananmen Square", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: ... the government of China doesn't claim that nothing happened.

According to the information provided, freedom of expression in China is considered a privilege rather than an absolute right. The Chinese legal system is described as being subservient to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), with laws existing to advance and protect the party's interests rather than individual citizens' rights. \n\nThe Regulations on the Administration of Publishing explicitly state that citizens can exercise their right to freedom of publication only if they do not oppose the basic principles confirmed in the Constitution or harm the interests of the country, society, or collective.

If a client has a complex matter which requires a particular expertise, it is not unusual for the client to discover that the number of knowledgeable lawyers who are available to take on the matter may be quite limited. \\[...]\n> Moreover, I will readily acknowledge that there are many situations where most, if not all, of the best lawyers who practice in the relevant area of law will be in a large firm.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **What Kind of Cases Do Large Law Firms Take On A Pro Bono Basis?**\n\nThere are three main paths to pro bono representation by a large law firm.\n\nOne is to have a personal relationship with a firm or someone in it, in a way that causes one or more lawyers to see you are part of their community, when you are in a potential legal dispute that poses a grave risk of injustice to you which you have no ability to afford a lawyer to assist you with.\n\nA pretty typical example of this would be a law firm that has a receptionist or a child of an office manager, for example, who is being stalked by a violent ex\\-boyfriend who needs a protection order, which a lawyer in the firm agrees to provide for free.\n\nSome times former clients who have fallen on hard times after a long paying representation can fit in this category as well.\n\nOften these disputes are \"small potatoes\" cases too minor to arouse the interest or ire of clients or prospective clients, and that are unlikely to change the law itself.\n\nAnother way to get pro bono representation from a large firm is to have a legal problem that fits into some sort of adopted cause of the law firm that doesn't conflict with its usual client base.\n\nFor example, it is fairly common for large law firms to take on the pro bono representation of someone who is likely to have been wrongfully convicted of a serious crime and is not sophisticated enough to represent themselves in the matter.\n\nA representation like this can provide trial court experience that young lawyers in large firms rarely get, rarely conflicts with the firm's representation of large businesses and rich people, and provides a moment in the lives of the participants in which they can remind themselves that the legal system can be used in skilled hands to secure justice for justice's sake, rather than merely to advance a paying client's interests.\n\nAssisting refugees seeking asylum, helping marginal small business owners comply with their tax obligations, and assisting a low income person with a case that has the potential to establish good precedents (e.g. regarding property rights) for your paying clients are other popular options.\n\nTypically, these kind of pro bono representations are \"pet causes\" of particular lawyers in the firm and those lawyers proactively look for opportunities to locate people for whom representing them pro bono can advance the cause.\n\nFinally, a fair amount of pro bono work comes in the nature of civic involvement with a legal angle, such as serving on the board or as a general counsel for a non\\-profit organization or church, or in some special one time transaction for a non\\-profit like a bond offering for a new building. Often, the non\\-profit or civic organization is one in which people somehow connected to the firm are involved.\n\nIn almost all cases, large law firms are also image conscious and will only take cases that would reflect well on the firm if they were reported upon in a newspaper story from a reporter willing to listen to their side of the story.\n\nIn a pro bono case, the law firm wants to be on the side of the case where they are wearing the \"white hats\" (i.e. the good guys).\n\n**When Do Law Firms Have A Policy Of Declining Pro Bono Representation?**\n\nOn the other hand, in addition to actual direct conflicts, where the law firm represents the other side of a dispute with you, which of course, no one would expect the firm to represent you in on any basis, most large law firms have a class of potential clients that they refuse to accept because they constitute \"business development conflicts.\"\n\nFirms that are hired by insurance companies to represent defendants in personal injury cases will almost never take on a personal injury plaintiff. Firms that represent residential landlords will almost never represent a residential tenant. Firms that represent big businesses that do business with the general public will almost never take on a consumer protection lawsuit for a consumer. Firms that represent manufacturing and utility companies won't take on lawsuits to enforce environmental laws. Firms that represent employers don't represent unions.\n\nThey don't take on these kinds of clients both because their existing and prospective clients don't like it from an appearances and \"loyalty to the cause\"/solidarity perspective, and because they don't want to end up making precedents as a result of their skillful representation that end up hurting most of their clients.\n\nFinally, law firms almost never represent someone who can afford their services on a paying basis for the work in question.\n\nSimilarly, law firms like to represent pro bono clients who are appreciative and reasonably tolerable to deal with. Law firms don't want to represent a client who is a headache to interact with without even getting paid to do it, unless very high principles indeed are at stake.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner in Toronto is facing a complex legal dispute with a large multinational corporation.

Option D fits this criteria best, as it involves helping someone with a personal connection to the firm (the office manager's sibling) in a case (seeking a protection order) that is unlikely to conflict with corporate clients' interests.\n\nOption A is unlikely because it could conflict with the firm's banking industry clients. Option B, while involving a former client, is less likely as it's described as a minor dispute, which might not be seen as grave enough to warrant pro bono work. Option C, despite potential positive publicity, is unlikely because it challenges practices of the firm's regular corporate clients, potentially creating conflicts of interest."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11176/is-disclosing-a-trade-secret-only-to-a-judge-in-court-as-happened-in-the-prest", "docs_id": 11176, "title": "Is disclosing a trade secret only to a judge in court, as happened in &quot;The Prestige&quot;, something that could happen in reality?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The 2006 film *[The Prestige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige_(film))* begins with a magician drowning while performing a magic trick, with another man accused of murdering him.

It seems that in the EU it is the default assumption that text data\\-mining requires consent for protected works, but there are specific statutory exceptions, and in the UK, there is an [exception for research](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/375954/Research.pdf) so that (p. 7\\)\n\n> researchers are allowed to make copies of whole copyright works that\n>  they have lawful access to, without asking for specific permission, \n>  as long as they are making these copies solely for the purpose of non\\-\n>  commercial research.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that under UK law, the proposed activity would not be legal (because it is not non\\-commercial, and also because it is not text). However, US law seems to be more open to data mining. The most applicable case would probably be [Authors Guild v. Google](http://torrent-defenders.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Authors-Guild-v.-Google-Books-05-cv-8136-Summary-Judgment-Granted-for-Google-Books.pdf), which found in favor of extensive \"fair usage\". However, Google Books are free, and the difference between \"for commercial purposes\" vs. \"for non\\-commercial purposes\" could well be the most heavily\\-weighted of the four factors. On the other hand, what you are proposing is vastly more transformative than putting searchable scans online, and the \"effect on market\" would arguably be positive (that is, no sales would be lost because a free copy was acquired instead \\-\\- the work itself would not be available).\n\nHowever... we also treat music differently (there is a separate section of code, [17 USC 114](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114)). [Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films, 410 F.3d 792](http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/2000-2009/Pages/bridgeportdimension.html) holds \"Get a license or do not sample\".

Why does the government care who stays in who's house, while paying money? Is there some third party that is negatively affected if the guidelines aren't followed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, to be clear, this is almost never a state level limitation. To the extent that the link in the question implies otherwise, it is incorrect.\n\nInstead, local governments, typically a municipality or in an area that is not part of any municipality, a county, enacts land use regulations, the most common of which is usually called a \"[zoning code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning_in_the_United_States).\" There are also usually locally adopted building codes that supplement the zoning code.\n\nA zoning code typically establishes rules regarding how different kinds of real estate can be used in different enumerated zones. Usually, there are several different zones in which residential uses are allowed and different rules apply in each one. One of the typical limitations in a residential zone is to establish the number of unrelated people who don't own the home who may live there.\n\nThe purpose of such limitations is to discourage the establishment of boarding houses, group homes, women's shelters, homeless shelters, flop houses, and halfway houses in relatively low density residential zones, on the theory that these uses are undesirable in terms of neighborhood character and cause undesirable people to move into a neighborhood that lowers property values for other people who live there.\n\nMore crassly, people in affluent neighborhoods want to ban property uses that make it possible for poorer people to live near them.\n\nOften the actual scope of the limitations, however, is far broader than is necessary to prohibit these particularly unpopular \"[NIMBY](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Not-in-My-Backyard-Phenomenon)\" (not in my backyard) uses. The drafters of zoning codes are frequently more concerned about preventing loopholes in their restrictions from being identified than about limiting property rights in a respect that most current property owners in the zone don't avail themselves of anyway.\n\nFor example, in Denver, where I live, the City Council recently passed a Group Living Amendment to its zoning code easing restrictions on uses of residences by unrelated people. This measure was sufficiently controversial that members of the public used their referral powers to petition to have [the repeal of the recently enacted legislation places on the November 2021 general election ballot](https://denverite.com/2021/10/07/denver-referred-question-2f-vg-2021/) for voters to consider repealing it.\n\nAs the link in the question notes, homeowner's associations, frequently also impose limitations on this kind of use of a residence, which are often even more strict, and are frequently adopted for the same reason. HOAs have more authority to do so than local governments because as private entities, they aren't required to meet constitutional law limitations on their authority.\n\n> The question is, if both parties agree to forgo any safety measures\n> that it might be there to protect, who exactly is it hurting if one\n> person pays the other to stay over?\n> \n> \n> In simple terms: why is it illegal?

Is there some 3rd party that\n> is negatively affected if the guidelines aren't followed?\n\nThe third\\-party is the neighboring property owners who fear that the quality of their neighborhood will be reduced by this kind of agreement.\n\nI am sympathetic to these criticisms. But, they aren't barriers to enacting laws if people with the power to enact legislation disagree.\n\nThe simple rule is that in the real world, legislation is not required to adhere to a liberal/libertarian ideal in which laws are enacted only to regulate matters in which someone else may arguably be harmed. Subject to light constitutional regulation, the authority of local government's to enact legislation regulating the use of property is frequently plenary (i.e. unlimited) or close to it. The government can do anything it wants that it isn't forbidden from doing by the constitution or a higher level government's statutes. Courts aren't permitted to second guess the accuracy or desirability of these legislative determinations in most cases.\n\nMany states, furthermore, have \"[home rule cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_rule_in_the_United_States)\" that are expressly protected from having their legislative authority limited in many respects by state legislation.\n\nA [regulatory taking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_takings_in_the_United_States), the prevents property from having any beneficial use, must be compensated by the government enacting the regulation of its use. But regulatory laws may reduce the value of property by limiting the uses to which it can be put so long as there is still some beneficial use of the property that remains available.\n\nA very light and disputed impact that is perceived to be negative, such as the one in this case, is a sufficient [rational basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_basis_review) for a municipal or local government to enact such legislation, and many local government zoning codes do, in fact, regulate this kind of activity.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld the authority of local governments to enact this kind of legislation in the United States in the face of a constitutional challenge to it, in the case of  *[Village of Euclid, Ohio v.

The applicable law would depend on other factors or clauses in the contract.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the non-exclusive clause doesn't give the American company the power to force the case to be moved to New York. While they might argue for it, the clause itself doesn't provide this authority.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the difference between exclusive and non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses, as well as the limits of contractual provisions in determining court jurisdiction."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61813/how-do-i-get-the-title-and-ownership-paperwork-for-a-deceased-relatives-house", "docs_id": 61813, "title": "How do I get the title and ownership paperwork for a deceased relative&#39;s house?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My mother passed away.

There is a physical document, the deed, which establishes that she has to the property. When a person obtains title to real estate, the new deed is generally recorded with the county recorder, and the title insurance company will get the relevant documents. It is possible but unlikely that the transfer to your mother was done informally: [read this](https://www.azlandlaw.net/2009/09/must-an-arizona-deed-to-real-property-be-recorded/) if you think that is the case, and hire an attorney to fix the mess.\n\nAs far as finding the safety deposit box is concerned, you could assume that if she did business with Bank X that that is where the box is (look on bank statements for rental charges). Or you could contact every bank in the area. Or wait some number of years, when the lease on the box expires (plus 3 years, for Arizona), at which point they drill the box and the contents go to the state unclaimed property pile (obviously the worst solution to the problem).

If the thief eats John's lunch and suffers severe discomfort, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's potential liability?\n\nA) John has no liability because the thief was committing an illegal act by stealing the lunch.\n\nB) John is protected from liability because he provided a written warning on the lunch bag.\n\nC) John could be held liable for negligence, as he had a duty of care even to potential trespassers.\n\nD) John would only be liable if he had explicitly stated the sandwich contained ghost pepper sauce.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Based on the information provided, John could be held liable for negligence. Even though the food was being stolen, John has a duty of care to not willfully prepare harm for would-be trespassers, which extends to office lunch thieves. The theft and potential injury were foreseeable, and simply adding a note saying \"Do not eat\" doesn't disclose the danger of the extremely spicy sauce.

By including a statement on the claim form indicating willingness to disclose confidential medical information to only the defendant and judge, without submitting details initially, the plaintiff:\n\n1. Alerts the court to the existence of potentially relevant confidential information.\n2. Expresses the desire for confidentiality upfront.\n3.

Or perhaps the burden of proof is on the non\\-compliant parent, depending on how that works in family/divorce matters.\n\n> they told her that they couldn't enforce him to pay by threatening\n>  jail as long as he's \"paying something.\"\n\nThat is accurate under reasonable circumstances. For instance, a parent with a good income would not (or should not) be allowed to elude a finding of contempt merely by paying $1/month.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal remedies available?\n\nA) The non-custodial parent cannot be held in contempt of court as long as they are paying any amount of child support.\n\nB) The custodial parent can immediately have the non-custodial parent jailed for not paying the full amount.\n\nC) The custodial parent can file a motion to show cause, requiring the non-custodial parent to prove they are unable to pay the full amount.\n\nD) Child support orders cannot be enforced through contempt of court proceedings in New Jersey.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most accurate statement is C. In child support cases, the custodial parent can file a motion to show cause when the non-custodial parent is not paying the full amount ordered. This process requires the non-compliant parent to demonstrate to the court why they are unable to pay the full amount, if that is their claim. The court will then determine if the non-payment is deliberate (contempt) or due to genuine inability to pay. Options A and D are incorrect because contempt of court can be used to enforce child support orders, but not automatically for partial payments. Option B is incorrect because immediate jailing is not typically used without due process and consideration of the non-custodial parent's ability to pay."}}
