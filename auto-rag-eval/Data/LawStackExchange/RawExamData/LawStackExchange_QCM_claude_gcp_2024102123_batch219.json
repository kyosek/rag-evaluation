Can the student's supervisor or the University claim to be a copyright holder of the software? What if the student was paid by the University as a Research Assistant?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The general rule is that the author of the software owns the copyright, so that would be the student. This is regardless of whether the student writes the code for fun, or for a thesis. If a student is hired to write that code, then it kind of depends on the university rules, and who hires the student. In the case of a \"work for hire\", the employer owns the copyright. However, it is non\\-trivial to determine whether that principle is applicable in the case of a student hired by the university. In part, it depends on which country this is in because work for hire laws are not exactly the same everywhere, and in part it depends on the details of the employment my a university. In a typical US institution RA appointment, it would come down to university policy \u2013 some universities declare that copyright in all student\\-written software is retained by the student. You would need to look for something resembling an \"IP Policy\" \u2013 [here is a sample](https://tco.osu.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/IP-Policy.pdf), note that such policies are subject to revision.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A graduate student develops a novel software application as part of their thesis work while employed as a Research Assistant at a university. Who most likely holds the copyright to this software?\n\nA) The student, as they are the original author of the software\nB) The student's supervisor, as they oversee the thesis work\nC) The university, as the student was employed as a Research Assistant\nD) It depends on the university's specific intellectual property policies\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While the general rule is that the author of software owns the copyright, the situation becomes more complex when a student is employed by a university, especially as a Research Assistant. The concept of \"work for hire\" could potentially apply, but its applicability varies by country and institution. The key factor in determining copyright ownership in this scenario is the university's specific intellectual property (IP) policy. \n\nOption A is not necessarily correct because employment as an RA could potentially override individual authorship. \nOption B is incorrect as supervision alone doesn't grant copyright. \nOption C could be true in some cases but isn't universally applicable. \nOption D is the most accurate answer because university IP policies can vary widely, and these policies ultimately determine copyright ownership in such cases."

And then ad\\-infinitum until it passes? If not, how often?\n\nWho is in charge of organizing the vote to form the Union in the first place?\n\nIf a vote to form a union passes today, can another vote be held tomorrow to disband the union? If not, when can a vote to disband the union be held, and who is allowed to organize such a vote?\n\nAlso, the worker population of a company is constantly changing. Basically like the Ship of Theseus. I think, none of the founding members of the UAW union in 1930 are alive today. But the union is still alive and well. So, was there any vote in the interim 90 years to reaffirm the union? Or is it that once a union is formed, it is un\\-disbandable?\n\n---\n\nI also read about Stabucks workers forming unions. So when a union is formed, a company is no longer allowed to hire any worker outside of the union?\n\nSo if there is this really great talented person whom Starbucks wants to hire. But this person wants to negotiate directly with Starbucks and does not want anything to do with the Union. Then this person cannot be hired?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, the question seems to misunderstand what \"union elections\" are about. They do not involve forming or joining a union. Under [29 USC 157](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/157) all employees have the right to form or join any union at any time. No election is needed. 29 USC 159 provides that:\n\n> Employees shall have the right to self\\-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities\n\nThe above section is part of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, as amended and updated. It is found in \\[Chapter 7 of 29 USC] ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter\\-7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-7))\n\nA union is formed as the voluntary act of its members. A union generally has a constitution that controls its operations. This will specify under what conditions the union will be dissolved. An individual may leave a union at any time.\n\nElections, such as those mentioned in the question, are held by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) when employees desire that a union become the designated collective bargaining representative for a bargaining unit (which is a group of employees deemed to have a \"community of interest\"). There is considerable flexibility in just which employees shall be designated as a bargaining unit. In the event of a dispute, this is resolved by the NLRB. (see 29 USC 159(b)). Elections may also be held when there is a desire by some workers to change representatives.\n\nA petition requesting a representation election can be filed by a union, a worker, or an employer.\n\nUnder [29 USC 159](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/159)(a) the representatives for a bargaining unit: \"shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment\". That is what representation elections are about.\n\nA union, or other organization, is supposed to be recognized or designated as the bargaining representative for a bargaining unit (BU) only if a majority of the workers in that BU who make a choice want that representative.\n\nIn addition to being certified by the NLRB after winning an election, a union can be recognized as the representative voluntarily by the employer on the request of a majority of the employees. Or such a request can trigger a secret ballot election.\n\n> My question is, how often can unionization votes be held?\n\nRepresentation elections are normally held no more often than once a year in any BU. Specifically, 29 USC 159(c)(3\\) provides that:\n\n> No election shall be directed in any bargaining unit or any subdivision within which in the preceding twelve\\-month period, a valid election shall have been held.\n\nCases recently in the news where a second election has been ordered or proposed in a shorter period of time involve cases where it has been held, or alleged, that the previous election was **not valid** because of unfair labor practices.\n\nAn election can also be held to decertify the bargaining representative, or to substitute a new representative. In all these cases a majority of the workers voting must agree for any change to be made. The \"no more than once per year\" rule applies to all these elections.\n\nIf there are more than two choices on the ballot (for example, if several different unions are proposed, perhaps along with \"no union\") and no one choice gets a majority, a runoff is held between the two choices with the largest number of votes. This is specified in 29 USC 159(c)(3\\)\n\nAll representation elections are held under the authority of, and are regulated by, the NLRB.\n\n> So when a union is formed, a company is no longer allowed to hire any worker outside of the union?\n\nThis is not correct. That is what is known as the \"closed shop\", and it is illegal under the NLRA. Arrangements that **are** legal (when they are part of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA)) under the NLRA are:\n\n* The \"union shop\". On being hired, an employee must join the union within a specified time (which must be at least 30 days, but may be longer). This is specifically permitted by [29 USC 158](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/158)(a)(3\\). However, many states have by state law prohibited union shop agreements.\n* An \"agency shop\". No employee need join any union, but any employee must pay the designated bargaining representative a fee (normally less than the union membership dues) for its efforts in representing the workers of that BU, and that worker specifically. Some states have by state law prohibited or limited agency shop agreements.\n* An \"open shop\". No worker need pay any dues or fee to any union or other representative., But if the representative is a union, its policies are set by the union members, and to become and remain a union member, a worker must pay union dues.\n\nAside from any shop agreement included in a CBA, 29 USC 158(a)(3\\) provides that it is an unfair labor practice (ULP) for an employer:\n\n> by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization ...\n\nIt is also a ULP (under 29 USC 158(a)(2\\)) for an employer to:\n\n> dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it ...\n\nThe provisions of the NLRA and some proposals that have been made to change it are summarized and explained in [\"The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA): Union Representation Procedures and Dispute Resolution\"](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL32930.html#fn54) from the Congressional Research Service (CRS). This report goes into more sub\\-topics than this answer calls for. As far as I can tell, it correctly describes the current law. See <https://www.everycrsreport.com/about.html> for more info.",

According to the National Labor Relations Act, representation elections are normally held no more than once a year in any bargaining unit. This is specified in 29 USC 159(c)(3).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the waiting period is 12 months, not 5 years.\n\nAnswer B is false because decertification elections can be held to remove a union as the bargaining representative, subject to the same frequency rules as other representation elections.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because \"closed shop\" arrangements (where only union members can be hired) are illegal under the NLRA. Companies can still hire non-union workers even if a union is certified as the bargaining representative."

However, it was a one\\-time occurrence, I have not been hospitalized since and I've made a full recovery.\n\nCan I legally purchase a firearm? The following sources give conflicting information. According to this article, you are only disqualified if you are ***currently*** under any court order for involuntary treatment. Therefore, at least according to this information, I should be able to pass a background check.\n\n[https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/08/05/michigan\\-gun\\-control\\-ohio\\-texas\\-shootings/1919891001/](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/08/05/michigan-gun-control-ohio-texas-shootings/1919891001/)\n\n> \"State and federal laws bar certain other people of legal age from legally buying handguns, including anyone not a citizen or legal resident, anyone under a court order of involuntary mental health treatment or deemed legally incapacitated under state law, and anyone subject to a domestic personal protection order under state law.\"\n\nHowever, according to 18 USC 922 (d):\n\n> \"It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person... (4\\) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution.\"\n\nI hope that a few mistakes in my twenties don't permanently disqualify me from owning a gun, and I wish federal law didn't treat all mental health commitments the same. But there is no requirement for states to report their involuntary commitments to NICS.\n\nIf I do fail a background check, do any states allow you to appeal the decision by providing a letter from a psychiatrist stating that you no longer suffer from a mental health condition?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **tl;dr**\n\nIn isolation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f922(g)(4\\) appears to operate as a permanent ban, though affected persons may seek permits and appeal a subsequent denial.\n\n**Background**\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f922(d) is the law on sales:\n\n> It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person ... (4\\) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution\\[.]\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f922(g) is the law on possession:\n\n> It shall be unlawful for any person ... (4\\) who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n\nThe wording of the laws is past tense\u2014any person who \"has been\" committed\u2014meaning that there's a strong textual case for a lifetime ban. While not binding, the Supreme Court seems to agree:\n\n> A person adjudicated as a mental defective may later be adjudged competent, and a person committed to a mental institution later may be deemed cured and released. Yet Congress made no exception for subsequent curative events. The past adjudication or commitment disqualifies. Congress obviously felt that such a person, though unfortunate, was too much of a risk to be allowed firearms privileges.\n\n[*Dickerson v. New Banner Inst.*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/460/103.html), 460 U.S. 103, 116 (1983\\) (not binding because the case dealt only with persons who had served lengthy prison terms rather than those who had been involuntarily committed).\n\nMore importantly, Congress seems to agree. It allows states to receive certain federal grants only if they establish programs that provide an avenue for \"relief\" from the lifetime ban of \u00a7\u00a7\u202f922(d)(4\\), 922(g)(4\\). For example, \u00a7\u202f105 of the [NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007](https://www.congress.gov/110/plaws/publ180/PLAW-110publ180.pdf), 121 Stat. 2559, describes a state's program as qualifying in the following way: \n\n> (a) Program Described.\u2014 A relief from disabilities program is implemented by a State in accordance with this section if the program\u2014\n> \n> \n> \n> > (1\\) permits a person who, pursuant to State law, has been adjudicated as described in subsection (g)(4\\) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code, or has been committed to a mental institution, to apply to the State for relief from the disabilities imposed by subsections (d)(4\\) and (g)(4\\) of such section by reason of the adjudication or commitment;\n> > \n> > \n> > (2\\) provides that a State court, board, commission, or other lawful authority shall grant the relief, pursuant to State law and in accordance with the principles of due process, if the circumstances regarding the disabilities referred to in paragraph (1\\), and the person's record and reputation, are such that the person will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest; and\n> > \n> > \n> > (3\\) permits a person whose application for the relief is denied to file a petition with the State court of appropriate jurisdiction for a de novo judicial review of the denial.\n> \n> \n> (b) Authority To Provide Relief From Certain Disabilities With Respect to Firearms.\u2014 If, under a State relief from disabilities program implemented in accordance with this section, an application for relief referred to in subsection (a)(1\\) of this section is granted with respect to an adjudication or a commitment to a mental institution or based upon a removal of a record under section 102(c)(1\\)(B), the adjudication or commitment, as the case may be, is deemed not to have occurred for purposes of subsections (d)(4\\) and (g)(4\\) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code.\n\nMichigan, however, wasn't one of the states that implemented a relief program. And this brings us to [*Tyler v. Hillsdale County Sherrif's Dept.*](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20160915133), 837 F.3d 678 (2016\\). Therein a Michigan resident who wanted to purchase a firearm was deemed ineligible by the Sheriff's Office because of an involuntary commitment related to a depressive episode during a divorce a couple decades earlier. On appealing to the FBI's NICS Section, he was denied. His case became a federal one and eventually reached the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in *Tyler*. Because Michigan's lack of a relief program made \u00a7\u202f922(g)(4\\) operate as a permanent ban on Tyler's ability to possess a firearm, they ordered a lower court to determine whether \u00a7\u202f922(g)(4\\) was unconstitutional as it applied to Tyler's specific circumstances. This gave Tyler the opportunity to argue that he didn't present a danger to the public.",

The federal law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922) uses past tense language suggesting a lifetime ban for those involuntarily committed to mental institutions. However, the passage also mentions that Congress has allowed states to implement \"relief from disabilities\" programs that provide a pathway for individuals to petition to regain their firearm rights. This indicates that while the federal law appears to create a lifetime ban, there are potential avenues for relief in some states. Options A and B are incorrect because they present overly simplistic views that don't account for the nuances in the law. Option D is incorrect because while the Supreme Court has commented on the issue, it hasn't made a definitive ruling specifically about mental health commitments and firearm rights."

There are other issues such as refusing to share information with me even when I am entitled to it, terribly drafted motions, thousands of mistakes such as mixing up my SSN with others, getting my age and name wrong in my applications (had I not noticed).\n\nIn light of these facts, I have decided to dismiss him as my legal counsel and continue in the case *pro se*. What steps do I have to take to formally dismiss him from the case, beyond sending him an email of notice? I heard that he needs to file a motion called substitution to relevant parties. Do I have to file any motions myself?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> what are the steps to kick off the dismiss procedure except for\n>  sending him an email of notice?\n\nIn addition to sending him an email, you should also notify him via USPS Certified Mail with Return Receipt. That will make it harder for him to deny his awareness of your decision to fire him (keep in mind that he might otherwise try to send you more bills).\n\nYou also need to file in court a *motion for substitution of counsel* (serving a copy thereof to any other parties). The motion's label is not as important as the assertions you make in it. In that motion you will indicate that you wish to proceed *in pro per*, or identify the attorney who henceforth will represent you (I think the new attorney will have to file in court a notice of *appearance*, but I am not sure).\n\nAlthough you are not expected to explain in your motion the reasons for firing the lawyer, I would encourage you to state them, as these might be relevant if your matter ends up in an appellate court.\n\n> how to draft such a motion, what's format?\n\nI strongly encourage you to get acquainted with the court rules (aka rules of procedure) of the jurisdiction where your matter is being litigated. There are significant overlaps of procedural law among jurisdictions, but there might also be some noteworthy differences.\n\nRoughly speaking, a motion consists of:\n\n* motion header;\n* the facts on which your motion is premised;\n* the relief you expect from that motion;\n* a brief, where the party develops his legal arguments and presents laws favoring his position.\n\nGiven the nature of this motion in particular, you might not have to cite laws except the procedural provision(s) (if any) addressing substitution of counsel. More generally, [http://www.leagle.com/leaglesearch?exact\\=immigration\\+court](http://www.leagle.com/leaglesearch?exact=immigration%20court) is a great resource where you can find case law with which to support your arguments.\n\nI have never litigated in immigration court, but in the latter portion of [this page (see section *Trial Court*)](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/viggers-v-pacha_74.html) you will see various motions filed by me (and others by the defendant) in one of my cases in state court.\n\nAlthough I promote litigation *in pro per*, the whole process (starting with the learning curve) is very challenging. On the bright side, you are about to save thousands of dollars and gain much more control over your case than through a lawyer.\n\nAnd once your matter runs its course, don't forget to report the lawyer with the corresponding agency in charge of disciplining malpracticing attorneys (for instance, in Michigan it would be the Attorney Grievance Commission). We *pro se* litigants have to endure so much prejudice, whereas situations like yours show that the legal \"profession\" leaves much to be desired.",

What would happen if you called police?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Much of \"the woods\" is owned by the US government, where your chances of any degree of success are highly variable. It is extremely unlikely that you can get away with it at all on a military base or in a national park. You may be able to get away with it for longer on Forest Service land (legally speaking, you're supposed to move along after 14 days), but if you're looking for a permanent legal claim to the land, that will not happen without an act of Congress. \nIf public domain land has valuable minerals which you exploit, you may be able to chop down trees and build a cabin, but until Congress lifts the moratorium on mining claims patents, you cannot gain title to the land. (Public domain land is land not set aside for a specific purpose, such as a national park or wilderness area).\n\nAnother possibility is to seize the land through adverse possession, as long as you satisfy the requirements for such an action in the state in question. Chopping down trees and building a cabin probably satisfy the requirements of actual possession, openness and notoriety. You would have to continuously live there for 5\\-30 years, depending on state, and have to have exclusive use of the land. If you get found and the owner tells you to leave (whether or not they get a court order), or if they say \"I'll let you stay for a while\", or they do a bit of landscaping, then you can't take the land (or, the clock restarts). There are a number of state\\-specific quirks such as whether you have to believe that the land is actually yours. Also, you can't dispossess a government.\n\nAt some point, you will have to deal with the county, since you built the cabin without a permit.",

Which should go first? If both are valid, are there situations in which one is preferred?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, the relevant law is [17 USC 401](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html) which provides in relevant part:\n\n> (a) General Provisions.\u2014Whenever a work protected under this title is published in the United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner, a notice of copyright as provided by this section **may** be placed on publicly distributed copies from which the work can be visually perceived, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. \\[*emphasis added*]\n> \n> \n> (b) Form of Notice.\u2014If a notice appears on the copies, it shall consist of the following three elements:\n> \n> \n> (b)(1\\) the symbol \u00a9 (the letter C in a circle), or the word \u201cCopyright\u201d, or the abbreviation \u201cCopr.\u201d; and\n> \n> \n> (b)(2\\) the year of first publication of the work; in the case of compilations or derivative works incorporating previously published material, the year date of first publication of the compilation or derivative work is sufficient. The year date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with accompanying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles; and\n> \n> \n> (b)(3\\) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner.\n> \n> \n> (c) Position of Notice.\u2014The notice shall be affixed to the copies in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright. The Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation, as examples, specific methods of affixation and positions of the notice on various types of works that will satisfy this requirement, but these specifications shall not be considered exhaustive.\n> \n> \n> (d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice.\u2014If a notice of copyright in the form and position specified by this section appears on the published copy or copies to which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be given to such a defendant\u2019s interposition of a defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in the last sentence of section 504(2\\).\n\nNote that this section lists the three elements in the order 1\\) symbol or word, 2\\) year, 3\\) owner's name. However, it does not explicitly require this order. As the notice is no longer required at all, and as the sole purpose is \"to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright\" and to defeat a defense of \"innocent infringement\", the order is probably not significant. But I would follow the text of the law and list the elements in teh same order that 17 USC 401 (b) does, that is, word or symbol fist, year second, name third. For example\n\n> Copyright \u00a9 2022 Jane Jones\n\nBut other forms probably have identical legal significance.\n\nNote that \"Copyright \u00a9\" is a redundancy and perhaps I should not have used it in the example here. But it is what I in fact use, and many commercial publishers do the same. I do it because I think the word will be clearest to many English\\-speaking people, but the symbol will be clearest internationally,\n\nNote also that a notice is no longer legally required. Under US law, until 1 January 1978 (the effective date of the 1976 Copyright Act) any publication without a notice caused the work to enter the public domain at once. After that, until 1 March 1989, any publication without a notice caused the work to enter the public domain in five years, unless the work was registered within that time. Once a work enters the public domain, there is no copyright in that work at all.\n\nEver since 1 March 1989, omission of a notice never causes a work to enter the public domain under US law, and currently, to the best of my understanding, a notice is not legally required in any country in the world, although it has some legal value under US law.",

While copyright notices are no longer legally required in the U.S. (or any other country) for works published after March 1, 1989, including a notice can still have legal value.

While Mr. Johnson doesn't explicitly say \"Please do not remarry\" (as in the second example), he does provide context that implies the money is being offered with the expectation that Sarah will not remarry. By mentioning that it's \"best for my grandchildren if you focus on them rather than finding a new partner,\" Mr. Johnson is linking the financial support to Sarah's marital status more directly than in the first example where no reason was given. This additional context makes it more likely to be interpreted as an offer to contract rather than a simple gift or a conditional gift.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The child would likely be eligible for British citizenship through the father, based on British nationality law.\n2. The child would likely be eligible for Spanish citizenship through the mother, based on Spanish nationality law.\n3. As the child was born in the United States, which follows jus soli (right of soil) principles, the child would also acquire U.S. citizenship at birth.\n\nOption A and B are incorrect because they falsely assume only one parent's nationality is passed on. Option C is close but fails to account for the U.S. citizenship acquired through birth on U.S. soil.

The U.S. Constitution merely states that the right to vote in a federal election cannot be denied on the basis of an age older than age eighteen. (A U.S. state could let 14 year olds vote if it wanted to do so.)\n\nBut, many legal rights are limited to persons aged twenty\\-one or older (e.g. drinking, tobacco smoking, serving as an executor of a decedent's estate, etc.), or to some other age (e.g., age discrimination in employment laws start at age 40, legal discrimination for senior citizen oriented housing starts at age 55, eligibility to run for the U.S. House starts at age 25, for the U.S. Senate at age 30, and for the Presidency at age 35\\.)\n\nHistorically, until the Vietnam War, the age of majority for most (but not all) purposes in the United States was twenty\\-one years of age.\n\nA majority of U.S. courts that have considered the issue have found that an age twenty\\-one restriction on the right to bear some or all arms is a reasonable regulation of the Second Amendment right that is constitutionally permitted, although there is a split of authority and one or two cases have reached the opposite conclusion.",

There were several points in the move that they had to block all traffic through an intersection (with one of the chase cars) for a few minutes in order for the truck to be able to swing around enough to make the turn.\n\nNow, just to be clear, I wouldn't have a problem with this if I were in one of the cars that was inconvenienced for a minute. But I do want to know, is it, strictly speaking, legal? Is there something in their oversized vehicle permit (or whatever paperwork) that says \"You can block the road\"? Or is it simply a matter of practicality, where the police realize that they need to get the girder there *somehow*, and it would cost more time and money to ticket them for blocking the road than it would just to let them continue?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Oversize transports are known beforehand and have special permits.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe [department of transportation/Federal Highway Administration](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/sw/permit_report/index.htm) provides information for oversize and overweight transports.\n\n> Permits\n> \n> \n> The Federal government does not issue permits for oversize or overweight vehicles. This is a State option.\n> \n> \n> Nondivisible Loads:\n> \n> \n> Permits may be issued by the States without regard to the axle, gross, or Federal bridge formula requirements for nondivisible vehicles or loads. Nondivisible is defined as any load or vehicle exceeding applicable length or weight limits which, if separated into smaller loads or vehicles, would:\n> \n> \n> * Compromise the intended use of the vehicle, i.e., make it unable to perform the function for which it was intended;\n> * Destroy the value of the load or vehicle, i.e., make it unusable for its intended purpose; or\n> * Require more than 8 work hours to dismantle using appropriate equipment. The applicant for a nondivisible load permit has the burden of proof as to the number of workhours required to dismantle the load.\n\nIn this case, a super\\-long girder has its value from being a single item, so the state is allowed to make a special permit to exceed the normal regulations on weight and size. The regulations what is needed for a permit and what the permit allows is state specific.\n\nTypically, the permit is single\\-use and bound to a specific day and route. It's also not atypical for the crossings to be closed by police before the truck convoy arrives. Even without a police escort, the special permit allows them to block the road in specific circumstances, such as taking a tight turn.",

According to the documentation, oversized transports require special permits issued by the state, not the federal government. These permits are typically for a specific date and route, and may allow for temporary road blockages when necessary, such as for navigating tight turns. The permit might also require or allow for police assistance in managing traffic. Options A and D are incorrect as they suggest operating without proper authorization, which would be illegal.

The conviction will cease to appear on a standard DBS check 11 years after the conviction date. Since the community order ended on June 1, 2023, we can assume the conviction date was around June 1, 2022 (as the community order was for 12 months).

This was also true in the rest of the UK until the 1800s, when statutes were passed with the aim of making abortion law clearer (generally forbidding it). This didn't extend to Scotland leaving much of its abortion law unclear.\n\nThe 24 weeks limit that the Scotsman article references is from [Section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 (as amended)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/87/section/1). This act *did* apply to Scotland. The act specifies conditions under which abortion within the first 24 weeks is *legal*, and that it is always legal when there is grave risk to the woman's health.

The Abortion Act 1967 applies to Scotland, setting conditions under which abortion is legal, including the 24-week limit. However, unlike the rest of the UK, Scotland retains elements of common law that could theoretically allow for criminal charges in cases falling outside the Act's provisions. This creates a unique legal situation where both statutory law (the Abortion Act 1967) and common law play a role.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overlooks the role of common law in Scottish abortion regulations. Option B is wrong as it mistakenly attributes Scottish abortion law entirely to Victorian-era legislation, when in fact Scotland's abortion law wasn't codified in the same way as the rest of the UK during that period. Option D is incorrect because it falsely claims that Scottish abortion law is identical to the rest of the UK and standardized by Victorian legislation, which is not the case due to Scotland's distinct legal system and the persistence of common law elements."

It avoids capacity issues, provides a clear ownership structure, and is a well-established method for minors to indirectly own businesses. However, John and his family should be aware of potential tax implications, such as the \"kiddie tax,\" and consider consulting with a legal professional to set up the trust and LLC properly."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An electronics enthusiast, Sarah, purchases a popular smartwatch and decides to analyze its internal components. She successfully reverse engineers the device and creates detailed circuit schematics. Sarah is considering publishing these schematics online for educational purposes. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications of her actions?\n\nA) Sarah's publication of the schematics would be illegal as it violates copyright laws protecting the smartwatch's design.\n\nB) Sarah can legally publish the schematics, but only if she obtains permission from the smartwatch manufacturer first.\n\nC) Sarah can legally publish the schematics, unless she agreed to specific terms prohibiting reverse engineering when purchasing the device.\n\nD) Sarah's publication of the schematics would be illegal as it infringes on the patent rights of the smartwatch manufacturer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because, according to the provided information, publishing schematics derived from reverse engineering an electronic device is generally legal, unless the purchaser agreed to specific terms prohibiting such actions. The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. Patent laws mainly prevent making, using, selling, or importing infringing products, not publishing schematics.\n2. Copyright laws do not cover \"idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery.\"\n3. The legality could be affected if Sarah agreed to license terms with restrictions on use, such as non-disclosure or prohibitions on reverse engineering.\n\nOption A is incorrect because copyright laws don't typically cover functional aspects like circuit designs. Option B is incorrect because permission is not necessarily required if no specific agreements were violated. Option D is incorrect because patent laws generally don't prohibit publishing schematics, only the making, using, or selling of patented inventions."

When we finally called her out on it, she mentioned that she has long suspected he may have ADHD, but couldn't say anything. She actually gave us the above quote.\n\nI've got several sub\\-questions, but the overarching question in the title is the same. What restrictions are on a teacher in regards to a student they suspect of having some disorder such as ADHD? I know a teacher can't diagnose ADHD, they aren't a doctor. Can a teacher mention that they suspect ADHD? Can a teacher recommend that the student be screened for various issues (even avoiding mentioning any particular disorder)? Can a teacher suggest a student be screened by a specialist?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no specific statute in Missouri that prohibits a teacher from saying \"ADHD\". There is a specific federal statute that obligates the school district to make accommodations if a student is diagnosed with ADHD (also a state law). A teacher is not technically qualified to diagnose ADHD. Finally, the teacher is an employee of the school district and is required to follow the policies of the district. Those are the 4 legal cornerstones on which the teachers response must rest. The unquestionably weakest cornerstone is understanding the realities of district policy.\n\nThere may be district\\-policy type reasons that motivate reticence to recommend testing, but such \"abundance of caution\" is not motivated by a legal mandate imposed on the teacher, it is more likely to be the result of a fear of reprisals (for triggering extra expenditures by the district). Such a fear is not legally warranted, except insofar as if you don't know what the law says (many people don't), fear is a kind of reasonable response. But ignorance of the law is no excuse.\n\nIt might be useful to know that it is [*not* required to get a doctors diagnosis of ADHD](https://www.additudemag.com/10-myths-about-special-ed-services/), so the teacher's evaluation might carry more weight that you would expect, were that a requirement.",

The teacher's reluctance likely stems from school district policies rather than legal mandates. The correct answer, C, aligns with the information suggesting that teachers can recommend screening without specifying disorders.

You can reject their offer and present a counter offer in any format you wish. Most likely, if they have room for negotiation, the agency will be more receptive to minor edits on their original contract. Generally speaking, contract negotiations go better when the series of counter offers involve the minimum changes from the most recent necessary to effect the desired resulting changes. But, in negotiations, the only rule is that there are no rules. So you can toss out their entire agreement and start over with your own if you want.\n\nIf you only want to make minor edits, a good technique is to simply mark a line through the language you want to delete, write in the language you want to add, then initial it before signing. If the other side also initials and signs, then the language you edited will be your agreement.\n\nFor more extensive changes, you could add a sentence in the original contract that says you will also agree to an addendum to the contract. This could be a set of terms you wish to add to the original agreement to protect yourself. You could and would also want to add a sentence in the original agreement that where the addendum conflicts with any other provision of the agreement, the addendum will control.",

The Police then tried to claim that he was loitering in order to arrest him. Under threat of arrest, he gave his name and information to the Police. Afterwards the Police confiscated his camera and phone under \"suspicious activity\". \n\n* Did the Police act legally when they confiscated his property?\n* Since the photographer was conducting a 1st amendment protected activity. Could he have been charged with loitering?\n\nHere is the video for reference: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=OWOtUDf0elQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWOtUDf0elQ)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The district court judge, as reported in [this news story](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2019/07/10/lawsuit-city-des-moines-iowa-police-detained-man-sidewalk-who-legally-filming-them/1693922001/) has held that there was probable cause to arrest Daniel Robbins in this case, and that his rights were not violated. If this ruling stands, officers acted legally, although they might still be required to return the phone with the images.\n\nWhether there is probable cause for an arrest (or a search) is always a very fact\\-based issue. I have not found the judge's actual decision, only a news summary of it, which can often be misleading. Specific facts about exactly what Robbins did or said may be important in determining whether there was in fact probable cause.\n\nIt appears that Robbins intends to appeal this decision. If he does there may be an opinion from a Circuit Court of Appeals expanding on whether there was probable cause or any violation of rights, and why.\n\nPrevious cases have established that normally there is no reasonable expectation of privacy for acts performed in public; that one my photograph or video record such public acts legally from anywhere that one may legally be; that there is a right photograph or record police officers engaged in official actions or the use of police powers; and that laws attempting to forbid such recording are unconstitutional when so applied. However, it seems from the news story that here the police officers were off\\-duty and not engaging in any official acts or use of police powers. That might change the ruling.\n\nI rather expect the district court's decision to be overturned, but there is no case exact;ly on point that i know of, and one can never be absolutely sure what a court will do in a particular case. I can see why police officers may have felt threatened, and why the Judge may have been inclined to sympathize with them, although I think the decision was incorrect. But a Judge of the Appeals Court might possibly feel the same way. Until the Appeals Court rules, one cannot be sure what the law in this matter will finally be. (It is possibly, but statistically a bit unlikely, there there will eventually be a ruling from the US Supreme Court on this case.)\n\n[This article from Nolo Press](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/recording-the-police-legal.html) discusses the issue of recording police, primarily in the context of police who are performing their official duties. It says:\n\n> Almost every court to consider the issue has determined that the First Amendment gives you the right to record (pictures, video, and audio) police officers in public while they are performing their duties. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re allowed to record if you\u2019re doing so surreptitiously (secretly), interfering with the officer, or otherwise breaking the law.\n> \n> \n> The courts' primary rationale for allowing police officer recording is that the First Amendment includes the right to freely discuss our government, and the right of freedom of the press and public access to information. Given the prevalence of personal filming devices, more and more \u201cnews\u201d is being gathered and disseminated by members of the public. The courts have found that freedom of the press applies to citizen journalists and documentarians just as it does to formal members of the press. (See, for example, [*Glik v. Cunniffe*, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011\\)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1578557.html).)\n\nThe Nolo article goes on to discuss whether a Section 1983 Federal suit against police officers who arrest someone recording their actions will succeed, indicating that this will depend on the specific facts of the case.\n\nThe Nolo article mentions that one is not allowed to interfere with an officer during process of recording. What exactly constitutes \"interference\" is not fully clear, and will depend on the facts of a specific case. The Nolo article mentions other circumstances when recording an officer may not be legal.",

The legality would depend on specific details such as the journalist's exact behavior, local laws, and how courts interpret the First Amendment in this context. Recent cases, like the one mentioned involving Daniel Robbins, show that courts may sometimes rule in favor of police in such situations, though these rulings can be appealed and overturned.

Which of the following approaches would be the MOST legally sound way to reuse this code?\n\nA) Secretly copy the code from Company A's codebase and use it directly in the freelance project\nB) Rewrite the code from memory without looking at Company A's codebase\nC) Open source the specific code components they want to reuse, with a permissive license, before using them in the freelance project\nD) Use the code as-is, arguing that since they wrote it personally, they have the right to reuse it\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is illegal and unethical, as the code belongs to Company A.\nOption B might still be considered derivative work and could lead to legal issues.\nOption C is the most legally sound approach. By open-sourcing the code with a permissive license before reuse, the developer creates a legal pathway to use the code in other projects.\nOption D is incorrect because code written for an employer typically belongs to the employer, not the individual developer.\n\nThe correct approach (C) aligns with the documentation's suggestion to \"open source any of the code you plan to reuse and implement a code license that allows you to use, modify, or distribute software code freely.\" This method provides a clear legal basis for reusing the code while respecting the rights of the original employer."

In this case, the recordings were made in New Jersey, a one-party consent state, making them legal at the time of recording. The fact that the case was transferred to a Florida federal court does not change the legality of the recordings when they were made.

If the internal audit of a company doesn't do due diligence by not properly auditing the financial documents of the company who is legally accountable for the lack of oversight of the internal audit? The CEO and the CFO or just the CFO?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Who is legally accountable for the action of the internal audit of a\n> company in the U.S.? If the internal audit of a company doesn't do due\n> diligence by not properly auditing the financial documents of the\n> company who is legally accountable for the lack of oversight of the\n> internal audit? The CEO and the CFO or just the CFO?\n\nThis answer is prefaced with a lot of context and discussion of possible fact patterns, because it contains some implicit assumptions about how liability for inaccurate financial statements works.\n\n**Context**\n\nPublicly held companies, non\\-profit organizations with certain kinds of grants, and some privately held companies with large unsecured bank loans, are required, as a matter of law, or as a contractual requirement, to prepare financial statements that are audited by a third\\-party certified public accountancy firm.\n\nThis kind of audit is one of the few accounting functions that can only be performed by a CPA, even though, in practice, most more sophisticated accounting tasks are performed by CPAs.\n\nThe process for conducting this kind of audit is established by industry standards adopted by a CPA industry non\\-profit organization called the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).\n\nThe Sarbanes\\-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the CEO of a publicly held company to certify that the financial statements of the company are materially true to the best of the CEO's knowledge, and that the CEO has reviewed the internal controls in the company and that they are either adequate, or that they have flaws which are expressly disclosed.\n\nFederal law also requires publicly held company to periodically change their outside CPA firms and regulates the governance requirements for such firms in connection with hiring and evaluating outside CPA firms.\n\nThe inclusion of a knowingly false or misleading statement about a matter that is material to a potential investor in a publicly held firm's financial statements or other public disclosures is one form of securities fraud. Someone who participates in securities fraud may have civil or criminal liability as a result, although civil liability requires a showing that a particular investor who is suing suffered damages caused by the false or misleading statement.\n\nThe inclusion of a knowingly false or misleading statement about a matter that is material to a lender or grant provider who contractually requires an internal audit of a privately held profit or non\\-profit firm is a breach of the lending agreement or grant agreement, that could have contractually determined penalties, and could sometimes, but not alway, constitute criminal fraud, or justify a civil lawsuit for fraud by the aggrieved lender or grant provider. These misstatements could also be a ground for making the breach of contract debt not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n\nAnother reason that firms sometimes conduct an internal audit would be for management to hire a CPA firm to investigate, forensically, a suspicion that fraud or misconduct has taken place within the firm, by someone at a lower level in the organization or affiliated with the organization, when management doesn't know for sure if something is amiss or not. This could happen in any kind of firm, but is most common in a large privately held company in which there is strong overlap between the group of senior managers of the company and the owners of the company.\n\n**What Can Go Wrong?**\n\nLegal accountability is something that is necessary only when the processes in the company to produce its financial disclosures and other disclosures are inaccurate for some reason.\n\nThere are a variety of people who could have legal accountability, and who is legally accountable depends upon why the disclosures were inaccurate.\n\nMost often, the firm that commissioned the audit may have legal liability to the people for whom the audited financial information was prepared. In the case of a publicly held company, this firm is called the \"issuer\" and the financial statements are prepared for the benefit of the holders of publicly traded stock and corporate bonds of the issuer.\n\nIn the case of a non\\-profit, this would be the grant issuer who imposed the audit requirement (and also the state attorney general, who has general supervisory authority over all non\\-profits in a state). In the case of a commercial lender to the firm, this would be the lender.\n\nUsually, the liability of an issuer for disclosing audited financial statements or disclosures that are inaccurate comes to be in the form of a civil lawsuit for money damages from someone who alleges that they were harmed by the inaccurate disclosure against the issuer.\n\nA civil lawsuit could also name, as co\\-conspirators or additional defendants directly in fraud claims, anyone who participated in preparing the financial statements and knowingly did something wrong in the process with an intent to mislead the person to whom the statements were directed.\n\nThis liability could arise because the CEO certified that the financial statements were accurate knowing that they were not accurate, or certified that there were adequate internal controls in place knowing that there were not adequate internal controls in place.\n\nThis liability could arise because some other officer or employee of the company knowingly manipulated the accounting records of the company, or knowingly set up an inaccurate reporting system to generate accounting records of the company, producing the wrong results. This could take the form of actual fake entries or omissions from accounting business records. It could also take the form of characterizing and aggregating data in accounting business records in a manner inconsistent with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) that are established by the FASB.\n\nThis liability could arise because the same kind of misconduct or negligence of some kind was committed by the CPA firm hired to conduct the audit. The issuer whose financial statements were inaccurate might sue the CPA firm for malpractice (effectively to indemnify it for the liability it incurred to others), or a third\\-party who relied upon the audited financial statements to its detriment could sue the CPA firm that conducted the audit as a third\\-party beneficiary of the representation from the CPA firm that the financial statements were materially accurate.\n\nAny of the people above, if they engaged in intentionally defrauding the intended audience of the financial statements with an intent to deceive (and not mere negligence) could also be prosecuted criminally for securities fraud.\n\nFor example, when a CPA at the national accounting firm of Arthur Anderson intentionally destroyed records with an intent to cover up misconduct, and prepared misleading financial statements for the failed oil and gas firm Enron, the firm was prosecuted criminally for that conduct, convictions were obtained against individuals and the firm, and the firm ceased to exist while the appeal of its conviction was pending. The conviction was ultimately overturned on appeal, but for reasons that don't change the basic concept that accountants and accounting firms can be prosecuting criminally for intentionally and knowingly misleading investors in a publicly held company that it audits with an intent to mislead the public about the audited firm's finances.\n\nAnyone who was in on the fraud and not deceived themselves could also have criminal liability, from a low level book keeper faking data entry records, to a CFO who, for example, intentionally reports the proceeds of loans owed by the company as purchase of stock in the company, in order to make it look like the company has less debt than it actually does.\n\nBut, suppose that the CEO relies upon information from the CFO and the CPA firm conducting the audit that the financial statements are correct and has no reason to suspect otherwise. In that case, even if the CEO certified that the financial statements were correct and was inaccurate in making that certification, the CEO would have no civil or criminal liability.\n\nCriminal liability for inaccurate financial statements or disclosures requires knowledge that they are inaccurate accompanied by a statement to the contrary, or knowing participating in conduct that causes the statements to be inaccurate (and not mere negligence).\n\nSometimes, there is civil liability, but not criminal liability, for \"negligent misrepresentation\" when there are inaccurate financial statements or disclosures, the person states that they are accurate, and due to that person's negligence (but not knowledge or intentional misstatement) the financial statements or disclosure are actually not accurate in a material way that harms someone. The damages available and the legal treatment of the debt in bankruptcy are much more serious for intentional or knowing misstatements than they are for negligent misrepresentations. Negligent misrepresentation liability is limited to actual economic harm and can be discharged in bankruptcy. Securities fraud liability can include punitive damages and is usually impossible to discharge in bankruptcy, and securities fraud debts may be collected from certain kinds of assets that are otherwise exempt from creditor's claims.",

Who is most likely to face legal accountability in this situation?\n\nA) Only the internal audit team members\nB) The CEO and CFO jointly\nC) The CFO and the internal audit team\nD) The CEO alone\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the CFO and the internal audit team are most likely to face legal accountability. The CFO is responsible for overseeing the financial operations and reporting of the company, including the work of the internal audit team. The internal audit team failed to properly perform their duties, leading to inaccurate financial statements.\n\nThe CEO, while having signed off on the statements, relied on information provided by the CFO and internal audit team. According to the information provided, if the CEO had no reason to suspect the information was inaccurate, they would not have civil or criminal liability even if they certified the incorrect financial statements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the internal audit team bears responsibility, the CFO also shares accountability for overseeing their work.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the CEO, in this case, is not likely to be held accountable if they genuinely believed the information to be accurate based on the reports they received.\n\nOption D is incorrect for the same reason as B - the CEO alone is not the most likely to face legal accountability in this situation.\n\nThe correct answer, C, reflects that both the CFO and the internal audit team share the primary legal accountability for the inaccurate financial statements in this scenario."

It aligns with the principle that confidentiality agreements are limited to confidential information, as stated in the documentation. This approach allows the contractor to discuss their general work experiences, techniques used, and non-proprietary technical details (addressing their desire to speak about their work). At the same time, it protects the client's sensitive information by specifying that only information transmitted in confidence is subject to non-disclosure.

During this address, there are 15 things that the court must ensure that the defendant understands (if they apply in the case); one of these is the nature of every charge the defendant is pleading guilty to. Prosecutors can't sneak stuff into the guilty plea that the defendant doesn't know about.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the plea process and potential additional charges?\n\nA) Once the defendant pleads guilty to theft of trade secrets, prosecutors can add any related charges without informing the defendant, and these are automatically included in the guilty plea.\n\nB) The court can accept a guilty plea without addressing the defendant personally, as long as the defense attorney confirms the defendant's understanding of the charges.\n\nC) Prosecutors can add new charges after the initial guilty plea, but the court must ensure the defendant understands the nature of every charge they are pleading guilty to before accepting the plea.\n\nD) If prosecutors add new charges after the initial guilty plea, the defendant is presumed to be pleading guilty to these additional charges without further court proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (Rule 11(b)(1)), a federal court must address the defendant personally in open court before accepting a guilty plea. The court must ensure that the defendant understands the nature of every charge they are pleading guilty to. While prosecutors might add new charges after an initial plea, these cannot be secretly included in the guilty plea without the defendant's knowledge and the court's explicit confirmation of the defendant's understanding. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest that charges can be added or presumed without the defendant's informed consent, which violates due process. Option B is incorrect because the court must address the defendant personally, not just rely on the defense attorney's confirmation."

The creator of it has made a number of false, or at minimum deliberately very misleading, claims about the legal system, with apparently an intent to convince people who believe him to have sex with him. He doesn't claim to be a lawyer of any type. \n\nThe video is long, but as an overview it, correctly, claims that any child born in the USA or with a USA citizen as a father is a US citizen. It then falsely claims this theoretical child will get free schooling and college scholarship without having to pay taxes and that the child's (non\\-citizen) parents will get a green card when the child turns 21, which is not really accurate, as the child can't benefit from free schooling without someone paying taxes, a green card is not guaranteed at 21, and the part about college scholarships seems completely false.\n\nThis all leads to the argument that foreign women should get pregnant by having sex with the poster of the video so that they can have a child who is a US citizen and reap all these wonderful benefits the US citizen child will supposedly gain.\n\nSome very lenient reading of the claims could *almost* say that the claims are all technically true, though I believe in context it is clearly deliberately misleading for self gain. However, it leaves me with two questions.\n\nFirst, in general, if we assume he had made an intentionally false statement about the the legal code for something like this would it be legal? I'm pretty sure it would be fraud if he gained financially, but does convincing someone to have sex with you from a misrepresentation of the law actually violate any law?\n\nSecond, would any statements made specifically in this situation be considered false/fraudulent from a legal standard? That is assuming that there were cause to file a complaint against him would he be able to claim that every statement taken in isolation have some slight bit of truth to them and so are not fraudulent? If he hadn't made the claim about college scholarships, which seems blatantly false to me, would he be able to claim that technically a child would get free schooling without the parent having to pay taxes if the parent abandoned the child in the US to be adopted, or is that still too far of a legal stretch to ever be accepted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fraud involves **gain**.

So lets say an Asian person sees a house rented out with a \"no Asians\" condition. Would it be legal for them to \"mask\" themselves as a White person, tell the landlord they're White, sign a paper saying they're White and then proceed to rent the place?\n\nNow... they'd be outright lying but at the same time what they're lying about is not supposed to have been asked in the first place. So does one wrong (discrimination) trump another (lying) in a court of law?\n\nUpdate: since it\u2019s not clear, I\u2019m talking about a scenario where the \u201cAsian\u201d person is willing to admit they lied in a court of law. This isn\u2019t a question on how race is legally defined.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Lying may be wrong, but it in the United States, it is generally not illegal. [*United States v. Alvarez*, 132 S. Ct. 2537 (2012\\)](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-alvarez).\n\nFor a lie to be illegal, it generally needs to fall into one of a few specific categories, usually involving either [fraud](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1341) or the frustration of legitimate government activities (as in [perjury](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621), [falsification of records](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1519), or [lying to a federal agent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001)).\n\nIn any of these cases, the First Amendment is generally going to prohibit any penalties unless the false statement is material, i.e., it had the potential to change the outcome of the event in which it was uttered. As you noted, it is generally illegal to discriminate against Asians, so I would expect a court to treat the tenant's ethnicity as immaterial and require the landlord to honor the rental contract.\n\nOf course, this assumes that the landlord is prohibited from disciminating against Asians, which is not always true. The Fair Housing Act has [exemptions](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3603) for (a) private clubs; (b) for buildings with four or fewer units, one of which the landlord occupies; (c) for single\\-family homes that the landlord is renting without the help of an agent; and (d) for religious organizations.\n\nIn such a case, the landlord may be actually be permitted to disciminate against Asians, so the tenant's false statement about their ethnicity would become material the transaction, and a court may therefore permit the landlord to rescind the contract.\n\n(Note, though, that even though the FHA permits *discrimination* in those limited situations, it does not permit *advertising* discriminatory preferences. The landlord's \"No Asians\" language is therefore illegal, whether it is communicated on a sign in the window or in a classified ad or by word of mouth.)",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The landlord's discrimination is illegal, but the applicant's lie is legal, so the rental agreement must be honored.\n\nB) Both the landlord's discrimination and the applicant's lie are illegal, so the rental agreement is void.\n\nC) The landlord's discrimination may be legal under FHA exemptions, but their advertisement is illegal. The applicant's lie could be considered material and potentially allow the landlord to rescind the contract.\n\nD) The landlord's actions are completely legal due to FHA exemptions, and the applicant's lie is illegal fraud, allowing the landlord to void the contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This situation involves several nuanced legal points:\n\n1. The Fair Housing Act (FHA) has exemptions for single-family homes rented without an agent, which may allow the landlord to discriminate.\n2. However, advertising discriminatory preferences is always illegal under the FHA, even in exempt situations.\n3. The applicant's lie about ethnicity isn't automatically illegal, as lying itself is generally not a crime.\n4. However, if the landlord is exempt from FHA non-discrimination rules, the lie could be considered material to the transaction.\n5. In such a case, a court might allow the landlord to rescind the contract based on the material misrepresentation.\n\nOption C captures these nuances most accurately, acknowledging the potential legality of the discrimination itself, the illegality of the advertisement, and the possible materiality of the applicant's lie."

The service is offered exclusively to users located in Australia, who must provide an Australian phone number when subscribing.\n> \n> \n> An Australian subscriber of the service travels to Germany on holiday and continues using the service.\n> \n> \n> Although the Australian subscriber will be using the service while in the EU, the service is not \u2018targeting\u2019 individuals in the Union, but targets only individuals in Australia, and so the processing of personal data by the Australian company does not fall within the scope of the GDPR.\n\nAlso relevant is Example 10, which says that app downloads in the EU might not be subject to GDPR:\n\n> A U.S. citizen is travelling through Europe during his holidays. While in Europe, he downloads and uses a news app that is offered by a U.S. company. The app is exclusively directed at\n> the U.S. market, evident by the app terms of use and the indication of US Dollar as the sole currency available for payment. The collection of the U.S. tourist's personal data via the app by the U.S. company is not subject to the GDPR.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A US-based mobile app company develops a gaming application primarily for the US market. The app collects user data for personalized experiences but doesn't explicitly target European users. Under which scenario would the company most likely need to comply with GDPR?\n\nA) A US user downloads the app while in the US, then travels to Germany and continues using it without any changes to data collection.\n\nB) The company decides to translate the app into German and advertise it on German websites.\n\nC) A European user downloads the app while visiting the US, then returns home and uses it occasionally.\n\nD) The company adds an option in the app settings to display prices in Euros, but doesn't actively market to European users.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) This scenario is similar to the Australian news service example in the EDPB guidelines. Since the app isn't targeting individuals in the EU, GDPR likely wouldn't apply even when a US user travels there.\n\nB) This is correct because actively translating the app into German and advertising on German websites would likely be considered \"offering goods or services to persons in Europe\" under GDPR Article 3(2)(a), thus bringing the company under GDPR jurisdiction.\n\nC) Similar to the US citizen traveling in Europe example, if the app is exclusively directed at the US market, the collection of a European tourist's data while they're in the US wouldn't be subject to GDPR.\n\nD) While adding a Euro pricing option might seem like targeting European users, this alone probably isn't enough to constitute \"offering goods or services\" to EU individuals, especially if there's no active marketing to European users.\n\nThe key factor is whether the company is actively targeting or monitoring individuals in Europe, not just incidentally allowing European users to access the service."

That means, I would have to compile a large data set containing all or most of the works of Seuss, and store it all in a text file, or series of files. For simplicity's sake let's say 1 file containing all the books/poems concatenated together. All copyrighted, all intellectual property (IP) of someone else.\n\nHere's a precursor question:\n**Is it legal to even create that document, for personal/educational/fair use?**\n\nAssuming it is, even vaguely, then imagine a case where I create said document, and plug it into a neural network to generate Seuss\\-like works, and now I want to share the application on GitHub, publically, so other people can train their own Seuss neural network. That would mean sharing the IP dataset too, because I can't very well expect everyone who wants to clone my repository to generate their own Seuss dataset, because that's not a trivial thing to do.\n\nThe last question (which I linked above) told me that no, sharing it in this way is sketchy and ambiguous at best, if I wanted to claim fair use.\n\n---\n\nSo then it became, \"How can I do what I want to do, but without copyright infringement?\" I had a couple of ideas on that, relating to encrypting the IP dataset.\n\nOne idea was to write a batch processing script that would do a simple en/decryption on a plaintext file, and include that with the repo.\n\nAnother idea was to encrypt the data initially before putting it in the repo, and include the decrypt script, as a subprocess to be run each time the neural network generates \\[samples] some original\\* data.\n\n\\*original being used loosely here, as poorly managed neural nets are prone to overfitting, or providing samples which are not unique enough to be considered original data...\n\nThis was sort of a crazy idea to me, to think that I could potentially train a NN on encrypted (seemingly junk) data, and then when it generates its own gobbledygook, being able to run the decrypt script on it which would turn out to be accurate, legible, and coherent. But it lines up perfectly with what I am trying to do. (**Is encrypted intellectual property still intellectual property in this case?**) \n\nWithin the repo, the encrypted IP data is junk, meaningless and without context. Within the neural network, which would be training on the encrypted data, it's also arguably meaningless. At least, is not utilizing or infringing on any intellectual property in any straightforward way. Only when the user tells the neural network to generate some Seuss\\-like text, it spits out what it has learned. But what it has learned will be, for all intensive porpoises, an illegible layer of encrypted nonsense. Only after running the output through the decrypt will it even remotely resemble the works of Seuss.\n\nSo... what about all that? :) **Does any of this resemble something legal?** Or are they just pipe dreams with little basis in the reality of law?\n\nAgain, remember that due to overfitting, the sort of black\\-box system I've described could potentially output data that decrypts into verbatim Seuss intellectual property. But in reality, the level of 'closeness' to Seuss falls along a spectrum, which I informally call 'variable likeness.' If the sample is too exact, its overfit (which is a bad thing unless the user just wanted a really complicated program to print out exact Seuss stuff all along). On the other hand, if it is incomprehensible or nonsensical, it needs to keep learning, or start learning differently.\n\nAlso remember that the decrypt script would still exist somewhere in the repo, and someone could potentially use it or modify it to decrypt the actual IP dataset. But to be fair, that's their potential infringement, not mine.\n\nFinal question, which may seem weird: Does the copyright holder of Dr. Seuss' work also hold the copyright to anything resembling the 'variable likenesses' of Seuss as I have described? In other words, **could decrypted samples generated from this network constitute Seuss IP, seeing as all the machine learned on was encrypted Seuss IP in the first place**?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If it is fair use to copy it *en clair* then it is fair use to copy it enciphered. If it is not fair use *en clair* then it is not fair use enciphered.\n\nEnciphered works are derivative works of the original and permission of the copyright owner or fair use is required to create the encipherment. Yes it is still IP.",

To avoid copyright infringement, they consider encrypting the text before including it in their public GitHub repository. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this approach?\n\nA) Encrypting copyrighted material removes all copyright protection and makes it legal to distribute freely.\n\nB) Encrypting the text creates a new work that is not subject to the original copyright.\n\nC) Encrypting copyrighted material is considered fair use and does not require permission from the copyright holder.\n\nD) Encrypting copyrighted material does not change its status as intellectual property and still requires permission or fair use justification.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, encrypting copyrighted material does not change its status as intellectual property. The encrypted version is considered a derivative work of the original, and creating or distributing it still requires either permission from the copyright holder or a valid fair use justification. Encryption does not remove copyright protection or create a new, independently copyrightable work. The key principle is that if using the material in its original form would not be considered fair use, then using an encrypted version would also not be considered fair use."

Obviously, the plaintiff is not aware of the fact that we are their landlord and not employer. They are suing all 3 of us for monetary damage due to lost profits.\n\nAlso, to my surprise the competing beauty salon is represented by a legit lawyer registered at <http://www.calbar.ca.gov/>\n\n**To make it clear, I am not asking for legal advice. I am currently inquiring if our business insurance would cover legal defense and, most likely, will end up seeking professional legal defense. However, in the mean time I have 2 generic questions about court process in California to understand the process better:**\n\n1. If someone is incorrectly listed as defendant, then what is the correct way to remove his name from lawsuit? Should one ask plaintiff to voluntarily remove him as defendant? Or is it safer for defendant to file something like \"motion to dismiss\"?\n2. If plaintiff's lawyer has not done due diligence and is misrepresenting relationship between listed defendants, then would that qualify as frivolous lawsuit? Would this lawyer risk sanctions imposed on him by State Bar of California? Would the plaintiff have to cover legal defense expenses for the defendant that was incorrectly listed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The only way in which you could be \"incorrectly listed as a defendant\" is if somehow your name was typed in as a party (there would be a glaring gap, that no paragraph of the complaint says anything about you as a defendant). Assuming the situation is nothing so bizarre as a typo, you *are* a defendant. Whether or not you are liable in this case is a matter of fact and law, and the plaintiff's attorney has probably done due diligence in suing everybody imaginable.\n\nPerhaps the plaintiff lied to his attorney about material facts (read the complaint); or perhaps there is a credible legal theory under which you would be liable (read the complaint). Your attorney will take care of your problems, to the best of his ability. He may be able to persuade the plaintiff's attorney that they stand no realistic hope of winning and some chance of getting smacked for pointlessly involving you. If the plaintiff's attorney isn't persuaded by the argument, your attorney could submit the legal arguments as a motion to dismiss. If the judge is not persuaded (at this stage), you (your attorney) will have to counter the arguments presented at trial.",

This approach allows for a proper legal assessment of the situation. The answer highlights that being named as a defendant doesn't necessarily mean one is \"incorrectly listed,\" but rather that liability needs to be determined based on facts and law.

The users of my website are not required to log in or provide any kind of personal information, they are just readers of my content.\n\nI used to be under the impression that I do not need to worry about GDPR, but articles like [this one](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77282/under-the-gdpr-in-germany-is-a-privacy-policy-required-when-not-tracking-any-pe) lead me to now believe otherwise. What concerns me even more is that my hosting provider is a US company, and the server is physically located in US. So all user information like IP addresses and browser specifications is stored and processed in US.\n\nIs it even legal for me to use a US web server, seeing that US is considered an \"unsafe\" environment by GDPR? What are the measures that I need to take to ensure it's legal?\n\nAnd one extra question: If I want introduce the ability for my users to login and comment on my website, will I be able to use a US database to store user emails and comments?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'd rather not, but this might be compliant if you make sure that the personal data under your responsibility remains secure and protected even if it is processed abroad.\n\nSince the UK has left the EU, it is sometimes necessary to distinguish between implications of the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR. These are functionally equivalent, but in the matter of international data transfers the practical details have diverged.\n\nIn [my answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/77286) that you cited, I argued that any website processes personal data, and is thus potentially in\\-scope for the GDPR. If you cause another organization to process this personal data outside of the UK, you are performing an international data transfer (called \u201crestricted transfer\u201d in UK guidance). For example, such non\\-UK processing occurs if you use cloud services that run outside of the UK.\n\nThe UK ICO has [guidance on international data transfers](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers-after-uk-exit/#adequacy). As in an EU GDPR context, you can only perform the transfer if the data remains suitably protected, or one of the exceptions applies. The data remains suitably protected if the target country was attested and \u201cadequate\u201d level of data protection, or if you have implemented appropriate safeguards.\n\nAs of 2022, the list of countries considered adequate is generally equivalent to the EU list of adequacy decisions. Notably, the US is no longer on that list after the Schrems II decision that invalidated the Privacy Shield Agreement. Since this decision was made before Exit Day, it also applies in the UK.\n\nThis leaves \u201cappropriate safeguards\u201d for UK\u2192US restricted transfers. In the linked ICO page, read the section [Is the restricted transfer covered by appropriate safeguards?](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers-after-uk-exit/#appropriate). In brief, you will need to perform a Transfer Impact Assessment, and sign Standard Contractual Clauses with the US data importer.\n\n* In a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA), you check that the data remains protected despite the transfer into a country without an adequate level of data protection.\n\nThere is no official guidance on conducting a TIA, but the [IAPP has a template](https://iapp.org/resources/article/transfer-impact-assessment-templates/) and the EU EDPB has [recommendations on supplemental measures to protect data transfers](https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf), which might reduce the risk and affect a TIA in your favor.\n\nIt's worth noting that the EDPB recommendations were written in the wake of the Schrems II ruling, and can be summarized as \u201ccompliance is impossible when using US\\-based cloud services\u201d. But this is your assessment, and TBH it seems the UK is a bit more relaxed than the EU in this regard.\n* The Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are a pre\\-formulated contract that binds the foreign data importer to handle the data properly. In essence, this translates relevant aspects of the UK GDPR into contract law.\n\nMany service providers already provide a Data Processing Agreement that includes SCCs by reference, but you'll have to make sure that these contracts have been entered in a legally binding manner. Sometimes these apply automatically as part of the terms of service, sometimes you need to explicitly sign these documents.\n\nBut SCCs are one detail where UK GDPR compliance and EU GDPR compliance diverges a bit. The old EU SCC templates from 2004/2010 can no longer be used and have been replaced.\n\nFor compliance with the EU GDPR, the new [2021 SCCs](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) must be used.\n\nFor compliance with the UK GDPR, you have [two options](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/). You can either use the 2022 International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA), or you can use the 2021 EU SCCs along with the 2022 UK International Data Transfer Addendum which modifies the EU SCCs in some details.\n\nDon't want to deal with TIAs and SCCs? Switch to a hosting provider that only processes the personal data under your control in the UK, or in a country with an adequacy decision (e.g. EU, Canada, Israel).",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Professional negligence is somewhat related in the sense that it's generally recognizable in extremes, but is overall too abstract to define with much granularity. You can't measure it to tiny units.\n\nI want to understand how something like this is codified. I did see this question ([When is \"reasonable\" not implied in a contract?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16878/when-is-reasonable-not-implied-in-a-contract)) in which \"reasonable\" is treated as a means of smoothing over the complexities of certain definitions.\n\n**If one wanted to codify something abstract \\-\\- like professionalism, kindness, humor \\-\\- how would that be approached? \n Can one simply put \"reasonably\" in front?**\n\n---\n\nFor example: say I had \"kindness\" baked into a friendship agreement:\n\n```\nI will be your friend and bring you snacks as long as you are reasonably kind.  \nSigned me\n\n```\n\n... but they weren't kind and I wanted to cease bringing them snacks. Could I argue that they weren't reasonably kind? And how far can something like this be stretched before it's thrown out or ignored? Could one take it to such an *extreme* as `reasonably cool` and still have a serious verdict?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's a contract, vagueness is not something you want (from a legal perspective). If you want somebody to be \"reasonably kind\" you need to spell out what that means so that there is no question when it comes to breaking the contract. \n\nFor example, your contract should state something like:\n\n> I (Seph Reed, herein \"me\") will be John Doe's friend and provide\n>  snacks (defined in Section B) as long as John Doe:\n> \n> \n> * Does not call me names\n> * Invites me to at least 1 social activity per week\n> * etc...\n\nThe contract needs to be specific because if you want to ever break the contract you need to be able to prove a breach. Specifically in the above if \"John Doe\" texted that you are a \"STUCK\\-UP, HALF\\-WITTED, SCRUFFY\\-LOOKING NERF HERDER\", you could break your contract for a breach of item 1\\. \n\nHaving vagueness in a contract invites a lawsuit, one which may be expensive for you. Courts usually look at a contract most favorably for the person who **didn't** draft the contract. If you want to avoid expensive litigation, don't be vague, spell out *exactly what you want* and what constitutes a breach.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: You want to create a legally binding contract that includes abstract concepts like kindness or professionalism. Which of the following approaches would be most effective from a legal perspective?\n\nA) Use the term \"reasonably\" before abstract concepts (e.g., \"reasonably kind\" or \"reasonably professional\")\nB) Leave the abstract concepts undefined to allow for flexibility in interpretation\nC) Define the abstract concepts with specific, measurable behaviors or actions\nD) Rely on common understanding of abstract concepts without further clarification\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most effective approach from a legal perspective is to define abstract concepts with specific, measurable behaviors or actions. This aligns with the advice given in the documentation, which emphasizes the importance of avoiding vagueness in contracts. \n\nOption A, using \"reasonably,\" still leaves room for interpretation and potential disputes. Option B, leaving concepts undefined, invites lawsuits and expensive litigation. Option D, relying on common understanding, is also too vague for legal purposes.\n\nThe correct approach (C) involves spelling out exactly what is expected, such as listing specific behaviors that constitute \"kindness\" or \"professionalism.\" This makes it easier to prove a breach of contract and reduces the risk of costly legal disputes. The documentation provides an example of how to do this, listing specific actions like \"Does not call me names\" to define kindness in a friendship agreement."

Is the seller liable or obligated\n> to disclose this and if so what are my options?\n\nProbably not.\n\nThe general rule is that you accept any condition which could be discovered with reasonable inspection. When \"At the time of sale I waived inspection and did As\\-Is\" you are greatly limiting your claims.\n\nIf the seller believe that the work done fixed the problem, you probably have no remedy. It could be that the seller made a false representation in the disclosure (you'd have to look at the exact language) but even then proving it with only the kind of circumstantial evidence provided would be very challenging. In particular, as a practical matter, it isn't really economic to sue in a $10,000 non\\-disclosure case without open and shut clarity of fault, as opposed to some suggestive but ultimately inconclusive indicators.\n\nYou could always ask and state the case in a demand letter, but if you came to me as a potential client, I wouldn't take your case because the high cost combined with the low likelihood of success would make it unlikely that an attorney could bring the case in a way that would generate net value to the client.",

While purchasing a property \"as-is\" and waiving inspection greatly limits the buyer's claims, there may still be recourse if the seller knowingly made false representations in the property disclosure statement. However, proving this can be challenging and may not be economically feasible for smaller amounts like $10,000. Options A and B are incorrect because they present extreme positions that don't accurately reflect the nuanced legal reality. Option D is incorrect because finding evidence of repairs doesn't necessarily prove the seller knowingly misrepresented the property's condition, and winning such a lawsuit is far from easy or guaranteed."

Affirming that answer: It appears that the legal definition of perjury, for example in [18 USC \u00a71621](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621), applies only where \"a law ... authorizes an oath to be administered.\" So it would seem that nobody can make an affirmation \"under penalty of perjury\" unless the government permits it.\n\nCan or does perjury apply in [arbitration](/questions/tagged/arbitration \"show questions tagged 'arbitration'\") or other [alternative\\-dispute\\-resolution](/questions/tagged/alternative-dispute-resolution \"show questions tagged 'alternative-dispute-resolution'\") (ADR) proceedings?\n\nThere might be a law that explicitly says oaths administered in the course of bona fide ADR are made under penalty of perjury; if so that's the answer to this question.

The application of perjury laws in arbitration proceedings can vary depending on state laws and specific circumstances. As evidenced by RCW 7.04A.170 in Washington State, some jurisdictions explicitly authorize arbitrators to administer oaths and apply laws compelling testimony as if the arbitration were a civil action. However, this may not be uniform across all states or situations. The question acknowledges that \"There may be states or circumstances where arbitrators are not authorized to administer oaths,\" indicating that the application of perjury laws in arbitration is not universal but depends on the specific legal framework in place.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it overgeneralizes by stating perjury laws never apply to arbitration, which is not true in all cases.\n\nAnswer B is also incorrect as it assumes perjury laws always apply to arbitration in the same manner as court cases, which is not universally true across all jurisdictions.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it falsely claims that perjury in arbitration is exclusively governed by federal law, when in fact state laws play a significant role in determining the applicability of perjury laws in arbitration proceedings."

Usually, ignorance of the law is no excuse. But for criminal offenses, ignorance of the facts is an excuse.

Without realizing it, I cross the border into NY, and I don't have a NY hunting license. I haven't committed a criminal offense because I didn't intend to hunt deer in NY.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenant's rights and the security deposit?\n\nA) The tenant must vacate within 30 days and will automatically forfeit their security deposit due to the sale of the property.\n\nB) The tenant has the right to stay until October 1st, and the return of the deposit depends on the condition of the property upon move-out, as per local laws.\n\nC) The tenant must negotiate a new lease with the new owner, but is entitled to an immediate return of the full security deposit.\n\nD) The tenant can stay indefinitely under the terms of the original lease, regardless of the property sale.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because in most common-law jurisdictions, a property sale does not automatically terminate an existing lease. The new owner typically purchases the property subject to any existing leases. Therefore, the tenant likely has the right to stay until the end of their lease term (October 1st). The 30-day notice to vacate would generally be considered illegal in this scenario.\n\nRegarding the security deposit, its return is typically governed by local laws and depends on the condition of the property when the tenant moves out. It is not automatically forfeited due to a property sale, nor is it immediately returned in full.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they misrepresent the tenant's rights and the handling of the security deposit. Option D is incorrect because while the tenant can likely stay until the end of the lease, they cannot stay indefinitely beyond the lease term without a new agreement.\n\nThis question tests understanding of tenant rights during property sales, lease obligations, and security deposit regulations, emphasizing the complexity and locality-dependent nature of residential tenancy laws."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a divorce proceeding, John's wife Sarah has confided sensitive information to her friend Mary about John's infidelity. If John's lawyer attempts to subpoena Mary to testify about what Sarah told her, what is the most likely outcome?\n\nA) Mary will be compelled to testify, as she is a direct witness to Sarah's statements.\nB) Mary's testimony will be admissible as evidence against John in the divorce proceedings.\nC) Mary's testimony will likely be considered hearsay and inadmissible in court.\nD) Mary will be protected by therapist-patient privilege and cannot be forced to testify.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Mary's testimony about what Sarah told her would likely be considered hearsay and inadmissible in court. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, Mary's knowledge comes solely from what Sarah told her, not from firsthand observation of John's actions. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while Mary is a direct witness to Sarah's statements, those statements themselves are hearsay when it comes to proving John's actions.\n\nOption B is incorrect for the same reason - hearsay evidence is generally not admissible in court proceedings.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Mary is not acting as a licensed therapist, so therapist-patient privilege would not apply in this situation. The relationship is described as an \"unofficial therapist role,\" which does not carry legal protection.\n\nThis question tests understanding of hearsay rules and their application in legal proceedings, particularly in the context of divorce cases and informal confidences between friends."

The next day I received an email from the company sending me an invoice with the price almost doubled explaining \"There had been an increase in price to $70 \\+ GST\". My question is, is this legal? Is a store owner allowed to change the price after an order? Am I legally obliged to pay the invoice now?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This question is usually regulated by each respective countries equivalent *Sale of Goods Act*. An example from one of Australia's States: [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol\\_act/soga1923128/s13\\.html](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/soga1923128/s13.html)\n\n13 Ascertainment of price\n\n(1\\) The price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract, or may be left to be fixed in manner thereby agreed, or may be determined by the course of dealing between the parties.\n(2\\) Where the price is not determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the buyer must pay a reasonable price. What is a reasonable price is a question of fact dependent on the circumstances of each particular case.\n\nAccording to the Statute, that means that the agreement you entered into either had a **fixed** price of $42 \\+ GST, or a **non\\-fixed price**. If it had a fixed price, then the price must be $42 \\+ GST. If it is not a fixed price, then per (2\\), you (the buyer) must pay a 'reasonable price'.\n\nReally this probably mirrors the Common Law. In a contract, when a valid agreement is made, one party cannot unilaterally vary the terms of the contract. That means they cannot unilaterally change the price, UNLESS there is a term in the contract that allows them to do so. Alternatively, in the event that price is silent, the contract would either be void for being uncertain, or a reasonable price would be implied.\n\nTo answer your question succinctly then, I'd say you probably had a contract with a fixed price, and therefore the seller is under a duty to sell you the goods at $42 \\+ GST, and so you are NOT obliged to pay the new price.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer orders a product online for $100 + 10% tax. The next day, before shipping, the company emails the consumer stating that due to a supplier error, the new price is $150 + 10% tax. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The consumer is legally obligated to pay the new price as the company has the right to adjust prices at any time before shipping.\n\nB) The original contract is void due to the price discrepancy, and the consumer has no obligation to proceed with the purchase.\n\nC) The consumer can insist on the original price, but only if they can prove they suffered a financial loss due to the price change.\n\nD) The consumer likely has a valid contract at the original price, and the company cannot unilaterally change the terms unless the contract specifically allows for price adjustments.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Based on the principles outlined in the Sale of Goods Act and common contract law, once a valid agreement is made with a fixed price, one party cannot unilaterally change the terms of the contract, including the price. The original order at $100 + 10% tax likely constitutes a binding contract with a fixed price. The company cannot arbitrarily increase the price unless there was a specific clause in the terms of sale allowing for such adjustments. The consumer would be within their rights to insist on the original price or cancel the order if the company refuses to honor it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because companies don't have an automatic right to adjust prices after a contract is formed. Option B is wrong because a price discrepancy doesn't necessarily void the contract; in fact, the original price would likely be enforced. Option C is incorrect because the consumer doesn't need to prove financial loss to enforce the original contract terms."

The bank refuses to open the account upon learning of the company's ownership structure. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The bank's refusal is illegal as it constitutes discrimination against a foreign-owned company.\n\nB) The bank is required by law to open an account for any legally registered UK company, regardless of ownership.\n\nC) The bank's refusal is likely legal, as businesses can generally choose their clients unless the refusal is based on protected characteristics.\n\nD) The foreign ownership of the UK company makes it ineligible for any banking services within the United Kingdom.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, banks (like any other business) have the right to choose who they will and won't do business with. This discretion is legal unless the refusal is based on discrimination against a protected characteristic. Since juridical persons (such as companies) typically don't have protected characteristics (except for nationality), it's generally not illegal for a bank to refuse service to a company, even if it's foreign-owned. The bank's decision may be based on various factors, including risk assessment or internal policies, rather than illegal discrimination. Options A and B are incorrect as they misstate the legal obligations of banks. Option D is overly broad and inaccurate, as foreign ownership doesn't automatically disqualify a UK-registered company from all banking services in the country."

Will the man likely be able to get reduced child support\n> and/or alimony on the claim that he was tricked into a marriage he\n> would not otherwise have undertaken?\n\nGenerally speaking, marriages induced by fraud about anything other than the extreme case of fraud involving who someone is marrying in the act of marriage itself (i.e. someone believed they were marrying John Smith from Denver but actually was married to John Smith from Los Angeles, whom they had never met before, because the marriage ceremony was conducted with disguises and they didn't look closely at the marriage certificate), has no impact on marital rights. Evidence regarding fraud to induce a marriage wouldn't even be admissible at trial because it wouldn't be legally relevant.\n\nThis has no impact on alimony.\n\nPaternity can be contested by filing a paternity suit within the statute of limitations for doing so which varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction (usually within two to five years of the child's birth). If the husband prevails in a timely paternity contest, child support will not be owed. Otherwise, actual genetic paternity would be irrelevant.\n\nIn California, the statute of limitations to disavow paternity of a child born to one's wife is two years from the date of birth.\n\nN.B. I am making some interpretations of inexact language in the question. It says:\n\n> The couple then gets divorced and the wife sues for alimony and child\n> support.\n\nBut I assume that what is really meant is that one or both of the members of the couple file for divorce and that in the course of the divorce proceeding the wife seeks alimony and child support.

Since the man discovered he was not the biological father after two and a half years, he has missed the deadline to contest paternity. Therefore, he will likely be required to pay child support regardless of biological paternity. Option A is incorrect because there is a time limit, not just a requirement for DNA evidence. Option C is incorrect because while some states may have a five-year limit, California specifically has a two-year limit.

There is a legal concept of promissory estoppel which boils down to promises being binding. However, there has to be a clear and definite promise, not for example a statement like \"we hope to bring you back after this is over\". \n\nNormally, the employer can argue that they have the right to fire you regardless of performance, and that would be the end of it. Let's say you have it in writing, and it is clear that they unconditionally promise to hire you back: you would want to (e)stop them from arguing that they have the right to fire you. The underlying idea of promissory estoppel is that such a promise keeps them from making that argument. But: it is not enough that they made the promise, you also had to rely on the promise and act / forbear from acting in some way because of that promise.
