There would need to be checks and balances to that power for the sake of justice, personal privacy, etc, lest we end up ruled by the press.\n\nThe implication, and the point of the bolded part, is that these checks and balances must inherently weaken the protection offered by the First Amendment. So the Amendment can be seen as either an all\\-but\\-inviolable protection of the specific freedoms enumerated within, or as a general get\\-out\\-of\\-jail\\-free card that can be voided as community interests demand. It can not reasonably be both strong *and* overly broad.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the passage, what is the potential consequence of interpreting the First Amendment as an \"all-purpose shield\" for journalists?\n\nA) It would strengthen the protection of free speech for all citizens.\nB) It would lead to a weaker First Amendment due to the need for balancing against other interests.\nC) It would eliminate all libel suits against journalists.\nD) It would increase government censorship of the press.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The passage argues that if the First Amendment is seen as an all-encompassing protection for journalists against various legal actions (libel suits, depositions, searches), it would ultimately weaken the amendment. This is because such broad power given to the press would need to be balanced against other private and social interests in the community. The author suggests that this balancing act would result in a weaker shield of protection overall, potentially compromising the core function of the First Amendment, which is to protect free speech on matters of political and social controversy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage doesn't suggest it would strengthen protection for all citizens, only potentially for journalists.\nOption C is incorrect because while the passage mentions protection from libel suits, it doesn't claim they would be eliminated entirely.\nOption D is incorrect as the passage doesn't discuss increased government censorship as a consequence of this interpretation."

(Please correct me if I'm mistaken.) However, it would be illegal for the bakery to refuse service to customers based on the color of their skin, sexual orientation, gender, etc. \n\nCould someone explain to me the legal distinctions therein? I believe there is something about the latter type being discrimination based on a \"permanent condition\" but that's the sort of thing I'm looking for some clarity about. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Federally, in places of public accommodation, discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin is prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964\\.\n\nThis was upheld in *[Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/379/241/case.html)* 379 U.S. 241\\. As summarized in that case, \"Public Accommodations\" cover:\n\n1. any inn, hotel, motel, or other establishment which provides lodging to transient guests, other than an establishment located within a building which contains not more than five rooms for rent or hire and which is actually occupied by the proprietor of such establishment as his residence\n2. any restaurant, cafeteria . . .\n3. any motion picture house . . .\n4. any establishment . . . which is physically located within the premises of any establishment otherwise covered by this subsection, or . . . within the premises of which is physically located any such covered establishment . . .\n\nIn Oregon, there are additional restrictions imposed by the [Equality Act of 2007](http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/659A.403):\n\n> Except as provided in subsection (2\\) of this section, all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any place of public accommodation, without any distinction, discrimination or restriction on account of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age if the individual is 18 years of age or older.\n\nIn Oregon, a \"place of public accommodation\" includes:\n\n> Any place or service offering to the public accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges whether in the nature of goods, services, lodgings, amusements, transportation or otherwise.\n\nOther states may not have these extra prohibitions or different prohibitions. They may also have statutory exceptions for peoples' sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\n*Why* the legislature chose to specifically protect these classes is a policy question better asked on Politics.SE.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A bakery owner in Oregon refuses to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, citing religious beliefs. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) The bakery owner's action is legally protected under federal law, as religious freedom takes precedence over anti-discrimination laws.\n\nB) The bakery owner's action is illegal under Oregon state law, but would be legal in most other states that don't have specific protections for sexual orientation.\n\nC) The bakery owner's action is legal as long as they can prove their religious beliefs are sincere and deeply held.\n\nD) The bakery owner's action is illegal under both federal and Oregon state law, as sexual orientation is a protected class in all public accommodations nationwide.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the Oregon Equality Act of 2007, sexual orientation is a protected class in places of public accommodation, which includes businesses offering goods and services to the public. Therefore, refusing service based on sexual orientation is illegal in Oregon. However, federal law (the Civil Rights Act of 1964) does not explicitly include sexual orientation as a protected class for public accommodations. Many states do not have laws protecting against discrimination based on sexual orientation, so this action might be legal in those states. Option A is incorrect because religious freedom does not automatically override anti-discrimination laws. Option C is incorrect because Oregon law does not provide exceptions for religious beliefs in this context. Option D is incorrect because federal law does not currently protect sexual orientation in all public accommodations nationwide."

The termination clause is supposed to be 90 days, but the contract has a typo that introduces some ambiguity:\n\n> Either party may terminate this Agreement, or any Services to be performed hereunder, in whole or in part, without cause and for its own convenience, by providing the other written notice of termination at least **thirty (90\\) days** in advance, specifying the extent to which the Agreement is so terminated and the date upon which such termination becomes effective\n\nThis is further complicated by the fact that the original agreement was struck between myself and an out\\-going manager. We verbally agreed the terms of the contract (although we didn't specifically discuss termination period), and when I sent it over for signing, he accepted and I have a screen print from a Slack conversation with him where he states \"Looks fine to me \\- 3 months notice period under normal conditions is fair\".\n\nA new manager has since come in and wants to change the agreement. Firstly, he wants to reduce the amount of hours, which IMO seems fair. However he also wants to add a clause in that could potentially impact my ability to fulfill my side of the agreement, so I am not willing to accept that term. He is insisting on this clause, I am refusing to accept. \n\nHe also keeps insisting that the contract has a 30 day termination period despite me explaining all of the above to him (my understanding all along has been that it is 90 days).\n\nThis impasse has got me reviewing my options. It's looking like the contract will be terminated and I'd like some advice on whether I am within my rights to insist on a 90 day termination period, despite the typo in the contract.\n\nWhatever the outcome may be, I'll definitely be chalking this one up to experience!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Tricky. Let's assume this goes to court. \n\nObviously there's a mistake (do yourself a favour and don't call it a typo). We have \"thirty (90\\)\", not \"thirty (30\\)\" or \"ninety (90\\)\". If you insist on calling it a typo, 90 instead of 30 is a typo, thirty instead of ninety isn't. It's a completely different word. On the other hand, 3 and 9 are in quite different places on the keyboard... If that was the only question, you would probably lose. \n\nTwo things are in your favour: Your external evidence (a screenshot saying \"3 months\") could be used to find out what the intent was. Maybe he was confused? Well, maybe he wasn't. If he typed \"3 months\" it is much more likely that he meant 3 months, and not 1 month.\n\nAnd finally, if something is unclear in a contract, that should be held against the person who wrote the contract. If you wrote that contract, you lose. If the company wrote the company, you win. \n\nNow the best way for you is if you can convince the company that my interpretation is right and avoid court altogether :\\-)",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: H.R.1865, known as the \"Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017\", recently passed both chambers of Congress and was signed into law by president trump. I'm not a lawyer, nor do I have much experience with the law, but the fact that this bill passed, almost unanimously, really concerns me. I want to clarify that I'm not advocating for prostitution or sex trafficking. I'm simply interested in the constitutional legality of the bill and the precedent that it sets.\n\nA summary of the bill and its actual contents can be found on Congress.gov: [H.R.1865 \\- Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1865).\n\nI have several questions about the legality of this bill. After reading through it, it seems to violate the constitution in a couple ways:\n\nSection 4, Subsection (b)\n=========================\n\n> \"Effective Date \\- The amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and the amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply regardless of whether the conduct alleged occurred, or is alleged to have occurred, before, on, or after such date of enactment.\"\n\nThis seems like a violation of Clause 3 of Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution which clearly states that Congress shall not pass any Ex Post Facto law. Meaning, a law that can be applied retroactively. **Am I missing something?**\n\nSection 2 and Section 3\n=======================\n\nThe purpose of these sections, and the bill in general, is to add an exemption to section 230 of the \"Communications Decency Act of 1996\" for websites that promote or facilitate prostitution or sex trafficking. The purpose of section 230 was to limit liability for the owners of a website in regards to content generated by the website's users. This new law essentially strips away that limitation. So, states can now prosecute an individual who owns or operates a website for content produced by the users of the site, if those users advertise prostitution or sex trafficking.\n\nThis seems like a clear violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution. **How can an individual be held legally liable for content, free speech, created by other individuals?** Consider the amount of content produced, even within a short period of time, by websites such as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc. How is it that they should be obligated to regulate the free speech of others?\n\n**What makes prostitution and sex trafficking the only crimes exempt?** Essentially, why not make all crimes exempt? That one simply defies logic, in my opinion.\n\nOther Concerns\n==============\n\nSection 4, Subsection (a) states:\n\n> \"Whoever, using a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, owns, manages, or operates an interactive computer service (as such term is defined in defined in section 230(f) the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(f))), or conspires or attempts to do so, with the intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both.\"\n\n**How is this a federal crime when the legality of prostitution is regulated by the states and is not among the enumerated powers of the federal government?** I'm guessing that because it stipulates that it must be a \"means of interstate or foreign commerce\", that it falls within federal jurisdiction?\n\nLastly, if indeed this law is unconstitutional, how does the public go about challenging it's legality? Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As for the ex post facto question, an ex post facto law is one that makes an act illegal when it was legal at the time of the commission. Let's now look at the clause:\n\n> (b) Effective date.\u2014The amendments made by this section shall take\n>  effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and the amendment\n>  made by subsection (a) shall apply regardless of whether the conduct\n>  alleged occurred, or is alleged to have occurred, before, on, or after\n>  such date of enactment.\n\nWhat amendment is made in section subsection a?\n\n> Section 230(e) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(e)) is\n>  amended by adding at the end the following:\n> \n> \n> \u201c(5\\) NO EFFECT ON SEX TRAFFICKING LAW.\u2014Nothing in this section (other\n>  than subsection (c)(2\\)(A)) shall be construed to impair or limit\u2014\n> \n> \n> \u201c(A) any claim in a civil action brought under section 1595 of title\n>  18, United States Code, if the conduct underlying the claim\n>  constitutes a violation of section 1591 of that title;\n> \n> \n> \u201c(B) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought under State law if\n>  the conduct underlying the charge would constitute a violation of\n>  section 1591 of title 18, United States Code; or\n> \n> \n> \u201c(C) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought under State law if\n>  the conduct underlying the charge would constitute a violation of\n>  section 2421A of title 18, United States Code, and promotion or\n>  facilitation of prostitution is illegal in the jurisdiction where the\n>  defendant\u2019s promotion or facilitation of prostitution was targeted.\u201d.\n\nThis does not make any act illegal. It say \"we don't mean by this that...\", and does not make any act illegal.\n\nThe basic definition of the crime is here:\n\n> \u00a72421A(a) Whoever, **using a facility or means of interstate or foreign\n>  commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce**, owns,\n>  manages, or operates an interactive computer service (as such term is\n>  defined in defined in section 230(f) the Communications Act of 1934\n>  (47 U.S.C. 230(f))), or conspires or attempts to do so, *with the\n>  intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person*\n>  shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 10\n>  years, or both\n\nlikewise \u00a72421A(a). The bold part is standard language invoking the Commerce Clause, which is the source of federal authority in what would otherwise be a state matter. The italicized part, referring to intent, indicates that the website owner/operator has to have a wrongful intent, so it's not just a penalty against those who own or operate a website for content produced by the users of the site, if those users advertise prostitution or sex trafficking.\n\nThe First Amendment has a number of limits, for example you are not free to threaten or defraud, or advertise murder for hire, of advertise employment, housing or lodging (etc) discriminatorily (e.g. \"Women need not apply\" is illegal). The question would be whether the government has a compelling interest in limiting free speech (I think the court would say yes), and is this the narrowest restriction possible that accomplishes that interest (again, yes). So it would probably pass strict scrutiny.\n\nThe purpose of the act is both to tune up the Communications Decency Act and to extend the [Mann Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-117), which makes certain forms of interstate sex a crime. So, 18 USC 2422 \n\n> (a)Whoever knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any\n>  individual to travel in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any\n>  Territory or Possession of the United States, to engage in\n>  prostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be\n>  charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so, shall be fined\n>  under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both\"; (b)\n>  Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or\n>  foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial\n>  jurisdiction of the United States knowingly persuades, induces,\n>  entices, or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 18\n>  years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any\n>  person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so,\n>  shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 10 years\n>  or for life.\n\nThis expands the federal limits on prostitution in a standard way.",

The Act does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause as it does not make previously legal acts illegal retroactively. It targets specific conduct with criminal intent (\"with the intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person\"), which addresses First Amendment concerns. The Act invokes the Commerce Clause (\"using a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce\") to establish federal jurisdiction, which is a standard approach for federal legislation on matters that might otherwise fall under state purview. Additionally, the analysis suggests that the Act would likely pass strict scrutiny for First Amendment considerations, as the government has a compelling interest in limiting this type of speech and the restriction appears to be narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) Once the lump sum is paid, the parent is completely absolved of any future child support obligations, regardless of changes in circumstances.\n\nB) The court will likely reject any attempt to pay future child support as a lump sum, as all child support arrangements must remain modifiable.\n\nC) The court may allow a lump sum payment for the maximum guideline amount, but it could still be subject to modification if circumstances change significantly.\n\nD) Lump sum payments are only allowed for past due child support, never for future obligations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, while most states don't allow unmodifiable lump sum payments for future child support, there may be an exception for very high-income families. In these cases, if the maximum guideline amount is paid as a lump sum, it might be allowed. However, it's important to note that even this arrangement could potentially be subject to modification if there are significant changes in circumstances, such as drastic changes in income or parenting time.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because child support obligations are generally always subject to modification, even after a lump sum payment.\n\nAnswer B is too absolute. While it's true that most child support arrangements must remain modifiable, the documentation suggests there may be exceptions for high-income cases.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it only addresses past due support. The question is specifically about future obligations, which are treated differently."

[In Albany](https://ecode360.com/7683700), construction and power equipment noise is prohibited between 10:00pm and 7:00am. There are various noises that are are just plain illegal (gong or siren whistle similar to that used on ambulances or vehicles of the Police and Fire Departments). The general noise limit is that\n\n> It shall be unlawful for any person to make, continue or cause or\n> permit to be made or continued any unreasonable, unnecessary or\n> unusual noise, between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., which\n> either annoys, disturbs, injures or endangers the comfort, repose,\n> health, peace or safety of a reasonable person of normal sensitivities\n> or to make, continue or cause to be made or continued, between the\n> hours of 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., whether in the operation of any\n> machine or the exercise of any trade or calling or in the use of or\n> operation of any radio, receiving set, musical instrument, phonograph,\n> television set or other machine or device for the production or\n> reproduction of sound or otherwise, any noise which either annoys,\n> injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health or safety of a\n> reasonable person of normal sensitivities, unless the making and\n> continuing of the same shall be necessary for the reasonable\n> protection or preservation of life or property or for the health,\n> safety or life of some person or made in connection with governmental\n> functions or activities conducted in furtherance of the public health,\n> safety, welfare or convenience.\n\nUsually, construction noise can be annoying but it is reasonable, necessary or usual. You can always complain to the authorities, and they can determine if the noise is unreasonable etc. Seattle (not in NY) has an ordinance that limits construction noise to 75 decibels, averaged over a one\\-hour period and measured 50 feet away, so that is the kind of ordinance that would most likely work to your benefit.",

According to the information provided, noise ordinances are determined at the municipal level. While there are specific time restrictions for construction noise (typically prohibited between 10:00pm and 7:00am), the general noise ordinance states that it's unlawful to make \"unreasonable, unnecessary or unusual noise\" that disturbs others, even during daytime hours. The tenant can complain to local authorities, who will then assess whether the construction noise falls into this category. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no blanket prohibition on construction noise during standard working hours. \n\nOption B is wrong because while construction noise is often considered reasonable, it's not always the case, and tenants do have recourse through local authorities. \n\nOption D is incorrect because while there are stricter regulations for nighttime noise, daytime noise is still subject to the \"unreasonable, unnecessary or unusual\" standard."

This is wrong.\n\nIn most countries (certainly in Germany), a binding contract generally *does not require a written document*. A contract can be entered into orally, or even silently (\"[Schl\u00fcssiges Handeln](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%BCssiges_Handeln)\", \"Implied\\-in\\-fact contract\").\n\nAll that is required for a contract is that one party made a proposal, and the other party indicated their agreement, implicitly or explicitly (\"[Willenserkl\u00e4rung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willenserkl%C3%A4rung)\").\n\nClicking \"yes\" on a website can mean entering into a contract if you could reasonably be expected to understand that you were accepting certain obligations (such as that of paying a fee).\n\nSo in your case, you probably entered into a valid contract, and will have to fulfill your obligation under it, which means paying.\n\n---\n\nFrom a practical point of view: If you choose not to pay, the organizers will probably either drop the claim (if you are lucky), or they will pursue it.\nIn that case, they can send you a \"[Mahnbescheid](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahnverfahren)\" for their claim. At that point you either pay within 14 days, or respond that you reject the claim, then there will be a trial, which you will probably lose, and pay a lot more than 40\u20ac. If you do not respond to the Mahnbescheid, you will receive a \"Vollstreckungsbescheid\", and then a visit by a Gerichtsvollzieher (officer of the court).\n\nMy advice would be to pay and learn to properly cancel registrations.",

Which of the following clauses would be most legally sound and comprehensive regarding pets in hotel rooms?\n\nA) \"Guests are strictly prohibited from bringing any animals into hotel rooms.\"\n\nB) \"Pets are not allowed in hotel rooms, except for service animals as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act.\"\n\nC) \"No pets are permitted in hotel rooms, except as required by federal, state, or local law.\"\n\nD) \"Animals are prohibited in hotel rooms unless the guest has obtained prior written approval from management.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \n\nOption A is too restrictive and doesn't account for legal exceptions, potentially violating laws like the ADA.\n\nOption B specifically mentions service animals and the ADA, but it's limited in scope. It doesn't account for potential future changes in law or variations in state or local regulations.\n\nOption C is the most comprehensive and legally sound. It allows for all current and future legal exceptions without specifying them, covering federal, state, and local laws. This flexibility ensures the contract remains valid even if laws change.\n\nOption D gives discretion to management but doesn't explicitly acknowledge legal requirements, which could lead to inconsistent application or potential legal issues.\n\nThe phrase \"except as required by federal, state, or local law\" serves an important purpose beyond just reminding the reader. It explicitly incorporates legal compliance into the contract terms, making it clear that the hotel will follow all applicable laws even if they contradict the general no-pets policy."

You can read about [Bridgeport v. Dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeport_Music,_Inc._v._Dimension_Films) as an example of someone being sued for copying and modifying 2 second's worth, without permission. However, there is disagreement depending on which district you are being sued in, see [VMG Salsoul v. Ciccone](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/case/vmg-salsoul-llc-v-ciccone/) where the court held that 230 milliseconds of copying was a trifling amount not prohibited by law. Your description suggests that this is not *de minimis* use.\n\nIf there is no direct evidence of copying (such as your confession), the court will rely on \"substantial similarity\" to determine whether you copied someone else's work.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) This is fair use and does not require permission from the original copyright holder.\nB) As long as less than 50% of the original song is used, it's legally acceptable without permission.\nC) This would likely be considered a derivative work and require permission from the copyright holder.\nD) If the modified version is at least 70% different from the original, it's considered a new work and is legal to use.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This situation would most likely be considered the creation of a derivative work, which is one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder according to 17 USC 106. Even if the specific lyrics and melodies are unrecognizable, the fact that the overall mood and tone are still present suggests a substantial similarity to the original work. The degree of transformation does not negate the need for permission from the copyright holder.

The article says that thsi follows from provision in the Patents Act 1977, the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988, the Registered Designs Act 1949, and the Regulation on Community Designs (6/2002/EC).\n\nA key provision here is \"during the course of their employment\". The article goes on to explain that:\n\n> Most IP disputes which arise between an employer and an employee hinge on whether the intellectual property in question has been created 'during the course of employment'. This is determined by a number of factors including whether the work falls within the job description of the employee, whether the work was created during working hours, whether the employee could have reasonably been expected to create the work and whether any agreement exists relating to the work between the employer and the employee. However, it is useful to note that just because a work is created during working hours does not necessarily mean that the intellectual property in that work is owned by the employer (though this may give rise to a disciplinary procedures for misuse of company time, computer equipment etc). Similarly, if work is produced outside working hours but falls squarely within the job description of the employee then it may be that the first owner of that intellectual property in the product of that work is the employer, notwithstanding the fact that the work was created, for example, in the evening.\n\nThe article also says that:\n\n> As a consultant is an independent party then unless otherwise agreed, all IP created by a consultant will be owned by them and not the company engaging the consultant.\n> \n> \n> Therefore, it is important that companies ensure that an appropriate consultancy agreement is entered into between the company and the consultant.\n\nIt seem clear that absent an agreement to the contrary, a UK employer will own work that is created as part of an employee's job, even if outside of working hours. However, it is not at all clear to me if a \"sweeping\" agreement which claims **all** IP, even if outside of hours and in no way related to the contracted job, will be considered valid and enforceable.\n\nIn such a case it may be best to obtain a specific agreement with the \"daytime\" employer (company D, let's say) that D makes no claim on work done by consultant C for second employer S. That has the possible downside of alerting D to the situation, and si something about which S should probably consult S's own lawyer.",

While UK law generally grants employers ownership of IP created during the course of employment, the enforceability of sweeping IP assignment clauses that extend beyond job-related tasks and working hours is not clearly established. The ownership could depend on factors such as the specific wording of Company A's contract, the nature of the work done for Company B, and whether it could be considered within the scope of the developer's employment with Company A.

Most of that phrase other than the final bit is self explanatory but the use of the word \"ordinary\" just seems quite odd. What is its intended meaning?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Between 1876 and 2009, there were three ways to be a \"Lord of Appeal\", a member of the House of Lords who was part of its committee exercising judicial functions. (Before 1948 it was not a formal committee; proceedings took place in the Lords chamber as part of the House's normal business.)\n\n1. You could be Lord Chancellor. The most recent LC to have done this was Derry Irvine, Lord Irvine of Lairg (e.g. in *Boddington v British Transport Police* \\[1998] UKHL 13\\).\n2. You could be a regular member of the House of Lords who was qualified to sit as a judge, by virtue of having held \"high judicial office\". In principle, this would include hereditary peers who had taken a legal career path, but most often meant life peers. That would include distinguished members of the judiciary who had been given a life peerage, former holders of the office of Lord Chancellor. and (since 1889\\) retired Lords of Appeal in Ordinary. For example, Lord Mackay of Clashfern (LC until 1997\\) continued to hear cases for several years on an ad\\-hoc basis. There were also current former Masters of the Rolls, Lords Chief Justice, and senior Scottish judges in this category.\n3. You could be appointed as a \"Lord of Appeal in Ordinary\", which means that you were named to the House of Lords in order to serve as a judge (and by convention, not to participate in debates and votes). The \"in Ordinary\" phrase expresses that you are a Lord of Appeal as your main job \\- not because it's an additional job on top of being a peer.\n\nBefore the reforms of the late 19th century, any peer could participate in judicial business, at the discretion of the House in general. Some peers with legal experience were de\\-facto regarded as \"law lords\", and were the ones who by consensus took charge of appeal cases. The last time a lord without this experience tried to do this was 1883, in *Bradlaugh v Clarke*: Lord Denman (whose father had been Lord Chief Justice but who himself had no legal qualifications) tried to vote but the Lord Chancellor ignored him. That follows a precedent of 1844 (*O'Connell v The Queen*) that other Lords should gracefully decline to contribute, once the Law Lords had given their opinions.\n\nEven in that century, the emerging and eventually formalized category of \"law lords\" did not capture the nuance of who was making judicial decisions. The committee was typically \"assisted\" by professional judges, drawn from the serving judiciary, who would privately give their opinions to the actual named Lords. This was also the system used in trials of peers, where the House sat as a court of first instance if a peer was charged with a felony: nominally, any lord could take part in proceedings, but in practice the process would be stage\\-managed by a qualified Lord, with a panel of normal judges quietly doing much of the real work.",

This was their primary role, as indicated by the phrase \"in Ordinary\" which meant it was their main job. By convention, they did not participate in debates and votes, focusing solely on their judicial duties. This differs from other types of Lords who could participate in judicial business, such as former Lord Chancellors (option C) or other peers with high judicial office (option D).

The case prohibited a showing of a \"special need\" for a concealed weapon to allow one to have a permit. Many California concealed carry laws have similar requirements.\n\nBut, California doesn't have just one concealed carry law. There is a default rule that applies in small, rural counties, but most larger cities and counties in California have their own specific concealed carry laws and the precise grounds for denying a concealed carry permit would matter.\n\nIn all likelihood, many provisions of existing California concealed carry laws would remain grounds to deny permission to concealed carry (e.g. age, history of drug abuse, criminal record, restraining orders in place, etc.), while others provisions would no longer constitute valid grounds for a denial.\n\nThis particular decision is about denying permits based upon lack of a particularized need for one different from other members of the general public, rather than about any possible reason that the permit applicant could be deemed untrustworthy to have a permit. The decision discusses the idea that it is problematic to have unfettered discretion in issuing permits, but doesn't really base its ultimate conclusion on that ground. So, something like a general residual \"good character\" requirement, while vague, wouldn't be squarely within the scope of the most recent decision.\n\nThe case also doesn't itself prohibit (nor does the case law) some reasonable fee for issuance of a concealed carry permit.\n\nThus, the new case does not require uniform law with \"constitutional carry\" for everyone permitted by federal law to own a gun. But, it does prohibit limitations related to a requirement to show a need to have a concealed carry permit.",

The Supreme Court's decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen specifically prohibited states from requiring applicants to show a special need or proper cause to obtain a concealed carry permit. This directly impacts similar requirements in many California jurisdictions.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the decision does not mandate that all non-disqualified residents must be issued permits. States can still have other reasonable requirements and grounds for denial.\n\nAnswer C is overly broad. While some existing grounds for denial may no longer be valid, others (such as age restrictions, criminal history, or substance abuse issues) are likely to remain permissible.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the decision does not require states to adopt permitless or \"constitutional\" carry. It still allows for a permitting process, just without the \"special need\" requirement.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the nuanced impact of the Supreme Court decision on existing state laws, particularly in California's complex system of local and state-level concealed carry regulations."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee receives a signing bonus with the following clause in their offer letter: \"Should you leave within your first year, you will pay back the full amount.\" Six months into their employment, the company undergoes restructuring and the employee is laid off. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the signing bonus?\n\nA) The employee must pay back the full amount of the signing bonus, as the clause applies to any form of departure within the first year.\n\nB) The employee can keep the full signing bonus, as involuntary termination is not typically considered \"leaving\" in legal terms.\n\nC) The employee must pay back a prorated amount of the signing bonus based on the number of months worked.\n\nD) The situation is ambiguous, but the employee has a strong case for keeping the bonus due to the principle that ambiguities are generally interpreted against the drafter of the contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While the clause \"Should you leave\" could be interpreted broadly, it's ambiguous whether it applies to involuntary termination. The purpose of a signing bonus is typically to incentivize an employee to join and stay with a company, and the employee in this case was willing to do so. The ambiguity in the contract language would likely be interpreted in favor of the employee, as ambiguities are generally interpreted against the drafter (in this case, the employer). Additionally, keeping the bonus could be seen as fair compensation for the disruption caused by the unexpected job loss. However, without a clear legal precedent or more specific contract language, the situation remains somewhat ambiguous, making option D the most accurate response."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A person has a validated court order from the Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT). The CRT does not have authority to enforce its orders but small claims court does. In the payment hearing the debtor told the judge that he had just filed to dispute the decision made by the CRT. The judge \"believed\" him and adjourned the hearing to a future date. To me this seems like abuse of of process, the CRT doesn't even issue a validated order until the deadline to dispute is passed. The judge did not seem too concerned about this point, though granted they were probably not familiar with the details of the CRT. Is this allowed to happen, and if not can anything be done?\n\nFrom the [CRT website](https://civilresolutionbc.ca/how-the-crt-works/how-the-process-ends/#how-do-i-enforce-my-small-claims-order)\n\n> You need to give the BC Provincial Court a validated copy of your CRT\n> order. This will be sent to you after the time limit for making a\n> Notice of Objection has expired (approximately 29 days after the date\n> of the CRT decision). If you don\u2019t receive a validated copy of your\n> order after 40 days, please contact us.\n\nThe judge ordered the debtor to supply the creditor with a copy of the dispute to the decision, and financial information. What if the debtor does not supply this information, can a debtor be found in contempt of court in small claims?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Just to hit the specific point in the question beyond what @DaleM mentioned, judges have very broad discretion to continue hearings and extend deadlines that have not already expired upon the request of a party, except in a very narrow class of cases that provide otherwise.\n\nThe standard for doing so in the jurisdictions where I have practiced is \"good cause\" and I suspect it is similar in B.C.\n\nAllowing a few days to figure out what is going on in the CRT matter and, in general, affording a party an opportunity to make arguments along those lines, while not immediately ruling on the merits, wouldn't be an abuse of discretion which would be the standard by which a decision to continue a hearing would be reviewed on appeal (except that it is really a higher standard to review it, because it is a non\\-appealable, non\\-final interlocutory order that could only be immediately reviewed for extraordinary causes).\n\nHearings get continued all the time, when the requests are made before the hearing is held or during the hearing, at this level of the court system. The reasons can be as mundane as \"my car broke down\", \"my babysitting arrangements fell through\", \"I'm actively working on getting a lawyer to help me,\" and \"a winter storm interfered with my ability to prepare for the hearing because the power went out at my home/office most of yesterday.\"\n\nCourts also not infrequently will continue a hearing *sua sponte* (i.e. without any party requesting it) because some emergency matter has come up on the judge's schedule (e.g. in the counties where I practice, domestic violence restraining orders have priority over almost everything and any available judge can be interrupted in the middle of another hearing for half an hour or so to deal with one), or in the judge's personal life (I once had a hearing where the judge started to collapse on the bench in the middle of a three day trial that had to be continued for five months after he was rushed to the hospital and then recovered.)\n\nAnother fairly common reason to continue a hearing, that happens maybe one hearing out of five or six in my world, is that it takes longer than anticipated for some reason for the parties to present their evidence and make arguments and the allocated time for the hearing runs out, due to no real fault of the parties, so additional time is squeezed in a week or two later.\n\nFor example, one of the courthouses where I practice frequently is next to a fire station and in the event of a major fire, the commotion as fire trucks rush out to respond to the fire can make it impossible to hear what is going on for as much as fifteen or twenty minutes, which can disrupt the schedule in a short hearing.\n\nIn contrast, if you miss a hearing or deadline entirely, your excuses have to be vastly more impressive (e.g. \"I was hit by a bus on the way to court and was taken to the hospital.\", something that I've had come up in cases I was involved in, although not personally, knock on wood, three or four times).\n\nIn general, there are lots of ways to slow down a judicial proceeding, and there are few effective ways to make it go faster or insist that it stays strictly on schedule.",

The judge decides to adjourn the hearing to a future date. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The judge has committed an abuse of process by adjourning the hearing.\nB) The judge has no discretion to adjourn the hearing once it has started.\nC) The judge has broad discretion to continue the hearing for various reasons, including allowing time to clarify the CRT dispute status.\nD) The judge can only adjourn the hearing if both parties agree to it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Judges have very broad discretion to continue hearings and extend deadlines, even after a hearing has begun. This discretion is typically based on a \"good cause\" standard. Allowing time to clarify the status of a CRT dispute falls within this discretion. While it may seem unusual given the CRT's process of only issuing validated orders after the dispute deadline has passed, the judge's decision to adjourn is not inherently improper or an abuse of process. Judges often continue hearings for various reasons, including gathering more information or allowing parties to present their arguments fully. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they misstate the extent of judicial discretion in these matters."

It could be a typo for \"prepared\", or a grammatical error in saying that they preferred *to* file a lawsuit. But \"prefer\" also seems to have a technical legal meaning, e.g. [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prefer) has \"To present or submit (something) to an authority (now usually in 'to prefer charges')\". However, that would seem at first glance to correspond to *filing* the lawsuit, which is just what the author said they could not do. So maybe there are separate steps involved?\n\nCan someone explain what is probably meant by this passage? What specific steps toward a lawsuit is the author saying that the plaintiffs took, and which steps were they unable to take?\n\nThe article's author is a lawyer, so I would assume by default that they are familiar with the terms, and that the usage is deliberate instead of a mistake. The lawsuit in question would have been in US federal court.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The word is not being used in the technical sense here, and is not a mistake.\n\nThe legal term you are thinking that they might have been intending to use is \"[proffered](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proffer)\". But that wasn't the word that they were trying to use.\n\nThe author is saying that their first choice of legal tactics would have been to file a civil lawsuit with a test plaintiff, who is a boy seeking to be admitted to the Young Women's Leadership School. But, because they could not manage to make this ideal legal tactic work, because they could find a boy willing to do so, they chose to take their Plan B legal tactic instead.",

The term \"preferred\" in this context is not being used in a technical legal sense, but rather in its common meaning of \"would have chosen\" or \"would have liked to.\" The ACLU is indicating that their first choice or preferred strategy would have been to file a lawsuit, but they were unable to do so because they couldn't find a male plaintiff willing to seek admission to the school.

In a co-ownership situation like this, all co-owners have equal rights to possess and enjoy the entire property, unless otherwise specified in the deed or by mutual agreement. Charlie cannot unilaterally demand rent from Alex and Beth for using a property that they co-own, unless there was a prior agreement among all three siblings regarding exclusive possession and rent payment. \n\nOption A is incorrect because Charlie doesn't automatically have the right to demand rent from co-owners using the shared property. \n\nOption B is partially correct in that Alex and Beth can refuse to pay rent, and Charlie does have the right to live in the house rent-free, but it's not a direct consequence of their refusal to pay rent. It's simply Charlie's right as a co-owner.\n\nOption D is incorrect because adverse possession typically doesn't apply among co-owners, and the time period and conditions for adverse possession vary by jurisdiction and are generally much longer than 18 years."

For example, if the now convicted defendant is granted bail before sentencing, could the judge at the sentencing stage overrule the verdict and set the defendant free?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is called a \"Directed Verdict\" and exists in all cases where a jury trial is present. A judge can make a directed verdict at any time up to and including the return of the verdict from the jury and the reading of the verdict in the court.\n\nA directed verdict can only be made in the defendant's favor (A Directed Verdict finds the defendant not guilty is the only option) and may be one of the few grounds for appeal available to the prosecution. Typically the judge makes them when they feel that the evidence presented is insufficient for any reasonable jury to convict the defendant.\n\nAlthough I wasn't able to find a U.K. procedures, I was able to find procedures in the U.S. Typically the first time this will happen is when the Prosecution Rests their case, the defense may make a motion for a directed verdict which allows the judge to rule on if one or more of the charges are dropped as the judge reasons the prosecution did not present evidence to convict.\n\nThe judge may also make a directed verdict at any point after the jury has received the case up to the point where the jury announces the verdict. Typically this occurs in civil suits when the jury awards damages in excess of legal limits, at which point the judge will alter the damages awarded to the maximum limit set by law (This was the case in the Depp v. Heard defamation case, where the jury awarded Depp punitive damages that were higher than the limit for such damages one could be awarded for Defamation by Virginia Law) but they do occur in criminal cases (typically the judge will not issue directed verdicts because they are hoping the jury realizes they shouldn't convict, and but the judge will if the jury some how convicts anyway.). Typically, in these are matters of law, not matters of fact (the jury deliberates on the facts of the case). For this reason, they are usually entered as \"Judgements as matter of law\" which basically says \"the law says this isn't a crime, so not guilty of a crime\".\n\nIn the U.S., a directed verdict entered after the jury receives the case for deliberation is one of the few times in U.S. law that the prosecution may initiate the appeals process.",

While these policies may not be directly enforceable as law for a small number of high-level appointees (like Cabinet members who serve at the pleasure of the President), they are indeed enforceable for the vast majority of government employees. For most staff, violating departmental policies can lead to administrative consequences such as suspension, fines, or dismissal. This system allows for internal discipline and accountability while recognizing the unique status of certain top-level positions. Options A and D are incorrect because they overgeneralize the lack of enforceability to all or most employees, which is not accurate. Option B is incorrect because it overstates the legal weight of departmental policies, conflating them with criminal law."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm concerned about the following text in a real estate transaction for a home I am selling in Florida. It will be difficult for me to be at closing so the title company sent me some documents to sign in front of a notary. All the documents are straightforward except 1 single document buried in the middle of the stack. It says:\n\n> The undersigned hereby authorizes \\[Real Estate agent name] or \\[Real Estate agents title company name] to execute any and all documents on my behalf in order to sell and convey the above real property\"\n\nIt has a line for date and my name but no other verbage or expiration date. I don't understand why this document is needed if I have to sign and notarize all the other documents.\n\n* If the closing falls through on the closing date for some reason (like issues with the buyers lender, etc) does this document give the agent or title company the power to extend the seller contract without my (the seller) consent?\n* If the money due to me at closing changes (i.e. they made a mistake or something else changed such that the funds due to me are less than I was notified about in the closing disclosure) do they have the right to sign and allow the closing to proceed even if it's not in my best interest?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It gives these people the authority to close the deal on your behalf as your agents. But an agent owes fiduciary duties to the person for whom the agent is acting. These duties including duties of loyalty to you and duties of care in conducting their activities on your behalf.\n\nAlmost all (although not necessarily every) instance in the \"parade of horribles\" that you could imagine from granting these people the authority to close the transaction on your behalf, would constitute breaches of fiduciary duties owed to you. If they happened, you would be bound by their actions, but very likely would have the right to sue these agents for a breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nA typical case where this might apply would be one where everything was proceeding according to plan, but while you were *en route* to the closing, you were hit by a bus, and went into a coma. But no one had a POA for you and no one went to a court to have a guardian or conservator appointed for you (perhaps because you had no other living adult family members).\n\nFun Fact: I've had approximately 14 clients, expert witnesses for my clients, or employees, hit by buses during my legal career.",

The authorization document grants the real estate agent the power to act on behalf of the seller, but it does not negate the agent's fiduciary duties. These duties include loyalty to the seller and the obligation to act in the seller's best interest. While the agent can execute documents, they must do so in a manner that upholds their fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nOption A is incorrect because extending the contract without the seller's consent would likely breach the agent's fiduciary duty. Option B is also incorrect for the same reason - proceeding with a closing that results in less money for the seller without their knowledge would be a breach of duty. Option D is incorrect because the authorization does not grant unlimited power; the agent's actions are still bound by their fiduciary obligations, and the seller would have legal recourse if these duties were breached."

The original will states that the partner can continue to occupy the home for three years following his death. After the three years, she will move out and I can/will sell the home. I assume she will be paying all the expenses.\n\nHe has recently added a twist...he will transfer his IRA to me, and I will share the homeowner expenses 50/50, with her, up until the IRA is exhausted, or she decides to move out. At that time, I will be able to sell the home.\n\nMy concern is that none of this is in writing, but an agreement on the honor system. Nothing in writing and no rental agreement. He does not want to change the will.\n\nMy concerns:\n1\\. She gets ill, exhausts her life savings, and cannot afford her share.\n2\\. She decides not to pay her share.\n3\\. She does not adequately preserve the home.\n4\\. Who covers major expenses..painting, appliances, furnace, etc? As I am the homeowner.\n5\\. I cannot evict her if needed, as she is a senior citizen, living in my home, with no lease.\n6\\. The potential financial burden in case of a catastrophic loss or my inability to quickly sell the home at the end. \n\nA side note....she would like to remain in the house, but acknowledges that the yearly expenses are too costly to do so without help. I understand his desire to accommodate her request to stay in the house, but, I think it is unreasonable to burden me with this very generous agreement.\n\nMy suggestion: sell her the house at a discounted rate and provide her with three years of expenses.....or....give her lifetime use of the home, at her total expense, and the house reverts to me upon her death or abandonment. \n\nDesperately need some advice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is going to depend very much on exactly what is in writing. Note that your father could, if he chose, directly leave both the house and the IRA to his partner. \n\nIf you become the homeowner after your father's death, and the \"3\\-year right to use\" and the cost sharing provisions are not in writing, then neither is legally binding. You and the partner may choose to honor your father's wishes, but if he does not put them in the will or another legal document, neither of you is bound.\n\nThe question says:\n\n> I cannot evict her if needed, as she is a senior citizen, living in my home, with no lease.\n\nI do not know of any jurisdiction in which there is a general ban on evicting a senior citizen in all cases. There will be some restrictions no doubt, but they will depend on the local laws. And of course you may not wish to exercise all the legal rights you may have.\n\nYou would ultimately, have the right as homeowner to evict the partner. I don't what procedures would need to be followed legally \\-\\- that will depend on the specific jurisdiction, which the question does not list. As the homeowner, you would be legally responsible for maintaining and paying taxes and other expenses on the house. The partner would be either your tenant or your guest.\n\nOnce you have title (and that will take some time after your father's death, in all probability) if the \"right to use\" was never put in writing, you could ask the partner to sign a lease. The terms could be whatever the two of you choose to agree on. If she becomes a tenant under such a lease, she has both legal rights and legal responsibilities, and each of you has the protection of a clear agreement.\n\nYou would be wise to consult a lawyer to learn exactly what the local law does and does not permit. Your father might well be wise to put his wishes more clearly in writing while he still can.",

The inheritor would become the full legal owner of the house upon receiving the inheritance, with all the rights and responsibilities that come with homeownership.

This aligns with the state's role in pursuing justice and protecting citizens' interests, even after a conviction has been secured. The answer emphasizes the importance of returning remains to loved ones, which is considered a significant aspect of the justice system's responsibilities. This explanation is supported by the fact that governments often invest considerable resources in locating and identifying remains of the deceased, even long after conflicts have ended, highlighting the enduring importance of this practice in serving justice and supporting victims' families."

For instance, the clause should state that his communications to your subsequent employer shall be only by email and with you Cc\\-ed. Keep in mind, though, that amendments of that sort do not prevent the client from *anonymously* abusing your disclosures of subsequent employment and ultimately sabotaging your relations there.",

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal and professional implications of this clause?\n\nA) The clause is standard in freelance contracts and poses no risk to future employment opportunities.\n\nB) The clause is illegal and unenforceable, and the developer should refuse to sign the contract.\n\nC) The clause is legal but unusual, and may present risks to future employment opportunities if the client misuses the information.\n\nD) The clause only applies if the developer works in the same industry as the client within the one-year period.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the clause is described as unusual, not standard.\nB is incorrect because the clause, while unusual, is stated to be lawful.\nC is correct because it accurately summarizes the key points from the documentation - the clause is legal but uncommon, and there are potential risks if the client misuses the information about future employment.\nD is incorrect because the clause as described applies to any subsequent employment, not just within the same industry.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the complexity of the situation, acknowledging both the legality of the clause and its potential risks to the freelancer's future opportunities."

In Washington, speed limits are implemented via [Chapter 46\\.61 RCW](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61&full=true), the very first section of which states:\n\n> The provisions of this chapter relating to the operation of vehicles\n> refer exclusively to the operation of vehicles upon highways except:\n> (1\\) Where a different place is specifically referred to in a given\n> section. (2\\) The provisions of RCW 46\\.52\\.010 through 46\\.52\\.090,\n> 46\\.61\\.500 through 46\\.61\\.525, and 46\\.61\\.5249 shall apply upon highways and elsewhere throughout the state\n\nWe then turn to the question of what a \"vehicle\" is (this is the discussion of a number of legal treatises). Title 46 is about *motor* vehicles, but still you should look at the definition, if any, of \"vehicle\". We have two definitions of vehicle in RCW [46\\.04\\.670](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.04&full=true#46.04.670). Definition 1 says that\n\n> \"Vehicle\" includes every device capable of being moved upon a public\n> highway and in, upon, or by which any persons or property is or may be\n> transported or drawn upon a public highway, *including bicycles*\n\nDefinition 2 omits the italicized bicycle inclusion, and explicitly excludes\n\n> A bicycle, for the purposes of chapter 46\\.12, 46\\.16A, or 46\\.70 RCW, or\n> for RCW 82\\.12\\.045((.))\n\nThis is a bit of a mess arising from legislative screwup, which should be resolved by appeal to [RCW 1\\.12\\.025](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=1.12.025). The explicit\\-exclusion sections are about registration, dealers and taxes, and not speed limits. The latter version was [recently reaffirmed](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1066.SL.pdf) effective July 23, 2023\\.\n\nThe courts could therefore be somewhat inclined to *not* apply speed limits to bicycles, because bicycles were recently removed from the set of explicit vehicles. But as notes in the Eskridge's extensive discussion of a hypothetical ban on vehicles in Lafayette Park, there are multiple principles for interpreting laws, and \"legislative intent to assure safety\" would be one prominent consideration, in case the wording of the law is not crystal clear \u2013 as it is not, in this case.",

There are two definitions of \"vehicle\" in Washington law, one which includes bicycles and one which doesn't.\n\n2. Recent legislation (effective July 23, 2023) reaffirmed the definition that excludes bicycles, but only for specific chapters of the law not related to speed limits.\n\n3. The law states that provisions relating to the operation of vehicles apply to highways, which could include bicycles.\n\n4. There's potential conflict between the literal interpretation of the law and the legislative intent to ensure safety.\n\n5. Courts might consider multiple principles of law interpretation, including legislative intent, when faced with unclear wording.\n\nGiven these factors, the correct answer is C. The situation is unclear due to conflicting definitions and recent legislative changes, creating ambiguity that would likely require court interpretation or further legislative clarification."

The Supreme Court has upheld that minors do not have to answer questions from police officers, including School Resource Officers. While police can question minors without parental consent, the minors are not obligated to answer. The student in this scenario has the right to refuse to answer questions, even if a parent is not present. Option A is incorrect because students are not required to answer all questions from authority figures if doing so might incriminate them. Option B is false because the right to remain silent exists regardless of parental presence. Option D is incorrect because, while parents may prefer to be notified, police do not legally need parental consent to question a minor in this type of situation."

Basically, if you want to attend a gig you can try winning \"entry\" by entering the draw \u2014 which you can do by either donating, or \"for free by post\".\n\nThe hitch is that the gigs \"will happen when it\u2019s safe for gigs to happen properly\" \u2014 which may happen later than sooner, if at all.\n\nDoes that sound like a scheme\nfor gig organisers to avoid\nhaving to refund / being held to account?

Therefore, free draws always have been and remain exempt from statutory control. Schedule 2 to the Act gives details of what is to be treated as amounting to \u2018payment to enter\u2019 for the purposes of distinguishing free draws from lotteries.\n\nGiven that there is an alternative route (sending a letter by post) to entering the prize draw, it can be regarded as a \"free draw\" and is not considered gambling.\n\nTo answer the other questions:\n\n> Does that sound like a scheme for gig organisers to avoid having to refund / being held to account? Is it legal proof?\n\nNo. It seems entirely pragmatic to be upfront that the gigs will not be going ahead until it's safe enough to withdraw social distancing guidelines. I don't know what you mean by \"legal proof\" here.\n\n> If someone wins entry (having paid a \"donation\") but the organisers never deem it safe for the gig to happen, will the donor be entitled to a refund?\n\nIt seems unlikely that there is a contract here. You are not buying a ticket, merely the right to enter a draw which *may* reward you with a ticket. I suppose you could argue that a contract has been formed if you have the right to dispose of your right to enter the draw, but it seems worthless to me and I can't imagine that any valuable consideration has exchanged hands as a result. Still, it would be a matter for a court to decide on the facts at the end of the day.",

As long as there is a free method of entry available (in this case, entry by post), the draw is exempt from gambling regulations. This is true even if some participants choose to donate for entry. The donation is not considered payment to enter the draw, but rather a voluntary contribution to the charity. There is likely no contractual obligation to provide the concert or refund donations, as participants are donating to the charity and receiving only a chance to win, not a guaranteed ticket. The organizers' statement that concerts will happen \"when it's safe\" is a reasonable caveat given the uncertainties involved."

This seems to imply that you would need consent to store whether or not someone uses your service. It is easy enough to get consent to store who is using it, but how to get consent from every EU citizen who doesn't use your service? After all, according to the GDPR, personal data are \"any information which are related to an identified or identifiable natural person.\" If someone does not use the service, it is pretty easy to identify that fact by looking at the user database.\n\nSo, would revealing or storing whether or not an EU citizen uses your service constitute a GDPR violation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Revealing whether an EU citizen used a service could certainly be considered a data breach under the terms of GDPR, but that's not what's happening here.\n\nThe service provider would be checking whether a particular string of characters had appeared before as an account name.

The service is merely checking a string of characters (the email address) against its database, not directly revealing personal data associated with a natural person.\n\n2.

Let's spin an example:\n\nLet's assume EULA contains this sentence from the [Rockstar EULA](https://www.rockstargames.com/eula):\n\n> You agree not to, and not to provide guidance or instruction to any other individual or entity on how to:\n> \n> \n> i \\[...] display, perform, prepare derivative works based on, or otherwise modify the Software, in whole or in part\n\nIn that case, by making it available, you are interfering into the contract (EULA) of your potential buyers with the game server owner \\- which is [Tortious Interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortious_interference) and illegal.\n\nUsing the software, as well as making it is [breach of contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract) and, that can make your whole endeavor illegal as you lost your license.\n\nHeck, even **modding** can be considered a breach of that EULA, as became apparent for some Red Dead Redemption fan: He had already gotten a Cease and Desist on a previous project and then worked on *another* project, allegedly on an *illegal copy* of the (prequal) game... It went to court and it went through Arbitration and ended with a settlement making it for that fan illegal to [**ever** work on **any** Take 2 or Rockstar game\\-related project forever.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK0COV8CkoM) Oh, and it is entirely up to the company to decide if they *want* to pursue those breaches.\n\nIn the worst case, to facilitate your hack, you might need to interact with servers without allowance to do so, which can be Computer Fraud and Abuse Act violations.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates a program that reads in-game events and displays information not normally available to players, without modifying the game's original code. The developer intends to sell this software. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) This action is always legal as long as the software doesn't modify the game's code or attack its servers.\n\nB) The legality depends primarily on the game's End User License Agreement (EULA) and whether the software violates its terms.\n\nC) This action is always illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nD) The legality depends solely on whether the software causes harm to other players.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The legality of creating and selling such software primarily depends on the game's EULA. Many EULAs prohibit the creation of derivative works or modifications, even if they don't directly alter the game's code. By creating software that interacts with the game in ways not intended by the developers, the creator may be in breach of contract. Additionally, by selling the software, the developer might be engaging in tortious interference by encouraging others to breach their EULA with the game company. While the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act could potentially apply in some cases, it's not always applicable, and the effect on other players is not the primary legal consideration. The EULA and potential breach of contract are the most critical factors in determining the legality of such software."

It can be prompted by either uttering a few random words into a microphone, or by verbally providing it with a cluster of notes (they could be random or have a deliberate structure).\n2. Person YT, an employee of M Ltd, wishes to try the AI out. He has consented to M Ltd's IP policy, which takes the position of the law on who holds the copyright to any copyrightable work created (i.e. the employer holds the copyright over the copyrightable work its employees create).\n3. Person YT utters a few random words and provides the AI with a random arrangement of notes.\n4. The AI generates a song.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1. With the fact pattern I have presented, can either the AI or M Ltd hold the copyright to the song the AI has generated?\n2.

In this case, the human contribution (random words and notes) does not qualify for authorship, as the AI is ultimately determining the expressive elements of the song. Therefore, the generated song is not protected by copyright and cannot be owned by any entity. The employee's minimal input and the company's creation of the AI do not meet the threshold for human authorship required for copyright protection."

They have been illegal since 1968, and unenforceable since 1948\\. Yet people still try to \"enforce\" them, with some success.\n\nIs there a term for this type of legal situation? And if such practices are illegal (taking the house off the market when a buyer is certain race), why can't they be overridden through say, a summary judgment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would first disagree with your statement that efforts to enforce such restrictive covenants are sometimes successful. The linked article provides no evidence to support that view. Racially restrictive covenants remain in the public records (as do innocent anachronisms such as an early subdivision named \"Swastika Park\" named before the Nazi's had co\\-opted the meaning of this symbol and it was an obscure reference to a South Asian good luck symbol instead), and are sometimes not formally removed from legal documents, but anyone who tries to enforce them almost always swiftly find that doing so is illegal.\n\nTaking a house off the market when a buyer is of a certain race is certainly illegal and has been uncontroversially illegal for decades, although proving a case is often difficult and damages are often hard to quantify.\n\nThere are situations where laws that are no longer on the books are given continuing effect, although this particular one is not a good example. \n\nFor example, (1\\) many people think that it is legally required to give a child born out of wedlock the father's surname (it isn't), or (2\\) think that some or all of the legal disabilities of married women associated with the historic coverture regime in the English common law have continuing effect (almost all of them have been repealed), or (3\\) give effect in some way or other to historic definitions of libel that no longer have legal effect such as a ban on speaking ill of the dead, or of calling attention to the natural infirmities of someone who is genuinely disabled in an embarrassing manner (truth has been an absolute defense for at least half a century ruling out liability in these cases).\n\nNo specific, widely used term to describe these situations comes to mind as I write this answer.",

If not, the process is the same, except for asking the lawyer himself.\n\nRegardless of the actual value of knowing a lawyer's trial experience \\- the value and knowledge of an attorney is much more than trial experience, and the best indicators of experience and judgement are the least public aspects of a lawyer's work \\- there are two major sources of information: public search engines and court record systems. Your searches will yield a lot of raw data in terms of personal names, case names and legal documents that you will need to use your own judgement when analyzing.\n\n**Google:** Best thing to do is start with Google and the lawyer's name. That may sound simplistic, but a simple Google search will give you any firms he is associated with, any news articles with his name in conjunction with trial cases, professional affiliations, and more. Once you find any references, you will find case names, names of past clients, and more. Search again. Follow all the rabbit trails.\n\nGoogle doesn't typically show search results from commercial databases and library catalogs. Most public libraries have access to commercial journal and magazine databases that cover thousands of titles, including law journals, as well as databases of historical newspapers; if not, university libraries do. You may need to go to a state or provincial law college to access legal journals.\n\nContact the people \\- past clients, etc. \\- you find and ask them about the lawyer and the trials in question. I doubt very much any lawyer will have anything more to say that *you need to talk to him yourself*.\n\nBear in mind that if you misrepresent yourself to people you contact about the lawyer \\- you say you're looking for a long lost cousin on the pretext of finding out information about the lawyer and his cases \\- you're treading a fine legal line called pretexting. Pretext is legally defined as a reason for an action which is false while offered to cover up the true intention. If you pretext, it can come back to bite you.\n\n**Court records:** Find the court record system for your jurisdiction. These will greatly vary, and vary between civil and criminal courts. Google will lead you to the website of the court jurisdiction in question; there will be different methods of access to the court records systems. \n\nThe big problem you're up against is that many cases are settled out of court, and there will be no records in court systems. And if there are records, you will have to parse the decisions to find out if the lawyer in question was actually involved.\n\nAs a last resort (other than asking the lawyer himself), hire an unemployed just\\-graduated law student to research for you :)",

When someone gives you permission as part of an agreement having the necessary characteristics of a [contract](/questions/tagged/contract \"show questions tagged 'contract'\"), then the revocation of that permission is governed by the terms of the contract itself and your jurisdiction's [contract\\-law](/questions/tagged/contract-law \"show questions tagged 'contract-law'\").\n\nYou may not need any permission to use the photos you paid to have taken. (For example, in the U.S. if they were taken in a public place and you are not displaying them for profit.)\n\nOr, you might need permission due to various rules or laws protecting minors \u2013 only an IP lawyer familiar with your jurisdiction can confirm this is the case \u2013 and, unless it was drafted by a competent lawyer, it is quite possible that your \"permission statement\" was legally insufficient or defective.\n\nOr, you might have legally secured necessary permission and still have that permission even though you handed the \"permission statement\" back to the parents of the subject.\n\nIn practice: Only a lawyer in your jurisdiction can offer an opinion on which of these scenarios is in fact the case.

As stated in the documentation, \"Permission is not a physical thing that disappears when a piece of paper evidencing that permission is lost or handed to another party.\" The initial permission granted may still be legally binding, depending on the terms of the agreement and local contract law. The return of the physical permission slip does not automatically invalidate the permission given. However, the exact legal status would depend on various factors, including local laws, the specifics of the agreement, and potential protections for minors. To determine the precise legal standing, the organizer would need to consult with a lawyer familiar with the relevant jurisdiction's laws."

You can't prove a negative, so they can't be convicted of perjury for lying about whether they remember; they didn't testify about any fact so they can't perjure themselves; and they didn't help the prosecution (or defense) by truth.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> You can't prove a negative, so they can't be convicted of perjury for lying about whether they remember;\n\nYes, they can. The government can convict the witness of perjury by proving that they *did* remember. This may be difficult, but it's not impossible.\n\nNow you may say that we can't ever prove with certainty what a person did or didn't remember. But the legal standard isn't *certainty*, it's *beyond a reasonable doubt*. So a jury is allowed to draw a [reasonable inference](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/inference) about whether they remembered, based on evidence of their outward behavior and other circumstances.\n\nAs an extreme example, suppose Alice was overheard chatting freely about topic X an hour before the trial, but when asked about topic X on the stand, said she didn't remember. When presented with evidence of her earlier conversation, a jury could reasonably infer that she was lying about not remembering. Is it *possible* that she truly had a memory lapse in the intervening hour? Sure, anything is possible. Is it *reasonable* to believe that she did? Probably not.\n\nThe [US Department of Justice's Criminal Resource Manual](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1753-perjury-cases-special-problems-and-defenses-evasive-and) has this to say on the subject:\n\n> Witnesses who claim not to remember, rather than deny a fact, may be prosecuted for perjury. However, the government must prove both that the witness at one time knew the fact and that the witness must have remembered it at the time he or she testified. United States v. Chen, 933 F.2d 793, 795 (9th Cir. 1991\\). If the dates of the transaction and testimony are sufficiently close, memory may be inferred. Instances in which the witness remembered other events that occurred at the same time or earlier than the event in question, or mentioned the event either immediately before or after his testimony, would be probative of the witness's memory at the time of the testimony. The two witness rule does not apply to prosecutions based on false memory lapses, and circumstantial evidence is sufficient, since there is no direct evidence possible concerning what the defendant actually believed. Gebhard v. United States, 422 F.2d 281, 287 (9th Cir. 1970\\).\n\nThere's a similar issue in all laws that deal with a person's knowledge or intent. Suppose Alice hits Bob with a stick and he dies. To convict Alice of murder, it must be proved that by hitting Bob, she intended to kill him. Can we ever really know what was in her heart? Maybe not, but if there is evidence that shortly beforehand, she told someone that she was going to kill Bob, it would be a reasonable inference that this was her intention.",

Which of the following scenarios would be MOST likely to lead to a successful perjury conviction against this witness?\n\nA) The witness's social media posts from five months ago mentioned details about the event in question.\nB) The witness was overheard discussing the event in detail with a friend one week before the trial.\nC) The witness accurately recalled several other less significant events from around the same time period during testimony.\nD) The witness's spouse testifies that the witness has a generally poor memory and often forgets important details.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the strongest evidence of perjury because it demonstrates that the witness had clear recollection of the event very recently before the trial. This makes it highly unlikely that they genuinely forgot the details in such a short time frame.\n\nOption A is problematic because five months have passed since the social media posts, leaving room for reasonable doubt about whether the witness truly forgot in the intervening time.\n\nOption C provides some circumstantial evidence that the witness's memory is generally intact for that time period, but it's not as direct or damning as option B.\n\nOption D actually supports the witness's claim of memory issues and would make a perjury conviction less likely.\n\nThe key here is that perjury based on false claims of memory lapses can be proven through circumstantial evidence, and recent, detailed recollection of the event in question provides the strongest basis for inferring that the witness is lying about not remembering."

The only relevance of spousal privilege is the *evidentiary* issue of precluding a spouse's testimony from being obtained and entered as *admissible evidence* in the court proceedings to which the respondent is a party.\n\nIn the context of restraining orders, spousal privilege *might* be available only if the respondent invokes it during the proceedings for civil or criminal contempt that resulted from respondent's violation of the restraining order.\n\nIf the restraining order is pursuant to, or in the context of, divorce proceedings, spousal privilege is inapplicable.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As I have [found out](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/q/8395/2829), there are \"open\\-source hardware\" licenses which are written in the spirit of \"open\\-source software\" licenses and require the user to publish a modified design if they distribute a physical product based on that design. Examples are TAPR and Arduino license.\n\nHowever, unlike software which is subject to copyright in any form, circuit boards are not subject to copyright as they are not works of art. This makes me wonder whether open\\-source hardware licenses can actually provide the protection that they advertise.\n\nAre such licenses deemed legally enforceable? Have they ever been enforced?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Circuit boards are not subject to copyright but circuit board designs are\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[This](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ecbb24af-4a0a-4971-9022-2edfeac253eb) case from Taiwan neatly explains the difference.\n\nThe licence presumably attaches to the design of the circuit board \\- the circuit diagram, circuit board layout, or integrated circuit layout. In order to use the design, one would almost surely need to make a copy of it or modify it. It is this step that requires adherence to the licence, not the actual manufacture of the circuit.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to use an open-source hardware design for a circuit board in their product. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of using this design?\n\nA) The company can freely manufacture and distribute the circuit board without any legal obligations, as circuit boards themselves are not subject to copyright.\n\nB) The company must adhere to the open-source hardware license only if they modify the physical circuit board after manufacturing.\n\nC) The company needs to follow the open-source hardware license terms when copying or modifying the circuit board design, even before manufacturing.\n\nD) Open-source hardware licenses are not legally enforceable for circuit boards, so the company has no legal obligations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the license attaches to the design of the circuit board, not the physical board itself. As stated in the documentation, \"The licence presumably attaches to the design of the circuit board - the circuit diagram, circuit board layout, or integrated circuit layout.\" The company would need to copy or modify this design to use it, which is the step that requires adherence to the license terms. This is true even before manufacturing begins.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while circuit boards themselves are not copyrightable, the designs are protected.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the license applies to the use of the design, not modifications to the physical board after manufacturing.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the licenses can be enforceable for the designs, even if not for the physical boards themselves."

Which of the following scenarios would be considered legal under UK employment law?\n\nA) The company requires all employees to attend unpaid training sessions outside of normal working hours.\n\nB) The company makes attendance at training sessions during work hours voluntary, with no negative consequences for non-attendance other than missing the learning opportunity.\n\nC) The company mandates attendance at training sessions during work hours but does not pay employees for this time.\n\nD) The company allows employees to choose between attending paid training sessions outside work hours or unpaid sessions during work hours.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nOption B is the correct and legal approach according to UK employment law. The company can make attendance at training sessions during work hours voluntary, as long as there are no negative repercussions for not attending (other than missing the learning opportunity). This aligns with the principle that if attendance is not mandatory, the company is not obligated to pay for the time.\n\nOption A is illegal because the company cannot require employees to attend unpaid training sessions, even if they are outside normal working hours.\n\nOption C is illegal because if attendance is mandatory, the company must pay employees for their time.\n\nOption D, while creative, is still not legal as it forces employees to choose between two options that both violate employment law - either working unpaid during normal hours or being required to attend paid sessions outside of work hours.\n\nThe key principle is that if attendance is required, it must be paid. If it's truly voluntary with no negative consequences for non-attendance, then it can be unpaid."

The information provided shows that there have been multiple cases where foreign countries appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court, such as Republic of Sudan v. Harrison, Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, Republic of Austria v. Altman, and Argentine Rep. v. Amerada Hess. In these cases, the main issues often centered around the applicability and conditions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).\n\nOption A is incorrect because foreign countries have appeared before the Supreme Court in several cases. Option B is wrong because the FSIA actually limits the circumstances under which foreign countries can be sued, rather than allowing unrestricted lawsuits. Option D is false because the Republic of Sudan v. Harrison case was not the first instance of a foreign country appearing before the Supreme Court, as evidenced by the earlier cases mentioned in the passage."

The waiver would apply even if California had some legislation akin to the EU's GDPR. Your description nowhere indicates that that person had a statutory or equitable duty of confidentiality.\n\nIt is also highly doubtful that you would wish to block the distribution of the video if people instead of mocking you expressed something pleasant or encouraging to you.\n\n> people who I don't even know their names come to me to comment about the video and joke about not falling again.\n\nThat is not unlawful in and of itself.\n\nSince the matter does not involve a protected category such as sex, race, religion, or disability, pursuing a claim of hostile work environment would be quite a stretch. It would also be futile because any relief would not cover outsiders who watch the video and feel like joking about it.\n\nThe notion of harassment entails a *pattern* of conduct (meaning that a person engages twice or more in that conduct) that causes a reasonable person to feel annoyed or concerned for his safety. Even if someone engages makes a few jokes that cause you to get annoyed, any petition for restraining orders seems unlikely to succeed.\n\nSooner rather than later, the jokes will get old and people will move on.",

The employee has no legal recourse regarding the distribution of the video or the resulting workplace behavior. The security footage was recorded in a workplace setting where privacy expectations are limited. Additionally, the employee's decision to share the video with a coworker likely waived any potential privacy rights. The jokes and comments, while potentially annoying, do not constitute illegal behavior or create a hostile work environment since they don't involve a protected category (e.g., race, sex, religion). The situation doesn't meet the threshold for harassment or justify a restraining order. While the behavior may be unprofessional, it doesn't violate any specific laws based on the information provided."
