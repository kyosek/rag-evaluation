But since you ask in terms of a user's \"*right to try*\", I needed to clarify this.\n\n> Is a software developer responsible for source code they give away for\n>  a tutorial?\n\nNo. You (or any developer sharing his or her code) are not liable for others' misunderstanding and/or lack of scrutiny of any tutorial code they use in Production, even if that source code was released by yourself. The legal jargon for this would be that the user(s) *unreasonably relied* upon the source code at issue.\n\nMoreover, the fact that others need to copy/paste code from a tutorial suggests that they probably shouldn't be tweaking Production yet.

According to the documentation, the software developer is not responsible for how others use the code from their tutorial, even in a production environment. Users who implement tutorial code without proper testing are considered to be unreasonably relying on the code.

I presume attainder means detention, but I can't work out what \"corruption of blood\" or \"forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted\" means or why it's prohibited.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In English law during the late Medieval and early modern period (from 1321 to 1798\\), it was possible for Parliament to pass a \"Bill Of Attainder\". This declared a person guilty of a crime, often treason, by legislative act, without any trial or other legal process. See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder) for more detail.\n\nOften a Bill of Attainder not only decreed that a person (or people) was guilty, but also confiscated the convicted person's property, preventing his (or rarely her) heirs from inheriting, and possibly rendering those heirs ineligible to hold public offices or peerages. The heir would also be prevented from inheriting **through** the attainted person. For example, property held by the father of the attainted person would not pass to the child of the attainted person. This was called \"corruption of the blood\", and was viewed with particular horror by many during the colonial period and before. It effectivly treated the heirs of the attainted person as illegitimate.\n\nAttainder was usually followed by execution, possibly by torture. The bill might specify the specific fate of the person attained.\n\nThe US constitutional provision prohibits declaring people guilty of crimes by legislative act, and prohibits sentences for crimes that take property or rights from the family or heirs of the convicted person, even in cases of treason. At least that is how it has been interpreted. Fines may be levied, but may only fall on the actual property of the person convicted. \n\nThe US Supreme Court has dealt with this clause in several cases:\n\n* *Ex parte Garland*, 71 U.S. 333 (1866\\) (law requiring lawyers to swear that they had not supported the confederacy held unconstitutional);\n* *Cummings v.

Douds*, 339 U.S. 382 (1950\\) (federal law which required elected labour leaders to take an oath that they were not and had never been members of the Communist Party USA, and that they did not advocate violent overthrow of the U.S. government upheld);\n* *United States v.

This practice was viewed with horror during the colonial period. The U.S. Constitution explicitly prohibits this practice, even in cases of treason, stating that \"no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood.\" This means that while a person convicted of treason may be punished, their conviction cannot affect the rights or property of their heirs.

By and large, name calling is not a justification for violence.\n\nSubsequently, the word \u201cfight\u201d is too broad to to decide if either of you have committed further offences. If \u201cfight\u201d means a minor scuffle that ends quickly with no serious injuries then probably no further offences have occurred: you are entitled to defend yourself using reasonable force. However, self\\-defence stops as soon as you are no longer at risk of imminent harm \\- if you strike your assailant and knock them down (perhaps even killing them), that can be self\\-defence. If you knock them down and then beat their head with a piece of timber \\- that isn\u2019t.\n\nOf course, context matters. If you yell \"you dumbass\" while charging at the person with your fists raised, you have probably committed assault and *they* are entitled to defend themselves, including hitting you first. However, it is not the words alone that make this assault \\- it is the words as part of the whole situation and if that puts the other person in reasonable apprehension of imminent harm.\n\nThere is a concept of [fighting words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_words) but those are **not** words that justify fighting \\- they are words that fall outside the particular jurisdiction\u2019s free speech protections.

Person A's verbal insult, while potentially offensive, does not typically constitute a legal offense on its own. The concept of \"fighting words\" refers to speech that can be criminalized by the government, not words that justify a violent response.

I have also resisted emboldening any of the text to allow users to make up their own minds without any unconscious bias on my part.\n\nFinally, I have left my original answer as is for posterity.\n\nThe statement in full reads as follows (with the description of what caused the arrest bolded):\n\n> \u201cIt is clear from the video that has been shared online that this incident was distressing for the woman involved and particularly for her child. We understand why it has prompted significant public concern and we want to be transparent about our position and the role of our officers.\n> \n> \n> \u201cOfficers from the Met\u2019s Roads and Transport Policing Command were supporting TfL ticket inspectors on a pre\\-planned operation in Whitehorse Road, Croydon on Friday, 21 July. As buses pulled into the stop, TfL inspectors would check the tickets of those onboard and also those getting off.\n> \n> \n> \u201cAnyone without a valid ticket is required to provide their details to a TfL inspector so a penalty fare can be issued. This is not a policing matter. **Officers only become involved where details are not provided or where someone tries to leave when challenged.**\n> \n> \n> **\u201cThe woman involved in this incident was asked to provide her ticket as she got off the bus, but did not do so. She was spoken to by a TfL inspector, then by a PCSO and finally by a police officer. She continued to try to walk away and did not provide her ticket for inspection.**\n> \n> \n> **\u201cShe was arrested on suspicion of fare evasion and was handcuffed. When officers were able to take her ticket from her so that the TfL inspectors could check it, they were able to confirm it was valid. She was immediately de\\-arrested and her handcuffs were removed.**\n> \n> \n> \u201cThroughout the incident, the child was comforted by a PCSO who immediately recognised his distress. Anyone seeing how upset he was would be moved by this, and we regret any impact it may have on him.\n> \n> \n> \u201cWe recognise that the use of handcuffs can be a cause of concern, particularly given the context of this incident and the type of offence involved, but when a person is trying to physically leave an incident it is an option officers can consider. All uses of force must be proportionate and necessary in the circumstances.\n> \n> \n> \u201cTicket inspection operations of this nature are difficult. They place police officers in direct confrontation with frustrated members of the public and could escalate what would otherwise be civil matters to a different level.\n> \n> \n> \u201cThis incident raises questions about the extent to which officers are having to intervene in this way when supporting TfL in their operations. We will now work with TfL to ensure that the balance is right between officers tackling the most serious crime on the transport network and supporting their own operations to ensure revenue protection.\n> \n> \n> \u201cAn initial review of the officers\u2019 actions did not identify any conduct matters but we will reflect on it carefully, in discussion with communities locally, to urgently identify any opportunities to do things differently.\n> \n> \n> \u201cGiven the level of community concern generated we believe it is in the public interest to voluntarily refer the matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct to review.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**ORIGINAL ANSWER**\n\n**YES**\n\nA breach of the Regulations is a summary offence.

In Australia, courts have specific expectations for juror attire, generally requiring neat and respectful clothing. Wearing an outlandish costume could be seen as disrespecting the court. This behavior falls under contempt of court, which can result in serious consequences including fines or imprisonment. While option B (asking the juror to change) might occur in some cases, the extreme nature of the described outfit would likely be viewed as intentional disrespect, warranting more severe action.

The consensus at the time was that a \"traditional\" i.e. non\\-half\\-hourly (NHH), non\\-smart meter reading itself was not considered personal data \\- they are conceptually tied to a metering point (which may or may not be a physical meter), not to an individual and don't represent an individual's energy consumption (the granularity of the reading is insufficient to tell anything about the usage profile)\n\nBut this information, while all around the implementation of GDPR it was a couple of years back and to be honest it was bugging me that I might be out\\-of\\-date on the current practices so I reached out to a former colleague who was the Data Protection Officer at the supplier I worked at to try and get a more up\\-to\\-date take. He's since moved on but was there until recently so has more experience with the topic since GDPR actually went into effect.\n\nI asked him whether a) estimated opening reads were considered \"personal data\" and b) what would happen with a request to change one under article 16 and he had this to say, I've translated industry\\-speak in square brackets:\n\n> a) for NHH \\[\"Non Half Hourly\" \\- meters that are read ad\\-hoc, essentially all non\\-smart domestic meters will be this] an estimated reading wasn't personal data automatically until the billing flag was set in CRM and those would be the only ones we'd include on an SAR \\[Subject Access Request], any others are internal data not personal. HH \\[\"Half Hourly\" \\- meters for higher consumption users, typically larger business premises are billed on increments for each half hour so have readings for each] and remote \\[smart meter] readings are always personal for domestic and microb \\[micro\\-businesses are a certain class of non\\-domestic energy customer see [condition 7A](https://epr.ofgem.gov.uk/Content/Documents/Electricity%20Supply%20Standard%20Licence%20Conditions%20Consolidated%20-%20Current%20Version.pdf)]\n> \n> \n> b) erm no! we'd only change it if the value in CRM didn't match the value in the D10 \\[industry Data Flow used to transmit meter reads] for some reason. if they match it's an accurate representation of what we estimate the reading to be so it's just a vanilla billing dispute not a data protection issue so i'd have punted it to \\[name of person who was head of metering]\n\nFrom that it would sound as though the estimated read **would** count as personal data \\- *so long as it's being used for billing purposes*, but that doesn't mean they *have* to accept your read in it's stead. \n\nIt all comes down to accuracy \\- GDPR requires that personal data be \"accurate\" but provides no definition as to what \"accurate\" means (which makes sense since you can't give a one\\-size\\-fits\\-all answer that isn't an encyclopedia) and while The Electricity Directive 2019 confirms the need for accuracy in billing again it doesn't tell us what that means. The implementation is left to member state regulators.\n\nIn the UK this is OFGEM and all opening meter readings are validated through third parties (so you don't end up with the foxes guarding the hen house!) and are calculated using the following formula:\n\n> Last validated reading for the meter point \\<\\= supplied reading \\<\\= (expected daily usage x number of days since last validated reading x 2\\.5\\)\n\nwhere \"expected daily usage\" is obtained from a database maintained by the regulator \\- it's calculated off meter type, property type, property use, previous validated reads etc.\n\nSo if the customer provides a reading that falls outside the above the supplier can (and in practice invariably will) reject it as being inaccurate.\n\nNow this is why the *when* a meter reading is provided matters \\- reads you provide are always assumed to be the read on the day you give them. With opening reads there's some leeway, I can't remember the official rule on how much but usually they give you up to the *next* estimated read is generated but more on that later.\n\nNow if the reading you're trying to submit is a \"now\" reading and it's failed the validation criteria and you aren't happy with the rejection you can force the issue by demanding the supplier come read the meter.\n\nYou don't say how long has passed since the opening read \\- more than the week from what you've said so presumably at least a month (guessing you've had at least your first bill).\n\nNow if they are saying the opening read was X (based on the estimated usage) and you're it should have been X \\+ Y and the current reading is X \\+ Y \\+ Z you want to pay your *actual* usage Z not Y \\+ Z. What you need to do is dispute the opening read, which you're entitled to do, arguably GDPR of Article 16 gives you this right, but on it's own it's a weak argument.

Subsections(b,c) require that the copy not be made available outside the premises, which precludes internet posting; (d) requires a user request to make a copy; (e) applies only to items that are off the market and transferred to a specific user; (h) allows more copying in the last 20 years of the period when a work is protected (not applicable here). Subsection (a) allows a library or archive to make one copy of a work, as long as there is no commercial advantage to making the copy, the library is relatively public (it might restrict access to bona fide researchers), and a copyright notice is included: this has the fewest restrictions on copying.\n\nThe internet downloader is not a library or an archive, so the downloader is not granted any permission under 108 to make a copy. Under 108(a) a library can make no more than one copy available, but every uploading or downloading is \"making a copy\". A library would be contributorily liable for the illegal downloadings of their \"customers\".\n\nIt is difficult to know exactly what one can get away with under 17 USC 107 a.k.a. \"[fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7683/in-the-us-when-is-fair-use-a-defense-to-copyright-infringement/7684#7684)\".

A university library, as a non-commercial entity, is allowed to make a single copy of a copyrighted work for preservation or research purposes, as long as it's not made available outside the library premises. This aligns with the requirements of Section 108(a).\n\nOption B is not legal under either Section 107 or 108, as individual downloaders are not granted permissions under these sections.\n\nOption C would likely not be considered fair use under Section 107, as it involves copying and distributing the entire work without transformation, which could significantly impact the market for the original work.\n\nOption D might have some elements of fair use under Section 107, but creating a searchable database of entire books could be legally contentious and would depend on various factors, including the amount of content displayed and the effect on the market for the original works."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77613/did-i-commit-sexual-harassment-by-asking-a-spam-caller-when-they-would-sleep-wit", "docs_id": 77613, "title": "Did I commit sexual harassment by asking a spam caller when they would sleep with me, to stop the calls?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My friend used to complain that he gets phone calls from credit card companies many times (about 1\\-2 times per day).

In the US, \"sexual harassment\" is legally subsumed under laws against illegal discrimination, which can exist at the federal level and the state level. You cannot discriminate on the basis of race for employment, housing, public accomodations and so on. You cannot discriminate on the basis of sex in employment. However, you are not employing anyone, so that law does not apply to you.

The document specifically mentions that \"It is legal in the US to be rude.\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because the analysis indicates that sexual harassment laws are primarily tied to employment discrimination, which doesn't apply in this case. \n\nOption C is wrong because the caller is not an employer and has no employment relationship with the person on the phone. \n\nOption D is incorrect because there's no indication that actions directed at customer service representatives are automatically illegal, and the analysis emphasizes the protection of speech under the First Amendment."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42160/how-to-find-audio-of-us-supreme-court-oral-arguments", "docs_id": 42160, "title": "How to find audio of US Supreme Court oral arguments?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The newer audio (starting with 2010\\) are available on the Supreme Court's website.

For example, do they need to prove the defendant knew he didn\u2019t have authorization? What about intent to defraud \u2014 do they need to prove he knew it was against the law, too?\n\n(tl;dr) My specific question: **How do prosecutors determine the elements necessary to satisfy the *mens rea* requirements attached to certain laws?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is actually a very complicated question, about (1\\) the scope of \"knowingly\", (2\\) what kind of \"intent\" is required for conviction, (3\\) how does the jury understand and evaluate concepts of intent and (4\\) how does an attorney persuade the jury that the situation does or does not satisfy the particular intent requirement. One thing we can dispose of quickly is the possibility that the law says that the accused has to actually *know* that the act is against the law. It is a standard legal fiction (2,400 years old) that the accused knows the law, or should have known.\n\nAs for the 4th element, persuasion, on the strong side we have statements of intent by the accused \u2013 \"And I pulled out my rifle and blew his head off, and I laughed the whole time\". What the jury has to decide is whether the accused had in mind a conscious purpose of doing some act (that is, it wasn't just an accident like butt\\-dialing, or an instant stimulus\\-response reaction to some event). \"Intent\" generally falls in the realm of acting \"purposely\", which the Model Penal Code \u00a72\\.02 defines as:\n\n> A person acts purposely with respect to a material element of an\n>  offense when:\n> \n> \n> (i) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result\n>  thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that\n>  nature or to cause such a result; and \n> \n> \n> (ii) if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is aware\n>  of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that\n>  they exist.\n\nwhich more or less means what you think \"with intent\" means. That doesn't say what they intended to do, it just distinguishes intent from negligence and accident. The prosecutor would then present factual evidence that the accused had a bad intent, like showing that he actually made an attempt to access credit card account data (that such data had been accessed when he broke into the system), etc.\n\nWe can sort of dispose of the other scope question about \"knowingly\", namely, what things would he have to know? The chunk *accessing a protected computer without authorization* can be interpreted in a number of ways, having to do with which elements of the clause are known to the accused. You might know that you were accessing but not know that you were unauthorized; you might know that you were accessing and unauthorized, but not know that the computer is protected. The only reliable way to know which is which is to study the case law on a statute and see if there is a controlling decision that say e.g. that you have to know that you are accessing and are unauthorized, but you don't have to know that the computer is protected. I haven't determined (yet) is there is decisive case law on this, but I'm betting that the outcome would be that not knowing of the protected status of a computer carries no weight.\n\nAs for what kind of intent, there is a distinction between \"specific intent\" and \"general intent\". The distinction comes down to having some evil purpose like \"make him suffer\" (general intent) versus a specific evil purpose like \"kill him\".\n\nFinally, the people who actually decide, the jury, will be given instructions that say what they have to look for. Here is the tip of the tip of the iceberg, from California's criminal jury instructions. The judge will say...\n\n> The People must prove not only that the defendant did the acts\n>  charged, but also that (he/she) acted with a particular (intent/\n>  \\[and/or] mental state). The instruction for (the/each) crime \\[and\n>  allegation] explains the (intent/ \\[and/or] mental state) required.\n>  A\\[n] (intent/ \\[and/or] mental state) may be proved by circumstantial\n>  evidence.\n> \n> \n> Before you may rely on circumstantial evidence to conclude that a fact\n>  necessary to find the defendant guilty has been proved, you must be\n>  convinced that the People have proved each fact essential to that\n>  conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt.\n> \n> \n> Also, before you may rely on circumstantial evidence to conclude that\n>  the defendant had the required (intent/ \\[and/or] mental state), you\n>  must be convinced that the only reasonable conclusion supported by the\n>  circumstantial evidence is that the defendant had the required\n>  (intent/ \\[and/or] mental state).

In other words, at what point does the government's inability to effectively administer a program become an unreasonable restriction on personal liberty?\n\nSupplementary:\n\n* Is there a legal concept or term for this, or for a valid defense strategy that could be made if reasonable and good faith attempts to comply could be demonstrated? *(i.e. a Latin phrase comparable to \"mens rea\", etc.)*\n\nWhat other remedies might be available?\n\n* I have considered proceeding with the restoration, and drafting an \"Affidavit in lieu of registration\" document detailing my numerous attempts to follow the process, and indicating a sincere desire to comply, but my concern would be having the vehicle impounded if/when I get pulled over.\n* I have even considered asking local law enforcement to just issue me a citation so that I might appear in court and plead for an opportunity to be given the means to comply. *(i.e. move to the head of the line...)*\n* I have also considered writing to my state representative. Are there any other preemptive actions that might help get this situation \"unstuck\"?\n* Is there a statute of limitations for asserting ownership that might alleviate my concerns about proceeding with the project?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The state of Washington does not have an *absolute* requirement that vehicles must be registered. What it has is [RCW 46\\.16A.030 (2\\)](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.16A.030):\n\n> (2\\) It is unlawful for a person to **operate any vehicle on a public highway of this state** without having in full force and effect a current and proper vehicle registration and displaying license plates on the vehicle.\n\nTherefore you *already* have a means to comply with the law: simply refrain from operating this vehicle on any public highway of the state of Washington. In other words, don't drive or park it on public roads; keep it on private property. (In many states, \"operating\" includes parking; I could not immediately find out whether this is the case in Washington.)\n\nSo now your question instead becomes: \"What is the state's obligation *to make it possible for me to lawfully drive this particular vehicle on the public roads*?\" And the answer to that is much more clearly, \"none\". Driving in general is considered a privilege and not a right, so your \"personal liberty\" is not at issue. The state is not doing a good job of providing a service which they generally do provide, which is certainly annoying, but is not a legal issue, and does not give you the right to break the law.\n\n---\n\n> I have considered proceeding with the restoration, and drafting an \"Affidavit in lieu of registration\" document detailing my numerous attempts to follow the process, and indicating a sincere desire to comply, but my concern would be having the vehicle impounded if/when I get pulled over.\n\nYes, it probably would be.\n\n> I have even considered asking local law enforcement to just issue me a citation so that I might appear in court and plead for an opportunity to be given the means to comply.

However, if the issue is simply that the State Patrol is overloaded with work, there may not be much they can do.\n\n> Is there a statute of limitations for asserting ownership that might alleviate my concerns about proceeding with the project?\n\nThe requirement to have an inspection before getting a title seems to be from RCW 46\\.12\\.530 (2\\): \"The department may require additional information and a physical examination of the vehicle or of any class of vehicles, or either.\" So there is no exception written into statute.\n\nThe implementing regulation looks to be [WAC 308\\-56A\\-150](https://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=308-56A-150). There are several criteria listed for when inspection is required, and I'm not sure which would apply to your vehicle. It may perhaps be \"[(g) ownership in doubt (WAC 308\\-56A\\-210\\)](https://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=308-56A-210)\" which applies when you do not have the documentation described in [WAC 308\\-56A\\-265](https://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=308-56A-265). Or it may be the catchall \"(c) One on which the identification number needs verification as requested by the department, county auditor, or authorized agent\". You'll have to research this further.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any exception based specifically on the long time period that the car has been unregistered, or the fact that no theft is known to have been reported in the past 20 years, or anything like that.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Washington State, what is the legal status of operating an unregistered vintage automobile on public highways if the owner has made multiple unsuccessful attempts to schedule a required VIN inspection due to chronic staffing shortages at the State Patrol?\n\nA) It is legal to operate the vehicle as long as the owner can provide documentation of attempts to schedule an inspection.\n\nB) It is illegal to operate the vehicle on public highways, regardless of attempts to comply with inspection requirements.\n\nC) The owner can draft an \"Affidavit in lieu of registration\" to legally operate the vehicle until an inspection becomes available.\n\nD) The state's inability to provide timely inspections nullifies the registration requirement, making operation legal.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to RCW 46.16A.030 (2), it is unlawful to operate any vehicle on a public highway in Washington State without proper registration and displayed license plates, regardless of the circumstances preventing registration. The state's obligation is not to make it possible for a particular vehicle to be driven on public roads, but rather to provide a means of compliance, which in this case already exists: refraining from operating the vehicle on public highways.

Professional joke writers often copyright their work, and the punchline is considered the most valuable part of a joke.

It doesn't work. Mfg just keeps delaying with service visits and attempted fixes. I'm done and ready to buy a new dishwasher and sue for the cost of the old. Who do I sue?\n\n**Background**\n\nWe purchased a new dishwasher from a big box store. We want to return it for a slew of reasons, top among them being:\n\n* Dishes do not come clean\n* Dishes smell of chemicals, most likely from detergent not being washed off\n* Sound level is 26 db above rated level (I expected 5\\-10, but not 20\\+)\n\nThese problems can be partially mitigated by running every load twice, but that's wasteful of water, time, energy, etc and not what we paid for.\n\n**Attempted Resolution**\n\nI contacted the big box store who told me to talk to the manufacturer first, and they asked me to try a few things, such as:\n\n* Different types of detergent\n* Different types of rinse aid\n* With and without rinse aid\n* Running the hot water in the sink first\n\nAfter none of these worked I contacted the big box store, and they told me I was past the 30 day return window at that point and had no recourse other than through manufacturer.\n\nThe manufacturer said they had to sent a tech before approving a return. The tech said these problems were definitely real, and there was no apparent cause, and I should get a new machine. The manufacturer then said they had to send another tech. That tech said the only thing they could guess it might be is a faulty motor that works, but not strongly enough. They offered to replace it, but said it would be 3\\+ weeks.\n\n**Now What?**\n\nAt this point I've already lost close to an hour a day double washing and hand washing dishes and pots and pans for a month, and am unwilling to wait any longer, especially since I believe the manufacturer is just trying to delay until I go away. And I didn't buy a refurbished dishwasher, I bought a new one. So I'm planning to just buy another dishwasher, and sue the manufacturer or big box store for the money I spent on the first.\n\nWho do I sue? My sales contract is with the big box store. However, the problems seem related to a manufacturer defect or, more likely, faulty design by the manufacturer.\n\nAnd if I win, what do I do with the dishwasher?\n\n**Limitations**\n\n* I do not have a vehicle to transport this dishwasher\n* I have a back problem and do not want to try lifting this dishwasher to transport it\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Would I sue seller or manufacturer for a new appliance that does not function correctly?\n\nYou have viable claims against both seller and manufacturer, and you may sue both of them in the same complaint. Hopefully the tech's assessment that you \"*should get a new machine*\" is *in writing*, since that evidence seems dispositive (i.e., decisive) and immune to manufacturer's potential denial. Regardless of what approach you choose, the award you might be granted is subject to the prohibition of *double recovery*.\n\nIt seems that the seller's directions were purposefully dilatory. Coupled with its subsequent pretext about expiration of the 30 day period, seller's conduct is in violation of legislation regarding *unfair and misleading practices*. Your post does not specify which jurisdiction in the US you have in mind, but consumer protection laws are rather uniform all over the country.\n\nIf the provision of 30\\-day return period is reflected in a document such as the invoice, or in seller's signs/advertisements, you also have a claim of *breach of contract* for seller's failure to abide by the corresponding clause or policy.\n\nA similar rationale applies with respect to the manufacturer. The manufacturer is not entitled to arbitrarily postpone compliance as to the warranty. Seller's 30\\-day deadline serves as comparison in your argument that the manufacturer's open\\-ended schedule is excessive, a schedule which is on top of the delay from the interactions with both techs.\n\n> if I win, what do I do with the dishwasher?\n\nWait for the party who reimburses you or replaces the dishwasher to determine whether it opts to take the defective dishwasher. That party is responsible for transportation costs and related expenses if it decides to pick up the appliance.\n\nIf the party is not interested in retrieving the defective appliance, make sure it signs a waiver. Otherwise you would be at risk that that party maliciously tries to turn the tables by alleging that you unlawfully got a second dishwasher for free.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a consumer dispute over a defective dishwasher, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding legal recourse?\n\nA) The consumer can only sue the manufacturer, as they are responsible for the product defect.\n\nB) The consumer can only sue the retailer, as they have the direct sales contract.\n\nC) The consumer can sue either the manufacturer or the retailer, but not both simultaneously.\n\nD) The consumer can sue both the manufacturer and the retailer in the same complaint.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

As an easy example, I'm sure costs for rent and food differ in Norway from region to region just as in any other country. In my country, for a good salary in a northern town, you would not find a bridge to sleep under in the most epxensive southern town. A salary in the southern town tends to be at least twice as much as in the north just to keep their employees. But what the employees actually have in their pockets after all neccessary expenses like rent, food and utility is very similar between the regions.\n\nThere are also instances of companies paying for public transport tickets for example. Which if you use public transport is a lot of money over the year, if you go by car or even bike, it's worth nothing. Or maybe they offer a company car. That is nice if you need a car. If your family already has two in the garage, it's kinda \"meh\".\n\nSo yes, different payment based on variables that are not productivity of the employee are legal and widespread.\n\nIt does become a problem at the \"approval\" step though. For example which region you live in is not exactly covered under the GDPR and is information that is already available to your employer in way more detail anyway (I assume they have your full address). More personal information is not available to your employer and for good reasons. Even just *having* such information runs against anti\\-discrimination laws.\n\nIt is also not only legal, but *legally required* in some EU countries to take those things (age, dependents) into account when laying off people. So there can be legal discrimination to protect those most vulnerable. So maybe it's better to create that sounds like a protection for vulnerable groups than a payment scheme. Something like extra days off for specific needs. Like say you not only allow the legally required maternatiy leave, but give 4 weeks on your own paid leave on top. Or give a day off not only for bereavement leave of first degree family members, but also second degree. Or maybe you grant a paid day off for a persons kids first day in school. Although this does need prove of some kind, I'm pretty sure if properly worded that would not be a legal problem.\n\nIt would also been seen as more fair by other employees. Giving out lump sums of money for reasons unrelated to the job seems unfair, while giving out benefits directly related to the *specific* needs of employees seems very friendly and helpful.\n\n> What steps would need to be taken to ensure that this process is compliant with the law?\n\nYou need to get a lawyer (and maybe a union representative if your industry is heavily unionized) and go through your plan item by item and check whether your company is allowed to have and process this information. And if your company is allowed to discriminate based on this information, even if they have it legally.\n\nAnd in the end, when you have your watertight legal plan, you have to ask yourself how you will attract talent, when you pay based on their needs. Why would a young, single, very educated person do overtime for you, when an undereducated, lazy slacker next desk earns double what they do. Not because they do a better job, but because they have a wife and three kids and have a mortgage on their house.\n\nSo it's legally a very costly endeavour.

Probably the most pertinent first part of the law is [Subpart B](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3a3c0be5e65f577366f7fd2581a784a7&mc=true&node=pt29.4.1601&rgn=div5#sp29.4.1601.b), which encompasses procedures. The EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) may receive allegations of a violation, and there is a procedure for deciding on the merits of the case. After charges are filed, there is an investigation by the EEOC, which may include a public hearing. Based on the investigation, the commission may dismiss the charge (technical flaws in the complaint); they may issue a letter of determination to that effect if they find that there was no reasonable cause for the complaint. They can also encourage a negotiated settlement. In making this determination, the commission follows its own guidelines, as encoded in the regulations. So if the commission determines by its rules that there was a violation, the courts will generally [defer to that finding](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/chevron_deference) unless the finding is contrary to what Congress said. If there is no dismissal or settlement, then they issue a determination that there is reasonable cause (\u00a71601\\.21\\). Then there is a procedure to rectify unlawful practices, which includes the possibility of a conciliation agreement.\n\n*Finally*, starting at \u00a71601\\.27, we get to the point that somebody might get their day in court. If the accused still refuses to relent on whatever point was at stake, the matter can go to trial:\n\n> The Commission may bring a civil action against any respondent named\n>  in a charge not a government, governmental agency or political\n>  subdivision, after thirty (30\\) days from the date of the filing of a\n>  charge with the Commission unless a conciliation agreement acceptable\n>  to the Commission has been secured\n\nBut also, the aggrieved can take the accused to court at any time.

The standard of proof in these cases is indeed \"preponderance of evidence,\" as these are treated as civil matters (torts) rather than criminal ones.

In other words, they have a legal duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the corporation. Sometimes these duties are full fiduciary duties, and sometimes these duties established by statute include duties of care and duties of loyalty that are narrower than the fiduciary duties owed, for example, by a trustee to the beneficiaries of a trust.\n\nGenerally speaking, directors owe their duties primarily to the corporation as an entity overall, and not to the shareholders generally, or to any subset of shareholders. \n\nBut, there is case law that provides the owners or directors of a corporation who control the corporation are not allowed to take actions using their voting and control powers that \"oppress\" the minority owners of the corporation. These duties arise even at the shareholder levels, despite the fact that shareholders aren't normally seen as owing duties, fiduciary or otherwise, to anyone.\n\nFor example, suppose that a corporation is an S\\-corporation in which corporate income is taxable to shareholders whether or not dividends are paid, in which the majority shareholder has other assets from which taxes on the corporation income attributed to the majority shareholder can be paid, but the minority shareholders do not have other assets from which taxes on the corporation income attributed to them can be paid. \n\nCase law in many states has held to if the majority shareholder exercising either shareholder voting level rights or director level powers declines to distribute dividends in order to put pressure on the minority shareholders to sell out at a discount in this situation, that this constitutes official oppression by the majority controlling shareholder and violates the common law legal duties of the majority shareholder to the minority shareholders. The remedies available in these situations also varies considerably.\n\nOf course, as a practical matter, directors elected by a particular constituency are expected to be conscious of the particular needs of the people who put them in office and act accordingly, and this is rarely actionable. But, this is, in part, a function of the fact that the majority of corporations conduct all of their business with the unanimous consent of the directors on a day to day basis. Typically, voting disputes that divide directors into different camps happen only episodically in connection with major transactions like a takeover or leveraged buyout or proxy fight, not in the day to day conduct of the business of the corporation which is almost always left in the hands of senior management, in practice, if not always in legal formal terms.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A corporation has five directors, two appointed by common stockholders and three by preferred stockholders.

Typically a ship master will enter their days underway in a nautical log. These logs are important because they are required for certifications. The higher the certification, the more days required. For a hired master, the log must be signed by the owner of the vessel (me), vouching that the master did operate the vessel on the days in question.\n\nOne concern I have is that a master might forge my name in the log. They would do this for various reasons. I might not be around when they are filling out their log. They don't want to go to the hassle of bringing their log to me. They might want to exaggerate their days to qualify for certification faster. They might not want me to see the log for some reason.

But, there are a few hurdles.\n\nFirst, the design needs to be original. That is, it has to be an exercise of a modicum of creativity. (Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991\\))\n\nMost important though, the aspect of the design that the author seeks to protect via copyright must be separable from the utilitarian aspects of the article. You couldn't protect vertical sides, or a hard, crumble\\-based bottom. Even in a world where those elements were original (they probably aren't) they are utilitarian aspects, driven by function, and would not be protected by copyright. ([US Copyright Office: Useful Articles](https://web.archive.org/web/20180517093048/https://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl103.pdf))1\n\nTo the extent that these elements are separable from the ultilitarian purpose of the cake (I concede that this is almost the entire question), a particular choice of shape, color, decorations, graphics, etc. can protected by copyright as a \"pictorial, graphic, \\[or] sculptural work\". 17 USC 102(a)(5\\)\n\nThis test was most recently clarified in [Star Athletica v. Varsity Brands](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-866_0971.pdf) 580 U.S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2017\\) (slip opinion):\n\n> A feature incorporated into the design of a useful article is eligible\n> for copyright protection only if the feature (1\\) can be perceived as\n> a two\\- or three\\-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article,\n> and (2\\) would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural\n> work\u2014either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium\n> of expression\u2014if it were imagined separately from the useful article\n> into which it is incorporated.\n\nCertain elements of cake design may have become *sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire*, stock elements commonly re\\-used by many authors in a given context (pillars, successive cylindrical layers, etc.).
