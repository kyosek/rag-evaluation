However, the president knows that such a move would be wildly unpopular and so wants to mitigate the risk of tarnishing his own reputation and legacy.\n\nIn such a scenario, could the president issue a pardon in the presence of witnesses who agree to hold it confidential, and then not publish it?

While there is no explicit law requiring immediate public disclosure of a presidential pardon, keeping it secret presents practical challenges. The pardon itself would be legally valid when issued, but its effectiveness could be compromised for two main reasons:\n\n1. Authentication difficulties: Without public records or official acknowledgment, proving the authenticity of a secret pardon would be challenging if it needs to be used in the future.\n\n2. Potential for forced disclosure: Although the pardon could initially be kept secret, there are legal mechanisms (such as the Freedom of Information Act) that could compel its disclosure.

Might it be lawful to make a public notice that I will not offer business to folks who want me to express Christian concepts? Is it any better/worse if I note that I will accept Christian clients as long as they don't ask for anything Christian to be expressed in the product?\n\nFor context, I'm attempting to understand the conjunction of [*Masterpiece*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colorado_Civil_Rights_Commission) and [*303 Creative*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/303_Creative_LLC_v._Elenis).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Probably not. The impediment is the claim that you have a genuinely held religious belief. Changing the context a tiny bit, your employer is statutorily required to make an accommodation for the requirements of your religion, therefore they cannot fire you for refusing to work on the Sabbath, unless it would impose an unreasonable burden on them. If they fire you, you complain to the EOC and the EOC sanctions them. The employer's defense would be that you did not request a reasonable religion\\-based accommodation (you failed to explain that this was about Sabbath). The employer does not scrutinize the validity of your claim (does not demand proof of what your religion requires).\n\nIn your planned announcement, you are not requesting a statutory accommodation from the government, analogous to requesting an accommodation from an employer, you are offering a defense in the case the government takes action against you for violating the law. There is a statutory exception to the prohibition against employment discrimination based on religion, that (roughly speaking) a church is not required to hire a rabbi instead of a mullah to deliver sermons. There is no statutory exception w.r.t. public accommodations and religious discrimination.\nTherefore, to implement your plan, you would have to have the law or the EOC's interpretation of it overturned as unconstitutional.\n\nTo succeed in your argument, you would have to show that the law unconstitutionally restricts your free exercise of your religion. One part would be a demonstration that your religion prohibits... The least likely scenario is that your religion prohibits doing business with a person outside of your religion. I don't of any religion that maintains a requirement of absolute religious segregation, but that is hypothetically a path to argue \u2013 that you will burn in hell forever if you do business with a Christian, or a Muslim. I am maximally skeptical that the courts would ever take such a claim seriously.\n\nA more likely possibility would involve \"compelled speech\" as well, where you are forced under the law to express a viewpoint that contradicts your fundamental religious beliefs. You cannot be compelled by law to express a viewpoint.\nWhat is less clear is what constitutes expressing a viewpoint, see [this](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/compelledspeech.htm). For example, there is a federal law withholding federal funds from schools which discriminate against military recruiters. Some law schools argued in [Rumsfield v Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/547/47/) that allowing military recruiters amounts to forcing the schools to express a viewpoint, but the court held that \"the Solomon Amendment regulates conduct, not speech\".\n\nThe upshot of [303 Creative LLC v. Elenis](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-476_c185.pdf) is that\n\"The First Amendment prohibits Colorado from forcing a website designer to create expressive designs speaking messages with which the designer disagrees\". A proposal to refuse to service Christians plainly does not fall within the penumbra of that ruling. Nor does a refusal to print books containing religious material (which you already created). You have to cater to Christians, but you do not have to create Christian messages. You could draw a line between a simple ISP who you pay to make available your religious website (you create it), versus hiring a company to *design* the website, which clearly involves \"expression\".\n\nThe issue is simplified if you don't make a claim based on a specific belief system, instead rely on simple \"compelled speech\" doctrine. General beliefs do not enjoy the same \"Free Exercise\" protections that religions enjoy. What matters is what you are \"expressing\", not what you are doing (like, printing).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner in Colorado who operates an art expression service wants to refuse service to Christian clients due to their Satanist beliefs.

Elenis ruling, the business owner cannot be compelled to create expressive designs that contradict their beliefs. However, they cannot refuse service to Christian clients entirely, as this would be religious discrimination in public accommodations. The correct approach would be to serve Christian clients for non-religious work while declining to create specifically Christian-themed artwork or messages.

If so, what is the legal reason that this is the case and what policy does this serve?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **The Distinction Is Probably Between Criminal And Civil Enforcement**\n\nMy suspicion is that the distinction that you are picking up upon reflects of division of labor in which civil enforcement actions are mostly handled by lawyers assigned to the Securities and Exchange Commission (an independent federal government agency), while criminal securities fraud enforcement actions are mostly handled by lawyers assigned to the United States Department of Justice. \n\nBut, I strongly suspect that the fundamental source of the distinction is the kind of case handled by each agency and not agency of employment per se, because constitutionally and for most purposes, SEC employees and Justice Department employees are both employees of the same entity, the federal government of the United States of America.\n\nIf an SEC lawyer were loaned to the Department of Justice to work on a criminal securities fraud prosecution that the DOJ didn't have anyone qualified to prosecute due to lack of financial industry knowledge, I do not believe that the limitation that you assert exists would apply.\n\n**Search Warrants, Wiretaps and Arrest Warrants Are Generally Only Available In Criminal Cases**\n\nGenerally speaking, search warrants, wiretaps, and arrest warrants are investigative tools available only in criminal investigations, and in the absence of exigent circumstances, may only be issued upon a showing to a neutral magistrate or judge, supported by a sworn statement showing that probable cause exists that a crime has been committed and (1\\) in the case of an arrest warrant, that the person named committed that crime, and (2\\) in the case of a search warrant or wiretap, that the search or wiretap will reveal evidence of that crime. \n\n*Exceptions To The General Rule*\n\nThe main exceptions to this general rule is that arrest warrants may issue in a civil case (i) to compel the attendance of a witness who fails to make a timely response or appearance to a subpoena after being personally served in a timely manner with that subpoena, (ii) to compel someone to attend a quasi\\-criminal contempt of court hearing, and (iii) to arrest someone who have been held in contempt of court. In criminal contempt proceedings, contempt of court is a crime that is just prosecuted using an unusual procedure. In the case of subpoena enforcement and civil contempt enforcement the infringement on an arrestee's right is limited in that compliance with the court's order will promptly result in the person arrested being freed. Also in subpoena and civil contempt cases the person arrested does not get a criminal record as a result (although they may get an arrest record), so there are no collateral consequences to the proceeding as there would be a criminal case.\n\n*The Legal Basis For This Rule*\n\nThese limitations are a function of the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution which states:\n\n> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,\n>  and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be\n>  violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,\n>  supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the\n>  place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\nThe implied term that \"probable cause\" means probable cause that a crime has committed and that the object of the search or seizure is connected to that crime is a long standing interpretation of the 4th Amendment through case law. \n\nThis interpretation has been applied and has been enforced via the exclusionary rule in federal criminal prosecutions since *Weeks v. United States*, 232 U.S. 383 (1914\\) (the U.S. Supreme Court definitively applied the 4th Amendment exclusionary rule to state criminal prosecutions under the selective incorporation doctrine via the 14th Amendment in *Mapp v. Ohio*, 367 U.S. 643 (1961\\)). \n\nThe meaning of probable cause, however, is even older than the exclusionary rule (before which, a civil rights action would have been the primary remedy for a violation). But, federal criminal prosecutions were extremely rare in the first 90\\-150 or so years of the existence of the federal government because the scope of federal government activity relative to state government activity was much smaller, and because the combined scope of all government was smaller in a less complex economy.\n\n*Wire Taps Are 4th Amendment Searches*\n\nThe determination that a wiretap was a search for 4th Amendment purposes was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in *Katz v. United States*, 389 U.S. 347 (1967\\).\n\n*Policy Considerations*\n\nThe investigatory tools of search warrants, wire taps and arrest warrants, are frequently obtained *ex parte* and secretly (until the search, wiretap or arrest is complete), because the law considers it likely that defendants facing potentially lengthy incarceration will risk disobeying court orders and destroy evidence to avoid those consequences. \n\nIn a criminal case, the assumption that the defendant is basically a law abiding person which applies in civil cases no longer holds true once probable cause has been demonstrated to an independent magistrate, even though the defendant is presumed innocent for the purpose of an ultimate trial.\n\nThe policy purpose of this rule is to allow \"people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects\" from government intrusions allowing them privacy, comfort and security as a basic human right. The 4th Amendment is the way that the law balances those privacy interests and the compelling interest of the state in punishing crime so as to deter people from committing crimes.\n\n**Securing Evidence In Civil Cases**\n\n*What Are Civil Cases?*\n\nCivil cases are case where only money judgments and injunctive awards which do not involve incarceration if obeyed are potential punishments, and are generally considered less serious than criminal charges for which incarceration and various other collateral consequences are available as punishments, for a variety of procedural purposes.\n\nMost civil cases are brought by private parties, but governmental officials, usually in regulatory agencies, can also bring civil cases.\n\nIn civil cases, it is generally assumed that defendants and their lawyers, facing the limited stakes that they do, will comply with court orders and will cooperate in providing testimony and documents rather than upping the stakes to criminal obstruction of justice charges and civil spoilation of evidence charges.\n\n*Obtaining Evidence In Civil Cases*\n\nIn civil cases, evidence must generally be obtained voluntarily from third parties, obtained involuntarily from the parties via the disclosure and discovery process of the rules of civil procedure (which were greatly expanded around the same time that the SEC was created in connection with a major overhaul of federal civil procedure that resulted in the federal rules of civil procedure in effect with amendments today), and via subpoenas. These discovery and subpoena tools are all basically derivative of the common law trial subpoena power, and certain other powers that were vested in courts of equity, which is constitutionally recognized in federal criminal trials in the 6th Amendment which includes a right \"to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor\" and applies in civil trials by tradition, court rule and statute. \n\nThe SEC has statutory pre\\-litigation subpoena power even in the absence of a pending lawsuit between the SEC and the parties subject to the subpoena as do almost all other administrative agencies that enforce non\\-criminal law.\n\nAlso, because of the way that the securities laws enforced by the SEC are structured, it is possible to bring civil cases and try them without any need to resort to discovery or investigatory tools, based upon complaints filed by members of the public. For example, placing a newspaper ad offering to sell shares of stock without a registration of the offering with the SEC is a civil violation which can often be pursued in a civil case with a copy of the newspaper and the documents provided to a complaining witness by the defendants. In contrast, criminal charges almost always require third party evidence of criminal intent which is rarely publicly available.\n\nAnother useful tool in civil cases is that the 5th Amendment privilege against self\\-incrimination does not apply, so if the defendant refused to testify (perhaps claiming the 5th Amendment for fear of criminal consequences of truthful testimony) that refusal to testify can be used to infer that his testimony would have hurt him and to find civil liability.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawyers typically cannot use surveillance evidence or wiretaps in their investigations, while Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers can?\n\nA) SEC lawyers are not authorized to handle criminal cases, which are required for obtaining wiretaps and surveillance evidence.\nB) The 4th Amendment explicitly prohibits the use of wiretaps and surveillance in civil cases.\nC) SEC lawyers are not considered federal employees, unlike DOJ lawyers.\nD) SEC investigations are always public, making secret surveillance impossible.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The key distinction lies in the type of cases handled by each agency, not the agency itself. SEC lawyers typically handle civil enforcement actions, while DOJ lawyers handle criminal prosecutions. Wiretaps and surveillance evidence generally require probable cause of criminal activity and are only available in criminal investigations, as per 4th Amendment interpretations. Civil cases, which the SEC primarily deals with, use different methods of evidence gathering such as subpoenas and discovery processes. If an SEC lawyer were to work on a criminal case with the DOJ, they would likely have access to these investigative tools. The other options are incorrect: B) The 4th Amendment doesn't explicitly prohibit surveillance in civil cases, it's the interpretation that matters; C) Both SEC and DOJ lawyers are federal employees; D) SEC investigations are not always public, and this isn't the reason for the limitation on surveillance use."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80717/should-the-village-compensate-for-wrong-land-measurement", "docs_id": 80717, "title": "Should the village compensate for wrong land measurement?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I bought a house 10 years ago.

Or will they just tell me to pay it and perhaps add a $20 fee on top of the 30% of $500 that they consider me to owe them?\n\nAgain, I'm talking \"in general\". In most countries. Feel free to use the USA as an example, but I'd be interested if it varies wildly.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short Answer**\n\nThe dollar amount of a criminal tax offense is considered at the sentencing stage, but is only one of many factors and merely helps determine which of several possible sentencing guideline sentences that a U.S. judge uses as a starting point when determining the sentence.\n\nWhile the amount of money involved is a factor, the punishment isn't usually \"proportional\" to the tax liability in a criminal tax case.\n\nBut criminal tax offenses make up only a tiny fraction of all punishments imposed for violating tax laws. Most tax law violations are punished with civil penalties that are often proportional to the amount of tax not paid or not reported.\n\nThe U.S. pattern in this respect is typical of punishments for violating tax laws in the developed world more generally.\n\nUndeveloped and developing country economies tend to be less bureaucratic and to have a more criminal law oriented system for punishing violations of their revenue collection laws, and also tend to have narrower tax bases limited to more concrete transactions. Many resource rich countries, like oil rich monarchies, often don't impose taxes on the general public at all.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\n> I'm sure they will punish me somehow, and not care about any\n> explanation I might have.

Less frequently, the civil penalty involves the forfeiture of property of the offending taxpayer (e.g. currency received as lawful payments for goods or services that is not disclosed to tax officials), or the loss of some tax law related benefit or privilege (e.g. disallowing a tax credit when a tax return upon which it should be claimed isn't filed by the due date).\n\nStrict liability or negligence based penalties for tax law violations are usually civil rather than criminal. Criminal penalties for tax law violations are usually reserved for intentional misconduct.\n\n*How Severe Are Tax Crime Penalties?*\n\nCriminal tax crimes usually involve intentional fraud or willful conduct influencing the amount of taxes you owe (as opposed to good faith efforts to lawfully not pay higher taxes than necessary, or negligent or unintentional actions that have that effect), or intentional non\\-reporting or misreporting of information necessary for the government to determine how much tax someone else owes, or willfully failing to pay or collect taxes when the taxable is able to pay or collect the taxes, or for conduct that thwarts tax collection more generally (like sending fake inaccurate tax forms to random people causing them to pay the wrong amount of taxes or none at all). The maximum penalty for serious tax crimes of this type are typically similar in severity to the maximum penalty for non\\-violent theft, forgery or fraud offenses not involving taxes, which is typically at the low to medium end for felony criminal conduct and is typically far less than the maximum punishment for violent crimes.\n\nCrimes involving willful manipulation of how much tax is owed by someone usually has higher maximum criminal penalties than willful failure to pay or collect taxes.\n\nConduct such as lying to tax investigators, or disregarding legal process during tax audits and litigation, or other fraudulent conduct that doesn't change how much is owed or paid directly but makes it more cumbersome to collect taxes (like intentionally filing a false information tax return, when the taxpayer reports the income anyway, or filing a false information tax return to harass someone who doesn't owe any tax in the first place), are typically misdemeanors with only comparatively minor criminal penalties (perhaps a few days to a year in jail and a fine in the hundreds or single digit thousands of dollars).\n\nThe main driver of the maximum penalty for the narrow range of tax law violations are actually tax crimes is how clearly malicious and unruly the conduct is, rather than the amount in controversy. Negligently failing to pay $10,000,000, or recklessly taking a very dubious tax law position in a tax return, will usually result in a large civil tax penalty, but no criminal prosecution. Intentionally forging or doctoring a $700 information tax return, or intentionally paying a tax bill with counterfeit currency, will usually have criminal penalties.\n\nThere are also quite a few crimes that arguably count as tax crimes for conduct like murdering tax collectors, kidnapping tax collectors, assaulting tax collectors, bribing tax collectors, blackmailing tax collectors to act unlawfully, stealing or destroying tax collection agency property, etc. that would be crimes even if there was no tax component to the conduct, that I do not consider in this answer. These crimes are usually punished only modestly more severely than they are in the non\\-tax context when no government officials or offices are involved, and are usually punished with about the same severity as other crimes against non\\-tax government officials.\n\n*Determining The Sentence For A Tax Crime Under U.S. Law*\n\nIn the U.S., the maximum period of incarceration for a federal tax related crime is usually not related to the amount of money that the government was denied in tax revenues, although the civil penalties for violations of tax laws are usually capped at a percentage of the tax not paid. Criminal fines for tax offenses are sometimes related to the dollar amount of the offense, and sometimes aren't related directly to the dollar amount, although they may be determined with the dollar amount of the offense in mind.\n\nThe length of the sentence of incarceration and the amount of the fine actually imposed by a federal judge upon a conviction for a federal tax related crime between the maximum and minimum sentences authorized by law is governed by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines set by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Commission.\n\nThe guideline sentence is based upon the specific subsection of the federal tax crime for which you were convicted and then a lot of factors that add or deduct points. Some of the points are related to your prior criminal history. Some of the points are related to your conduct in the litigation (e.g. did you cooperate with prosecutors), and some of the points are based upon the nature of the offense itself, including the dollar amount of the tax loss caused by the crime. Typically, there are several dollar ranges for each crime, and the number of points added to the number used to determine the sentencing guideline range is stated for each of the possible range of dollar values of the money at issue in the crime.\n\nThe number of points you have after the judge evaluates all of these factors (based upon a preponderance of the evidence with lower evidentiary standards than those that apply at the guilt\\-innocence phase of the case) to produce a non\\-binding recommended sentencing range for the crime. The judge than imposes the sentence.\n\nA sentence within a correctly determined sentencing guideline range is always upheld on appeal. A judge can impose a sentence that is higher than the guideline range but lower than the maximum statutorily authorized sentence, or below the guideline range by higher than the minimum statutorily authorized sentence, if the judge articulates reasons for doing so that are on a list of reasons that a judge can impose a non\\-guideline sentence.\n\nIf a sentence for a federal tax crime conviction is appealed, the appellate court evaluates whether the sentencing guideline range was determined correctly, and whether if the judge imposed a sentence outside the sentencing guideline range, if the reasons articulated by the judge were insufficient to justify that decision and hence constituted an abuse of discretion by the judge. If the appellate court makes that determination, the case is remanded for re\\-sentencing in accordance with the appellate court opinion (assuming that the conviction itself was affirmed on appeal).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner intentionally fails to report $10,000 in Bitcoin transactions on their tax return.

The guidelines use broader ranges of dollar amounts to assign \"points\" that contribute to the sentence calculation. \n\nOptions A, B, and C are all explicitly mentioned as factors that influence the sentencing guideline calculation. The specific subsection violated sets the base offense level, prior criminal history is a major factor in determining the guideline range, and cooperation with prosecutors can lead to a reduction in the offense level.\n\nThe exact tax percentage owed (option D) is not directly used in the guideline calculations, making it the least likely factor to directly influence the length of the prison sentence among the given options."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5364/can-a-person-block-access-to-a-public-space-if-so-how-much-public-space", "docs_id": 5364, "title": "Can a person block access to a public space?

While John can use public space for his picnic and lay out a blanket, even a large one, he cannot prevent others from using the same space. Public parks are meant for everyone's use, and no individual can claim exclusive rights to a portion of it. John's attempt to block others from using the area covered by his blanket goes beyond acceptable use of public space.\n\nIf John's large blanket significantly impedes others' ability to enjoy the park, park administrators or law enforcement could ask him to remove it or reduce its size.

In [accompanying media articles](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/new-zealand-river-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-being) it wasn't clear whether this meant a living entity, a person or a human; the article author says \"human\", the Whanganui representative is quoted as saying \"living entity\" and Finlayson is quoted as saying \"person\". I recognise that these are three different (although overlapping) legal definitions carrying different liabilities. And while I would agree that the net ecosystem services of a river clearly outweight its costs even before you consider the social and religious significance, as far as I am aware the law on corporate personhood does not recognise this. If/when you cause harm, you can be sued.\n\nAssuming that a direct quote from the minister responsible for the law (Chris Finlayson) can be taken at face value:\n\n> Te Awa Tupua will have its own legal identity with all the\n>  corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a legal person\n\n...

If someone drowns, the river will be prosecuted for murder? What happens if a river goes bankrupt?\n\nThe [Economist article](https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21719409-odd-legal-status-intended-help-prevent-pollution-and-other-abuses-new-zealand-declares) mentions that some NZers have been 'joking' about whether the river can be prosecuted if someone drowns, but doesn't attempt to answer that. I assume it's implying that it's ludicrous, but that's not obvious to me from the information provided.\n\nI am interested to know whether this decision potentially creates significant legal liabilities for the river which may not be obvious to those who think this is a straightforward environmental 'win' for the Whanganui.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In context, the answer is *clearly not*. The precise reason that this is the case, requires a somewhat more sophisticated theory of what is going on than the *Economist* article cited seems to provide.\n\nThe most useful analogy to apply to a situation when a river or forest or some other non\\-sentient being is given legal personality would be the relationship of a [guardian and ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian). A guardian for a ward can be appointed by a court or other person with a special relationship to the ward (e.g. a parent or deceased parent for a child, or a spouse for an older person, or an indigenous tribe for a river), to look out for the best interests of a ward (sometimes at public expense). A ward could be a minor, or a person with advanced dementia, or otherwise unable to personally take legal action on their own behalf. In this case, the ward is a river.\n\nYou couldn't prosecute a river criminally or for most civil obligations (e.g., breach of contract and torts) for its own actions for the same sorts of reasons that you couldn't prosecute a six months old, or an individual in a coma, on that basis. A person such as that could neither have capacity to contract nor form the intent necessary to commit a tort and be legally responsible for that tort.\n\nIn the same way, the river doesn't actually walk into court, or sign affidavits, or sign contracts, or anything like that. Instead, it acts through a fiduciary appointed to act on its behalf in its best interests (in the [environmental law context](http://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3359&context=mlr) (also [here](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1559&context=wmelpr)), such a guardian is often called a \"[Lorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lorax)\" after the character in the Dr. Seuss book, \"The Lorax\" who says \"I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees. I speak for the trees for the trees have no tongues.\"). It merely has the capacity to sue, much like a corporation or a trust or a probate estate or a guardianship estate, through a fiduciary appointed on its behalf, and is granted legal standing in cases related to it.\n\nIf the river enters into contracts through its guardian, however, for example, to provide irrigation water to a company in exchange for the company ceasing to pollute it, that contract would probably be enforceable by specific performance, at least (the river is probably judgment proof, so a suit for money damages would be futile anyway), in a suit to which the guardian would be made a party and have standing to raise defenses.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the legal concept of personhood granted to the Whanganui River in New Zealand, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the river's legal liabilities?\n\nA) The river can be prosecuted for criminal charges such as murder if someone drowns in it.\n\nB) The river is personally liable for any damage caused by flooding and can be sued directly.\n\nC) The river acts through a guardian who represents its interests, similar to a legal guardian for a minor or incapacitated person.\n\nD) The river can enter into contracts independently and be held financially responsible for breaching them.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The legal personhood granted to the Whanganui River is best understood through the analogy of a guardian-ward relationship. Like a guardian appointed for a minor or incapacitated person, the river has a representative (often called a \"Lorax\" in environmental law contexts) who acts on its behalf and in its best interests. The river cannot be directly prosecuted for criminal charges or sued for civil damages as it lacks the capacity to form intent or take independent actions. It cannot enter into contracts on its own, but rather through its appointed guardian. This arrangement allows the river to have legal standing in cases related to it, while protecting it from direct liability for natural occurrences like flooding or accidental drownings."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59234/are-there-laws-disallowing-discriminatory-pricing-based-on-the-customers-employ", "docs_id": 59234, "title": "Are there laws disallowing discriminatory pricing based on the customer&#39;s employment?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Are there any jurisdictions in the US which make it illegal (against the law rather than against some contract or custom) to charge higher prices for categories of customers based on their employment.

Dunkin' Donuts, one of the first chains to run 24/7 service in the U.S. needed some security (especially during the Graveyard shift, when robbers were more likely to cause trouble because of very few witnesses) and found that for the price of a donut and some coffee, they could have the city's finest sitting in their parking lot, sipping coffee and writing reports, for way cheaper than hiring a security service.

[EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/pre-employment-inquiries-and-religious-affiliation-or-beliefs) says that \"Questions about an applicant's religious affiliation or beliefs (unless the religion is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ)), are generally viewed as non job\\-related and problematic under federal law\". They also state that (excluding positions with religious exemptions, like hiring a Catholic priest) \"Other employers should avoid questions about an applicant's religious affiliation, such as place of worship, days of worship, and religious holidays and should not ask for references from religious leaders, e.g., minister, rabbi, priest, imam, or pastor\". This reflects the standards by which they will make a finding of forbidden religious discrimination.\n\nThe actual statutory law, [42 USC 2000e\\-2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-2) does not prohibit asking questions about religion, instead it says\n\n> (a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u2014 (1\\)\n> to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise\n> to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\n> compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because\n> of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;\n> or (2\\) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants\n> for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n> individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n> his status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color,\n> religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n[29 CFR Part 38 Subpart A](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/subtitle-A/part-38/subpart-A) does not specifically prohibit asking questions. Although many labor\\-law web sites and HR advice firms state that asking questions is illegal, DoL and EEOC do not specifically declare categorical illegality. The fact of asking some question might constitute partial evidence for a finding of religious discrimination. So no court has held that it is flatly illegal for an employer to ask a question about religion.\n\nThe case of [EEOC v. Abercrombie \\& Fitch](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-86_p86b.pdf), which did find discrimination, gives you the required elements for a finding of religious discrimination. There is simply no \"don't ask\" cause of action. Asking might be evidence to support a claim of disparate treatment based on religion. The rule is: \"An employer may not  \n\nmake an applicant\u2019s religious practice, confirmed or otherwise, a factor in employment decisions\".\n\nI have found no cases where [EEOC found illegal discrimination](https://www.eeoc.gov/selected-list-pending-and-resolved-cases-alleging-religious-and-national-origin-discrimination) based exclusively on the fact of asking questions about religion.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A large tech company conducts an anonymous survey of its employees, asking about their religious affiliations and practices.

You couldn't press charges on the drivers in an accident for detaining you\". There's a huge difference between being detained by an accident, and a group of people intentionally and unlawfully detaining me on a public freeway. So I really don't understand these responses.\n\n---\n\nMy initial wording to the question seemed to confuse my intentions and lead to alot of \"no, you can't run them over\" rhetoric (which wasn't actually my question at all), so I've edited and simplified the question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **tl;dr**\n\nHitting the pedestrians is a separate crime, even if they shouldn't be there.\n\n**Background**\n\n*On a highway, you might have a legal right of way and therefore a claim against the pedestrians for failing to yield.*\n\nSince the states (and not the federal government) own and operate the interstate highway system, your specific answer depends on the state law. \n\nIn North Carolina, for example, pedestrians walking along or upon a highway have a [statutory duty](http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/trans/wolftrails/documents/wt-ped-laws.pdf) to yield the right of way to all vehicles. So you could probably videotape and press misdemeanor charges against them individually. That said, contacting the police and waiting (or taking an alternate route) is the best recourse.\n\n*Having the right of way (or feeling ethically justified) doesn't allow you to commit an offense like hitting a pedestrian.*\n\nThe fact that the pedestrians aren't supposed to be in your way is of little consolation in the charges you'll face if you injure or kill one. The court will see this as a legal/ethical problem, but one that won't go in your favor.\n\nIn particular, you deliberately directed your vehicle into the crowd with the knowledge that the action might cause harm. One doesn't have to imagine the [Austin Powers steamroller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PrZ-J7D3k) scenario to know that injuries are possible when cars go through crowds. That will pull all of the \"involuntary\"\\-flavored mitigations off the table.\n\nIn particular, driving a car into a crowd might be considered \"an inherently dangerous act or omission, done in such a reckless and wanton manner as to manifest a mind utterly without regard for human life and social duty.\" In the worst case scenario, where someone died as a result, a North Carolina prosecutor might push for [second\\-degree](http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_14/GS_14-17.html) murder (which operates on a \"recklessness\\-plus\" standard and might not be as crazy as it sounds since driving into the crowd is likely reckless, and driving in slowly with them yelling at you to stop could push a jury over the top). In that case, as a defendant, you'd hope your charge could be mitigated down to something like [death by vehicle](http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/statutes/statutelookup.pl?statute=20-141.4) (which is similar to \"vehicular manslaughter\" in other states), and you'd shoot for the misdemeanor version of death by vehicle since you weren't driving under the influence. However, a key element of proving death by vehicle is that you *unintentionally* caused the death\\-\\-\\-and the fact that you deliberately drove into the crowd might ruin your defense. In the case where you just hurt someone, you'd likewise hope to mitigate intentional charges to unintentional ones.\n\n*A claim for false imprisonment is unlikely to succeed.*\n\nFalse imprisonment is called a variety of things\\-\\-\\-like felonious/misdemeanor restraint, unlawful detainment, etc.\\-\\-\\-depending on where you live. To prove it (and generalizing a bit since this varies by state), you typically have to show (1\\) detention or restraint against your will, and (2\\) unlawfulness of the detention or restraint. A big challenge here is that courts often interpret this to mean detention or restraint by exercise of force or threat of force, as in *Harris v. Stanioch*, 150 Wash. 380 (1928\\) for example. The protesters are just in the way, so it's unlikely this would hold up.\n\n*Self defense almost surely won't be a viable excuse.*\n\nThe idea of driving the car slowly through the crowd relies on the notion that you should be able to escape the alleged detention. The escape you're considering in driving through the crowd likely comes at the expense of making contact with members of the crowd. Making unprivileged contacts might be allowable in self defense. However, self defense probably hold up either. Setting aside notions of proportional defense, you have to be defending yourself against something: force or threats of it by the protesters. So if they don't use force, or threaten it, against you, then your defense is going to be really shaky.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A group of protesters is blocking an interstate highway, causing significant traffic delays.

If it\u2019s on sale then this might work if done properly.\n\nIf it is a contractural restriction that the shop freely entered, it is unlikely that this ruse would protect them from a breach of contract suit because the shop is obviously acting in bad faith in a calculated attempt to avoid their obligations.\n\nIf it really is a law restricting sales, then giving it away free would work. However, what the shop is doing is not giving away free water \\- they are bundling a peanut and a bottle of water and selling that.

However, it's crucial that the water is genuinely free and available to anyone who asks, not just those who purchase peanuts. The case of the Sydney salon giving \"free\" wine with haircuts demonstrates that if the \"free\" item is only available with a purchase, it may still be considered a sale.

Aircraft are not, however, enentitled to use false markings.\n\nFrom [false flag Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#cite_ref-9)\n\n> In land warfare, such operations are generally deemed acceptable under certain circumstances, such as to deceive enemies, provided the deception is not perfidious and that all such deceptions are discarded before opening fire upon the enemy. Similarly, in naval warfare such a deception is considered permissible, provided the false flag is lowered and the true flag raised before engaging in battle.\n\n**Initial question**: What is the intention of this law, like why is it considered unfair fighting to use false flags (when taking action/open firing already)? **ETA**: By which I mean to ask: Why is it considered unfair/inhumane/inhuman/unethical/immoral fighting to (continue to) use false flags (when taking action/open firing already)?\n\nContext:\n========\n\n1\n\nWhat I understand is that a 'war crime' is something which gives you an unfair advantage in that civilians are affected at the cost of your military progress eg [chemical weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention), [incendiary weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Certain_Conventional_Weapons) (at least in [our world](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/267014/what-are-likely-to-not-be-considered-war-crimes-in-atla-tlok); alternatively see [here](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/234792/what-are-likely-to-not-be-considered-war-crimes-in-a-universe-where-people-can-c) or directly [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QxLB2.jpg)) or well actually directly killing civilians for example.\n\n2\n\nMy intention is to genuinely understand what is inhumane/unfair/unjust about attacking with false flags.

Obvious examples are prohibitions on attacking civilians, destroying civilian property and infrastructure, neglecting civilian public health, harming prisoners who are incapable of fighting, and so on. I wouldn't say these are about \"fairness\" or any other such abstract ethical principle; they are simply pragmatic. All other things equal, the world is better off if fewer civilians end up dead.\n\nAnd so just as the laws try to avoid collateral damage to *individuals* who are not fighting (civilians, prisoners, injured troops, etc), they likewise try to avoid collateral damage to *nations* who are not fighting (neutrals). Combat under a false flag carries a risk of harm to the nation whose flag is impersonated, as the belligerents may get the wrong idea about who is attacking them.\n\nHere are a couple of scenarios that could occur if false flag combat were considered acceptable:\n\n1. Potsylvania is at war with Grand Fenwick, while Freedonia remains neutral in the conflict. The Potsylvanian ship *Fearless* sights the Fenwickian ship *Goose*, and as a ruse, the *Fearless* runs up a Freedonian flag. The *Goose*, knowing that Freedonia is neutral, assumes the *Fearless* is harmless and lets it approach. When within range, the *Fearless* fires at the *Goose*, while still flying the Freedonian flag. The *Goose* reports back to its government that they have been attacked by a Freedonian vessel. The Fenwickian government considers this a hostile act, declares war on Freedonia, and launches an immediate retaliatory invasion of Freedonian territory. Now Freedonia has been brought into the war despite no party actually having anything against them. This is not desirable.\n2. Same scenario, but instead of raising a Freedonian flag, the *Fearless* runs up a Fenwickian flag. The *Goose* knows the flag must be fake, as no genuine Fenwickian vessel would attack them, but they don't know what nation the *Fearless* actually does belong to. They faintly hear the captain of the *Fearless* shouting orders in Potsylvanian, but he has a Freedonian accent and they think he's speaking in Freedonian. They report to their government that a Freedonian vessel has attacked them, and Grand Fenwick again declares war on Freedonia.\n\nNote that using a false flag when *not* attacking doesn't carry the same risks, which is why it is not included in the prohibition. Suppose that the *Fearless* doesn't plan to attack the *Goose*, but simply wants to avoid being attacked so they can get away. If their ruse of flying a Freedonian flag is successful, then the *Goose* simply thinks they saw a neutral Freedonian vessel going about its business, and Grand Fenwick does not get the idea that Freedonia is doing anything aggressive. And if it's unsuccessful, then the *Goose* must have figured out that the *Fearless* is not Freedonian at all, but instead Potsylvanian, and so likewise Freedonia does not come under suspicion.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why the use of false flags during combat is prohibited under international law?\n\nA) It gives an unfair military advantage to the side using false flags\nB) It potentially harms neutral nations not involved in the conflict\nC) It violates the principle of distinction between combatants and civilians\nD) It prevents captured soldiers from claiming prisoner of war status\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\n\nA) While using false flags may provide some tactical advantage, this is not the primary reason for the prohibition.

Is it legal?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The relevant law is [section 828(b)(2\\) of the civil code](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=827.):\n\n> (2\\) If the proposed rent increase for that tenant is 10 percent or less of the rental amount charged to that tenant at any time during the 12 months prior to the effective date of the increase, either in and of itself or when combined with any other rent increases for the 12 months prior to the effective date of the increase, the notice shall be delivered at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the increase, and subject to Section 1013 of the Code of Civil Procedure if served by mail.\n\nYour landlord is offering to renew your existing one\\-year lease for a 10% rent increase, and as such, a 40\\-day notice meets the requirements of \"at least 30 days\". The fact that you're also given the option to change your lease terms at an increase of more than 10% is irrelevant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in California receives a rent increase notice 40 days before their current lease ends.

A month-to-month lease with the amount from option 1 plus an additional $500\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct regarding the legality of this notice?\n\nA) The notice is illegal because the month-to-month option exceeds a 10% increase, requiring a 60-day notice period.\nB) The notice is legal because the one-year lease option complies with the 30-day notice requirement for increases of 10% or less.\nC) The notice is illegal because both options must be within the 10% increase limit to comply with California law.\nD) The notice is legal only if the tenant chooses the one-year lease option; selecting the month-to-month option would make it illegal.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The notice is legal because the one-year lease option complies with the 30-day notice requirement for increases of 10% or less. According to California Civil Code Section 827(b)(2), a 30-day notice is required for rent increases of 10% or less. The landlord provided a 40-day notice, which exceeds the minimum requirement. The fact that there's an alternative option with a higher increase doesn't invalidate the notice, as the tenant has the choice to select the compliant 10% increase option.

Strict liability of an employer or principal for acts of an employee or agent, or by one general partner for another one, or of an insurer or surety for someone insured or guaranteed.\n2. Strict liability for a defective product.

Strict liability for harm caused by an ultra\\-hazardous activity. The inference is that a reasonable person wouldn't engage in ultra\\-hazardous activities at all.\n4. Strict liability is imposed for breaches of contract.\n\nGenerally the common theme is that someone subject to liability consciously assumed a risk of liability in advance of an incident, and often has some control or influence over the events that could conceivably cause harm.\n\nStrict liability is not constitutionally required or prohibited.

Typically the share or bond certificates are held in the name of a nominee company which in turn are held by a brokerage for the benefit of its customers, and not infrequently the brokerage account is in turn owned by a revocable trust or other trust for the benefit of the beneficial owners.\n\n[The commercial reality](https://www.lexisnexis.com/documents/pdf/20080507045332_large.rtf) is discussed in the official comments and memorandum discussions of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the United States. Shares held in nominee form all called \"[street name securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_name_securities)\" in the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nOwnership of mortgages sold in the secondary market in the U.S. is handled similarly. The original lender typically transfers nominal status as holder of the note obligation to [MERS](https://www.mersinc.org/products-services/mers-system/faq), a nominee firm, that in turn is held by a trust that owns a pool of mortgages called a mortgage backed security, that is in turn owned by secondary market investors through brokerage account trusts and often through personal trusts or a charitable pooled trust for the benefit of ultimate beneficial owner charities.

Any legal charge of treason is treason against the country. Article III, Section 3, Clause 1 of the US constitution reads:\n\n> Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\n\nSee also [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2381 \\- Treason](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) which reads:\n\n> Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.\n\nIt is hard to see how making war on the United States, or helping an open enemy do so, could \"save the nation\" and in the absence of either of these, there is no treason, although other charges might possibly apply.\n\nThe [interactive Constitution site](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/article-iii/clauses/39) from the National Constitutions Center says about this provision of the Constitution:\n\n> Treason is a unique offense in our constitutional order\u2014the only crime expressly defined by the Constitution, and applying only to Americans who have betrayed the allegiance they are presumed to owe the United States. While the Constitution\u2019s Framers shared the centuries\\-old view that all citizens owed a duty of loyalty to their home nation, they included the Treason Clause not so much to underscore the seriousness of such a betrayal, but to guard against the historic use of treason prosecutions by repressive governments to silence otherwise legitimate political opposition. Debate surrounding the Clause at the Constitutional Convention thus focused on ways to narrowly define the offense, and to protect against false or flimsy prosecutions.\n> \n> \n> The Constitution specifically identifies what constitutes treason against the United States and, importantly, limits the offense of treason to only two types of conduct: (1\\) \u201clevying war\u201d against the United States; or (2\\) \u201cadhering to \\[the] enemies \\[of the United States], giving them aid and comfort.\u201d Although there have not been many treason prosecutions in American history\u2014indeed, only one person has been indicted for treason since 1954\u2014the Supreme Court has had occasion to further define what each type of treason entails.\n\n> The offense of \u201clevying war\u201d against the United States was interpreted narrowly in *Ex parte Bollman \\& Swarthout* (1807\\), a case stemming from the infamous alleged plot led by former Vice President Aaron Burr to overthrow the American government in New Orleans. The Supreme Court dismissed charges of treason that had been brought against two of Burr\u2019s associates\u2014Bollman and Swarthout\u2014on the grounds that their alleged conduct did not constitute levying war against the United States within the meaning of the Treason Clause. It was not enough, Chief Justice John Marshall\u2019s opinion emphasized, merely to conspire \u201cto subvert by force the government of our country\u201d by recruiting troops, procuring maps, and drawing up plans. Conspiring to levy war was distinct from actually levying war. Rather, a person could be convicted of treason for levying war only if there was an \u201cactual assemblage of men for the purpose of executing a treasonable design.\u201d In so holding, the Court sharply confined the scope of the offense of treason by levying war against the United States.\n\n> The Court construed the other treason offense authorized by the Constitution similarly narrowly in *Cramer v. United States* (1945\\). That case involved another infamous incident in American history: the Nazi Saboteur Affair. Cramer was prosecuted for treason for allegedly helping German soldiers who had surreptitiously infiltrated American soil during World War II. In reviewing Cramer\u2019s treason conviction, the Court explained that a person could be convicted of treason only if he or she adhered to an enemy and gave that enemy \u201caid and comfort.\u201d As the Court explained:\n> \n> \n> \n> > A citizen intellectually or emotionally may favor the enemy and harbor sympathies or convictions disloyal to this country\u2019s policy or interest, but, so long as he commits no act of aid and comfort to the enemy, there is no treason.

The Supreme Court in Cramer v. United States (1945) clarified that merely harboring sympathies or convictions disloyal to the country's interests does not constitute treason without accompanying acts of aid and comfort to the enemy.\n\nOption D, like option A, describes protected speech. Criticizing government policy, even during tense times, is not treason as long as there is no intent to betray the nation or actual aid given to enemies.\n\nOnly option C involves concrete action that could be interpreted as adhering to enemies and providing them aid and comfort, potentially meeting the constitutional definition of treason if proven with the required evidence and intent."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/40858/could-the-openjdk-license-legally-be-changed-to-a-commercial-one", "docs_id": 40858, "title": "Could the OpenJDK license legally be changed to a commercial one?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am aware of the new commercial licensing model for Oracle JDK.

But since juries do not normally give reasons for their votes, it is hard to establish when it has and when it has not happened, and I have seen no statistics on such occurrences.\n\nBy the way, \"Jury Nullification\" is simply when one or more jury members vote in a particular way because of something other than the law and evidence as presented in the trial. Most often the term is used when a jury votes to acquit because they dislike or disapprove of the law involved.

This can happen in any type of case, not just those involving politicians (ruling out option C). \n\nA is incorrect because jury nullification is not a formal legal process that jurors can request.

The general law is that\n\n> A person shall not drive a vehicle on a [highway](https://law.justia.com/codes/south-carolina/2016/title-56/chapter-5/section-56-5-430/) at a speed greater\n>  than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having regard\n>  to the actual and potential hazards then existing. Speed must be so\n>  controlled to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle, or other\n>  conveyance on or entering the highway in compliance with legal\n>  requirements and the duty of a person to use care.\n\nThere are various maximum lawful speeds that may not be exceeded, for example 70 on the interstate, or 30 in an \"urban district\". Local jurisdictions are authorized to modify the limits, and in [Charleston](https://library.municode.com/sc/charleston/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CICO_CH19MOVETR_ARTVIIOPVEGE_DIV3SPRE) the maximum is generally 25\\. However, a posted limit can also be set, so if the sign says 20, the limit is 20\\.

Option B is false as there is no such blanket rule giving entering drivers the right of way. Option D is incorrect because while parking lots are private property, owners can establish right-of-way rules, and general traffic laws often still apply to some extent in areas open to the public.\n\nThe situation described is complex, and the correct determination of right of way would depend on various factors not fully specified in the question.

There's no fixed two week notice requirement, the amount of notice required depends on the circumstances. It would be necessary for an employer to prove damages that resulted from an employee quitting without giving notice or sufficient notice.\n\nAn example of this would be [Consbec v Peter Walker](https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2014/2014bcsc2070/2014bcsc2070.pdf) where the defendant was determined to have failed to give reasonable notice of his resignation:\n\n> \\[212] Peter was obliged to provide Consbec with notice of his resignation.

Accordingly, it suffered no damages as a result of Peter\u2019s failure to give notice.\n\nIn many ways having a notice period specified in a contract is a much better option than ultimately leaving it up to a court decide. There seems to be very little precedent for this, especially for non\\-fiduciary employees. In Consbec the trial judge opted not to make a determination of what notice period was required in the case, something the appeal court determined was an error. The appeal court determined that a one month notice period was reasonable, but didn't explain how it came to this determination.\n\nOn the other hand, lawsuits like these a very rare for low ranking employees with little or no authority. As in the Consbec case, it would be hard for an employer prove damages. If Consbec hadn't been seeking large damages on other claims it's unlikely it would've brought a lawsuit.\n\n---\n\nSomeone who tried to falsely claim to be sick in order to avoid having to work their remaining notice period would likely at minimum owe their employer the same damages as if they had failed to give notice. If the sick time is paid and/or includes benefits they'd have to pay back or compensate the the employer for these wages and benefits. In addition, because they're still employed, they still owe a duty of loyalty to their employers that former employees do not, and so could face additional damages for doing things like working for a competitor.\n\nSomeone who started work at another job couldn't use this as an excuse to avoid working during the required notice period.

One way in which racial epithets are (indirectly) illegal is via anti\\-discrimination laws, indeed labeled [\"harassment\"](https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment) by the EEOC\n\n> Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color,\n> religion, sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, or\n> pregnancy), national origin, older age (beginning at age 40\\),\n> disability, or genetic information (including family medical history).\n> Harassment becomes unlawful where 1\\) enduring the offensive conduct\n> becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2\\) the conduct is\n> severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a\n> reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.\n> Anti\\-discrimination laws also prohibit harassment against individuals\n> in retaliation for filing a discrimination charge, testifying, or\n> participating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit\n> under these laws; or opposing employment practices that they\n> reasonably believe discriminate against individuals, in violation of\n> these laws.\n\nIf an employer tolerates racial epithets, they are likely to be the target of a harassment lawsuit. There is no limit on who utters the epithet, thus a customer can be the trigger for a suit. In cases not involving supervisory employees, liability arises if the employer \"knew, or should have known about the harassment and failed to take prompt and appropriate corrective action\". Analogously, racial epithets in educational institutions are actionable. Framed in terms of a random epithet by a non\\-employee or campus visitor (where the institution has minimal leverage over the offender), the institution must act, when it becomes aware of such circumstances arising, and cannot just say \"What can *we* do??\".\n\nA second (remote) possibility is through the [fighting words doctrine](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/959/fighting-words), that the government can limit speech that is \"likely to incite immediate violence or retaliation by the recipients of the words\". This arose initially in [Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/315/568/) \u2013 one of the holdings was that\n\n> The Court notices judicially that the appellations \"damned racketeer\"\n> and \"damned Fascist\" are epithets likely to provoke the average person\n> to retaliation, and thereby cause a breach of the peace.\n\nThere have been numerous refinements of the doctrine over the decades, so the mere utterance of a racial epithet would not run afoul of properly\\-restrained \"breach of peace\" laws. One of the two most\\-relevant current opinions is [Brandenburg v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/), 395 U.S. 444, where the court held that the government cannot\n\n> forbid advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where\n> such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless\n> action and is likely to incite or produce such action\n\nbut uttering an epithet is not advocacy of force or law violation. The second is [R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/377/), 505 US 377 where defendant was charged with violating an ordinance that\n\n> prohibits the display of a symbol which one knows or has reason to\n> know \"arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of\n> race, color, creed, religion or gender\"\n\nSCOTUS ruled that \"the First Amendment does not permit a state to use content discrimination to achieve a compelling interest *if it is not necessary to achieve that interest*\" (emphasis added), holding that\n\n> A few limited categories of speech, such as obscenity, defamation, and\n> fighting words, may be regulated because of their constitutionally\n> proscribable content. However, these categories are not entirely\n> invisible to the Constitution, and government may not regulate them\n> based on hostility, or favoritism, towards a nonproscribable message\n> they contain. Thus the regulation of \"fighting words\" may not be based\n> on nonproscribable content. It may, however, be underinclusive,\n> addressing some offensive instances and leaving other, equally\n> offensive, ones alone, so long as the selective proscription is not\n> based on content, or there is no realistic possibility that regulation\n> of ideas is afoot.\n\nA further holding is that the law is\n\n> is facially unconstitutional because it imposes special prohibitions\n> on those speakers who express views on the disfavored subjects of\n> \"race, color, creed, religion or gender.\" At the same time, it permits\n> displays containing abusive invective if they are not addressed to\n> those topics. Moreover, in its practical operation the ordinance goes\n> beyond mere content, to actual viewpoint, discrimination.\n\nThe court has not clearly identified a context in which a law against a racial epithet would be constitutional, they have simply identified other bars that would have to be cleared for such a law to be permissible. No utterance, devoid of context, is illegal, so to discover where such an utterance could be part of a prosecutions, we would need a lot of specific context in the hypothetical.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In what scenario would the use of a racial slur like the N-word most likely be considered illegal in the United States?\n\nA) A person shouting the N-word at a Black individual on the street\nB) A comedian using the N-word as part of their stand-up routine\nC) An employer repeatedly using the N-word to refer to Black employees in the workplace\nD) A person using the N-word in a private conversation with friends\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \n\nOption C is the correct answer because it represents a clear case of workplace harassment, which is prohibited under anti-discrimination laws enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The repeated use of racial slurs by an employer creates a hostile work environment, which is considered unlawful harassment when it is severe or pervasive enough to create an intimidating, hostile, or abusive work environment.\n\nOption A, while highly offensive, is not inherently illegal under U.S. law. It could potentially fall under fighting words doctrine, but courts have narrowed this exception significantly over time.\n\nOption B is protected under the First Amendment as artistic expression, even if it's considered offensive.\n\nOption D, while morally reprehensible, is not illegal as it occurs in a private setting and does not create a hostile environment in a workplace or educational institution.\n\nIt's important to note that while options A, B, and D are not illegal per se, they could potentially lead to other legal issues depending on the specific context and circumstances.
