According to the Rules of Professional Conduct, the attorney is behaving appropriately by maintaining confidentiality and taking direction only from Mrs. Johnson, who is the actual client. Even though Mark is paying for the legal services, he is not considered the client. The attorney is prohibited from disclosing privileged communications with Mrs. Johnson to Mark without her consent. If Mrs. Johnson wants to involve Mark, she can do so herself, but the attorney must prioritize her wishes and judgments over those of her son.

This could consist of an unopened letter with a date stamp, a notarized copy, or some other scheme involving a third party. According to the wikipedia entry there is no specific provision for this in US copyright law.\n\nIs there any legal reason to use a \"poor man's copyright\"? Have these techniques been used successfully in court, or are they mostly useless? And if one wanted to use such a technique, what is the best way to go about it?\n\nI am looking for an answer for US law, but would appreciate other countries' perspectives too.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [U.S. Copyright Office says of poor man's copyright](http://copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#poorman):\n\n> There is no provision in the copyright law regarding any such type of protection, and it is not a substitute for registration.\n\nThis means that the U.S. government will not grant you any special rights or protections for having undertaken poor man's copyright, unlike advance copyright registration, which confers the ability to collect statutory damages. In any case, as a prerequisite to legal action, you will need to register your work, even if you must do so after the infringement has taken place:\n\n> You will have to register, however, if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work.\n\nInstead, poor man's copyright is purely an evidentiary mechanism for proving possession of a work at a particular point in time. Suppose a best\\-selling author illegally uses huge verbatim passages of your unpublished work in a new novel. As part of your legal argument against the infringing author, you want to prove that you possessed your unpublished work decades before the author claimed to have started work on the infringing novel.\n\nThe truly serious issue with many types of poor man's copyright is that it simply *doesn't* prove what it intends to prove. If you have a sealed envelope that is postmarked with a date, that only proves that the *envelope* passed through the postal system on that day. It says nothing about what the contents of the envelope were at the time; notably, the envelope could be mailed unsealed and then filled and sealed at a later date.\n\nMore involved forms of poor man's copyright, like storing a work in an undisturbed bank safe deposit box, *might* carry more evidentiary weight, but such an approach could still be difficult to verify reliably: we must ask the bank to verify the negative that no one ever accessed the deposit box. This may or may not be something the bank is prepared to do, and they may or may not maintain such records perpetually.\n\nIf you really want to prove that you had possession of a creative work on a particular day (which, again, is not a complete legal argument, but may be helpful), you will need to find a trustworthy third party who can demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that the work has remained undisturbed in their possession since a particular date. A bank might be good at this, but the best agency I know of to carry out such a purpose is the *U.S. Copyright Office*! They allow you to register your work (for probably much cheaper than a decades\\-long deposit box rental) *and* confer the benefits of registration, e.g. statutory damages.\n\nI don't know of any legal cases that have tested a poor man's copyright in court. On a personal note, I suspect there are none, because the primary case that poor man's copyright is intended to protect against \\-\\- someone taking your unpublished work and making the baldfaced lie that it is their own, such that your only recourse is to prove a timeline that renders their claims impossible \\-\\- seems somewhat uncommon. Consider the likelihood of such a case occurring combined with the likelihood of a plaintiff who has undertaken poor man's copyright, and I suspect the likelihood is small indeed."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An aspiring author, Alex, has written a novel but hasn't published it yet.

Using product images without permission from the copyright holder (usually the manufacturer) can be considered copyright infringement. Retailers like GadgetZone do not have an automatic right to use these images under fair use or any other doctrine.

Would this matter, if pursued by Bob, be a small claims matter in Spain given that the total bill is about \u20ac2,000?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [france](/questions/tagged/france \"show questions tagged 'france'\")\n\nFrance is not Spain, but both are civil\\-law jurisdictions, so I expect this answer to be marginally more applicable to the original question than answers based on common\\-law countries.\n\nListed prices are binding on the seller, even if mistaken\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrice tag errors (whether physical or electronic) usually involve low amounts of money, so there is not much jurisprudence on that point. Let us start by discussing [Cour de cassation, Chambre civile 1, 04 juillet 1995, 93\\-16198](https://juricaf.org/arret/FRANCE-COURDECASSATION-19950704-9316198), where the highest French court endorsed a 1993 court of appeal ruling, because it illustrates some relevant principles.\n\nA jewelry store put up a ring for sale for 100 000 francs (equivalent to roughly \u20ac20 000 in 2021\\), which someone bought. The store later realized that there was a mistake in the price tag (the intended listing price was more than four times higher) and sued to revert the sale.\n\nThe court of appeals judged that\n\n* as a general rule, mistakes in price tags are a risk the seller takes;\n* the buyer could reasonably think the asked price matched the true value of the ring, and therefore it was not \"unrealistically low\"\n\nThe latter point refers to a statute [(Code Civil 1169\\)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000032041120) that says a contract of something\\-for\\-money is void if the price is \"unrealistically low\". The ruling essentially says that the test for \"unrealistically low\" is whether the buyer should reasonably be aware that the price is due to a mistake from the seller.\n\nI doubt a store can rely on the \"unrealistically low\" provision in the case of shipping fees. A random consumer has no way to accurately know the price of overseas shipping. Even if they did think the shipping fees were much lower than expected, it might be because the store chooses to charge something else that their exact costs, for whatever reason (e.g. uniform shipping fees is easier to maintain on their website that one cost for each country; some stores are \"free shipping\" meaning they recoup their shipping costs with higher item prices).\n\nNo surprise fees\n----------------\n\nThe seller might argue that their shipping costs were unknown, and that the shipping fee they charged was a provisional estimate, or conditional on a later determination of the true cost.\n\n[Code de la consommation, L112\\-3](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000032227327) says that when the total price of the item or service sold \"cannot be reasonably known in advance \\[of the sale]\", the seller must provide advance notice to the buyer, as well as the method by which the unknown components of the price will be later determined. No such notice appears to have been made.\n\nOnline sale: when is the contract formed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe seller might argue that clicking \"buy\" on an online shopping cart does not form a contract, but that they reserve acceptance at a later date. The other answers seem to indicate that is a valid practice in some common\\-law countries, but I believe that is not the case in France. I could not find court cases on exactly that point, and therefore cannot be sure that the rest of my answer is correct.\n\nI believe the seller is bound by the terms offered on the website, based on [Code Civil, 1127\\-1 and 1127\\-2](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/id/LEGISCTA000032007249/).\n\n> Quiconque propose \u00e0 titre professionnel, par voie \u00e9lectronique, la fourniture de biens ou la prestation de services, met \u00e0 disposition les stipulations contractuelles applicables d'une mani\u00e8re qui permette leur conservation et leur reproduction.\n> \n> \n> **L'auteur d'une offre reste engag\u00e9 par elle tant qu'elle est accessible par voie \u00e9lectronique de son fait.**\n> \n> \n> (...)\n> \n> \n> Le contrat n'est valablement conclu que si le destinataire de l'offre a eu la possibilit\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier le d\u00e9tail de sa commande et son prix total et de corriger d'\u00e9ventuelles erreurs avant de confirmer celle\\-ci pour exprimer son acceptation d\u00e9finitive.\n\n> Whichever business proposes by electronic means the sale of goods or services must allow the contractual conditions be be recorded and reproduced.\n> \n> \n> **The author of an offer is bound by it as long as it is accessible due to his or her actions.**\n> \n> \n> (...)\n> \n> \n> The contract is formed only if the recipient of the offer could check the details of his or her order, its total price, and could correct possible mistakes, before confirming the order to formulate his or her definite acceptance.\n\n\"Due to his or her actions\" means I cannot screenshot an Amazon page (or duplicate it on my web server) and request the conditions of that screenshot two years later. However, it does not include provisions for mistakes in the listed price or sales conditions, and I would expect the general rule (price tag mistakes are on the seller) to apply on the internet.\n\nThe last paragraph cited is a consumer rights provision \\- essentially, \"no contract is formed unless the consumer did X\". However, it implies that once the consumer did X, the contract *is* formed.\n\nContract enforcement\n--------------------\n\nFor the above reasons, I believe clauses that allow an online store to unilaterally cancel an order once placed are unenforceable (unless *force majeure* or other narrow exceptions apply). That being said, the incentive to sue in such cases is low (and I could find no jurisprudence).\n\nIn France (and I believe in all [civil\\-law](/questions/tagged/civil-law \"show questions tagged 'civil-law'\") systems), civil liability is established by three factors: a damage, a wrongful action, and a causation link between the two. In the jewelry case, the store could easily prove the damage (difference between the price at which the sale was made and the price at which the item was estimated), and the causation link between the consumer\u2019s action and the damage; however, there was no wrongful action.\n\nIn the case where the exchange of goods against money has been blocked by the store, the consumer\u2019s problem is to prove damage. If they have not been charged, or if they have been charged but refunded, the direct monetary impact is zero. The consumer would have to prove other theories of damage: for instance, that they relied on the ordered item to do something, and could not find a replacement in time. However, in all such scenarios, the causation link will be hard to prove."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Bob in New Zealand orders a device from a Spanish online store.

I'm inclined to think that if the document being notarized is of a type that only a lawyer may prepare (or it could be prepared by an individual acting for himself), then it would be unauthorized practice of law for a notary who isn't an attorney to suggest which kind of notarial act should be performed on the document.\n\nOn the other hand, if the document is of a type that anyone may give another person advice about, such as a school permission slip, an application form to obtain a birth certificate, or an absentee ballot application, does the mere fact that a notarization is needed magically transform it into a legal document, so the notary is prevented from suggesting which notarial act should be used?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whether this constitutes the practice of law is a close call, and would be somewhat context specific and jurisdiction specific. Generally speaking, the Northeast United States is the most jealous of actions that could be the practice of law committed by non\\-lawyers, while rural states in the Great Plains and Mountain West are most lenient.\n\nNormally, it boils down to a choice between an acknowledgement and an affidavit.

In this scenario, there are several factors that make it prudent for the notary to refrain from suggesting a type of notarial act:\n\n1. The client is from a civil law country, where notaries typically have legal training equivalent to lawyers. This increases the risk that the client might assume the notary has more legal knowledge than they actually do.\n\n2.

The Seller cannot force the Buyer to make a lump-sum payment of a balance they agreed would be paid in installments (ruling out option B). The Seller's claimed inability to reinstate auto deductions does not void the contract or release them from their duty to perform the deductions as scheduled, even if it means processing them manually (ruling out option D).

I'm relying on the paragraphs chronologically.

The consideration for P is the \u00a325 at once plus the promise of \u00a35 per year until \u00a350 is paid. The consideration for D is the bicycle. As P advertised that the price was negotiable it was reasonable for D to offer this deal, and P could chose to accept or not. Having accepted unconditionally P cannot undo the deal without D's consent. If D had been a company, consumer protection law might give P a period within which P had a right to cancel, but that would not apply between two private individuals.

The contract between P and D is valid, with clear consideration on both sides. P's consideration is the bicycle, while D's consideration is the \u00a325 upfront payment plus the promise of \u00a35 per year for five years, totaling \u00a350. \n\nA is incorrect because although P mentioned D's past work, this was not the basis of the contract.

Your will should establish a [testamentary trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testamentary_trust) for the child for which you will establish the terms (for example, the will can consider things like living and education expenses and when the trust will end and the child can access the money directly) and name the trustee(s) in the will (and how they get replaced if they die or refuse to continue as a trustee). \n\nThe trustee is legally obligated to manage the funds in accordance with whatever terms you wrote into the trust for the benefit of the child. This should be someone you trust to a) do the right thing and b) manage the money wisely. You should also make provision in the trust to pay the trustee for their services. Most governments have a public trustee who will do this stuff for a fee.\n\nYou will need both professional legal and accounting advice to do this properly.

You could probably easily seize the Dutch account with a Dutch judgment if it wasn't closed as soon as the Defendant got word of the suit and before judgment entered.\n\nIn any other country, you would have to look to their law regarding the recognition of foreign judgments and follow the requirements of that law to convert your judgment into a judgment in a place where the defendant has assets. Recognition of foreign judgments for rent or other monies owed is usually more easily obtained than recognition of judgments for torts (e.g. damages owed from a car accident). In some U.S. states, this could be very straight forward and not involve a full fledged new trial on the merits, in other U.S. states, particularly if the Dutch judgment was obtained by default, it might be necessary to retry the case from scratch in the U.S.\n\nI do not know what the process is in Australia, but I suspect that it is similar.\n\nThe trouble is, that even though you could get a valid judgment in the Netherland and enforce it against the assets there, it would probably not be cost effective to pursue collection in the U.S. or in Australia for that amount of money.

The father, by allowing his 10-year-old son to gamble, could be considered as promoting gambling involving an underage person. This falls under the definition of \"promotion of gambling\" in Arizona code section 13-3303, which is classified as a Class 5 felony. The law doesn't specify penalties for underage gamblers themselves, so the son likely wouldn't face charges.

The DMCA and copyright law give publishers significant control over the distribution of e-books. Unlike physical books, where the first-sale doctrine allows for resale and lending, e-books are subject to more restrictions. Publishers can determine who has the right to distribute their e-books and under what conditions.

While the Russian citizen technically shouldn't have to pay VAT, the store is unlikely to change their process for individual sales. The customer can't easily claim a refund, and demanding the store remove the charge is unlikely to be successful.

The child is identified as a victim and the police and child/youth services have the obligation to protect the child and to keep them from harm. This is the main goal of police and children/youth services \\- to keep the child safe and act in the best interest of the child.\n\nUsually, a complaint to a child abuse center can take time to process. When a police complaint comes in it is more immediate, with police having more 'influence' with CYS (child/youth services). Especially when the child is in deadly danger (they were just stabbed, after all), the police may arrest the mother or abusive sibling or intervene therein to remove the child from the parents care with CYS\\-equivalent services working to find suitable alternative living situations for the child as a result of a order of removal/protection authorized by a judge. (PA at least had emergency situation response plans for these situations where a judge is just a phone call away).\n\nAs well, the child will likely be made a ward of the state if the courts determine the mother cannot care for the child or is a threat as such (not caring enough to stop the brother may count), insomuch that the child may be removed from the dangerous situation and placed in the care of a willing relative or if none can be found will be placed in temporary foster care in a safer environment.\n\nNote that nothing happens rapidly without the initial complaint to the police. At age 16 the child is likely going to be taken more seriously (compared to a 12 year old, for example), and has the right to be allowed to reach out to hospital staff to ask to speak to a police officer \\- otherwise it takes a child abuse complaint from someone who knows the child and situation and that can sometimes take longer to process (though, the distance factor in the original question may make a complaint from overseas given a lower priority due to not knowing the person on a more personal in\\-person level)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old in Chicago, IL has been stabbed by her drug-using brother and her mother is neglectful.

A third person sees the t\\-shirt and thinks it would make the perfect costume for a photograph. Recognizing your copyright in the t\\-shirt, he asks if he can put a model in your t\\-shirt and take a picture. On the language of the license, your answer must be, \"no.\" You do not have the right to sublicense the Corel clipart to the photographer, so you cannot authorize the photograph. Technically, you will need to be careful about using it in your online t\\-shirt store for this same reason: if you provide a final (non\\-downloadable) image for use in the store, you are probably fine. But if the store permits images to be downloaded and permanently stored, that use is forbidden.\n\nThe final image to be printed on the t\\-shirt, the clipart image, your intended and possible future uses of the final design, and much more information about the particular online t\\-shirt store would all be helpful in giving you a more complete answer.

Doing so might be a breach of contract. Some jurisdictions flat out ban surrogacy contracts (Arizona, D.C), perhaps even penalizes (Michigan, NY), or declares void (Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska). In California, surrogacy contracts are legal and enforceable. One possible challenging scenario is that the mother refuses a requested abortion, the other is that one or both of the intended parents seek to block the mother from getting an abortion. The former case in the case of [Melissa Cook](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1487/44751/20180426163111738_Cook%20v.%20Harding%20et%20al.%20Petition%20-%20Refile.pdf), where there was an attempt made to reduce the number of pregnancies from three \u2013 Cook carried the fetuses to term despite a contrary request from the intended parents (no action was filed to attempt to force an abortion). There has apparently been no attempted case to force a mother to carry a fetus to terms because of a contract (i.e. order for specific enforcement).\n\nUnder present US law, the woman carrying the fetus has the exclusive right to choose to terminate a pregnancy. No statutes or case law suggest that a surrogacy contract will override that right, and some laws explicitly deny the ability to force a mother to have an abortion (Utah Code Ann. \u00a778B\\-15\\-808(2\\) \\& (3\\), Tex.

Under well-established US law, including in California where surrogacy contracts are legal and enforceable, the person carrying the fetus (in this case, the surrogate) retains the exclusive right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy. This right supersedes any contractual obligations. However, by choosing to have an abortion against the wishes of the intended parents as stipulated in the surrogacy contract, the surrogate may be sued for breach of contract and potentially face financial consequences. The surrogacy contract itself remains valid, but it cannot override the surrogate's constitutional right to choose. Options A and B are incorrect because no contract can legally remove the right to abortion or force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term.

The enforceability thus depends on the specific jurisdiction and applicable statutes. Option A is incorrect as these clauses are not automatically void everywhere.

The main legal reason is that in the US, a seizure (arrest) must be reasonable under existing interpretations of the 4th Amendment. A person has a constitutional right to his life and property, and police force potentially infringes that right. For example, stopping a jaywalker with a shotgun blast would be unreasonable force, and could open the government up to a section 1983 lawsuit (referring to [42 USC 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983)). So while the police are motivated to protect lives and property and to enforce the law, their use of force has to be reasonable.\n\nThere is no mechanical procedure for determining, in any arbitrary instance, where the line is between reasonable and unreasonable force. The courts have determined that it is whatever force a reasonable officer would use in the given circumstances. More force is justified if the reasonable officer believe that he or others are in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death, and lack of such a reasonable belief could lead to a protracted low\\-speed car chase to arrest a suspect. There are guidelines that help police make these decisions, see [this](https://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/Pages/continuum.aspx) for example, and department will have specific rules about use of force. \n\nThere is a tradeoff between spending more time waiting for a suspect to stop, and using force to stop a vehicle. One way to stop a fleeing vehicle is with a spike strip, but that will destroy property and is likely to cause injury, so you need a policy. [Here](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Files/Briefing-Room/News-Releases/Policy-and-Legislation/Vehicular-Pursuit/CORSA-Vehicular-Pursuit-Model-Policy.aspx) is a policy in Ohio, which begins by stating that\n\n> Due to the unique conditions within the community we serve the agency\n>  designee has determined that high speed pursuits are generally \n>  restricted to exigent circumstances, and when occurring are \n>  authorized and closely monitored by supervisors.\n\nSpike strips can be used in some circumstances, but not all.

The documentation emphasizes that police use of force must be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. There's a balance between protecting public safety and respecting the suspect's constitutional rights. The reasonableness of force depends on the specific circumstances, including the perceived threat level. Immediate forceful interventions (like crashing into the suspect's vehicle) could be seen as unreasonable in some situations, potentially exposing the police to legal liability.

They took his tax returns every dang year, until last year! \n\nWe know that DHS pulled out of the case and the judge was basically forced to give my fiance his daughter because as soon as that supervisor from DHS looked over the case he realized they should have given custody to my fiance YEARS AGO! \n\nWhile we will never be able to get back the time and raising his daughter who is now 16, we want the child support that the state took while they kept custody of his child when they shouldn't have. \n\nHow do we go about finding someone to help us?

Thank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You shouldn't try to bring suit against the state or DHS.\n\nDHS and the state and any other plausible defendants all have sovereign immunity from all liability for the kinds of conduct that you describe. Their actions were expressly approved by judges which gives them complete immunity from liability. You would not prevail. There is nothing you can do about that. You need to move on and get past it.\n\nNothing described constitutes a violation of someone's constitutional rights that can be remedied in a civil action.\n\nAlso, there is no way that he would ever get the child support back. Whether he liked it or not, the state paid money over that ten year period to support his daughter, and he had a legal duty as a father to provide some of that economic support. Child support cannot be changed retroactively, even if the custody decision was wrong.\n\nIf his child was physically harmed (or, for example, raped) over that ten years, the child may have a cause of action for that harm which could be brought by the child when the child becomes an adult, or by a guardian appointed for the child. \n\nBut, no facts above suggest that this has happened, proving that the harm was caused by the wrongful actions of a responsible person (like a foster parent) rather than, for example, a fellow child in foster care, showing damages, and overcoming the qualified immunity of the persons who allegedly caused the harm, is pretty much an insurmountable barrier as well."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the situation described, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential legal recourse for the father?\n\nA) The father can sue DHS for wrongful custody and recover all child support payments made during the 10-year period.\n\nB) The father can file a lawsuit against the state for violating his constitutional rights and seek compensation for lost time with his daughter.\n\nC) The father has no viable legal options to recover child support or seek damages due to sovereign immunity and judicial approval of DHS actions.\n\nD) The father can petition the court to retroactively modify the child support order and receive a refund for payments made while his daughter was in state custody.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because the documentation clearly states that DHS and the state have sovereign immunity from liability for their actions in this case. Additionally, their actions were approved by judges, giving them complete immunity. The child support payments cannot be recovered retroactively, even if the custody decision was wrong, as the state provided support for the child during that time. The father has no viable legal options to recover money or seek damages in this situation. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they suggest legal actions that would not be successful given the circumstances described in the documentation."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67794/is-a-company-allowed-to-break-their-own-terms-of-service-tos", "docs_id": 67794, "title": "Is a company allowed to break their own Terms of Service (TOS)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have spotted multiple counts of a gamecompany breaking their own TOS for their own or \"associates/friends\" gains, including real world trading (selling items for money) while stated in their TOS it's not allowed, allowing the use and game assets from a dozen games that were directly copied and having them featured in their game or promoted on their social media and more counts.

However, if it says *you* won\u2019t do X, it doesn\u2019t restrict what they can do at all.\n\nSo, for example, if a game includes tradables and the ToS prohibit users from selling them for real world consideration, then users are prohibited. The company isn\u2019t and can sell as many as they want.\n\nFurther, there is nothing stopping them from having one contract with general users and another contract with different terms with premium users and a third contract with even more different terms with the founder\u2019s brother\\-in\\-law Jim. Or, they can tell Jim that they won\u2019t take action if he ignores this part of the contract.\n\nThis is called *discrimination* and, unless there is a law against it (which there is for protected classes like race, gender etc.) it\u2019s perfectly legal. \u201cBeing married to my sister\u201d is not a protected class so I can discriminate in favour (or against) people who are."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: GameCo's Terms of Service (ToS) prohibit users from selling in-game items for real money. However, GameCo itself has been observed selling items directly to certain users. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) GameCo is in breach of its own ToS and can be held legally accountable for this violation.\n\nB) GameCo's actions are illegal because they constitute unfair discrimination against regular users.\n\nC) GameCo can legally sell items despite the ToS prohibition because the restriction only applies to users, not the company itself.\n\nD) GameCo's actions are legal only if they have a separate contract with the users to whom they are selling items.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. A company's Terms of Service typically restrict what users can do, not what the company itself can do. In this case, GameCo prohibiting users from selling items doesn't prevent GameCo from selling items themselves. The company can engage in practices that are prohibited for users without breaching the ToS.\n\nOption A is incorrect because GameCo isn't bound by the restrictions it places on users in the ToS.\n\nOption B is incorrect because this type of discrimination (treating different users differently) is generally legal unless it's based on protected characteristics like race or gender.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while GameCo could have separate contracts with different users, it's not necessary for their actions to be legal.

This could potentially lead to deportation, even if extradition is not possible due to lack of treaties between Iran and Canada.

That nets out to adding $75 to your taxable income, *same outcome*, **except the $25 is in peril, due to the complexities of the tax law.** For instance:\n\n* Charity deductions give no tax benefit at all until you achieve $12,000 of itemized deductions (from donations and mortgage interest, certain state taxes, certain medical expenses etc.) Deem that unfair *(we at charities certainly do!)* but the fact is, it's because you *already* get a $12,000 standard deduction as a 'gimme'.\\*\n* If you're a huge donor (I am *on certain years*, thanks DAF), you can only deduct 50% of income (with carryforwards, yay).

This answer reflects the separation of powers and the distinct roles of the legislative, executive (law enforcement), and judicial branches in the legal process.\n\nOption A is incorrect because law enforcement does not have the authority to determine if an action is illegal (that's the legislature's role) or to convict individuals (that's the court's role).\n\nOption C is incorrect because courts do not define illegal actions; they interpret and apply the laws passed by the legislature.\n\nOption D is incorrect because public opinion and media coverage do not have legal authority to determine illegality or guilt."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59375/presidential-martial-law-authority", "docs_id": 59375, "title": "Presidential Martial Law Authority", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fired\\-attorney\\-sidney\\-powell\\-back\\-advising\\-trump\\-chart/story?id\\=74823842\\&cid\\=clicksource\\_4380645\\_2\\_heads\\_hero\\_live\\_hero\\_hed](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fired-attorney-sidney-powell-back-advising-trump-chart/story?id=74823842&cid=clicksource_4380645_2_heads_hero_live_hero_hed)\n\n> Trump and Powell met in the Oval Office Friday night, ABC News has\n> confirmed, and were joined by Trump's former national security\n> adviser, retired Lt.

POTUS, Congress and state governors can do it, to some extent. Art. 1, \u00a79 (speaking of powers denied to Congress) says that \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it\". Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus is one fundamental element of \"martial law\". Art. 2 \u00a72 (presidential powers) grants relatively little power to POTUS, but does say \"The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States\", so as commander in chief, POTUS can command the army, but in general requires authorization from Congress.\n\nAt the outset of the Civil War, Lincoln declared a numbered of things which Congress ratified, but this did not include a declaration of martial law. In [Ex parte Merryman](https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F.Cas/0017.f.cas/0017.f.cas.0144.3.html), 17 F. Cas. 144, the Taney (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States) stated that \"the president, under the constitution of the United States, cannot suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, nor authorize a military officer to do it\". Congress eventually retroactively legalized the suspension of habeas corpus. Without Congressional approval of the suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus, a \"declaration of martial law\" would be meaningless and toothless.\n\nThe [Posse Comitatus Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act) further limits the ability of the army to meddle in domestic affair, and [18 USC 1385](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1385) states that\n\n> Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized\n> by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the\n> Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the\n> laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two\n> years, or both.\n\nOne of authorizations by Congess is [The Enforcement Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Acts), which empowered federal intervention when states refused to protect the constitutional rights of citizens, and this was invoked more recently during the Eisenhower administration and in connection with the Mississippi Burning murders. Another much older authorization is the [Insurrection Act of 1807](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act_of_1807), now at [10 USC Ch. 13](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-I/chapter-13) allows use of the military (\u00a7252\\):\n\n> Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions,\n> combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of\n> the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the\n> United States in any State by the ordinary course of judicial\n> proceedings, he may call into Federal service such of the militia of\n> any State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary\n> to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\n\nThe next section [\u00a7253](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/253) would, no doubt, be the statutory provision invoked for use of the military:\n\n> The President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or\n> by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary\n> to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful\n> combination, or conspiracy, if it\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) so hinders the execution of the laws of that State, and of the\n> United States within the State, that any part or class of its people\n> is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in\n> the Constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities\n> of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right,\n> privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United\n> States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\n> \n> \n> In any situation covered by clause (1\\), the State shall be considered\n> to have denied the equal protection of the laws secured by the\n> Constitution.\n\nThe rhetoric that would need to be associated with such an executive order (sending in the troops) would resemble that in Texas v. Pennsylvania et al, which did not turn out well for POTUS. Moreover, nothing at all authorizes POTUS to declare elections void and to order new elections (therefore, the military cannot be employed to engage in such an illegal action)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the President's authority to declare martial law and order new elections in the United States?\n\nA) The President can unilaterally declare martial law and order new elections in any state without Congressional approval or specific legal justification.\n\nB) The President can declare martial law by invoking the Insurrection Act, but cannot order new elections without Congressional authorization.\n\nC) The President has no authority to declare martial law or order new elections under any circumstances, as these powers belong exclusively to Congress.\n\nD) The President can only declare martial law with explicit Congressional approval, and has no authority to order new elections in any situation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The President's power to declare martial law is limited and subject to specific conditions. While the President cannot unilaterally declare martial law without justification, they can invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 (now codified in 10 USC Ch. 13) to use military forces in certain domestic situations. This act allows the President to deploy the military to suppress insurrections, domestic violence, or situations where the execution of laws is hindered.\n\nHowever, the President does not have the authority to order new elections in battleground states or anywhere else. The power to regulate elections is primarily vested in the states and Congress, not the executive branch. There is no provision in U.S. law that allows the President to void existing election results and mandate new elections.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the President cannot act unilaterally without any legal justification. Option C is too extreme, as the President does have some authority under specific laws like the Insurrection Act. Option D is partially correct about elections but overstates the limitations on declaring martial law, as Congressional approval is not always explicitly required if acting under existing statutory authority."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49148/is-the-uuid-considered-personal-data", "docs_id": 49148, "title": "Is the UUID considered personal data?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am planning to build a mobile platform which I would use the UUID as the username, and a password of user\u2019s choice.

Even just being able to check whether one person has a registered account raises the issue.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the EU GDPR (or in the UK, the UK GDPR as defined in sections [3(1\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/section/3) and [205(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/section/205) of the Data Protection Act 2018\\) are (emphasis added):\n\n> Article 4(2\\): **'processing\u2019 means** any operation or set of\n> operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal\n> data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection,\n> recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or\n> alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, **disclosure by transmission,\n> dissemination or otherwise making available**, alignment or combination,\n> restriction, erasure or destruction\n\nSo, disclosure of the fact that a user has a registered account amounts to \"processing\".\n\n> Article 6(1\\): **Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that\n> at least one of the following applies:**  \n> \n> (a) the data subject has given **consent** to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;  \n> \n> (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a **contract** to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;  \n> \n> (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a **legal obligation** to which the controller is subject;   \n> \n> (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the **vital interests** of the data subject or of another natural person;  \n> \n> (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the **public interest** or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;  \n> \n> (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the **legitimate interests** pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\nOf these, only (a) and (f) are likely to be of any relevance:\n\n* (a) is not too useful since it isn't feasible to design a sign\\-up system that depends on the user's consent (which they may not give).\n* That leaves us with (f). As noted by the [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/legitimate-interests/), \"*Legitimate interests is the most flexible lawful basis for processing, but you cannot assume it will always be the most appropriate. It is likely to be most appropriate where you use people\u2019s data in ways they would reasonably expect and which have a minimal privacy impact, or where there is a compelling justification for the processing.*\".\n\nThe legitimate interest here would be that you need a sign up system which prevents duplicate registrations. Remember though that the processing has to be \"*necessary*\" for the purposes of the legitimate interest. One might argue that it is not since you could design the system to give the appearance of accepting the duplicate registration followed by sending an email to the account holder to inform them. On the other hand this will result in a less user friendly experience which could itself be a legitimate interest.\n\nUltimately this is a balancing exercise and it is hard to say whether you have struck the right balance until someone complains to the ICO or the court and a decision is issued. The fact that the practice is widespread among well\\-resourced and large companies would tend to indicate that it is lawful albeit this is not conclusive in the absence of a court decision. I'm not aware of any cases involving this particular issue but would be interested to hear from others on this point.\n\nIf the processing is unlawful then Article 18 is applicable:\n\n> 1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies: \\[...]\n> (b) the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the\n> erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use\n> instead\n> 2. Where processing has been restricted under paragraph 1, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed\n> with the data subject\u2019s consent or for the establishment, exercise or\n> defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another\n> natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of\n> the Union or of a Member State.\n\nIn other words, the data subject could ask you not to disclose their registration status via the sign up page, and you would be obliged to comply with the request.\n\nSeparately from the above points, in order to be lawful you must provide the data subject with certain prescribed information *at the time* when the data is collected. Of particular relevance here are the following items:\n\n> Article 13(1\\): Where personal data relating to a data subject are\n> collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time\n> when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of\n> the following information: \\[...] (c) the purposes of the processing\n> for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis\n> for the processing; (d) where the processing is based on point (f) of\n> Article 6(1\\), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by\n> a third party;\n\nSo even if you conclude that the processing will be lawful you will have to give some consideration to the basis so that you can comply with the above provision."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company is designing a user registration system for their website.

The FDA approval statement does not absolutely prohibit the use of the device in the mentioned patient groups. Instead, it serves as a warning that safety and effectiveness have not been firmly established for these specific populations. \n\nAccording to the documentation, it is permitted to use a device where its effectiveness or safety hasn't been proven for a particular usage.

As the documentation suggests, schools typically have their own rules and policies regarding absences and extenuating circumstances. The nature of the court appearance (e.g., as a juror, witness, or defendant) may affect how the school views the absence. Additionally, there may be an appeals process in place for such situations. While some might argue that the school should automatically excuse such an absence, there's no universal law requiring this.

It states \"Read, read, read\" and lists legislation, textbooks/lecture slides, and legal cases as the main items to read. The answer also acknowledges the fact mentioned in the documentation that \"you cannot learn every aspect of law. There is simply too much.\" This reflects the comprehensive yet realistic approach described in the source material. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while law courses involve reading, they are not described as the primary method. Option B is partially correct but doesn't acknowledge the impossibility of learning all aspects of law.

What is the general framework for laws around food exchange like this in the United States (California, specifically)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [This summary](http://www.urbanaglaw.org/food-ag-and-health/) from UrbanAgLaw.org (formerly run by the Sustainable Economies Law Center, but no longer updated) gives a summary of the US federal laws:\n\n> Traditionally, the FDA has been concerned primarily with fruits \\& vegetables that travel in interstate commerce (i.e., fruits and vegetables that are sold and/or transported across state lines); however, FDA authority has been greatly expanded through the Bioterrorism Act of 2002 and the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) of 2011\\. ...\n> \n> \n> The good news is that these new requirements do not apply to most urban farming operations. And the FSMA provides exemptions from most of its requirements to farms with: (1\\) less than $500,000 in annual gross sales; and (2\\) more than half of the product sold to \u201cqualified end users,\u201d defined as consumers and restaurants or retailers (not including wholesalers or distributors) either in\\-state or within 275 miles of the farm or facility. ...\n> \n> \n> The FDA also shares some of the health and safety regulation of fruits and vegetables with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA is authorized (under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act) to set tolerance levels for pesticides on and in foods. While regulatory testing of the pesticide levels on unprocessed fruits and vegetables is unlikely, it is a good practice (for obvious reasons) to limit pesticide use as much as possible, and to limit pesticide residues by thoroughly washing produce.\n\nState and local regulations may also apply; the guide recommends that you contact local health department officials and/or your state university's agricultural extension program (if one exists) to find more specific information:\n\n> While state food codes are primarily focused on health and safety surrounding retail sales of food products, other state food and agriculture laws may focus more on health and safety matters surrounding production, shipping, handling, storage, and processing of food products. These activities may be addressed in state food codes, health codes, agriculture codes, etc., and permits and licenses may be required for these activities. Furthermore, state and local regulatory officials often make judgment calls in deciding whether these licensing and/or permit requirements apply to a particular operation. Therefore, whatever your urban farming activity, it is important that you seek guidance from your state and local agriculture and health department (e.g., visit the website, write to a local health department official) to see what licensing and permit requirements apply."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A group of neighbors in California decide to start a community produce exchange program. Which of the following scenarios would likely trigger federal regulations under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA)?\n\nA) The neighbors exchange homegrown vegetables among themselves without using any form of currency.\nB) The exchange program expands to include 50 households, all within the same neighborhood.\nC) The group introduces a token system to facilitate trades, but no real money is involved.\nD) The exchange program grows to sell $600,000 worth of produce annually to local restaurants and consumers within a 100-mile radius.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) This scenario involves simple neighbor-to-neighbor exchanges without currency, which is unlikely to trigger federal regulations.\n\nB) While the group has expanded, it's still operating on a local scale without monetary transactions, so it's unlikely to fall under federal oversight.\n\nC) The introduction of a token system adds complexity, but as long as real money isn't involved and the scale remains local, it's probably not subject to federal regulations.\n\nD) This scenario would likely trigger FSMA regulations because:\n1. The annual gross sales exceed $500,000, which is above the exemption threshold mentioned in the FSMA.\n2. While the sales are to local restaurants and consumers (which qualify as \"qualified end users\"), the scale of the operation suggests it has moved beyond a simple neighborhood exchange.\n\nThe FSMA provides exemptions for farms with less than $500,000 in annual gross sales and more than half of the product sold to qualified end users.
