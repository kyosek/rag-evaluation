With permission of all copyright holders, the license can be modified. However, it does require the permission of all copyright holders. You would have to see the license terms distributed with jQuery 1\\.2\\.1 to see what license(s) that particular version is under.\n\nHowever, the GPL doesn't impact you in this case, since the library is dual licensed.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the use of jQuery 1.2.1 in this commercial project?\n\nA) The developer must update to a newer, MIT-only version of jQuery to avoid their entire project becoming subject to GPL.\nB) The change in licensing for newer versions automatically removes the GPL option for all previous versions of jQuery.\nC) The developer can choose to use jQuery 1.2.1 under the MIT license, disregarding the GPL option.\nD) The developer must comply with both MIT and GPL licenses when using jQuery 1.2.1.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When software is dual-licensed, as jQuery 1.2.1 was under MIT and GPL, the user can choose which license to comply with. In this case, the developer can opt to use jQuery 1.2.1 under the terms of the MIT license, which is generally more permissive and easier to comply with for commercial projects. The change in licensing for newer versions of jQuery does not retroactively affect the licensing options for older versions.

As stated in the documentation, a person's house is where \"privacy expectations are most heightened,\" and it is generally the most difficult place to obtain a warrant to search. In contrast, vehicles (option A) are treated differently by courts due to their mobility and the pervasive regulation of vehicles on public highways. For vehicles, officers only need probable cause to conduct a search without a warrant.

The Miranda warning does not constitute a contractual promise between the arresting officer and the arrestee, so \"will\" cannot be construed as a binding promise to prosecute and use the evidence in court. \"Will\" can only be construed as a prediction, as do \"may\" and \"might\". If the warning said \"can, and mightmay be used against you\", that choice or wording would suggest that the probability of statements being used against you is low \u2013 that would be totally misleading. The strongest modal should be used, because the probability is high that some statement will indeed be used against the person.

It is pretty likely that you can get away with it. The first thing to understand is that the act of transcribing is the creation of a derivative work (see the [definitions part of Title 17](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101)). The core protection is [section 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106), which states that the owner of copyright has the exclusive right to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work. So it is not permitted to prepare derivative works, e.g. transcriptions, without permission from the copyright owner. There is a big however: [section 107](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107) provides a possible loophole, \"fair use\". If you were to be sued for violation of copyright in making an unauthorized derivative work, your attorney might well advise you to set forth a fair use defense.

Many cite it but hardly anyone has seen it. Can I expect trouble if I make an electronic copy available on my blog?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Factual assumptions\n-------------------\n\nohwilleke's answer is entirely correct. However, it makes factual assumptions based on the standard meaning of \"journal\" and \"author\", which I believe to be unwarranted. From the question, it seems likely that we are talking about a *scientific paper*, which operates under a [very different economic and legal model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal).\n\nI am going to assume that:\n\n* the authors sent a draft of the paper, the *preprint*, to the journal editor;\n* the journal editor sent the draft to external experts (the *reviewers*); those reviewers, and possibly the editor, gave some feedback;\n* the authors modified their draft based on that feedback to produce the final version;\n* throughout all this, the authors, editor and reviewers agreed with the journal\u2019s policies;\n* the journal policies require a transfer of copyright to the *publisher*, a legal entity that \"owns\" large number of journals and provides some technical services (article typesetting, maintenance of a web site with the journal contents, maintenance of DOIs, etc.);\n* neither the authors, nor the editor, nor the reviewers received monetary compensation for their work (this is a key economic difference from non\\-academic journals, but as we shall see, it has little legal effect)\n\nIn theory, all depends on the copyright release agreement\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen the author(s) submit a draft to a journal, they have to click through an agreement to release copyright. Such a clause could, in theory, be anything the authors and the publisher agreed that does not violate contract law. In practice, because the publishers are a small oligopoly, the agreements are more or less standardized.\n\nThe \"sample publishing agreement\" given as example at <https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright> (as downloaded on March 2, 2023\\) is more or less representative:\n\n> I hereby assign to the Copyright Owner the copyright in the manuscript identified above (where Crown Copyright is asserted, authors agree to grant\n> an exclusive publishing and distribution license) and any tables, illustrations or other material submitted for publication as part of the manuscript (the\n> \u201cArticle\u201d). This assignment of rights means that I have granted to the Copyright Owner the exclusive right to publish and reproduce the Article, or any\n> part of the Article, in print, electronic and all other media (whether now known or later developed), in any form, in all languages, throughout the world,\n> for the full term of copyright, and the right to license others to do the same, effective when the Article is accepted for publication. This includes the\n> right to enforce the rights granted hereunder against third parties.\n\nThe authors are the sole intellectual contributors to the preprint version, but a copyright release agreement could still bar them from publishing it. The vast majority of agreements between novel authors and publishing houses forbid the author from selling the book rights to another publisher or posting drafts of the novel on the author\u2019s website (two actions that would result in greatly diminished sales for the publisher).\n\nThe published version incorporate revisions where the reviewers and possibly the editor contributed significant intellectual contributions. Again, all depends on the copyright agreement \\- the publisher terms could in theory require that the reviewers and editors release their contribution under an irrevocable license to the authors. In practice, all goes to the publisher.\n\nThe financial structure is irrelevant\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe fact that authors (and reviewers, and editors) are not paid by the publisher is irrelevant. Yes, a contract (in [common\\-law](/questions/tagged/common-law \"show questions tagged 'common-law'\") countries) requires consideration from both sides; however, consideration needs not be monetary.\n\nThere is not much doubt that publication of an article is \"consideration\", at the very least because that is considered prestigious among a significant fraction of the population. In addition, there is ample evidence that funding agencies and university HR staff evaluate and promote scientists based primarily on the papers they publish in scientific journals.\n\nIn practice, preprint rules are lax\n-----------------------------------\n\n[The vast majority of academic publishers allow authors to publish the preprint version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_publishers_by_preprint_policy) although conditions vary (only the preprint, only on a personal website, only for a limited time, only after some embargo period, only if you cite the final article with the correct DOI, etc.).\n\nI would speculate that this is the result of cultural pressure. Many academics decided to post their articles (sometimes the preprint before sumbission, sometimes the published version) on the internet without much regard to pesky questions of copyright law, because they viewed publishers as gatekeeping greedy monopolistic parasites. The publishers decided to embrace the practice in order to be able to put some limits on it, rather than try to mass\\-fire lawsuits against the people who provided them with free labor.\n\nRegardless of whether that speculation is correct, the current arrangement is not the inevitable result of legal rules, and publishers could conceivably decide to change their preprint sharing policies at any moment.\n\nLimitations to the copyright of research papers\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis section is quite obviously not exhaustive, but given that the original question does not specify a jurisdiction, I\u202fdid not search beyond what I already know.\n\nIn the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\"), works produced by employees of the federal government as part of their work duties are generally public domain ([17 U.S. Code \u00a7 105](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105); do note that subsection (b) means certain works produced by certain institutions still are under copyright). Hence, if the authors were both researchers at a federal research institution, the preprint is public domain and can be republished irrespective of the publisher\u2019s will. (I am led to believe, however, that most US researchers are *not* employees of the federal governments, but rather of private or state universities.)\n\nIn [europe](/questions/tagged/europe \"show questions tagged 'europe'\"), as a result of public pressure against publishers (see \"greedy monopolistic parasites\", above), the European Commission published non\\-binding guidelines ([2012/417/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012H0417)) asking that\n\n> there should be open access to publications resulting from publicly funded research as soon as possible, preferably immediately and in any case no later than 6 months after the date of publication, and 12 months for social sciences and humanities\n\nThat (non\\-binding) recommendation has been adopted with varying adaptations in various EU countries. The exact implementation in a given country should be checked before relying on it. For instance, in France, [article L533\\-4 du code de la Recherche](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000033205794/2016-10-09) allows authors (after the six or twelve months embargo period) to post the published version (not just the preprint), irrespective of what what signed with the publisher, as long as at least half of the funding for the research came from public funds.\n\nI will assume neither of those apply.\n\nThe copyright owner is likely still around\n------------------------------------------\n\nAcademic journals are born and die regularly. However, academic *publishers* rarely do (Elsevier is almost 150 years old).\n\nAs ohwilleke says, the copyright release contract signed 40\u202fyears ago is likely still valid; even if the publisher folded, it would apply to the publisher\u2019s legal successor. (The question of how legal rights are liquidated in a bankruptcy would be an interesting question that I am not competent to answer; it is plausible that under certain circumstances the contract would be dissolved.)\n\nIf the authors can access the copyright release they signed back when they submitted the article, you might be able to determine that posting the preprint or the final article is acceptable. (I realize that this is a fairly ludicrous hypothetical, given that the paper was published 40\u202fyears ago.)\n\nOtherwise, it is extremely likely that the publisher would be able to sue, even if the publication occurs with the authors\u2019 full support. Whether they are likely to do so, and whether publishing anyway is ethical, are of course non\\-legal questions.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A researcher wants to make an electronic copy of a seminal scientific paper published 40 years ago in a now-defunct journal available on their blog.

But standing to seek remedies for copyright infringement would belong to the copyright owner, i.e. usually the author of the copyright or a transferee of the copyright (in this case the friend), and not to the homeowner, if the homeowner is someone different than the copyright holder of the art.\n\nAmong other things, the friend who is the person who made the art could validly file a takedown notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act with the Social Media company in question.\n\nThere are common law privacy torts (i.e. grounds for private lawsuits) for public disclose of private facts. But normally, this would not extend to the appearance of someone's bedroom unless there were an express non\\-disclosure agreement, or a relationship (e.g. confessional priest, attorney, psychotherapist, treating physician) to which a duty of confidentiality arises by operation of law. The common law right would normally extend only to embarrassing private facts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Sarah takes a photo of herself in her friend Alex's bedroom without Alex's knowledge or consent. The photo inadvertently captures some of Alex's original artwork hanging on the wall. Sarah posts the photo on a popular social media platform based in California. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) Alex can file a lawsuit against Sarah for invasion of privacy, as the bedroom is considered a private space.\n\nB) The social media platform is legally obligated to remove the photo if Alex requests it, citing personal privacy concerns.\n\nC) Alex can submit a DMCA takedown notice to the social media platform based on copyright infringement of the artwork.\n\nD) Sarah has committed a criminal offense by taking a photo in someone else's private space without consent.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, original artwork has copyright protection by operation of law. As the creator of the artwork captured in the photo, Alex (the friend) owns the copyright to that art. Therefore, Alex has the standing to file a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice with the social media platform, citing copyright infringement of the artwork depicted in the photo.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there are privacy torts for public disclosure of private facts, they typically don't extend to the mere appearance of someone's bedroom unless there's an express non-disclosure agreement or a special relationship that implies confidentiality.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the social media platform is not legally obligated to remove the photo based solely on personal privacy concerns. The platform's actions would be guided by their terms of service and applicable laws, primarily copyright in this case.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while some jurisdictions may have laws against secretly taking photographs without permission, this isn't universally considered a criminal offense, especially when the photo is of oneself in someone else's space.\n\nThis question tests understanding of copyright law, privacy rights, and the limitations of both in the context of social media and personal spaces."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/57749/blocking-certain-countries", "docs_id": 57749, "title": "Blocking certain countries", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Due to some laws one wants to block certain countries from accessing his app which he uploaded on play console.One turns off those countries in GOOGLE play console so it cannot be downloaded in those country.\nSomeone pirates it and aquires it.\nIn EULA one clearly specifies the blocked countries and reasons for ban .

The answer states that businesses don't have the option to choose which laws they comply with.

They state that there's no information obligation where the data subject already posesses the information, but don't account for the case that the information has been lost.\n\nTherefore: the GDPR does not provide an explicit right to receive information per Art 13 \\& 14 a second time.\n\nHowever, I'd see a 40% chance that were such an issue presented to the CJEU, the court would find an extended obligation for the data controller to provide this information again on request, as long as the relevant processing is still ongoing and.

The availability of counsel for the indigent in cases involving petty crimes varies, but not in a way systemically related to the common law v. civil law distinction. It has more to do with the available supply of lawyers.\n\nThe lawyer's job isn't very different, despite the fact that the lawyer has an audience of a panel of judges rather than a judge presiding over a decision making jury, although obviously lots of fine details (e.g. concerning the procedures for presenting evidence) are different.\n\nIn both cases, defense lawyers call the attention to the facts favorable to the defendant's case, offer up evidence that tends to exonerate the defendant if the lawyer can obtain it, argues to the court regarding how the evidence should be interpreted and what inferences should be drawn from it, and argues regarding any ambiguities in how the law should be applied to these particular facts.\n\nFurthermore, in most criminal cases, in both civil law countries and in common law countries, guilt or innocence is not the primary issue. The primary issue for criminal defense counsel in most cases is assisting the judges in determining the right sentencing option on the right charges for a defendant who pleads guilty or is found guilty at trial of some crime, based upon the character of the crime and offender that is presented to the court by the lawyer. This part of the process is very similar indeed in the two systems.\n\nTypical issues might include an assault case where the issue is whether there was serious bodily injury, justifying a more serious sentence, or mere ordinary bodily injury, justifying only a less serious sentence, in a case where it isn't clear cut at the guilt and innocence phase, or arguing whether probation and a fine, or incarceration is a better fit to a minor offense, in the sentencing phase. It isn't entirely or primarily about \"legal loopholes\" in any system, although \"legal loopholes\" tend to be more important in U.S. criminal law than in many legal systems.\n\nThere are some places in which civil law courts are more open to consider a defendant's arguments than others (and many civil law countries decide serious criminal cases with a panel that is a mix of legally trained judges and lay jurors), but that can vary wildly from country to country and within a country as well.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In criminal cases, what is typically the primary focus for defense lawyers in both civil law and common law jurisdictions?\n\nA) Finding legal loopholes to get their clients acquitted\nB) Arguing about the interpretation of evidence and how the law should be applied\nC) Assisting in determining appropriate sentencing and charges for guilty defendants\nD) Confusing the jury or judges to create reasonable doubt\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, in most criminal cases in both civil law and common law systems, the primary issue for criminal defense counsel is not typically about guilt or innocence. Instead, it focuses on \"assisting the judges in determining the right sentencing option on the right charges for a defendant who pleads guilty or is found guilty at trial of some crime, based upon the character of the crime and offender that is presented to the court by the lawyer.\" This aligns with option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while legal loopholes may be used, they are not the primary focus, especially in civil law systems.

He owns a firearm and wants to bring it with him. Based on Santa Clara County Ordinances, under what circumstances, if any, can John legally bring his firearm to the campsite?\n\nA) John can bring his loaded firearm and keep it with him at the campsite, as long as he is over 18 and not prohibited from possessing firearms.\n\nB) John can bring his firearm, but it must be unloaded and stored in a locked container inside his vehicle at all times while on county property.\n\nC) John can bring his firearm and keep it at his campsite, but it must remain unloaded at all times.\n\nD) John cannot bring his firearm to Sanborn Park under any circumstances, as firearms are completely prohibited on all Santa Clara County property.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Santa Clara County Ordinances, firearms are generally prohibited on county property, including parks. However, there is an exception stated in section B19-11 (n) that allows a person to possess an unloaded firearm in a locked container or trunk of a motor vehicle while on county property. Therefore, John can bring his firearm to Sanborn Park, but it must remain unloaded and locked in his vehicle at all times. Option A is incorrect because loaded firearms are not allowed. Option C is incorrect because keeping the firearm at the campsite, even if unloaded, is not permitted. Option D is too restrictive, as there is a legal way to bring a firearm onto county property under specific conditions."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8720/is-fraudulent-activity-related-to-renting-a-residence-theft-by-deception", "docs_id": 8720, "title": "Is fraudulent activity related to renting a residence - Theft by Deception?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I discovered Wednesday that a recent tenant of 1\\.5 months misrepresented themselves, and lied and omitted information on the rental application to hide the truth and gain entry into my apartment.\n\nThe facts are:\n\n* She knowingly lied in person and omitted on the application her\nrental history.

With tenant landlord laws as they are, the landlord is deprived of their property and ability to rent the property simply by virtue of the fact that someone now has access.

However, \"(2\\)'Self\\-defence' means any defensive action which is necessary to avert a present unlawful attack on oneself or another\" \u2013 removing a trespasser is not necessary to avert an unlawful attack. This does not apply to removing an annoying person. Under \u00a7223, physically assaulting a person is a punishable offense. Pushing a person is one form of assault (so is punching them or pummeling them, perhaps a more severe form depending on the physical damage done).\n\nHowever, the response is also criminal because it goes past that which is necessary to avert the assault (a push is not a license to commit mayhem). Under \u00a7\u00a733\\-35 there are defenses for excessive self\\-defense (\"Whoever exceeds the limits of self\\-defence due to confusion, fear or fright incurs no penalty\"), which don't seem applicable in this situation (rage is not the same as fright).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Germany, a person pushes their roommate out of their room after the roommate refuses to leave.

The roommate's retaliation, while provoked, exceeds the limits of necessary self-defense and is also unlawful. The excessive self-defense clause (StGB \u00a7\u00a733-35) likely doesn't apply here, as it's meant for situations involving confusion, fear, or fright, not anger or retaliation.

Looking through state laws regarding how custody works, I can find no mention of dealing with minors, so my question is if minors do have rights to children they had, to begin with.\n\nThe primary law I'm looking at to try and help is NH RSA 461\\-A:6, some pertinent text from the law is as follows:\n\n> I. In determining parental rights and responsibilities, the court shall be guided by the best interests of the child, and shall consider the following factors:\n>  (a) The relationship of the child with each parent and the ability of each parent to provide the child with nurture, love, affection, and guidance.\n>  (b) The ability of each parent to assure that the child receives adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and a safe environment.\n>  (c) The child's developmental needs and the ability of each parent to meet them, both in the present and in the future.\n>  (d) The quality of the child's adjustment to the child's school and community and the potential effect of any change.\n>  (e) The ability and disposition of each parent to foster a positive relationship and frequent and continuing physical, written, and telephonic contact with the other parent, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.\n>  (f) The support of each parent for the child's contact with the other parent as shown by allowing and promoting such contact, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.\n>  (g) The support of each parent for the child's relationship with the other parent, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.\n>  (h) The relationship of the child with any other person who may significantly affect the child.\n>  (i) The ability of the parents to communicate, cooperate with each other, and make joint decisions concerning the children, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.\n>  (j) Any evidence of abuse, as defined in RSA 173\\-B:1, I or RSA 169\\-C:3, II, and the impact of the abuse on the child and on the relationship between the child and the abusing parent.\n>  (k) If a parent is incarcerated, the reason for and the length of the incarceration, and any unique issues that arise as a result of incarceration.\n>  (l) The policy of the state regarding the determination of parental rights and responsibilities described in RSA 461\\-A:2\\.\n>  (m) Any other additional factors the court deems relevant.\n\nI have been unable to find in this law or others how the situation is dealt with if one of the parents is a minor, but my friend mentioned that they had been court ordered for mediation, so I would assume they at least treat a minor somewhat like a non\\-minor in this circumstance. Any further information would be much appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The applicable state law is [here](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/xliii/461-a/461-a-mrg.htm). Section 461\\-A:2 guides the interpretation of the chapter:\n\n> I.

This chapter shall be construed so as to promote the policy stated\n>  in this section.\n\nThe law gets no more specific than to refer to the fact of being a parent. The law does not favor males over females, or vice versa, and the law does not discriminate between a parent who is a minor versus a parent who is a legal adult. The rights of parents are equal, *ab initio*. However, the recognition of the rights of a father does depend on the legal establishment of paternity whereas the law takes maternity to be self\\-evident. This may have been dealt with at birth, or may require a [legal process](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/2015/title-liii/chapter-522/section-522-1) if paternity is contested. If that part is sorted out, then disagreements about custody etc. which can't be worked out through agreement possibly with a mediator can be resolved in court. The court will determine what constitutes the \"best interests of the child\".\n\nThat is all there is to it, legally. That does not mean that a judge making a decision is absolutely immune from thinking that the minor father is less able take care of the child.

The court is guided by the best interests of the child, considering factors outlined in NH RSA 461-A:6. These factors apply equally to all parents, regardless of age.

A fashion retailer included the FB like button on the web page. The court found that the retailer was not a controller of subsequent processing by Facebook (here, Facebook is its own controller). However, the two parties are joint controllers for collecting and transmitting the personal data on the page.\\[1] While the ruling was made under the previous Data Protection Directive, it is entirely transferable to the GDPR. In your scenario the on\\-page processing is even more substantial.\n\n\\[1]: Which means that the website needs a legal basis for sharing data with the embed provider.

This is supported by the ECJ C-40/17 \"Facebook Like-Button\" case, which established that website owners and third-party service providers can be joint controllers for collecting and transmitting personal data.\n\nThe hotel determines the purposes (making reservations) and means (using the third-party system) of data processing, making them a controller. The third-party provider also plays a role in determining the means of processing by designing and operating the system.\n\nAs joint controllers, both parties share responsibility for GDPR compliance. This includes providing a comprehensive privacy policy, obtaining necessary consents, and ensuring the security of personal data. The hotel cannot simply defer all responsibility to the third-party provider.\n\nThe lack of a privacy policy and the provider's reluctance to supply one is a significant red flag.

But it seems to me like it would be a hard argument to make. It's only realistic if you have been visiting a psychologist who has been treating you for depression over the bullying, and/or if you have the bullying in writing or on record (the latter part is doubtful since in CA it's illegal to record people without consent).

(yours doesn't sound like this, but who knows)\n* They want to help people who are suffering from gross injustice due to poverty. (your situation sounds unjust, but not that bad)\n\nSo you are not likely to find a lawyer interested in doing this without pay.

Your running software as a whole clearly includes other's components, so you have no right to dedicate the copyright to the running software as a whole into the public domain. In contrast, you're the copyright holder for all the code that you wrote yourself, and can therefore dedicate its copyright into the public domain.\n\nYou mention that your software relies on other components, but I don't think they would be a problem here.\n\n* You are referencing Express, but you are arguably not creating a derived work from Express. If it is not a derived work, then the Express license is irrelevant. It would clearly be a derived work if you were to modify the Express software, or if you incorporate snippets of the Express code into your software. However, this can be argued differently as well, that by using the Express APIs in your code you are copying copyrightable aspects.\n* If the MIT license of Express would matter, it wouldn't be a problem since the MIT license does not impose any restrictions other than keeping the copyright and license notice of the original intact. The MIT license does not enforce that the components written by you use any particular license, or that they shall be covered by copyright at all.\n* The Typescript compiler is not part of your software. Your software is just data to the Typescript compiler. It is common to compile public\\-domain software with copyright\\-covered compilers, for example when compiling the public\\-domain SQLite database with the GPL\\-licensed GCC compiler.\n* If Apache license of the Typescript compiler were to apply, it would have generally similar consequences as the MIT license, though Apache\\-2\\.0 has more complex notice requirements.\n\nA note on NPM licenses: the metadata is not always fully correct. More importantly, the license metadata only relates to a particular package, not to the entire dependency tree. You must comply with the licenses of all your dependencies, even if they are just indirect dependencies. Similarly, if you were to upload your public domain code to NPM, this wouldn't imply that your Express dependency would now be public domain as well.\n\nIn summary, you probably can dedicate your own code into the public domain, if your jurisdiction recognizes this act.

You can't have committed fraud because you didn't have the *intent* of entering the museum without paying.\n\nFraud is defined in section 263 StGB:\n\n> (1\\) Whoever, **with the intention of obtaining an unlawful pecuniary benefit** for themselves or a third party, damages the assets of another **by causing or maintaining an error under false pretences or distorting or suppressing true facts** \\[\u2026]\n\nYou had no intention of obtaining an unlawful benefit.

The visitor genuinely presented their EU Disability Card, believing it might be accepted as proof of disability. They did not misrepresent their disability status or intend to enter without paying. The cashier's decision to waive the fee was made independently, and the museum has the right to waive fees at their discretion. Therefore, the visitor has not committed any crime in this situation.

(Mothers were allowed to pass on citizenship after 2009, but that was after Begum was born.) Note that registration at a Bangladeshi consulate within 1 year of birth is only necessary in the case where the father is a Bangladeshi citizen by descent. I believe Begum's father was a Bangladeshi citizen otherwise by descent, in which case no registration or other action is necessary for her to be a Bangladeshi citizen at birth. It doesn't matter that she has never been to Bangladesh nor does it matter that she never claimed to be a Bangladeshi citizen.\n\nThere were two men of Bangladeshi descent in a separate case who successfully fought their revocation of British citizenship, but the difference between their cases and Begum's case was that they were over 21, which she was under 21 at the time of revocation. Section 14 of Bangladeshi's Citizenship Act provides that someone with dual citizenship automatically loses Bangladeshi citizenship if they don't renounce their other citizenship, but this provision doesn't apply to those under 21\\. So these two men had Bangladeshi citizenship too, while they were under 21, but they lost it when they turned 21, before their supposed revocation of British citizenship, whereas for Begum, she hadn't lost Bangladeshi citizenship at the time of the revocation of her British citizenship, because she hadn't turned 21\\.\n\n(Perhaps you got the idea of \"claiming\" of citizenship from some report that one can \"claim\" Bangladeshi citizenship by descent while under 21, and these men failed to claim it, but Begum can still \"claim\" it. But if you read the text of the law, that is clearly not the case. For a child born to a father who was a Bangladeshi citizen otherwise than by descent, there is no \"claim\" of citizenship \\-\\- it is automatic and involuntary at birth.)\n\nAs to your question, there are no universal restrictions to how a country can grant or take away citizenship. There is the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, which countries may voluntarily join, but only a minority of countries of the world are party to the convention. Article 8 of the [Convention](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/6_1_1961.pdf) does prohibit countries that are party to the Convention from depriving someone's citizenship if it would \"render him stateless\", though there are several exceptions including if the citizenship was obtained through fraud or misrepresentation. The language seems to require that the person already have another citizenship, not just have the ability to acquire one, though I am not sure how much leeway countries have to interpret this.\n\nIn the case of the UK, it is a party to the Convention, and it has largely implemented the provisions of the Convention in its domestic law. With respect to deprivation of citizenship, [section 40](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/section/40) subsection (4\\) of the British Nationality Act 1981 prohibits a deprivation order if the Secretary \"is satisfied that the order would make a person stateless.\" (Subsection (4A) has a looser restriction where British citizens by naturalization can be deprived of citizenship if the Secretary believes that the person is able to become the national of another country. I am not sure whether this is compatible with the Convention. In any case, this is not relevant to Begum's case as she was not a British citizen by naturalization.) So if the UK were to try to deprive citizenship of a British citizen otherwise than by naturalization like Begum, not on the basis that the person already has another citizenship but on the basis that they are \"eligible\" to \"claim\" one (which as I described above I do not believe is the case for Begum; I am talking hypothetically if such a case were to arise), that can already be challenged as a violation of British law, in British courts, without considering the UK's obligations under the Convention.\n\nIf it's another country that's a party to the Convention, but their law expressly allows deprivation of citizenship for being \"eligible\" to acquire another citizenship even though the person doesn't have one (including, perhaps, British citizens by naturalization deprived citizenship under section 40(4A)), and a person in that situation is deprived of citizenship, they don't really have any recourse. A private party cannot \"sue\" a country over any violations of the Convention in an international court.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding a country's ability to revoke citizenship if it would render a person stateless?\n\nA) Countries can freely revoke citizenship even if it renders a person stateless, as long as the person is eligible for citizenship in another country.\n\nB) The Convention absolutely prohibits any revocation of citizenship that would render a person stateless, with no exceptions.\n\nC) Countries that are party to the Convention are generally prohibited from revoking citizenship if it would render a person stateless, but there are some exceptions, such as if the citizenship was obtained through fraud.\n\nD) The Convention allows countries to revoke citizenship if the person can claim citizenship by descent in another country, even if they don't currently hold that citizenship.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness generally prohibits countries that are party to the Convention from depriving someone of citizenship if it would render them stateless. However, the Convention does provide some exceptions to this rule, including cases where citizenship was obtained through fraud or misrepresentation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Convention does not allow revocation merely based on eligibility for another citizenship. Option B is too absolute, as the Convention does allow some exceptions. Option D is not supported by the Convention, which seems to require that the person already have another citizenship, not just the ability to acquire one."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55853/can-a-prisoner-choose-not-to-be-autopsied-after-execution-or-is-it-a-legal-requi", "docs_id": 55853, "title": "Can a prisoner choose not to be autopsied after execution or is it a legal requirement?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a writer so I've been trying to do some research for one of my MCs who ends up getting executed but has the ability to come back from the dead, preferably with a body intact so an Autopsy isn't something they'd desire after the execution and would try to deny that procedure from happening in the first place.\n\nSome background information that might be necessary: My MC is executed in Tennesse by Lethal injection, in late 2019 under the Federal government (the mc was a former government spy) for the conviction of 4 homicides of other agents, treason and espionage.\n\nNow, I have been trying to read and research prior to posting here but it's not all clear as there's a lot of contradictive answers online.

The Tennessee law ([38\\-7\\-106](https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/oscme/tca-postmortem-examination-act.html)) says that\n\n> A county medical examiner may perform or order an autopsy on the body\n> of any person in a case involving a homicide, suspected homicide, a\n> suicide, a violent, unnatural or suspicious death, an unexpected\n> apparent natural death in an adult, sudden unexpected infant and child\n> deaths, deaths believed to represent a threat to public health or\n> safety, and executed prisoners.

[Louisiana law](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2014/code-revisedstatutes/title-13/rs-13-5713/) is a little unclear at the statutory level, because\n\n> The coroner shall either view the body or make an investigation into\n> the cause and manner of death in all cases involving the following...\n> (2\\) Sudden or violent deaths...(9\\) Deaths due to drowning, hanging,\n> burns, electrocution, gunshot wounds, stabs or cutting, lightning,\n> starvation, radiation, exposure, alcoholism, addiction, tetanus,\n> strangulation, suffocation, or smothering...

Option B is incorrect because Tennessee law does not require autopsies for all executed prisoners, but rather gives discretion to the medical examiner.

Is it too overboard?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can't comment on what the legal situation would be in your home country, but as a matter of U.S. law, the hypothetical scenario you've described is not illegal.\n\nFirst, because you aren't a U.S. citizen and because you aren't operating in the United States, the U.S. government probably has no jurisdiction over you, your website, or your conduct.\n\nEven if it did, the most relevant statute, [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1017](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1017), would not apply. The statute prohibits the \"fraudulent or wrongful\" use of the FBI's seal. But \"fraudulent\" and \"wrongful\" generally refer only to conduct where one uses deception or other means to obtain money, property, etc. to which they have no lawful entitlement. [*United States v. Enmons*, 410 U.S. 396, 399 (1973\\)](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-enmons).\n\nBecause you aren't using the seal to obtain anyone's property through deception, this use would not fall within the statute's proscriptions.\n\nEven if the government sought to prosecute you, you would have a valid First Amendment defense. The First Amendment protects the right to free speech, and it does not allow statements to be criminalized merely because they are false. [*United States v. Alvarez*, 132 S. Ct. 2537 (2012\\)](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-alvarez).\n\nThis outcome should be unsurprising to most U.S. observers. I think most people would agree that the U.S. obviously cannot prosecute a Hollywood producer for making a movie dramatizing the FBI's efforts to shut down the Pirate Bay, even if it displayed the FBI's seizure message on a monitor in the course of the movie, and even if it showed the seal being used on a completely fictional website.\n\nThe hypothetical you're describing is not materially different. In both cases, the seal is being used to falsely create the impression \\-\\- for entertainment purposes \\-\\- that the FBI has shut down a website.

The scenario described is likely legal under U.S. law for several reasons:\n\n1. Jurisdiction: The U.S. government probably has no jurisdiction over a non-U.S. citizen operating a website outside the United States.\n\n2. Lack of fraudulent intent: The relevant U.S. statute (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1017) prohibits \"fraudulent or wrongful\" use of the FBI seal, which typically refers to deceptive practices for financial gain. An April Fools' joke does not meet this criterion.\n\n3. First Amendment protection: Even if prosecuted, there would be a valid First Amendment defense.

Were juries used in Old Testament, Greek, Roman, or Inquisition trials?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The modern jury trial in common law countries (i.e. those with legal systems based upon those of English law) derives from [12th century English practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juries_in_England_and_Wales) as it evolved over time in England, and is frozen in time to some extent in U.S. practice, by the nature of the jury trial as an institution at the time that it became a constitutional right in the United States in 1789\\. The English jury system emerged in the 12th century in the wake of the Norman conquest of 1066 CE, and codified Norman customary law, particularly among its soldiers in courts\\-martial and had some resemblance to modern courts\\-martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for the United States military such as the notion that you could be judge's only by your peers in rank or your superiors, although it subsequently evolved in English civil practice.\n\n(England also developed in parallel non\\-jury courts of equity as a division of the tax collection department in England, a set of courts that were merged with courts of law in most places in the U.S. in the 19th century, the remains a distinctive source of U.S. jurisprudence in matters which are decided solely by judges. This short summary also ignores features like the coroners' juries and grand juries of English derived practice.)\n\nThe civil jury is now almost extinct in England itself, and in most common law countries other than the U.S., except for a handful of kinds of cases (e.g. defamation, civil fraud, false imprisonment, and eminent domain cases), and in serious criminal cases. Other cases in England are now handled in the first instance by a single judge at the trial court level in most cases. Outside the common law countries, first instance trials in serious cases are usually conducted by a panel of three or five judges, with a lead judge presiding over the conduct of the matter.\n\nMost jury\\-like systems outside of common law countries are limited to serious criminal matters, and often involve a hybrid of judges and specially selected citizens with exceptional (\"blue ribbon\") qualifications who deliberate together with the judges. These systems were mostly adopted after World War II in imitation of U.S. and English practice, but some as early as the 15th century in Europe.\n\nThe Continental European practices described in an answer by @Geremia, and likewise Greek direct democracy based trial and Sumerian trials come from a tradition that was abandoned no later than the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe as civil codes on the model of the French and German civil codes were adopted, and often much earlier. These practices are not ancestral to the current practice of jury trials in modern legal systems.\n\nJuries were not described as a means of adjudication in the Bible. \n\nIn the ancient democratic Greek city\\-states, some city\\-states had direct democracy of landed males citizens and those citizens met collectively in town meeting style to address both legislative and judicial matters. The governance practice of Caribbean pirates, or some isolated bands and tribes, of small early New England Puritan communities, and of small revolutionary military units, have some similarities to this kind of practice, all of which were small communities organized on a principle of direct democracy and which arose more or less independently of each other.\n\nMostly, in the Roman Empire, judges or regulated private arbitrators resolved the matters that were vested in civil and criminal juries today in places that still have them. Some serious matters [at times in Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial#Rome) were decided by quasi\\-juries in a Greek town meeting like format with hundreds of jurors in a stadium or amphitheater. But this was never a routine means by which justice was metted out.\n\nInquisitorial trials were a subset of canon law, and canon law is generally carried out by deputized clergy, in a process that was more written than oral, and in that involved active investigation by the judges rather than passive consideration of adversary presented evidence (giving rise to the modern inquisitorial judicial systems common in Continental Europe, Latin America, and much of Asia (where Maoist or Islamic legal systems are not primarily influences).\n\nIn Medieval Times, the predominant practice was for decisions to be made by the ranking local feudal lord, or his delegate, and the role of the delegate of a feudal lord is directly ancestral to that of the common law legal system's judges, which is one of the reasons that common law judges have powers such as contempt of court, and immunities from liability not available to judges elsewhere.\n\nSelect institutions in the Holy Roman Empire and what is now Germany in the 15th to 19th centuries appear to have been devised in imitation of the English jury system.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the historical development and current status of jury trials?\n\nA) Jury trials originated in ancient Greece and Rome, were adopted by England in the 12th century, and are now widely used in most countries globally.\n\nB) The modern jury system evolved from 12th century English practice, is still extensively used in the U.S., but has been largely abandoned in most other common law countries except for specific case types.\n\nC) Jury trials were a common feature in Biblical times, Roman law, and Inquisition courts, forming the basis for the current common law jury system.\n\nD) Continental European countries developed jury systems independently in the 15th century, which were later adopted and modified by England in the 18th century.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most accurate statement based on the provided information.

A license is permission to make copies, and under copyright law, you can only make copies with permission of the rights holder. You cannot use software on a computer without making a number of copies (most of which are made semi\\-automatically by the computer).\n\nIf you own a copy of the software, you are allowed to do anything with that copy (not make other copies, but otherwise, whatever you want). This is the so\\-called first sale doctrine. However, it is very rare (perhaps nonexistent) that anybody \"buys a copy of the software\", in fact it is not at all clear what that would mean. When you buy a disk that installs software, you are buying two things: (1\\) a physical disk, and (2\\) a license to use the program in a specified way. Without the license, you only have a disk which can be used as an expensive coaster.\n\nFound disks are not an escape hatch that circumvents copyright protection. Suppose you buy a copy of Word, then installed it; then toss the original disk. Someone finds the disk, installs it, and tosses the disk. Ad infinitum: 1 legal and paid copy multiplies into thousands of free copies.\n\nIf you have an installation disk for e.g. MS Word which does not have a license (look for the license file), and somehow (somehow) suppressed the code that shows you the \"you must agree\" box, then you have an illegal copy of Word. If you have software that is supposed to be distributed under some do\\-anything license (e.g. CC\\-0\\) and there is no actual license on the disk (or similar means of distributing a license along with the software), they you don't know what you have. If you can locate the author, they may say \"I put the license file on my web page, I guess the other guy didn't include the file, but as you can see, everybody has permission to use it, and you don't even have to include the license\". In other words, there *is* permission, you just didn't know it. The same author might have even thought \"If I put the software out there for all to download and don't restrict access, then I've licensed it\". Or, the original author licensed the software as long as it is used non\\-commercially. \n\nThe problem is that the honest user cannot distinguish between pirated software and sloppily\\-distributed software, where the original author or the re\\-distributor has failed to include explicit permission to use.

What 'consideration' is being referred by **consideration**?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> A\u2019s promise is only good consideration for B\u2019s because the law regards **it** as enforceable and therefore of value, and **it** is only regarded as enforceable because **it** is supported by consideration.\n\nIn each of the three bolded cases \"it\" means \"A's promise\". It is A's promise that is enforceable. A's promise is enforceable because that promise is supported by consideration.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a bilateral contract where A promises to pay for grain in August that B promises to supply, which of the following statements most accurately describes the nature of consideration in this agreement?\n\nA) A's promise is consideration for B's promise, but B's promise is not consideration for A's promise.\n\nB) The physical exchange of grain and money in August constitutes the consideration for this contract.\n\nC) A's promise is only valuable consideration because it is enforceable, and it is enforceable because it is supported by B's promise, which is itself only valuable because it is supported by A's promise.\n\nD) The consideration in this contract is the mutual detriment suffered by both parties in making their respective promises.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the circular logic in bilateral contracts. Option A is incorrect because in a bilateral contract, both promises serve as consideration for each other. Option B is wrong because consideration exists at the time of contract formation, not performance. Option D, while touching on the concept of detriment, doesn't capture the circular nature of enforceability and value in these promises. Option C correctly describes the paradoxical nature of consideration in bilateral contracts, where each promise's value and enforceability is dependent on the other, creating a logical loop that is nevertheless accepted in contract law."}}
