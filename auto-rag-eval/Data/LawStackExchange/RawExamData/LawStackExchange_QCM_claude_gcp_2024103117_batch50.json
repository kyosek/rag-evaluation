We can make some observations.\n\nFirst, the Unlicense is applied to software that's basically free for anyone to do anything with. It's basically making the software available, not warranting it for any particular purpose. If you sell software, it's presumably for a purpose, so there will likely be some sort of legal warranty or liability that can't be disclaimed in the license. This depends on where you are, which you don't tell us.\n\nSecond, if you're planning to make money, consulting a lawyer is a worthwhile investment.

The documentation emphasizes that for a commercial project, especially one based in Europe, using a simple open-source license like the Unlicense (option A) would not be appropriate as it's designed for freely distributed software. While copyright laws do offer some protection by default (partially addressing B and D), they don't cover all aspects of commercial software distribution and liability. The documentation specifically recommends consulting a lawyer for commercial projects, stating it as a worthwhile investment to create a license that properly protects the developer's interests while addressing potential legal warranties and liabilities that may apply in their jurisdiction.

Would I for example have to include the storage service as a sub\\-processor in my published list of sub\\-processors?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since you are able to encrypt the data, the data is clearly personal data for you. That means you will have to comply with the GDPR regarding how you process and store this data. This involves disclosing recipients of this data per Art 13(1\\)(e), and only engaging data processors in line with Art 28\\.\n\nYour storage provider such as Azure and AWS cannot decrypt this data, so it would not be personal data if processed by them for their own purposes. There is an argument that they did not receive personal data, especially considering the definition of a recipient in Art 4: a person/entity \u201cto which the personal data are disclosed\u201d.\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily relevant when talking about sub\\-processors. A processor is anyone who \u201cprocesses personal data on behalf of the controller\u201d. As processors, they're not using the data for their own purposes but are just acting on your behalf. Storage is a kind processing, and they are storing data on your behalf. This data is personal data for you. Thus, I'd consider the storage providers to be your processors.\n\nDue to your use of strong client\\-side encryption, your remaining compliance obligations are mostly boilerplate (signing a data processing agreement per Art 28, sorting out international transfers if necessary, and getting agreement for adding a sub\\-processor from your controllers). Note that encryption is mandatory whenever appropriate (Art 32(1\\)(a)).\n\nSuch client\\-side encryption could even serve as a legal basis for storing the data in jurisdictions that don't offer an adequate level of data protection, such as a data center in the US.

This means that if the composer/arranger died before 1919, then the works passed into the public domain before the formal publication in 1989, and they are still in the public domain now. However, if the creator died after 1919, then their 1989 publication effectively \"resets the clock\" on the copyright, and they will not come into the public domain until (according to the above link) 70 years after the death of the creator or 2048, whichever comes later.\n\nWhat doesn't matter is that the original symphonic works were in the public domain.

In your case, if the work really is a straight transcription, it *might* not have a copyright; but if the work required some amount of creativity and artistic decision\\-making (which a piano transcription of a symphony certainly would) then the arrangement gets its own copyright when it's published.\n\n### Can I make transcriptions of them if I don't publish them?\n\nProbably, but you should really consult your librarians.

If the composer died before 1919, the works would have entered the public domain before their 1989 publication, and would remain so.\n\nOption A is incorrect because arrangements of public domain works can have their own copyright protection if they involve creativity.\n\nOption B is false because academic use alone doesn't guarantee freedom from copyright restrictions, especially for publishing.\n\nOption D is problematic because while fair use might apply to the researcher's study, it's not guaranteed and seeking guidance (e.g., from academic librarians) is advisable.\n\nThis question tests understanding of copyright duration, public domain status, and fair use concepts in a complex scenario involving both published and unpublished works."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/93780/getting-an-ein-number-for-a-trust-and-section-645", "docs_id": 93780, "title": "Getting an EIN number for a Trust and Section 645", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A person dies with a revocable trust that becomes irrevocable after the person's death.

However, I plan on continuing to develop them on my own time as I work at a company. They are software related.\n\nFirst, the first two highlighted parts seem to contradict each other. The first says whether or not during working hours, the second says it's fine if it's on my own time. Wondering if this is a problem for the contract. Also wondering how valid those statements actually are.\n\nSecond, they like most other companies want me to list my prior inventions. But I've asked this before to a lawyer and they said I can't simply list a title of a project such as \"Photoshop\\-like image editor\", I have to actually go into detail and describe it. And not just a few sentences, but paragraphs of detail. Not so much detail as to be like a patent in its thoroughness, but more detail than a few paragraphs PER INVENTION. But this is a security leak as I don't want to disclose my inventions even if they are simple, it's a matter of privacy. So the question is what I can do or what the reality is of the situation.\n\nAnd last thing is, let's say this company, a software company, is in the field of Sales and Marketing. This means they have a robust application or suite of applications, practices, and tools like CRMs, machine learning stuff, APIs, etc. They also use lots of open source programming tools. Meanwhile, let's say my inventions are in the field of Programming Tools and Application tools. It's not *directly* related to Sales and Marketing, but it's related pretty closely to CRMs and machine learning tools, and APIs. It's not related to their specific APIs, but it's related to APIs let's say. The question is how the line is drawn on what is considered competitive inventions. If I were to invent a new machine learning algorithm while working as a marketer or sales person at a software company, if that is considered competitive and prohibited by the contract.\n\nOh, and \"not useful with or related to any Company Interest\" is very vague. The company could be interested in literally anything these days.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> the first two highlighted parts seem to contradict each other.\n\nNo, in this case they do not. The first highlighted portion refers to works or items produced \"*for or under the direction of the Company*\", whereas the second highlight refers to your creations that satisfy conditions (a) and (b).\n\nWhere contradictions actually exist, the doctrine of [*contra proferentem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem) entitles you (the non\\-draftsman of the contract) to adopt the portion or reasonable interpretation that favors your legal position.\n\n> Also wondering how valid those statements actually are\n\nThey are valid and become enforceable as soon as you sign the contract or your subsequent conduct reflects your acceptance thereof.\n\n> it's a matter of privacy. So the question is what I can do or what the reality is of the situation\n\nThe reality is that you are asked to sign a contract that is abusive and ridiculous. \n\nOne vulnerability from describing your inventions (presumably in Appendix A) is that the employer gets \"irrevocable, worldwide, etc\" rights on them as soon as you \"*use or disclose any \\[items listed in Appendix A] when acting within the scope of \\[your] employment*\". This means that if instead of reinventing the wheel you share or apply any portion of your prior creations so as to enhance your productivity, you *knowingly* and *irreversibly* grant to the employer perpetual rights to those items.\n\nLegal disputes regarding APIs can become extremely intricate. And, since judges usually have no decent background on IT, even those few judges with integrity are unlikely to grasp the key subtleties that would lead to a correct ruling.\n\n> \"not useful with or related to any Company Interest\" is very vague. The company could be interested in literally anything these days.\n\nClauses which are too vague or excessively wide\\-encompassing are *supposedly* stricken as unconscionable, unenforceable, etc. However, I personally would foreclose upfront the risk of judicial hassle and decline the abusive contract.\n\nLegal issues aside, keep in mind that you are *offering* your *expertise* (in terms of supply \\& demand, you are on the *supply* side).

As with many other laws it would take a court ruling to definitively spell out how international agreements are applicable to a given situation.

The only somewhat relevant case is [Busby v. State](https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=16410084149983965777&q=\"Convention+on+Road+Traffic\"&hl=en&as_sdt=ffffffffffffe04) in which the court rules that one cannot drive in Alaska with an IDP after having been previously restricted from driving in Alaska. The court does stress out that:\n\n> **The Convention does forbid a signatory country (or subsidiary state) from imposing or enforcing license revocations in a manner that discriminates against residents of other signatory countries.** But Busby does not claim that he was the victim of such discrimination. Busby's license was revoked for conduct that would have led to license revocation if committed by an Alaska resident. (Indeed, Busby's license was revoked while he was an Alaska resident.) And Busby does not claim that he was singled out for prosecution because he was a resident of a foreign country\u2014i.e., that the State would not have charged him with the offense of driving with a revoked license if he had still been an Alaska resident.\n\nThis could possibly mean that the court believes that the Convention only applies to foreign residents, but its not spelled out specifically.\n* Searching for Canadian court cases [likewise doesn't turn up anything useful](https://www.canlii.org/en/#search/type=decision&text=%22convention%20on%20road%20traffic%22).

Here the court rules similar to the decision in Alaska in that having a foreign license does not allow one to circumvent locally imposed license restrictions.\n* Searching for UK case law [doesn't turn up any relevant court cases](http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/lucy_search_1.cgi?sort=rank&method=boolean&highlight=1&datehigh=&mask_path=/eu/cases%20/ew/cases%20/ie/cases%20/nie/cases%20/scot/cases%20/uk/cases&datelow=&query=(%22Convention%20on%20Road%20Traffic%22)).\n* Australian case law is [likewise mute on the subject](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?mask_path=&method=auto&query=%22convention+on+road+traffic%22).\n\nThere is also a relevant legal opinion by the Department of State quoted in the [Digest of United States practice in International Law, 2002](https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/139638.pdf):\n\n> Reading these provisions as a whole, we believe that the State\n>  of Georgia, consistent with the CRT, \n> \n> \n> (1\\) must permit an alien to\n>  drive in Georgia using a foreign driver\u2019s license issued by a country\n>  party to the CRT only if the alien has been lawfully admitted to\n>  the United States; \n> \n> \n> (2\\) **must permit a lawfully admitted alien to drive\n>  in Georgia using a foreign driver\u2019s license of a CRT party only\n>  during the first year after the alien\u2019s admission**; and \n> \n> \n> (3\\) may, in\n>  accordance with Georgia\u2019s residency laws, require an alien resident\n>  in Georgia to obtain a Georgia driver\u2019s license as a condition for\n>  continued authorization to drive. By the same token, nothing in\n>  the CRT would prevent the State of Georgia from applying more\n>  liberal rules with respect to the driving privileges of aliens.\n\nIn [Automated Vehicles Are Probably Legal in the United States, 2014](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2303904) the author further analyses how the 1949 Geneva Convention is applicable within the United States. First, to settle the definition of \"international traffic\":\n\n> Nonetheless, the United States ultimately accepted that \u201cthe purpose\n>  of chapter II was to establish, in effect, an international code of minimum\n>  safety requirements. By indirection, the rules of the road set\n>  forth in the convention **would apply to the pattern of domestic as well\n>  as to international traffic**.\n\nThe author the meaning behind Article I of the Convention:\n\n> Article 1 states in part that no party \u201cshall be required to extend the benefit of the provisions of this Convention to any motor vehicle or trailer, or to any driver\n>  having remained within its territory for a continuous period exceeding\n>  one year.\u201d \n> \n> \n> This provision, on its face, indicates that the parties recognized\n>  that the treaty would benefit individuals. In no way does this\n>  recognition compel a conclusion that the Convention is self\\-executing,\n>  but **it does suggest that the treaty is of a type that the Senate might\n>  have understood to be directly enforceable.**\n\nAnd finally on the issue of whether or not the treaty is \"self\\-executing\":\n\n> For these reasons, it is likely that courts will continue to treat the Geneva Convention as self\\-executing. Nonetheless, a court might conclude\n>  that, with respect to section II\u2019s rules of the road, the governmental obligation is merely to \u201ctake appropriate measures\u201d\n>  and that such an obligation is too vague to be enforced judicially.\n\n---\n\nSo it seems absolutely clear that the Convention intended for participating countries to allow foreign drivers to drive abroad for up to one year. However international treaties [are not self\\-executing by default in Canada](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/treaty-making-power/), unlike the US:\n\n> Canada is bound by the terms of treaties that it enters into and breach thereof may give rise to international claims. However, in Canada treaties are not self\\-executing; they do not constitute part of the law of the land merely by virtue of their conclusion.\n\nSo even though British Columbia is violating the 1949 Geneva Convention one cannot directly rely on said international agreement to enforce their rights.

The Convention indeed intends for participating countries to allow foreign drivers to drive for up to one year.\n\n2. However, the enforceability of the Convention varies by country.

Therefore, as of now, the law is valid unless and until it is challenged and overturned.\n\n> **2\\. What defenses could a government make if challenged?**\n\nIt depends on what grounds the law is challenged.\n\nYour question about *possible defenses* is highly dependent on the nature of any challenge \u2014 which you have not specified in your question. The U.S. Constitution, for example, prohibits laws respecting a number of things such as freedom of the press, speech, religion, peaceful assembly, bearing arms, etc. to list just a few of the most notable ones.\n\nBut your question does not assert the law in question violates any specific or particular prohibition against it. Although the question mentions \"*restricting free movement as well as targeting only a specific demographic*,\" it does not specify any part of any constitution that prohibits these things. Therefore, your question is unclear as to what might present a constitutional problem for the law. \n\nIt is also unclear which constitution you think might contain prohibitive language. Is it a federal constitutional issue that concerns you? Or is it a state constitutional matter? In either case, which issue specifically concerns you? Your question needs to address these specifics in order to analyze it and respond in a meaningful way.\n\nLook at it like this... just as it is impossible to prove a negative, so is it impossible for anyone to conclude with absolute certainty that any law is ***not unconstitutional*** because no one can predict with certainty every possible future challenge a law might face. There are just too many possibilities to (pre\\-emptively) exhaust them all with certainty. Also, no one can predict with certainty how any future court might rule on the future challenges (*which themselves* are unpredictable as previously argued). Therefore, one can only say I think the law ***is unconstitutional*** and here are my reasons. Then others can analyze the law and the reasons; then offer an opinion.\n\n> **Further, based on precedent, would they likely be successful?**\n\nSee above answer to question numbered 2\\.\n\n### Laws aren't required to be \"justified\" by the constitution.\n\n***Constitutional justification*** for a law is a meaningless phrase. There is no requirement for a law to be \"justified\" by any constitution other than that the legislature is empowered by the constitution to make laws. That's all the justification any law needs.

In most U.S. states there is a two part test. One part is determined based upon the face of the document, the other is based upon extrinsic evidence.\n\n**Formal Requirements**\n\nTo be formally valid without a hearing unless an interested party requests one in most U.S. states on its face (i.e. to be a \"self\\-proving will\") a will must:\n\n* Be in writing.\n* Be signed by the person making the will who is at least eighteen years of age.\n* Be signed by at least two witnesses who do not have conflicts of interest, who are attesting that the person making the will was competent and that they saw him or her sign it.\n* The signatures of the witnesses must be notarized. If their statements are not notarized, usually at least one witness must testify in a hearing or with a later affidavit.\n* The language of the will must indicate an intent to make a binding disposition of property in the estate of the person making it when they die, and other rights related to their estate and their death.\n\nVarious exceptions to these requirements exist in most state (e.g. a \"holographic will\" is valid if it is in writing, indicates the necessary intent, is signed, and has its material provision substantially in the hand writing of the person writing it).\n\nSome states allow oral wills called \"nuncupative wills\" in very specific circumstances usually limited to soldiers or sailors in circumstances of actual battle or imminent mayhem likely to result in death, with the proper witnesses.\n\nA will is like a dollar bill, a copy is not as good as the original document. If the original document cannot be found it is presumed that the will was revoked by physical destruction of the will, in the absence of evidence to the contrary submitted at a hearing to a judge.\n\n**Extrinsic Requirements**\n\nAny interested party can contest a will that appears valid on its face under the standards describe above on several grounds.\n\nTwo of these relate to the condition of the person signing the will at the time it was signed. The notarized witness statements create a presumption that these two conditions were met. But, that presumption can be overcome with other evidence from witnesses and/or documents or other kinds of evidence. These conditions are:\n\n* The document was procured from the person making it with duress or undue influence, even if the person making it did have \"testamentary capacity.\"\n* The person making it lacked testamentary capacity which is also a two part test. The first part is that the person making it knows who their family and the \"natural objects of their bounty are\", knows in general terms what they own, and knows what a will is intended to do and is capable of understanding the general outlines of what it does. This basically rules out people with severe dementia. The second part is that if the person is not suffering from dementia but is suffering from hallucinations, that the hallucinations have not influenced the nature of the provisions contained in the will.\n\nIn practice, \"[undue influence](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_aging/publications/bifocal/vol_35/issue_3_feb2014/defining_undue_influence/)\" is the predominant ground for contesting wills that are formally valid on their face because testamentary capacity is a very low standard.\n\nA will can also be contested on the grounds involving extrinsic evidence that:\n\n* A later validly executed document revoked the will, or\n* The document is a forgery.\n\nIf any of the issues related to extrinsic evidence are disputed, both the party contesting the will, and the party defending it, has a right to have that issue resolved in a jury trial, although often the right to a jury trial in a case like this is waived by the parties.\n\nThis is determined by making a reasonable inquiry before submitting the will and examining the physical document and the place where it was when it was discovered, closely. The inquiry should be very searching if the terms of the will are surprising, and can be fairly lax if the terms of the will are what was widely expected.\n\nThere is generally a notice given to all interested parties when a will is submitted to a court with probate jurisdiction to be given effect that contains a deadline to raise a contest along these lines. A will that is not submitted to a court with probate jurisdiction usually has no force or effect until that happen in most U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nPublic Policy\n=============\n\nEven if the will is valid in general, some terms of the will may be invalid as a matter of public policy, or modified by statue, in certain circumstances. These exceptions can usually be determined on the face of the document or with minimal additional information (although \"your mileage may vary\" and cases where, for example, the cause of death or date of death is uncertain can be difficult).\n\nFor example, the following limitations are common:\n\n* A term in a will conditioning a gift at death on marrying or not marrying a particular person is void in most, if not all, U.S. states.\n* Under certain circumstances a will is required to leave certain minimum amounts to a surviving spouse and/or minor dependent children.\n* If a will appears to omit a child of the person making it by accident, it is modified in particular ways mandated by statute.\n* Will provisions making gifts at death or giving responsibilities to someone who murdered the person who wrote the will are void.\n* Some states invalidate provisions in favor of an ex\\-spouse upon divorce, unless a post\\-divorce document reaffirms those inheritances.\n* Certain kinds of words are given defined statutory meanings unless the express language of a will says otherwise, such as \"by representation\", or \"if he survives me\", that are not necessarily intuitive or in line with every day use of language.\n\nIt is usually necessary to review the probate court and case law in the state where the decedent was domiciled at death to determine if these limitations apply, ideally with a probate or estate administration lawyer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: John, a 75-year-old widower with dementia, signs a will leaving his entire estate to his caregiver, Sarah.

Then your friend must report it. It appears your friend must report it in any case.\n\nIt's possible that the University isn't legally allowed to ask a question requiring this kind of answer.

The school is then either allowed to require an answer, or is not allowed to require an answer. If the school is allowed to require an answer, your friend likely has to answer and should almost certainly answer truthfully, as arrest records may well be public records that turn up in a background check or the University's research.

The \"distribution statement\" on US government documents has to do with sensitive information, not copyright. For instance, in the Department of Defense, a document with a graph of velocity vs. distance for a new bullet might be marked \"Distribution D \\- Critical Technology,\" meaning that the information shouldn't be given to anyone outside the DoD or a DoD contractor (the information might not be *classified*, but it's not something to go telling everyone about). A slide that talks about what the lab did that year and has a bullet point for \"Invented new, longer\\-ranged bullet\" might be marked \"Distribution A,\" meaning that there's no issue with telling everyone that the lab invented a new bullet with a longer range.\n\nAny work produced by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of their official duties is not protected under US copyright law. A work produced by someone else (like a contractor) likely is protected.

The distribution statement on U.S. government documents primarily relates to the handling of sensitive information and does not directly determine copyright status.

There were expensive stereo components in plain sight, which raised a reasonable suspicion. But that reasonable suspicion did not justify a further search, which police nevertheless conducted: they turned the stereo to get the serial numbers. Having phoned in the numbers and learning that the items were stolen, they then had probable cause for a seizure. That cause was, however, obtained via an illegal search.\n\nSuppose that the serial numbers had been visible from the front: then because they would have been in plain view and since the police were there for a reasonable search related to the shooting, then could have legally seized the stereo, since no additional search was required.\n\nThere is no distinction between search and seizure w.r.t. 4th Amendment protection (\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated\"). Police could not confiscate the stereo without probable cause, nor could they confiscate cash, or any other thing, again, unless they had probable cause. And they could not search for evidence that would give them probable cause to take stuff.\n\nAs SCOTUS said, regarding searches versus seizures, \n\n> We have not elsewhere drawn a categorical distinction between the two\n>  insofar as concerns the degree of justification needed to establish\n>  the reasonableness of police action, and we see no reason for a\n>  distinction in the particular circumstances before us here.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the Arizona v.

The police were lawfully in the apartment due to a shooting incident, but moving the stereo to obtain the serial number exceeded the scope of their original entry and was not justified by plain view doctrine. This action was deemed an additional search that required probable cause, which the police did not have at that time. The court ruled that this search violated the Fourth Amendment, leading to the exclusion of the evidence.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the police had a valid reason to enter the apartment due to the shooting incident.

I've leased this office for many years and currently don't have a lease. The owner of the building has decided to sell, and the new buyer has contacted me and asked me to sign a lease.\n\nThere is absolutely no benefit to me to signing a lease. Office space is plentiful locally, so the new owner needs me more than I need them. However, the buyer informed me today that if I don't sign a lease, the mortgage won't be approved. I don't want to be the guy who killed a real estate deal and end up with both the current owner and future owner mad at me. So the buyer proposed writing a contract \"on the side\" between us that releases me from the lease if I provide 90 days notice. The mortgage lender would be unaware of this contract.

The problematic scenario might be if you were planning to leave the building in the foreseeable future and the new buyer intentionally concealed that knowledge from the lender. That could be actionable as conspiracy with \\-\\-or abetting of\\-\\- the new buyer. Your description does not reflect any plans of yours to vacate the premises, though.\n\n> Would it be a legal, enforceable contract?\n\nYes. However, it is utmost important that the \"separate\" contract make it clear the superseding effect it has on the full contract that is presented to the lender.\n\nThe primary reason for this is that, when interpreting a contract, a court is supposed to restrict its review to the language of the contract only. Any external records are ignored unless they explicitly relate to the contract, or in situations where the language of the contract lacks guidance as to the controversy at issue.\n\nAlso, without proper reference to the official lease, the separate provision would look as a one\\-sided promise rather than an *exchange* of considerations (by definition, a contract is an exchange of considerations). Thus, you would be more vulnerable to the new buyer's eventual decision not to honor the provision. \n\nStrictly speaking, the separate contract with no references to the official lease could make it clear that your consideration was in the form of helping the new buyer in his mortgage process. However, for obvious reasons the new buyer will refuse to reflect that in the separate contract.

R. Civ. P. 68\\) offer of judgment (OOJ). Thus far, nearly every jurisdiction's court of appeals has refused to construe these as being binding on the Plaintiff if the offer is denied, even if it offers complete remuneration, especially in a putative class action. The underlying reasons when applied to a certified class differ fairly substantially from an individual plaintiff or a non\\-certified class. However, there are some kinds of cases where a Rule 68 offer could *never* fully compensate (as with cases where subjective or non\\-substantive forms of damage have been requested).\n\nA Rule 68 offer is a cost\\-flipping mechanism, often used by defense attorneys when they are making what they believe is a fair offer (very rarely is the offer one that is equal to the Plaintiff's demand, which is why this issue rarely arises). If a defense attorney makes an offer of judgment, and then the Plaintiff doesn't accept the offer, they need to get a jury verdict in an amount greater than the offer, or the costs are flipped. So, typically, if there is no OOJ and the Plaintiff wins even a nominal judgment (it can be a dollar) the Defendant always has to pay their costs, which can be substantial. When a Rule 68 offer is made, it's a carefully calculated amount that the defendant thinks the plaintiff can't get in a jury verdict, even if they win, but it's typically less than the demand. \n\nThe reason a Rule 68 offer is **almost never** \"full compensation\" is that a Plaintiff's demand for settlement will typically be somewhere in the area of 3x the amount the Plaintiff's attorney estimates the case to be worth. The Plaintiff is informed of this by their lawyer, so they don't have unreasonable expectations. If you think about it, this makes sense from an *ability to negotiate* perspective, with the logic being that the Plaintiff wants to get as close to full value as they can, and the defense needs their client to think they've saved them from some huge judgement. If a plaintiff demanded only what the case was worth, it would have no chance of settling for true value, or if the case were to settle, the Defense lawyer wouldn't be able to move the Plaintiff down off their number in any substantial way. This way, the lawyers can play their game negotiating the case down to a fair value. Plaintiff gets what their case is worth and Defendant feels like their lawyer saved them from catastrophe. It's all illusion.\n\nThe First Circuit recently joined the Second, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits in holding that a Rule 68 offer made prior to class certification and rejected by Plaintiff does not moot the Plaintiff\u2019s claim. The Plaintiff, a private high school, brought the action against the corporate developer of a college\\-entrance exam, alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and an analogous state statute related to unsolicited faxes it received. Prior to Plaintiff\u2019s deadline to move for class certification, the Defendant made an Offer Of Judgment, offering Plaintiff the amount it could receive under the two statutes for each fax. Plaintiff did not respond within 14 days, rendering the offer withdrawn under Rule 68, and instead moved for class certification. Defendant then moved to dismiss, arguing that the withdrawn offer rendered Plaintiff\u2019s claims moot and divested the court of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion, holding that Plaintiff\u2019s claim was not moot, but certified the question of whether an unaccepted Rule 68 offer, made before certification, moots the entire action and deprives the court of jurisdiction.\n\nGenerally speaking, aside from very specific types of cases involving contracts, or specific types of statutory relief, a Plaintiff typically includes counts for things like NIED (negligent infliction of emotional distress), pain and suffering, loss of consortium, loss of future earning capacity \u2013 these are a few of the types of counts whereby there is no specific value a defendant could ever point to being \"fully satisfied\" \u2013 the reason being, a jury needs to determine the legitimate value of these claims unless the Plaintiff accepts a settlement award whereby he/she/it feels as if it's fully satisfied.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a putative class action lawsuit, the defendant makes a Rule 68 offer of judgment to the lead plaintiff before class certification, offering the maximum statutory damages.

This is true even if the offer includes the maximum statutory damages.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the offer does not automatically moot the claim or terminate the class action, especially if rejected.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the case is not necessarily mooted even if the lead plaintiff accepts the offer, particularly in the context of a potential class action.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it's very rare for a Rule 68 offer to fully compensate for all potential damages, especially non-economic ones like emotional distress, which are subjective and typically determined by a jury."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60030/are-chess-games-copyrighted", "docs_id": 60030, "title": "Are chess games copyrighted?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: First and foremost, I've already done some research regarding my question \\- web pages including, but not limited to the following ones, weren't able to answer my question to it's full extent:\n\n* [https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/17143/what\\-are\\-the\\-laws\\-concerning\\-copyright\\-of\\-chess\\-games](https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/17143/what-are-the-laws-concerning-copyright-of-chess-games)\n* <https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1wgnc7/chess_and_copyright/>\n* [https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/copyright\\-on\\-games](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/copyright-on-games)\n* etc.\n\nAccording to various sources, chess games (the moves themselves) aren't protected by copyright of any kind.

Another opinion which has been shared frequently is that chess notations are eligible for copyright. *That out of the way, let's dive right into the question itself:*\n\nSuppose someone wants to share a paid blog post including special games of **different** kinds of players. For each of those games he lists a snippet of the important moves (which is completely legal) and includes the name of both parties, i.e. the white player is \"Magnus Carlsen\", black player is \"Anish Giri\".

These include the moves, the players involved, the venue, the clock times, draw offers, etc. Basically, anything found on the scoresheet.\n\nThe parts which *are* copyrighted are the parts the author actually, well, authored. Commentary and analysis, for example. A discussion of the \"important\" moves of the game would certainly qualify.\n\n> Am I allowed to share a selection of different games, including details like names, date, place and so forth \\- all public knowledge?\n\nSingle games, yes. But you can't take Fischer's \"My 60 Memorable Games\" and publish a collection of just those 60 games, even if you leave out his commentary \\- the creativity that went into selecting which games were included qualifies for copyright as well.

The consultant should request a written amendment to the clause that explicitly limits it to current and past clients. This is the most appropriate action because:\n\n1. The verbal assurance from the CEO and lawyer contradicts the broad language in the written clause. Verbal assurances are not legally binding in contract law.\n\n2.

Rejecting the agreement outright (option B) may be premature and could unnecessarily end a business relationship if negotiation is possible.\n\n4. Signing the agreement with plans to challenge it later (option D) is not advisable, as it's better to address issues before signing rather than rely on uncertain legal action later.\n\n5.

The law clearly states that full legal capacity is achieved at 18, and it outlines restrictions for those under 14 and those between 14-18 with mental illnesses. However, for a mentally-fit 16-year-old, the situation is not clearly defined. This leaves room for interpretation and potentially case-by-case consideration.

The legislature in question could surely act to expel a member in such a case, if its own rules allow expulsion (Each house of Congress is granted that power explicitly in the Federal Constitution, but a 2/3rds vote to expel is needed.) Presumably other procedures could also be used, but I am not sure what they would be, or what procedures were used back in the 1860s.\n\nIt is not clear that a person would need to be criminally convicted before this could apply, but under Due process some sort of hearing would be required.

SPARKS, (1980\\)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/449/24.html). It is part of larger reading from [Operation Greylord](https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/operation-greylord). Part of the decision says:\n\n> Judicial immunity arose because it was in the public interest to have\n>  judges who were at liberty to exercise their independent judgment\n>  about the merits of a case without fear of being mulcted for damages\n>  should an unsatisfied litigant be able to convince another tribunal\n>  that the judge acted not only mistakenly but with malice and\n>  corruption. Pierson v. Ray, supra, at 554; Bradley v. Fisher, 13\n>  Wall., at 349, 350, n.\n\nThe decision also makes reference to 42 U.S.C. 1983, but I have not read it yet. So I may be missing something obvious. (If so, then please accept my apologies).\n\nI'm not clear how it is the public's interest *not* to hold a corrupt judge accountable. In Operation Greylord the 17 judges willfully accepted bribes; it was not a matter of a \"honest\" mistake or false accusation.\n\nNaively, it seems to me a holding a judge accountable for willful criminal acts provides a deterrent. (A similar argument is usually made when the state provides a death sentence and executes its citizens). Or maybe the contra\\-positive is more import \\- a judge who knows he or she is not held accountable is free be be as corrupt as they like knowing they will probably not get caught.\n\nHow is it in the public's interest not to hold a corrupt judge accountable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Judicial immunity means only that the judge can't be *sued* by the people negatively affected by his decisions, even if they were made corruptly. \n\nThe idea is that if this were possible, then anyone who lost a case before the judge could sue him, perhaps falsely claiming that he was corrupt. Defending such suits would be a major nuisance and expense for the judge, and some fraction of such cases might be wrongly decided against him (courts do err sometimes). So, a party who said (or insinuated) to the judge that \"you'd better decide my case in my favor or else I'll sue you\" would have a credible threat, and the judge might be intimidated into giving in. This would certainly not be in the public interest, and so judicial immunity removes this possibility.\n\nIt's a trade\\-off: the harm done by false accusations would outweigh the good done by legitimate lawsuits against truly corrupt judges, and you can't allow the latter without creating the possibility of the former.\n\nHowever, judges *can* still be held accountable for corruption \\- just not through the mechanism of lawsuits by the affected parties. This is addressed within the *Dennis* decision, in the paragraph right above the one you quoted:\n\n> But judicial immunity was not designed to insulate the judiciary from all aspects of public accountability. Judges are immune from 1983 damages actions, but they are subject to criminal prosecutions as are other citizens. O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 503 (1974\\).\n\nSo a corrupt judge can still be prosecuted by the state: removed from his job, fined, sent to prison, etc. But the decision to prosecute him would be made by a state prosecutor, who has no personal stake in matters before the court, rather than by a potentially disgruntled litigant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the concept of judicial immunity as described in DENNIS v.

The concept of judicial immunity, as explained in DENNIS v. SPARKS (1980), protects judges from being sued by parties affected by their decisions, even if those decisions were allegedly corrupt. However, this immunity does not extend to criminal prosecution. The decision explicitly states that \"judges are subject to criminal prosecutions as are other citizens.\" This balance allows for public accountability through proper legal channels (criminal prosecution by the state) while protecting judges from potentially frivolous or retaliatory lawsuits by disgruntled litigants.\n\nOption A is incorrect because judicial immunity does not protect judges from criminal prosecution. \n\nOption B is the opposite of what judicial immunity does; it prevents such lawsuits, not allows them. \n\nOption D is incorrect because judicial immunity applies to all judicial decisions, including those that might be corrupt, protecting judges from civil lawsuits (but not criminal prosecution)."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/56165/can-you-explain-the-rule-of-three-scores-in-plain-english", "docs_id": 56165, "title": "Can you explain the &quot;Rule of Three Scores&quot;?

It is more helpful to think of it as the candidate himself.\n* \"Certifying\" a score mostly just means that the commission transmits the score to the hiring officer and promises that it's accurate.\n* So whenever there is an opening for a position, the civil service commission must certify/send a list of scores/candidates for the hiring officer to consider, i.e. choose from.\n* The Rule of Three Scores says that list must have at least two more scores than there are open positions. If the city is hiring 50 police officers, the list must have at least 52 scores (50 positions plus 2\\). If it is hiring three secretaries, the list must have at least five scores (3 positions plus 2\\).\n* It's called The Rule of Three Scores because the existence of a list presumes at least one opening, which necessitates at least three scores.

If you (or your mother) own the guns, you can sell them to anyone you like unless you have reason to believe they are a prohibited possessor.\n\n* There is no legal requirement for you to validate their identity.\n* There is no limit on the number of guns you can sell to one person.\n* A bill of sale is optional.\n* You don't need a lawyer and, honestly, I'm not sure what a lawyer would do to help you sell a gun.\n\nThe laws, being what they are, lead some to conclude that this must be how prohibited possessors get their guns. It's not. Most \"illegal\" guns are bought through straw purchases in which a person with a clean record buys a gun for someone who is not legally allowed to own one.\n\nYou can work through a licensed dealer if it makes you feel better. If you don't want to use a dealer, you can simply require that a buyer have a concealed carry license as evidence that they are not a prohibited possessor.

For example, [www.gunbroker.com](http://www.gunbroker.com) is a popular site and follows an eBay\\-style bid structure (I have no affiliation to them).

The FAA has nothing to do with it; they regulate things as they affect airplanes, but the actual *radio* rules are set by the FCC, and since frequency allocation is a purely radio thing the FAA has nothing official to do with it. The breakdown between FCC and NTIA is that the FCC deals with non\\-federal communications, while the NTIA deals with federal communications; they split the spectrum.\n\nNow, with things like Wi\\-Fi, many of the rules are set by non\\-governmental standards organizations. Wi\\-Fi is not regulated by the FCC; it falls within the frequencies and transmission powers that the FCC has deemed to be not regulated. So, the FCC never set aside 2\\.4 GHz for wireless Internet; they set it aside for any low\\-powered transmissions anyone wants to make (subject to interference rules). With LTE and satellite communications, there's more regulatory control; they are high\\-powered communications, and are licensed to individual operators for a specific frequency range. \n\nAs Flup said, there is international coordination for obvious reasons (the ITU actually predates the UN by almost a century).
