The initial copyright owner is the author of the work. In cases of employment, the \"author\" might be the natural person who authored the work, or the corporate person who employed the natural author.\n\nTo clarify your thinking about registration: copyright registration is a public record of authorship (or copyright ownership). Registration does not create a copyright, but is merely a recording of the copyright that was automatically created at the moment of original authorship.\n\nDepending on circumstances and jurisdiction, Alan might have a legitimate claim to copyright on his own work. However, he will be quite hard\\-pressed to find a convincing theory of law that allows him to publish the unpublished copyrighted work of *other people* without their permission.\n\nThis leaves him either to admit defeat \\-\\- he cannot possibly own the copyright of his coworkers' code, so he cannot have legally reproduced it \\-\\- or else make the baldfaced lie that the code has no other authors other than Alan himself. For your company to disprove such a claim, you may employ sworn testimony of your coworkers, you may employ code analysis to show differing coding styles (suggestive of multiple authors), or you may show code backups or version control history showing the progressive authorship of the work over time by many people.

The correct answer is C because, according to the Berne Convention (which applies in most countries), copyright is established at the moment of creation, not publication. This means the startup's code was copyrighted as soon as it was written, regardless of whether it was published or who published it first.\n\nOption A is incorrect because publication order and signed commits do not determine copyright ownership.

Is it illegal to register to vote in State B unless I go through some process?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To vote in a state, you must be a resident of that state. While attending school out of state does not terminate your legal residency in A, establishing residency in B does. If you want to vote in B, become a resident and register in B; if you want to remain a resident of A and vote in A, don't do that.\n\nEstablishing residency in B generally boils down to intending to reside in B for more than a temporary period. I suspect that most states do not have a universal definition of \"resident\", so for example in Washington, each agency has its criteria for residency. To register to vote, you have to be a legal resident and live at the address for 30 days (prior to the next election). One way to establish residency is getting a drivers license, which has a [residency requirement](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.16A.140) that is satisfied by receiving state benefits (only available to residents), registering to vote (hmmm), getting, according to [Licensing](http://www.dol.wa.gov/driverslicense/moving.html), or \"Declaring residency for the purpose of obtaining a state license or tuition fees at resident rates\", according to the actual law, in\\-state tuition, or get any state license at resident rates (we see a pattern here). The Department of Licensing also accepts utility bills with address (excluding cell phone, internet, or satellite), bank statements, and so on. This, BTW, is the most common path to *establishing* residency: take a bank statement or similar with street address to the license office. For [hunting and fishing](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=77.08.075), you have to live in a permanent place of abode in the state for 90 days. There are a number of ways to show that: use a Washington address for federal taxes; run for public office or use a Washington address for some court papers; be a custodial parent of a child attending school in the state; register to vote, have a driver's license; register a vehicle in the state. The suicide law restricts the right to medical suicide to residents, proof of which includes (is not limited to) having a Washington driver's license (which is not the same as a state ID card), being registered to vote, or owning / leasing property in the state.\n\nThere is a [social services definition](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=388-468&full=true), based on either living in Washington intending to continue for an indefinite period, or entering the state looking for a job with a job commitment and it explicitly says \"A person does not need to live in the state for a specific period of time to be considered a resident\". But for [tuition purposes](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/Rcw/default.aspx?cite=28B.15.012), you have to have moved to the state for reasons other than tuition, and you have to have been here at least a year. Ohio similarly has an agency\\-by\\-agency approach to \"residency\". If you exclude financial benefits and focus on drivers license or state ID and voter registration, you can probably make a reasonable guess as to the requirements. There is no official registration or form to fill out to become \"a resident\" (as far as I know, in any state), so the law will say what could constitute evidence that you *are* a resident.

The correct answer is B because it demonstrates the student's intent to establish residency in State B, which is crucial for voting eligibility. \n\nChanging the bank statement address and obtaining a State B driver's license are both mentioned in the documentation as ways to establish residency. These actions, combined with voter registration in State B, strongly indicate the student's intent to reside in State B \"for more than a temporary period,\" which is a key factor in establishing residency.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it conflicts with the principle that one must be a resident of the state to vote there. Maintaining official documentation in State A while only changing voter registration could be seen as attempting to vote in a non-resident state.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it assumes continued residency in State A, which may not be accurate if the student has effectively moved to State B.\n\nOption D is a tricky distractor because declaring residency for tuition purposes might seem sufficient. However, the documentation specifies that for voting purposes, more concrete evidence of residency (like changing driver's license) is typically required.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about the multifaceted nature of residency for voting purposes, requiring integration of various concepts from the documentation."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36327/how-long-can-one-be-detained-without-a-court-hearing", "docs_id": 36327, "title": "How long can one be detained without a court hearing?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A journalist was [detained in the US on January 13](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/melanie-franklin-marzieh-hashemi-us-iran-press-tv-anchor-arrest-material-witness/).\n According to CBS, Ricardo J.

The responsibility of having the DPA signed lies with the school, and not with the SAAS\\-provider? The provider must provide it, and sign it if requested by the school?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Under GDPR the Controller is the party which has defined \"purpose\" and \"scope\", meaning what the Processor is supposed to do while Processing Personal Data within the scope of a Service being rendered by the Controller.\n\nSo, if the Controller has defined what the Software does and the other company has developed the software \"tailor\\-made\" as per the Controller's request and now makes it available for the Controller to use it as a Service, then YES, the SaaS Company is the Processor and the School the Controller.\n\nHowever, most likelly, the SaaS company has developed a Software on its own that addresses \"most common needs\" of schools, and that makes them also a controller, for they has defined WHAT the SW does... so on that case:\n\\- the School is a Controller under that Service Scope\n\\- the SaaS company is both a Co\\-controller and a Processor (since it enables the tool as a Service).\n\n2. Controllers, being the ones that define \"purpose\" and \"scope\" should also be the ones enabling their own DPA for the Processor to sign... if the SW was \"tailor\\-made\" at the request of the School, then the School must provide the DPA for the SaaS company to sign. On the other hand if the SW already existed, hence both act as Co\\-Controllers and since the SW scope is the one that bears most relevancy within the \"relationship\" and Shared Services, the SaaS Company should provide the DPA for the School to sign (similar to what happens with Cloud hosting companies line AWS or Azure).\n3. It's not a matter of \"responsibility\" but of \"risk mitigation\" for the Controller since under GDPR the Controller becomes liable for any non\\-compliance points on the Processor's side.\nAgain, if the School is the Controller and the SaaS company the Processor, then it is of the utmost interest of the School to have a DPA ratified between both.\nNevertheless, and since it is most likely that both act as Co\\-controllers, it is most relevant for both to have the DPA in order.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A small private school is considering implementing the cloud-based SAAS system described.

If one party wants the police there, it is standard to wait. If **both** decide it not necessary, it is fine to leave. Either way, leaving or staying does not give rise to the avoidance of a finding of fault against one party or another. The state of Wisconsin is a Tort State (as opposed to a no\\-fault state). These are insurance related issues as opposed to legal issues, but utterly intertwined. The accident reports filed by each party, any police reports and other relevant data will be submitted to the DMV and the insurance, and the insurance companies will assign fault if the DMV or police haven't, either by agreement or inter\\-company arbitration.\n\nRelating to your question, however, you will see the processes required [HERE](http://www.dmv.com/wi/wisconsin/auto-accidents). In part, it states the following:\n\n> **REPORTING AN ACCIDENT TO THE WISCONSIN DOT** In **some** situations, you must report an accident to the Wisconsin Police.

In the event that another driver offers to pay\n>  for damages and asks you not to report an accident, you are still\n>  required to file the report in any of the situations outlined above.\n> \n> \n> Your report must include detailed and current information regarding\n>  your insurance coverage. The DOT will cross\\-check this information\n>  with the insurance company shown on the report. If you did not have\n>  liability insurance when the accident occurred and were unable to\n>  provide restitution for injuries or damages sustained due to your\n>  negligence, your driving privileges will be suspended. You will be\n>  required to file proof of future financial responsibility (SR\\-22\\) in\n>  order to have your driving privileges reinstated.\n> \n> \n> Make a copy of the accident report form for your personal records. You\n>  can mail the original directly to:\n>  Traffic Accident Section, Wisconsin Department Of Transportation,\n>  Po Box 7919,\n>  Madison, WI 53707\\-7919\n\nAs you can see, *from your interpretation/description*, you were not technically required to deal with the police, but you *were* required to exchange information, assess and give aid to the extent possible to the other driver, and so if the other called for emergency intervention it may be the other driver disagreed w/ one of these assessments (damage or injury).\\*\\*\n\nIf you did exchange information, took photos, etc., you are probably ok. If not, certainly that will be problematic. \n\n\\*\\*I know you are saying there was no damage or injury. However, while you are saying this is what the other driver acquiesced to, it may be that it is not the case either afterward or he/she wanted to avoid (potentially dangerous) interaction at the scene. That said, while you can clearly see the situations by which the police are necessitated, you also indicate the other driver called the police. In that case, you *probably* should have stayed once you were alerted to that fact, as leaving puts you in the precarious position of only the other driver's side being documented by the police, and your absence may lead the officer to find you at fault or with something to hide. \n\nThe officer will file a report, either way, of which you must get a copy. If he disagrees with your assessment of the damage/injury and feels you left in the face of those situations proscribed, you will know because you will be arrested or summoned for leaving the scene. That is to be determined by the reporting officer.\n\nIn the future, if there is an accident and one driver explicitly states the police have been called, you should wait. You don't have to say anything at all to the officer, if you don't want to. In most states, all you need to do is give the officer your driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. It always looks worse to leave the scene knowing they are coming, since it may lead to a determination that it was illegal to do so. Whereas, no additional harm can come from remaining present.\n\nSo far, I cannot find a state statute there whereby it is explicitly illegal to leave once one driver calls for emergency assistance.

The notice must be in writing and direct the tenant's attention to the automatic renewal provision of the lease. **The notice must be served personally or mailed by certified mail at least 15 days, but not more than 30 days prior to the time that the tenant is required to furnish notice of an intention to quit.**\n\nI didn't understand the lease completely, now I'm even more confused by the Minnesota Statute\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From the time that the lease expired and you remained with permission, you had a shorter period of obligation and protection. I assume that the lease ended long ago, and you've been living there month to month.\n\nAssuming that we can read \"two rental periods\" as \"two whole months\" (if there is something else in the lease that indicates this, such as a rent due\\-date), then we can interpret the notice requirement as saying that you must give notice before the first of the month 2 months before the intended end of tenancy \u2013 that is *one* meaning of the lease. Another meaning is that you can give notice 58 days in advance. The lease has an ambiguity as to what the notice requirement is. Since you did not write the lease, and they did (well, someone, whose obligations they inherited, did), the ambiguity is construed against the party to wrote it. In the present circumstance, because you want to leave soon, you would not be held to the notice requirement that favors the landlord. It's entirely non\\-obvious why such wording would be used.\n\nIn [504B.135](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=504B.135), the statutes say\n\n> (a) A tenancy at will may be terminated by either party by giving\n>  notice in writing. The time of the notice must be at least as long as\n>  the interval between the time rent is due or three months, whichever\n>  is less.\n> \n> \n> (b) If a tenant neglects or refuses to pay rent due on a tenancy at\n>  will, the landlord may terminate the tenancy by giving the tenant 14\n>  days notice to quit in writing.\n\nOnce you're past the end of the lease, you are a tenant at will, by [the definitions section](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=504B.001):\n\n> \"Tenancy at will\" means a tenancy in which the tenant holds possession\n>  by permission of the landlord but without a fixed ending date.\n\nAssuming that you pay rent at the first of the month, then the lesser of a whole calendar month and three months is, obviously, a whole calendar month. \n\nThe stuff at the end of the statute that you cite \u2013 \"The notice must be in writing and direct the tenant's attention\" \u2013 is addressed to the landlord's notice to tenant, where he says \"Your tenancy will not auto\\-renew\". This applies to leases of 2 months or longer, not recycled 1 month leases, and requires the landlord to give the tenant appropriate notice (it does not define the tenant's notice requirement).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A tenant has been renting an apartment on a month-to-month basis after their original lease expired. The building was recently sold to a new company. On August 2nd, the tenant informs the new landlord of their intention to vacate in 60 days. The landlord claims the tenant must pay for both September and October. Given the lease terms and Minnesota statutes, what is the most accurate assessment of this situation?\n\nA) The tenant must pay for both September and October due to the \"two rental periods\" clause in the lease.\nB) The tenant can vacate on September 30th (59 days) without paying October rent, based on the \"58 days\" clause and statutory interpretation.\nC) The tenant must give notice by July 31st to avoid paying for October, as per the landlord's claim.\nD) The tenant must stay for three months from the notice date, as required by Minnesota statute 504B.135.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This situation requires analysis of multiple factors:\n\n1. The lease contains an ambiguous clause stating \"58 days' or two rental periods,\" which creates uncertainty.\n2. According to legal principles, ambiguities in contracts are typically construed against the drafter (the landlord in this case).\n3. Minnesota statute 504B.135 states that for a tenancy at will, which this has become, the notice period must be \"at least as long as the interval between the time rent is due or three months, whichever is less.\"\n4. Assuming rent is due monthly, the lesser of one month and three months is one month.\n5. The statute 504B.145 cited in the question is not directly applicable here as it pertains to automatic renewals of fixed-term leases, not month-to-month tenancies.\n\nGiven these factors, the tenant's 59-day notice (August 2nd to September 30th) exceeds both the ambiguous lease requirement (interpreted in the tenant's favor) and the statutory one-month minimum notice period. Therefore, the tenant should be able to vacate on September 30th without paying October rent. This interpretation applies the relevant laws and lease terms while considering the real-world scenario and the principle of contra proferentem (interpreting ambiguities against the drafter)."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13862/disclaimer-for-app", "docs_id": 13862, "title": "Disclaimer for App", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm developing an App, through which illustrators/creators can distribute their own comic books for free and other readers can download the books for free as well.

Vilsack](https://casetext.com/case/wynn-v-vilsack), a motion for preliminary injunction was granted (and the program was *not* ruled unconstitutional). In the ruling, the court found that the evidence \"does not support a finding that USDA continues to be a participant, passive or active, in discrimination\", and does find that there were past successful remediation efforts, thus \"the Court expresses serious concerns over whether the Government will be able to establish a strong basis in evidence warranting the implementation of Section 1005's race\\-based remedial action\", moreover \"Plaintiff has convincingly shown that the relief provided by Section 1005 is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest\". The court finds that there is a good\\-enough case that the law fails strict scrutiny. Incidentally, Congress repealed that law.\n\nOn the other hand, in Evanston, we have no facts or concrete legal allegations (e.g. drafts of a legal complaint). The [cited memorandum](https://cityofevanston.civicweb.net/document/50624/Adoption%20of%20Resolution%2037-R-27,%20Authorizing%20the.pdf?handle=E11C7B73E1B6470DA42362AB80A50C46) is a recommendation, not a law. There does exist at least one available [council action from 2019](https://www.cityofevanston.org/home/showpublisheddocument/90573/638249272128130000) which says that\n\n> The Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to divert all adult\n> use cannabis funds received by the Illinois Department of Revenue for\n> sales of adult use cannabis to a separate fund in a City account for\n> local reparations.

It thus does not exclude Asian and Hispanic homeowners, LGBTQIA2S\\+, Catholic, Muslims or anyone else, except insofar as a Catholic was not demonstrably the victim of such discrimination.

Laws generally cannot be applied retroactively to criminalize behavior that was not explicitly illegal at the time it occurred.\n\n3.

But, Canada does have what it calls a \"[principled exception](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Hearsay/Principled_Exception)\" (which is somewhat broader than the parallel U.S. residual hearsay exception) that is generally available if the document can be shown to be reliable and there is an unavailable witness, or if there proponent of the document can show that it is reliable and necessary for other reasons.\n\nEven if the document itself is not admissible since it is hearsay, you could still testify as to what the boss said from your own recollection, and then have your lawyer ask you why you are sure that this is what was said. You would answer that you contemporaneously wrote a confirming letter to the boss spelling out what was said and you reviewed it to refresh your recollection before testifying at the hearing or trial.\n\nThese kinds of confirming letters are used quite frequently in business and employment litigation. And, in my experience, these statements tend to be surprisingly effective and persuasive, because, while they do not foreclose the possibility that the person writing it was lying or inaccurate in the confirming email account, it does rule out the possibility that you forgot exactly what was said, and you provided the boss with an opportunity to dispute you which the boss didn't feel an obligation to correct.\n\nIf one party has a coherent account in confirming emails of what was said, and the other party is trying to remember what happened a year or two earlier without notes from the witness stand, the person with the coherent, documented account is almost always going to come across as more credible unless the other side can show that your confirming emails are not infrequently gross misrepresentations of what really occurred.

The employee wants to document this interaction for potential legal action. Which of the following approaches would likely carry the most weight as evidence in a Canadian court?\n\nA) Secretly recording the conversation with the manager without their consent\nB) Sending a follow-up email to the manager summarizing the verbal denial, CCing HR and BCCing a personal email address\nC) Asking a coworker to witness future conversations with the manager about time off requests\nD) Keeping a personal diary detailing all interactions with the manager regarding time off requests\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective approach is option B, sending a follow-up email summarizing the verbal denial. This aligns with the \"principled exception\" in Canadian law, which allows for hearsay evidence if it can be shown to be reliable and necessary. While the email itself may be considered hearsay, it serves several important purposes:\n\n1. It creates a contemporaneous record of the conversation, which can be used to refresh the employee's memory if testifying later.\n2. It provides the manager an opportunity to dispute or correct the account, and their failure to do so can be seen as tacit agreement.\n3. By CCing HR, it creates a business record that may be admissible under the business records exception to hearsay.\n4. BCCing a personal email address ensures the employee retains access to the documentation even if they lose access to work accounts.\n\nOption A (secret recording) may be illegal depending on the jurisdiction and would likely be inadmissible. Option C (coworker witness) could be helpful but may be less reliable than contemporaneous documentation. Option D (personal diary) would still be considered hearsay and lacks the corroborative strength of an email sent to the manager and HR.\n\nThe documentation suggests that while such emails may not be directly admissible as evidence, they significantly enhance the credibility of the employee's testimony and provide a coherent account of events, which is often more persuasive in court than relying on memory alone."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7011/is-it-legal-to-ask-an-unknown-person-to-buy-something-for-me-abroad-and-then-bu", "docs_id": 7011, "title": "Is it legal to ask an unknown person to buy something for me abroad, and then buy it back?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I assume of course that laws will differ by country, and I'm interested in those differences, though there should be some common aspects.\n\nThere are several layers to my question.\n\nWe agree that your friend can bring you a gift from his homeland, as long as it complies with custom rules.\n\nNow can your friend legally sell it back to you at the price he bought it ?\n\nThis product may sometimes be available in your country, but at higher price, does it change anything ?\n\nCan your friend legally sell it back to you at a higher price, making some pocket money out of it ?\n\nNow what if he's not a friend, but a stranger, or someone you got acquainted with online, is it considered contraband?

The correct answer is C because the proposed strategy aligns with the definition of a fraudulent transfer provided in the documentation. Key points supporting this:\n\n1. The arrangement involves transferring debts to a spin-off company while retaining assets, which is precisely the type of transaction described as fraudulent in the documentation.\n2.

That is, celebrations whose participants meet *in person in the same place* are prohibited.\n\nBut then, all of those statements, and definitely the last one, also sound a lot like it's the very activity of celebrating that is prohibited, presumably because the \"serious situation in our country\" makes such a behaviour unbecoming.

But it is a really big channel.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Indiviual words and short phrases such as titles cannot be protected by copyright. However, they can be protected by trademark law. \"Android\" is a trademark in the US, in the EU, and I am pretty sure in most if not all other countries.\n\nTrademark protection is specific to a purpose or area. If you are writing an SF novel which contains an artificial being, you can describe that being as \"an android\" without infringing the trademark protection on the mobile phone OS. However, using the term \"android\" to describe a pieces of mobile phone software is likely to be an infringement. \n\nTrademark law is different in different countries. For example, in some countries, there is no protection unless a trademark is registered. In others, including the US, simply using a term to label a product or service in commerce can create protection, although registration can give additional rights to the trademark holder. The exact rights protected and the standards for measuring infringement will also vary, but there are many similarities in trademark laws across the world.\n\nOne can use a trademark to refer to the trademarked product or service, and this is not an infringement. For example, one can write a review of Android phones vs Iphones, and use the term \"Android\". This is called \"*Nominative use*\" or sometimes \"*Nominative fair use*\". One must be careful not to imply that the trademark owner has approved, endorsed, or sponsored the use. With a review, this is usually fairly obvious. But in other cases of nominative use it can be more of an issue. For example, one might write in an advertisement \"This software is compatible with Android phones.\" That is nominative use, but a reader might think that the software has been in some way approved by the trademark holder. The ad should therefore make it very clear that there has been no such approval, sponsorship, or affiliation. This is often do0ne with an explicit disclaimer, such as \"XYZ software is not produced by, approved, sponsored by, or affiliated with Android, which is a trademark of Google.\" \n\nIn general one should use no more of a trademark than is needed to identify a product under nominative use. It is generally better practice to sue the name, but not the logo. Use of a logo is more likely to appear to indicate some sort of affiliation. But this is not an absolute rule. For example, a product which is compatible with many other products might display a list of logos, provided it makes clear that this merely indicates compatibility. not approval.\n\nThe basic standard is that one may not use a trademark so that a reasonable person, a customer or potential customer, might plausibly be confused into thinking that a product or service comes from the trademark holder, or is in some way approved by, endorsed by, or is affiliated with the trademark holder, or that the reputation associated with the trademark properly attaches to the product that uses the trademark without permission. Also, one may not use a trademark so as to dilute it, treating it as a generic term for all products of a similar type. For example, one should not use \"Xerox\" as a synonym for \"photocopy\", as that dilutes the Xerox trademark. \n\nOne may offer training or instruction about a trademarked product, and one may use the trademark to identify the product about which instruction is begin offered. This is a form of nominative use, and like other forms, the user must make the lack of any affiliation clear, and avoid possible consumer confusion. This would apply to publicly posted videos.\n\nUsing a handle such as \"AndroidGuy\" to indicate that one is a fan of, or an expert with, Android phones could be a form of nominative use, but seems rather likely to create confusion. If others might reasonably think this indicates that \"AndroidGuy\" is some sort of official representative of Android, or has in some way been approved or authorized by Google, that would be infringement.\n\nA channel name, unlike a handle, comes with a description, that could help clarify the lack of affiliation. But again, if anyone might reasonably be confused into thinking the channel or the videos posted there are sponsored by Google, that might be infringement. If the videos are being sold, or are used to advertise commercial courses or any other products or services, one must be particularly careful to avoid any implied affiliation. \n\nTrademark infringement, like copyright infringement, is usually a civil matter, not a criminal one. That means that the trademark holder must bring a court case or other legal proceeding to stop the infringement, or to recover damages or penalties. Some holders are more aggressive about this than others. This also means that a holder can file suit even in cases that are clearly permitted nominative use, and it is up to the defendant to assert and demonstrate that the use is permitted under the relevant law.

I am specifically interested in exactly where the line between policy and law is. I understand why the laws are in place, I don't understand what the minimum requirement is, and what is just trying to cover the bases just in case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is illegal to sell alcohol to a minor in Washington ([RCW 66\\.44\\.270](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=66.44.270)). The seller can get into various kinds of trouble, including losing their license, under [liquor board regulations](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=314-11). However, as long as the establishment follows the rules for [acceptable ID](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=314-11-025), they [escape liability](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.20.210) if in fact they sell alcohol to a minor: the license holder is [legally allowed](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.20.170) to accept an identification of the specific type. That is the sense in which this is required by law: the customer must have actually presented the identification, in order for the establishment to escape liability ([RCW 66\\.20\\.210](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.20.210)). Looking old enough is not the issue. It is legal to sell alcohol to a person who is over 21, and the law does not *require* presentation of identification as a condition for a sale. However, under [RCW 66\\.20\\.180](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=66.20.180) a person is require to produce ID \"upon request of any *licensee*, peace officer, or enforcement officer of the board\". The legal risk attached to sales in an age\\-marginal situation is very high, and actual presentation of ID is required to escape liability by the establishment, so in that sense, it is \"required by law\".\n\nAll requests to produce ID for liquor sales (at least in Washington, and leaving out deliveries which are governed by other laws) are driven by company policy. Typical policies are quite rational, being designed to protect the company's interest in not getting into a heap of trouble for an under\\-age sale. There is no law saying when you must ask, or when you are protected if you don't ask. Usually, store policy is to use \"common sense\" so that 90 year olds are not required to produce ID (they may be asked, jokingly).\n\nNon\\-compliance with RCW 66\\.20\\.180 carries no legal penalty, that is, there is nothing in the statute that says \"if the customer doesn't...\". The most obvious would be that the seller would refuse to sell, which the seller can arbitrarily do anyhow. There is no statutory penalty imposed on a licensee if they request ID of a person over 21 and the person fails / refuses to produce the ID. Obviously, the licensee cannot be punished if a customer fails to provide ID (and leaves), especially if they lost it. But the law \"requires\" them to provide an ID, with ne except \"unless you leave / put the bottle back\". Somewhat less obviously, if the legislature wants to, it can enact a provision that once a licensee requests ID, they are forbidden to sell alcohol to that customer until ID is provided. But there currently is no such law.\n\n\"The law\" also included regulations, such as [WAC 314\\-17\\-105](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=314-17-105). This regulation is a chart, and the relevant entry is\n\n> PERMIT: Failure to produce permit or identification upon request. See\n>  RCW 66\\.20\\.310 and 66\\.20\\.180\\.\n\nfor which the 1st offense consequence is \"5\\-day permit suspension OR $100 monetary option\". This is a problematic regulation (potential lawsuit fodder), since it can be interpreted in a number of ways. The question is, of whom is the permit or identification predicated? Only the licensee has a permit, but customers and employees can both have identification. If we interpret this regulation as meaning \"Failure by licensee or customer\", then we arrive at the absurd conclusion that if a customer fails to produce ID on request, the establishment is fined. It is important to note that this regulation is under a chapter about server training, thus the regulation can only reasonably be interpreted as being about licensee providing identification.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the given LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A liquor store owner in Washington State implements a strict policy requiring ID from all customers, regardless of apparent age. An elderly customer, visibly over 70 years old, becomes upset when asked for ID and refuses to show it. The owner is concerned about legal implications. What is the most accurate assessment of this situation under Washington State law?\n\nA) The owner must refuse the sale, as state law mandates ID checks for all alcohol purchases\nB) The owner can legally sell alcohol to the customer without ID, but risks losing liability protection\nC) The owner is required by law to report the customer's refusal to show ID to the liquor board\nD) The owner must sell to the customer, as refusing based on lack of ID for an obviously of-age person is illegal discrimination\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of Washington State liquor laws and their practical application. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Contrary to what some believe, Washington State law does not mandate ID checks for all alcohol purchases. The law states that a person must produce ID \"upon request\" (RCW 66.20.180), but there's no blanket requirement to check everyone's ID.\n\n2. However, the store's liability protection is tied to actually checking ID. As per RCW 66.20.210, the establishment can \"escape liability\" for selling to a minor if they follow the rules for acceptable ID.\n\n3. The store owner can legally sell to someone who appears over 21 without checking ID, but in doing so, they lose the legal protection that comes with verifying ID.\n\n4. There's no legal requirement to report ID refusals to the liquor board, eliminating option C.\n\n5. While refusing service might seem discriminatory, it's not illegal to refuse a sale based on store policy, even if the person appears over 21, ruling out option D.\n\n6. Option A is incorrect because the law doesn't mandate ID checks for all purchases, only that customers must comply if asked.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the nuanced relationship between law and policy in liquor sales, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario."}, "27": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83177/who-has-to-pay-restaurant-bill", "docs_id": 83177, "title": "Who has to pay restaurant bill", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Based on a story from another site: It\u2019s A\u2019s birthday. A\u2019s mum invites mum, dad, A and A\u2019s brother B to a meal in an expensive restaurant. At the end, mum gets the bill, pays money, and mum, dad and brother B leave.\n\nA wants to leave but mum didn\u2019t pay the complete bill: She didn\u2019t pay for B\u2019s meal and didn\u2019t pay a tip which is maybe legal but very rude. So A is stopped from leaving the restaurant.\n\nQuestion: Is the restaurant entitled to ask *any* member of the group to pay (and since A is the only one still present they demand money from A)? If A explains the situation and the restaurant owner is sympathetic, would he be entitled to ask for payment from mum instead (who isn\u2019t there anymore, but A can provide name, address and phone number)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Who entered the contract with the restaurant?\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIn order for the restaurant to collect from a person, that person must have entered into a contract for the meal. That is, from the restaurant's point of view, they must have indicated that they would like some food and, since everyone knows how restaurants work, they know that the food will have to be paid for.\n\nWhether a given person entered a contract will depend on the specific facts. If they opened their mouth and said to the waiter something like \u201cI\u2019ll have the chicken\u201d, they almost certainly entered a contract and they are obliged to pay. This is even if they had an expectation that someone else would pay for them \\- the restaurant is not involved in any other contracts or arrangements you might have with third\\-parties. You ordered, you\u2019re on the hook.\n\nIn a situation where you didn\u2019t order, the answer is still probably yes, you have to pay. Again, because you know how restaurants work, by eating the meal that was placed in front of you rather than saying, \u201cJust so you know, your contract for this meal is with that guy over there, is that okay?\u201d, you probably entered a contract by your action of eating the meal.\n\nMore broadly, when a group collectively enters a contract with the restaurant, they are probably agreeing with the restaurant that they will be jointly and severally bound. That is, each is responsible for all and the restaurant can pursue any or all of the people they have a contract with.\n\nA minor dining with their parents is probably not entering a contract with the restaurant. Not because minors can\u2019t enter contracts (they absolutely [can](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/58279/344)) but because of the normal expectation that the parent is entering the contract.\n\nThis is because of a principle that contract terms may be implied by [custom](https://legalvision.com.au/different-types-of-implied-terms/). That is, if there is a general understanding that this is the way things are done, then that will be something the law will enforce. This is a simple expedient adopted in order to make the world work \\- if every term of every contract had to be explicitly detailed in advance this would be a) unworkable and b) impossible.\n\nEven if there is no contract, the restaurant has equitable remedies like unjust enrichment. The diner has had the benefit of the meal and it would be unjust if the restaurant was left out of pocket. Equitable remedies can be even more complicated than contract law so we\u2019ll just leave it at that.\n\nAs for whether the restaurant will accept a promise from one diner that another will pay, that\u2019s up to them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A group of five family members dines at an expensive restaurant to celebrate a birthday. The mother, who invited everyone, pays most of the bill but omits her son's meal and the tip. She leaves with the father and one son, while the birthday celebrant (A) remains. The restaurant prevents A from leaving due to the unpaid portion. Which of the following best describes the legal situation and the restaurant's options?\n\nA) The restaurant can only seek payment from the mother as she initiated the contract by inviting the group.\nB) A is legally obligated to pay the remaining balance as they are jointly liable for the group's contract with the restaurant.\nC) The restaurant has no legal recourse as the primary payer has left the premises.\nD) The restaurant can only pursue payment from A if they personally ordered or consumed food.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This situation involves complex concepts of contract law and implied terms in restaurant transactions. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. When a group dines together, they typically enter into a collective contract with the restaurant, making them jointly and severally liable. This means the restaurant can pursue any member of the group for the full payment.\n\n2. By participating in the meal, each member of the group likely entered into an implied contract with the restaurant, regardless of who invited them or who was expected to pay. This is based on the custom and general understanding of how restaurants operate.\n\n3. The restaurant is not privy to any private arrangements within the group about who would pay, so they can rightfully seek payment from any present party to fulfill the contract.\n\n4. Even if A didn't personally order or consume food (which isn't specified in the scenario), their presence as part of the group celebration likely makes them party to the implied contract.\n\n5. While the restaurant could potentially pursue the mother later, they are within their rights to demand payment from A as a member of the dining party still present.\n\n6. If no contract existed, the principle of unjust enrichment could still apply, allowing the restaurant to seek compensation for services rendered.\n\nThis question requires analysis of contract formation, implied terms, joint liability, and the application of legal principles to a real-world scenario, testing critical thinking rather than mere memorization of laws."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42697/can-a-landlord-force-all-residents-to-use-the-landlords-in-house-debit-card-acc", "docs_id": 42697, "title": "Can a landlord force all residents to use the landlord&#39;s in-house debit card accounts?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \\[asking regarding state law in Ohio, U.S.A. only]\n\nRecently I have noticed landlords issuing their residents a debit card with attached bank account. This is typically implemented without prior notice and often with an additional fee attached.

You can't unilaterally amend contracts to add new terms without acceptance on part of the lessee. Any clause in the contract like that will require notification of the lessee of the change and a chance for the lessee to terminate the contract without recourse on part of the lessor. Generally this must be done in the same format as the original lease (written). Most jurisdictions don't allow for a verbal amendment to a written lease.\n\nSo in a way, yes, it is legal for a landlord to require payment via a certain method (like a direct debit from a bank account). They cannot however change the payment terms unilaterally without notification and acceptance.

The others aren't really clean\\-up either; making graffiti unreadable doesn't remove it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume the underlying premise is that public spaces are open fora for any form of political expression, which is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nUnder the First Amendment, you have the right to express your viewpoint in a public forum. The government can reasonably restrict such expressions to some extent, thus violent riots can be prohibited, and permanent vandalism with spray paint can be banned. Chalk can even be banned. Any bans must, however, be viewpoint\\-neutral.\n\nGovernment protection of public expressions must also be viewpoint\\-neutral, therefore the police cannot elect to de\\-police just one side of an issue (based on viewpoint, as opposed to different conduct of participants). Therefore they must protect protesters coming from one side of an issue from vigilantes from the other side, or protect neither side \u2013 the government cannot favor a particular viewpoint in law enforcement.\n\nChalk is a commonly used expressive medium, and municipalities have massive discretion to ignore it and wait for the next rain to clean it up, or else they may actively intervene to stop and remove such expressions \u2013 in a viewpoint neutral fashion. Furthermore, a municipality may rightfully tolerate voluntary civilian clean\\-up in the aftermath of a political outburst.\n\nThe (remote) possibility exists that the municipality is not viewpoint\\-neutral in protecting public expressions \u2013 preventing vigilante cleanups by one side while encouraging vigilante cleanups by the other side, and that would violate the First Amendment. The First Amendment does not require individuals to be viewpoint\\-neutral, only governments.\n\nYou might imagine that the drawer could file a lawsuit for damages. A possible scenario would be if the municipality set up a controlled and protected space for artistic expressions, somebody \u2013 with permission to create the work \u2013 labors over an elaborate display, and a vandal trashes it. The vandal could be sued. The difference between that and the above scenario is that you have warring ideologies, one involving the application of chalk without permission and the other involving the removal of chalk without permission. The government will not favor just one viewpoint by awarding damages for an unsanctioned expressive action, over another unsanctioned expressive action.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly! Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A public university allows student groups to use sidewalk chalk for expressing their views on campus. Group A creates chalk messages promoting their political stance. Group B, disagreeing with A's message, modifies the chalk drawings by adding their own content and partially erasing some of A's message. The university administration is now considering how to respond. Which of the following actions would be most appropriate and legally sound for the university to take?\n\nA) Remove all chalk messages and ban future chalking to maintain neutrality\nB) Allow Group A to restore their original message and prevent Group B from further modifications\nC) Permit both groups to continue modifying the chalk messages as a form of ongoing dialogue\nD) Remove only Group B's modifications as they interfered with Group A's expression\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario requires analysis of First Amendment principles in the context of a public university, which is considered a government entity. The most legally sound action is to permit both groups to continue their chalk expressions, including modifications, for several reasons:\n\n1. Viewpoint neutrality: As stated in the documentation, the government (in this case, the university) must remain viewpoint-neutral in regulating or protecting speech. Allowing both groups to express their views equally upholds this principle.\n\n2. Public forum doctrine: The university sidewalks, by allowing chalking, have been designated as a limited public forum for student expression. Restricting access based on viewpoint would violate First Amendment protections.\n\n3. Competing expressions: The scenario presents \"warring ideologies\" using the same medium (chalk). The documentation suggests that the government should not favor one unsanctioned expressive action over another.\n\n4. Fostering dialogue: Allowing the ongoing modification of messages promotes the exchange of ideas, which is central to the educational mission of universities and the principles of free speech.\n\nOption A, while viewpoint-neutral, would be an overreaction that unnecessarily limits speech. Option B would improperly favor Group A's speech over Group B's. Option D would improperly restrict Group B's expressive rights and violate viewpoint neutrality.\n\nThis question tests the application of complex First Amendment principles to a real-world scenario, requiring analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and consideration of the unique context of a university setting."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58598/can-you-use-the-raspberry-pi-4-in-your-own-product", "docs_id": 58598, "title": "Can you use the Raspberry Pi 4 in your own product?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose I decided to create a product that used the Pi 4B as it's main processing unit.

This is because Raspbian is based on Linux and includes software licensed under \"copyleft\" licenses like the GPL. These licenses require that users of modified versions be given access to the source code, tools, and documentation needed for building the software.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Raspberry Pi Foundation explicitly states that their products can be used in commercial applications without special permission. Option B is not the most critical action, as MPEG-2 and VC-1 codec licenses are only required for specific use cases and are not mentioned as essential for all products. Option D is not the most important step for compliance, as registering the product design and Node.js code with the patent office does not address the open-source licensing requirements.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including understanding of open-source licensing, commercial use of Raspberry Pi, and software distribution requirements.

I am a student attending a rather large high school in South Carolina. In order to block to youtube, proxies, games, etc., the school has disabled SSL and TLS (secure socket protocol for web security). These are standards for all web browsers (I get a warning on my MAC that there may be an attack on my computer if I even get on their wifi and open Safari), and what is even more scary (and angering) to me is that they have a fake google certificate which they do not inform people of in any way or agreement. I understand that I am a minor and am resigned that I can do nothing about it, but this must illegal. I cannot imagine what the consequences would be if I did the on a private server. The vulnerability is further irresponsible because it leaves people's private data being transferred over the school network (such as private e\\-mail, logins) unsecured and open to packet sniffing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is more than a comment (too long), but not a definitive answer (since I am unfamiliar with the laws regarding this kind of thing). Please forgive me.\n\nFirst, there are some technical misunderstandings. They are not disabling SSL/TLS. Instead, they are inserting themselves in between these connections so they can make sure you aren't accessing material you are not allowed to access. They may actually be required to do this by law.\n\nHere is how it works. Typically when you connect to, say Google.com, you are given a certificate from Google.com that has a trusted chain all the way up to some trusted root. That trusted root is explicitly trusted by your web browser manufacturer. In order to be able to inspect these sorts of connections, security appliances will actually replace the certificate provided by Google.com with one that the appliance provides. It has to pretend to be Google.com so your browser doesn't freak out. The problem is, this certificate is no longer has a trusted chain to something that the browser manufacturer trusts. It is provided by the security appliance. So often, the appliance will have a root certificate that the administrators of the system must install on every machine they control. Then the browsers on these machines will not complain that the certificate is invalid.\n\nObviously, you are getting the error on your own machine because you have not allowed the administrator to install these certificates on your machine. Nor should you. **You should definitely not allow your school's network administrator to install these certificates on your personal computer.**\n\nYou say that \"leaves people's private data being transferred over the school network (such as private e\\-mail, logins) unsecured and open to packet sniffing\". This is not true. Any HTTPS website you visit is encrypted between your computer and the security monitoring appliance using the pretend certificate I mentioned above. Typically then, the traffic is decrypted and inspected by the appliance. Then it is re\\-encrypted using the real certificate, before being pushed out onto the internet. So, only at the security appliance is data turned back into the clear, only to be protected again before going out to the internet.\n\nSo, is this illegal?\n\nWell, I think you would agree that definitely on the computers that your school owns, they can do anything they want with them. The computers belong to them. Furthermore, the network belongs to them. Likely you signed an agreement (or agree to it each time you connect) that they are allowed to monitor your usage of their computers and their network. This includes when connecting your personal machine to **their** network.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A high school in South Carolina has implemented a network security measure to block access to certain websites. A student discovers this and raises concerns about privacy and legality. Which of the following best describes the school's likely approach and its implications?\n\nA) The school has disabled SSL/TLS entirely, leaving all network traffic unencrypted and vulnerable to interception.\nB) The school is using a man-in-the-middle SSL inspection technique, which is illegal and compromises student privacy.\nC) The school has implemented SSL inspection, which is legal on school-owned devices but raises privacy concerns on personal devices.\nD) The school is simply blocking specific IP addresses, which triggers false security warnings on some browsers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The scenario described in the documentation indicates that the school is using SSL inspection, not disabling SSL/TLS entirely. This technique involves intercepting encrypted traffic by inserting a security appliance between the client and the server, replacing the original certificates with ones generated by the appliance. This allows the school to monitor and filter HTTPS traffic.\n\nThis approach is generally legal and common in institutional settings, especially on devices owned by the institution. It's not illegal when applied to school-owned computers and networks, as the school has the right to monitor and control its own resources. However, it does raise privacy concerns, especially when applied to personal devices connected to the school network.\n\nThe student's observation of a \"fake Google certificate\" and browser warnings on their personal device indicates that the school is indeed using this technique. While it doesn't leave data \"unsecured and open to packet sniffing\" as the student fears (the traffic is still encrypted, just with a different certificate), it does allow the school to potentially inspect the contents of encrypted traffic.\n\nOption A is incorrect because SSL/TLS isn't disabled; it's being intercepted and re-encrypted. Option B mischaracterizes the legality of the practice. Option D doesn't align with the described symptoms and wouldn't explain the certificate issues mentioned.\n\nThis question requires the student to analyze the technical details provided, understand the implications of SSL inspection, and apply this knowledge to a real-world scenario involving privacy, legality, and network security in an educational setting."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24827/can-i-take-legal-action-in-colorado-against-a-car-dealership-that-has-yet-to-del", "docs_id": 24827, "title": "Can I take legal action in Colorado against a car dealership that has yet to deliver owed items to me?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I ordered a vehicle from a dealership in July of 2017\\.

Only a tiny share of modern pardons are granted to people who are currently serving sentences for the crimes of which they were convicted or to people who have not yet been convicted of crimes.\n\nMy understanding is that a pardon only effects that you no longer must bear the consequences of a conviction, it does not remove the conviction. Thus I want to ask for clarification on the part where it states that pardoned individuals \"*apply for a job not available to felons, or vote, or get a hunting license and use a firearm*\". I figure the three options are either:\n\n1. I am not entirely correct about what a pardon by the President does.\n2. The prohibitions on felons to applying for jobs not available to felons, voting, get a hunting license and using a firearm are part of the pardon\n3. The statement is not correct.\n\nWhat are the actual legal effects of pardons issued by the President of the United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on your location. A felony conviction can limit your rights in various ways, and those rights may or may not be restored at the state level. See [this article](http://alanellis.com/federal-felony-conviction-collateral-civil-disabilities/) for discussion of federal convictions and collateral civil disabilities. The [Dept. of Justics says](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardon-information-and-instructions) that \"a presidential pardon will restore various rights lost as a result of the pardoned offense and should lessen to some extent the stigma arising from a conviction, it will not erase or expunge the record of your conviction\", and \"most civil disabilities attendant upon a federal felony conviction, such as loss of the right to vote and hold state public office, are imposed by state rather than federal law, and also may be removed by state action\".\n\n[This article](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/pr/195110.pdf) surveys civil disabilities of convicts on a state by state basis, as well as at the federal level. For example, voting rights are set at the state level, so a state has to have statutes restoring rights upon a pardon if you are to get your voting rights back. Service on a federal jury would be restored per [28 USC 1865(b)(5\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1865); the federal felon in possession crime has [an exception encoded in it](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921) in the definition of \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" which says\n\n> What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in\n>  accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings\n>  were held.\n>  Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a\n>  person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be\n>  considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter, unless such\n>  pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides\n>  that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\n\nSo if you are a state felon, you need a state pardon (or other state procedure) and if you are a federal felon, a state pardon does no good, you need a federal pardon. However, [21 USC 862](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/862) makes mandatory the ineligibility for federal benefits after a third conviction for drug trafficking (either state of federal law), and there is no \"rights restoration\" clause that restores such rights after a pardon even if the convictions are all federal. I have not located any case law establishing whether federal benefits rights restoration for federal convictions flows automatically from a federal pardon (not many 3\\-time drug dealers get federal pardons). A federal felony conviction can also be used as a factor in granting a security clearance (applicable to certain jobs), and current law does not say that a pardoned conviction *cannot* be considered in deciding on a clearance.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about presidential pardons and their effects, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A federal felon who has received a presidential pardon is considering their restored rights and future opportunities.

The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced reality of presidential pardons. While a pardon does have significant effects, it doesn't automatically or universally restore all rights.\n\nKey points supporting this answer:\n1. The pardon does not expunge the record, contradicting option B.\n2. Restoration of rights like voting are often set at the state level, not automatically restored by a federal pardon, which contradicts option A.\n3. Some federal rights may be restored (e.g., serving on a federal jury), but others (like eligibility for certain federal benefits after multiple drug convictions) may not be, contradicting option D.\n4. State-level rights often require separate state action for restoration, even after a federal pardon.\n5. The pardon's effect on security clearance eligibility is not absolute, as pardoned convictions may still be considered.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to understand the complex interplay between federal and state laws, the limitations of presidential pardons, and the nuanced nature of rights restoration.

Basically, the 4th amendment (as far as searches goes) does not apply to things that are publicly observable; while this would protect a literal \"search history\" compilation (baring a reasonable search), the searches themselves are public queries, broadcasted over the internet.

The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced reality of the situation:\n\n1. Both D1 and D2 can indeed argue that D3's actions broke the chain of causation, as stated in the documentation. This is because D3's potential negligence occurred after both D1 and D2's involvement and could be seen as an intervening cause.\n\n2. However, their arguments cannot be identical copies.

Or even the customs officer, who may loathe the silent treatment?\n\nAfterword: I ask the above for Canada, USA, and UK.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When you refer to customs, that necessarily denotes travel to a foreign county, such that each county will have their own laws, rules, and regulations that govern these issues. It is more than likely that if you refuse to answer the questions of customs officials in ANY country, you will be denied admittance. The same is true if you refuse or balk at being searched (personally or your possessions), and keep in mind that this is without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The best thing to do is to answer the questions honestly and accurately, but also as narrowly as possible to completely answer. Trying to argue with them will only send up red flags and you will be there longer. Remember it is a privilege, not a right, to enter a sovereign nation of which you are not a citizen.\n\nFor example, in the U.S., customs reserves the right to detain for questioning, search you, your car, your children, your bags, packages, purse/wallet, or any other travel item with full legal authority to do sol they can even examine your electronics (content and hardware). You place your stuff on the exam station and open it. (After the exam is completed, you will be asked to repack and close the baggage.) If you are unhappy with the way you are being treated, you do have the right to ask to speak to a CBP supervisor, but I cannot see anything good coming of it, unless they were super rude without provocation or broke something of value.\n\nThe authority to delay and speak with travelers derives from the United States Code (section citations below) enables CBP to prevent the entry of persons who are inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and to prevent the smuggling of merchandise, including narcotics and other contraband items, into the United States.\n\nSpeaking with travelers and examining merchandise coming into or leaving the United States is just one of the mechanisms used to identify illegal or prohibited items, and to determine whether or not someone is trying to enter the U.S. for unlawful or fraudulent purposes. Unless exempt by diplomatic status, all travelers entering the United States, including U.S. citizens, are subjected to routine Customs examinations. At times, people make the mistake of thinking their civil rights are being violated by being asked questions about their trip, personal background and history, etc. That is not the case. Supreme Court decisions have upheld the doctrine that CBP's search authority is unique and does not violate the fourth amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nU.S. Customs website has a detailed Q\\&A section.

The traveler considers exercising their right to remain silent. Which of the following best describes the potential consequences and legal implications of this action?\n\nA) The traveler can safely refuse to answer without any adverse consequences, as the Fifth Amendment protects their right to remain silent.\nB) The traveler can remain silent, but this may lead to denial of entry, even if a court later determines the questioning was overly intrusive.\nC) The traveler must answer all questions or face immediate arrest, as customs officials have unlimited authority to interrogate non-citizens.\nD) The traveler can selectively answer questions, and customs officials are legally required to admit them after a maximum 24-hour detention period.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the complex interplay between individual rights and the broad authority of customs officials. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"if you refuse to answer the questions of customs officials in ANY country, you will be denied admittance.\" This directly supports the potential consequence of denial of entry.\n\n2. The answer reflects the reality that customs officials have extensive authority that may supersede some rights typically associated with law enforcement encounters.

It acknowledges the traveler's ability to remain silent, which is technically a right, but also the practical consequences of exercising this right in the specific context of border entry.\n\n4. The phrase \"even if a court later determines the questioning was overly intrusive\" reflects the complex legal landscape, where immediate practical consequences (denial of entry) may occur regardless of later legal determinations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Fifth Amendment exists, its practical application at the border is limited, especially for non-citizens.

The correct answer, C, addresses the key legal concerns mentioned in the documentation. A written contract is crucial, as explicitly stated: \"You need a written contract.\" This contract should specifically cover work-for-hire terms, ensuring that the creator owns the copyright to the artwork, and explicitly grant commercial usage rights.

FWIW I do not employ or hire people. If I did I'd be talking to my lawyer.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This law regulates employers, and New York City only has jurisdiction over employers in New York City, so this law would not protect residents of New York City seeking employment outside of New York City.\n\nGenerally speaking, the law of a jurisdiction can only apply to someone who has \"personally availed themselves\" of the benefits of operating in that jurisdiction such that it is foreseeable that they would be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction. An employer not operating in New York City seeking employees at large wouldn't meet that requirement. While this concept is usually applied in the context of the personal jurisdiction of a court, it is also not irrelevant to choice of law questions.\n\nAs with any law, there are edge cases that could be challenging in which the applicability of the law could be unclear. \n\nFor example, it isn't clear whether this rule would or would not apply to an employer looking for an employee in its Chicago office (e.g. working for the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange)) that conducts interviews and makes hiring decisions for the job at a job fair intended for NYU Alumni that is conducted at its New York City campus, even though it doesn't have offices for the conduct of its primary business in New York City and the staff conducting the job fair are based in Chicago. It might. \n\nBut, suppose that the law did apply to the conduct of the employer at the job fair.

Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A multinational corporation with offices in New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco is hiring for a remote position. The hiring manager, based in Chicago, conducts video interviews with candidates from various locations, including New York City residents. During the interview process, the manager asks about salary history. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) The law applies only if the candidate is a New York City resident, regardless of the employer's location\nB) The law applies because the company has an office in New York City, regardless of where the hiring manager is located\nC) The law likely applies due to the company's presence in New York City, but there may be jurisdictional complexities\nD) The law does not apply because the hiring manager is not physically in New York City\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario presents a complex jurisdictional issue that tests the boundaries of the New York City salary history law. The correct answer is C because it acknowledges both the likely applicability of the law and the potential legal complexities involved.\n\nThe law primarily regulates employers operating within New York City's jurisdiction, rather than protecting specific residents. The multinational corporation has offices in New York City, which means it has \"personally availed\" itself of the benefits of operating in the city's jurisdiction. This suggests that the law would likely apply to its hiring practices, even for remote positions.\n\nHowever, the situation is complicated by several factors:\n1. The hiring manager is based in Chicago, outside of NYC's jurisdiction.\n2. The position is remote, not specifically tied to any one office location.\n3. The interviews are conducted via video, not physically in New York City.\n\nThese factors create jurisdictional complexities that could potentially be challenged in court. While the company's presence in NYC suggests the law should apply, the remote nature of the position and the Chicago-based hiring manager introduce ambiguity.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they oversimplify the jurisdictional issue. The law is not solely based on candidate residency or company presence in NYC. Option D is likely incorrect because it ignores the company's established presence in NYC, which is a crucial factor in determining jurisdiction.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the law's focus on employers, the principle of \"personally availing\" oneself to a jurisdiction, and the potential for edge cases in application of the law.

The normal maximum to hold someone is 18 months, so we are well past that.\n\nCan the courts hold someone indefinitely for contempt of court?\nWhen would this situation be considered 'cruel and unusual' punishment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can the courts hold someone indefinitely for contempt of court?\n\nYes. This is civil contempt which is imposed to compel compliance with a court order that the disobedient person has the ability to comply with, rather than criminal contempt which is limited to a set time period to punish disrespect for the Court in an instance that is over and complete.\n\nOften, it is eventually vacated on the grounds of futility (i.e. it is clear that further incarceration will not secure compliance) or mootness (e.g. when a witness refuses to testify in a trial and then the trial is completed). In the case of government officials who refuse to comply to an order directed to them in an official capacity, the government official can be released forthwith by resigning from their official post.\n\nLong periods of detention for civil contempt are most common for cases like this where someone refuses to provide the location of something of great value, or in asset protection trust type cases involving millions of dollars worth of assets where the detained person refuses to disclose hidden assets or to take the steps necessary to cause them to be turned over to a creditor or ex\\-spouse, and the Court has determined that the person detained is capable of doing so. Less often, it is done for quite a long time in cases involving national security secrets.\n\nPersons held in civil contempt also have fewer due process protections than persons charged with indirect criminal contempt which is just a procedurally unusual form of crime (direct criminal contempt is even more procedurally unusual and involves less due process, the person held in direct criminal contempt can be jailed or fined for a set period of time summarily by a judge without a hearing for disrespectful conduct in the judge's physical presence with only a brief few seconds opportunity to speak up for himself or herself without a right to counsel in response before being punished).\n\n> When would this situation be considered 'cruel and unusual'\n> punishment?\n\nNo. Cruel and unusual punishment applies to punishment for wrongdoing. Civil contempt isn't designed to punish wrongdoing. It is calculated to secure compliance going forward with a lawful court order with which the person incarcerated has the ability to comply.\n\nIn a case of civil contempt, a fundamental principle is that the person detained, who has refused to comply with a court order that the person has the ability to comply with and does so without lawful justification, \"holds the key to the jail\" and can be released forthwith upon complying with the Court's order at any time.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A high-profile defendant has been held in civil contempt for 3 years for refusing to disclose the location of valuable assets related to a court case.

Which of the following best represents the legal principle that allows for this extended detention?\n\nA) The defendant's detention is justified as criminal contempt punishment for disrespecting the court's authority.\nB) The \"cruel and unusual punishment\" clause limits detention for civil contempt to a maximum of 18 months.\nC) The defendant \"holds the key to the jail\" and can be released immediately upon complying with the court order.\nD) Extended detention is permissible only if the assets in question are related to national security.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of civil contempt principles and their application in complex, real-world scenarios. The correct answer is C because the documentation clearly states that in cases of civil contempt, the detained person \"holds the key to the jail\" and can be released at any time by complying with the court order. This principle allows for indefinite detention in civil contempt cases, unlike criminal contempt which has time limits.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the scenario describes civil contempt, not criminal contempt. Civil contempt is used to compel compliance, not to punish disrespect.\n\nOption B is a distractor that confuses the 18-month limit mentioned in the question context with a non-existent constitutional limit. The documentation does not indicate any such limit for civil contempt.\n\nOption D is partially true but overly specific.

First off, does the \"Google's TOS\" actually mean it's for the Google company as a whole, or is this just for the search engine? They mention user accounts, which is part of their core to the ecosystem of Google Apps and such (Gmail, etc.), so what exactly is this TOS for? When do you agree to this?\n\nSecond, if the \"Google's TOS\" is all you need, why do you have the Chrome TOS? Do you need a TOS for every product you create?

If you use Chrome, you have to comply with all the terms in both documents, except where the Chrome TOS specifically overrides the company TOS.\n\nPresumably they found it inconvenient to have separate documents for all their many services, so they wrote a generic document that would be appropriate for most of them, and then they supplement this with specific documents when individual services need something special.\n\nFor your own apps, you'd have to decide, based on your business needs and in consultation with your lawyers, which of these two models makes the most sense for you.

It also mentions that \"additional terms or product requirements\" may apply to specific services, which are provided separately.\n\nThis strategy offers several advantages:\n\n1. It provides a consistent baseline of terms across all products, ensuring core company policies are uniformly applied.\n2.

For example, an adult asthmatic may be fine 95% of the time, but if they were just visiting a friend's house where several cats and dogs live, they may have a brief, minor issue with \"shortness of breath\" or \"wheezing\".\n\nAnd it gets worse if they have OCD and are analytical. An individual like that might, for example, notice that their breathing is 99%, not 100%.

On the other hand though, they are also ***chronic***.\n\nNow, I want to highlight this: Common sense is common sense, and normally these signs would be ignored. However, if we use the example above about the cats and dogs, the asthmatic might cough a couple of times, which would be noticeable; but in this case, it does not suggest COVID, and the problem is something that is ***chronic***. And while that's a temporary matter, they may be very *slightly* \"short of the breath\" all the time.\n\nDespite being practically everywhere, *were/are these signs and rules illegally discriminating against a large swath of the population with common, chronic, and non\\-contagious conditions?*\n\nTo the extent a specific country is required, let's use the US and regulations like the ADA, though I'd be interested to hear about other countries as well.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nThe currently accepted answer (as of 2021\\-7\\-23, at which point it was the only answer) was a little hard for me to follow at first, because I believe there was some context I didn't see initially. Without that context, the rationale and flow behind the answer didn't seem to follow logically. In particular, when it was mentioned that people are expected to know the law, usually I think of that as mainly applying to the offender, as opposed to the victim. An offender can always still say or do something illegally though, and a victim's knowledge or ignorance of the law doesn't grant the offender a free pass to impede their rights. However with the proper context, the answer does seem to follow.\n\nI could be misinterpreting something, but per a few comments back and forth, I think this is a rough paraphrase/summary, context included:\n\n> Basically the dividing line is a matter of how clearly the alleged offender is addressing the alleged victim. In the case of a typical COVID sign, there's typically supposed to be context that the sign doesn't apply to people who just have things like asthma, unless, for example, a store employee actually addresses the individuals directly. Therefore it is not clearly and unambiguously barring them for symptoms clearly attributable to asthma (or whatever the condition is).

However a \"Please do not enter if you are \\<race/color/ethnicity X\\>\" sign, for example, is illegal, because even in the proper context, it is still quite clear it applies to the people literally mentioned.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have to start with the pertinent [ADA regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&SID=2ab2aab2d3d2fd0f544a5ce7aad8f04c&rgn=div5&view=text&node=28:1.0.1.1.37&idno=28), 28 CFR Part 36, and esp. subpart B which gets to the prohibition. Under \u00a736\\.201(a),\n\n> No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of\n> disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services,\n> facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of\n> public accommodation by any private entity who owns, leases (or leases\n> to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\n\nAfter that under activities, it is stated that\n\n> A public accommodation shall not subject an individual or class of\n> individuals on the basis of a disability or disabilities of such\n> individual or class, directly, or through contractual, licensing, or\n> other arrangements, to a denial of the opportunity of the individual\n> or class to participate in or benefit from the goods, services,\n> facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of\n> public accommodation.\n\nand also\n\n> A public accommodation shall not afford an individual or class of\n> individuals, on the basis of a disability or disabilities of such\n> individual or class, directly, or through contractual, licensing, or\n> other arrangements, with the opportunity to participate in or benefit\n> from a good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation\n> that is not equal to that afforded to other individuals.\n\nmoreover \"separate but equal\" is not allowed.\n\nThe sign does not articulate any denial of opportunity, so that should be the end of the discussion. OTOH I suspect that a sign saying \"Please do not enter this store if you are white\" would be held to be discriminatory, as an indirect denial of permission to enter based on race.\n\n\u00a736\\.208 introduces two important exceptions. First,\n\n> This part does not require a public accommodation to permit an\n> individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services,\n> facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of that public\n> accommodation when that individual poses a direct threat to the health\n> or safety of others.\n\nThat means that (irrespective of the fact that covid is not a legal disability) it is legal to exclude direct threats to the health of others. And furthermore,\n\n> In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the\n> health or safety of others, a public accommodation must make an\n> individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on\n> current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence,\n> to ascertain: The nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the\n> probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether\n> reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures or the\n> provision of auxiliary aids or services will mitigate the risk.\n\nBased on reasonable medical judgment and innumerable official government proclamations, it is reasonable to believe that a person with covid symptoms pose a threat to public health. The law doesn't require you to be omniscient and actually know that customer A has covid and customer B has asthma. \u00a736\\.301 then says more about possible screening requirements.\n\nIt is generally expected that everybody knows the law and will follow the law: ignorance of the law is no excuse, nor is it a cause for a discrimination claim. It would not be legal to exclude a person from a public accommodation when they pose no threat to public health. The customer with asthma is expected to know this law, and is expected to not infer incorrectly that the sign implies that he is being illegally excluded. The customer with covid is also expected to know this law, and is expected to know that it refers to him \u2013 as is allowed under the law.\n\nPotentially illegal discrimination enters the picture once actual exclusion happens, getting you back to \"individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment\".

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this situation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?\n\nA) The sign is inherently discriminatory and violates the ADA, as it could discourage individuals with non-contagious chronic conditions from entering.\nB) The business owner is required to perform an individual assessment of each customer's symptoms before allowing or denying entry.\nC) The sign is likely compliant with ADA regulations, provided the business doesn't actually exclude individuals whose symptoms are clearly attributable to known non-contagious conditions.\nD) The business owner must modify the sign to explicitly exclude chronic conditions to avoid potential ADA violations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This situation requires analysis of multiple concepts from ADA regulations. The sign itself does not articulate a denial of opportunity, which is a key factor in determining discrimination under the ADA. The regulations allow businesses to exclude individuals who pose a direct threat to public health, based on reasonable judgment and current medical knowledge. \n\nThe critical point is that the mere presence of the sign does not constitute discrimination.

The law expects both the business owner and customers to understand this nuance.\n\nThe sign reflects a reasonable attempt to protect public health during a pandemic, which is allowed under \u00a736.208 of the ADA regulations. However, the business is still required to make individualized assessments when actually enforcing this policy. This means they shouldn't automatically exclude someone with asthma-related breathing difficulties if it's clear the symptoms are not due to a contagious illness.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they assume the sign itself is discriminatory, which isn't the case under ADA regulations.

Maybe jurisdiction doesn't much matter here, let's consider a typical civil country).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nIn the US, the default rule is that your home is your castle. In general, nobody, not even the police, can enter your home without your permission. The main exception to this rule is that police do not need your permission if they have a search warrant to search your home. To get a warrant, the police must convince a magistrate that they have good reason (ie, \"probable cause\"), such as a gps track, to believe they will find evidence of a crime if they search the house.\n\nThe police in your hypothetical are in a similar situation to police who are tracking the gps signal from a \"[bait car](http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vol128_Joh.pdf)/bike/phone/tablet/package.\" (A bait car is a car/etc that has been fitted with a camera and gps tracker, and left out as bait for thieves.)\n\nAs long as the car is in public view, the police do not need a warrant to search it and arrest the person driving it. However, once the bait car is out of public view, where the police can no longer see it, they need a warrant to go in and recover it, even if they can see it on the tracker. (See, for example, the instructions for bait car programs from the [Eugene](https://www.eugene-or.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5186) and [Reno](http://www.renopd.com/content/gen_ord/S-270-09%20Bait%20Vehicle%20Operations.pdf) Police Departments.)\n\n(For phones, which may not be in \"plain view\" even if the thief is, the police use ring programs to make the phone ring. Hearing a phone respond to a ring program gives them probable cause under the \"hearing\" version of the \"plain view\" doctrine.)\n\nBottom line: In the US, the police need a search warrant. Since search warrants take time and effort, police may be unwilling to get a warrant for something as low valued as a phone.\n\nIf the police can't or won't help, there are various options for privately enforcing one's rights.

The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate and legally sound action because:\n\n1. It respects the legal requirement for a search warrant, which is necessary to enter a private residence without permission, even if stolen property is suspected to be inside.\n\n2.

Statute law which consists of the Acts passed by the legislature\n2.

Judges (if they are wise) never give opinions on the law \\- that is the role of solicitors and barristers who are the paid advocates of the parties.\n\nThe role of a judge is to decide how the law fits the circumstances of the particular case before them. To do this they interpret the statutes, administrative rules and decisions made by other judges on similar cases. The decision of a superior court is binding on a subordinate court, persuasive on an equivalent court or a court in a parallel jurisdiction and subject to review by a superior court.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of cases **do not** make new case law \\- most of the arguments in court are about why (or why not) the established law applies to the current facts; they are not about what the law **is**.\n\nOccasionally a decision will be made that modifies the previous interpretation or even more rarely represents a paradigm shift \\- those are the cases that matter!", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly!

You'll notice that I made it $875 this month. This is because we have not yet moved the cats into the apartment and don't think they'll be coming within the next month or so. We will let you know when we bring them and pay cat rent accordingly. Don't worry about the first 2 months' cat rent. Thanks, \"name\"\n\nTheir reply (text message. Apparently they didn't see the email):\n\n> Hi \"name\". I just wanted to let you know that I received $875 for rent payment, but there is another $40 due. To avoid late fees, please check to make sure this third payment is made. Have a good weekend.\n\nOur reply: mention email and repeat (basically copy\\-paste) what the email said.\n\nTheir reply:\n\n> Hello \"name\", thank you for you message. First, I did not receive an email yesterday about this, so I don't have the information contained in it, I'm not sure what happended to it, but feel free to send it again. Second, I can understand that there may be some confusion about this, but I hope you can understand that the pet rent is very much rent just like the main rental amount. There isn't really any flexibility in paying one month or another based on the pets being in the home or not. Just as you would be responsible for rent, even if you were out of town for a month or two, you are still responsible for the pet rent, even if they have not moved in yet. Again, I would be happy to review the email, if you would send it again, but the full rental amount is due today.\n\nThen, we paid the $40 so we didn't potentially get charged a late fee. It feels as though we're getting held hostage a little for this just because we're young (early 20's). We tried to be courteous by even allowing them to keep the previous unnecessary payments, hoping they'd show the same reasonable courtesy, but I suppose not.\n\nCan a landlord legally charge for pet rent even when no pets are present in the apartment? Should I take this to court and get a lawyer? The lease was signed with the impression that the $40 would only be necessary if we brought pets. It also sounds like if we never mentioned pets until, say, 6 months in, they would charge us pet rent for the previous 6 months even though the pets were not present.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can a landlord legally charge for pet rent even when no pets are\n>  present in the apartment?\n\nYes. Absent any indication in the lease that your cats would not move in immediately, the landlord is right.\n\nI assume that your lease reflects mutual knowledge of your intent to bring your cats over (via a marked checkbox or in \"*d) Pet1 Details: ... Pet 2 Details ...*\"). If so, according to the lease, you officially have pets in the apartment. To avoid being charged unnecessarily, you should have (1\\) ensured that the contract reflects the intended delay regarding your cats, or (2\\) asked the landlord to amend the lease once it is imminent that you will bring your pets over.\n\nOne or multiple administrative reasons justify a landlord to charge pet fees even if there are no pets in the apartment. For instance, the landlord might need to notify his insurer whenever an additional rental unit will host pets, thereby resulting in adjustments to a premium. Likewise, the number of pets might be a factor when a cleaning company bills the landlord.\n\n> The lease was signed with the impression that the $40 would only be\n>  necessary if we brought pets.\n\nHence the relevance of determining whether or not the lease objectively reflects that you notified the landlord of your intention to bring pets and, if so, *when* it would become effective. If the latter is not specified, it defaults to the start date of the lease.\n\n> It also sounds like if we never mentioned pets until, say, 6 months\n>  in, they would charge us pet rent for the previous 6 months even\n>  though the pets were not present.\n\nIt depends. If the landlord \"busted\" you, then he could sanction you in accordance with the terms of the lease. Instead, if you subsequently requested an amendment to the lease, then the landlord would only charge you from the date you officially bring the pets. But the *effective* date needs to be reflected in the lease/amendment.\n\n> Should I take this to court and get a lawyer?\n\nNo. First, for the reasons I mentioned above. Second, because lawyers want money, and they will detect right away that there is really not much to recover in a controversy like this one. Third, because complaining about a relatively small amount ($40/month) tells the lawyer that he or she won't get much money from you either (and lawyers want your money). And fourth, because the yearly total of pet fees indicates that the matter would have to be filed in Small Claims Court, where \\-\\-if I am not wrong\\-\\- parties are not allowed to be represented by counsel.\n\nGoing to court is not \"peanuts\". Even if your were allowed \\-\\-and you managed\\-\\- to retain a lawyer, you would end up paying so much in attorney fees to someone who might not be forthcoming, let alone diligent.

Let me give two possible scenarios to illustrate:\n\n*(A) I create a Youtube video about, for instance, a particular language. I want to analyze it and I use a theoretical approach developed in the published writings by Smith (1980, 1991, \u2026) \\[author invented for the purpose of being explicit].

You are free to (indeed expected to) provide citations of factual and theoretical sources; you are free to use the ideas and facts reported or expressed in those works. The title of a book, year of publication, authors name and all the other things that go into a citation are not creative elements, so are not protected by copyright. Addressing example (A) in particular, you are entitled to use all of the the language data provided, as long as they are not creative literary texts (this would be a concern for a work on syntax that is based on texts, if the texts are still in copyright \u2013 this potentially includes elicited texts).\n\nAlthough the words of the source publications can be reproduced because they are not, individually, protected, the arrangement of the words, e.g. in a grammatical paradigm, can be. In that case, the issue is whether the particular presentation is \"creative\" and novel to the source author, or is it a purely mechanical product directly reflecting the facts (or, reflects a long\\-standing tradition used by all authors on the topic).\n\nNeedless to say, direct copying of book pages is potentially infringing, though a small amount of copying can be defended under \"fair use\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about fair use in YouTube videos, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A popular YouTuber creates a series of educational videos on linguistic theories, citing and discussing the work of several prominent linguists.

Option C is the most likely to pose a copyright infringement risk because recreating and animating original diagrams without permission could be considered a derivative work, which is protected by copyright. \n\nOptions A and D are generally considered fair use, as they involve discussing ideas and theories without directly copying content. These practices are standard in academic discourse and typically extend to educational content on platforms like YouTube. \n\nOption B, while potentially riskier than A and D, could still fall under fair use if the excerpts are brief and used for purposes of commentary or criticism. The inclusion of proper attribution and a fair use disclaimer further strengthens this position.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the principles of fair use, the distinction between ideas and expression in copyright law, and the application of these concepts to real-world scenarios in digital media.

Police power is almost always exercised by the legislature, and when the executive exercises it (e.g. by issuing regulations) it's typically operating under conditions set by the legislature.\n\nThe United States has police power in a few situations: DC, federal property and territories, US\\-flagged ships on the high seas, etc. Outside of those situations, the United States instead has enumerated powers. Congress has a power to tax and spend to promote the general welfare, but otherwise it can only legislate to achieve one of the enumerated powers in the Constitution. Now, courts have read Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce very broadly, but there does need to be *some* relation to enumerated powers.\n\n---\n\nYou're asking about the Capitol Police, but they don't have \"police power\" in the 10th Amendment sense. They have the power to carry guns and to arrest people for crimes committed against the United States. This power is limited based on geography and/or the nature of their task; for instance, they have nationwide arrest powers \"\\[i]n the performance of their protective duties,\" but not when they're traveling outside DC on other official duties (e.g. to attend training).\n\nWhile there's no litigation I can dig up that's *directly* on point, courts have repeatedly ruled that Congress has the power to do some not\\-entirely\\-legislative tasks in order to protect its own functions. For instance, in *Anderson v. Dunn* (1821\\), the Supreme Court upheld an inherent power of the House to hold private citizens in contempt of Congress for disobeying its subpoenas and for the Sergeant at Arms to arrest them and bring them before the House. It seems likely Congress would also have the authority to protect its own members from physical violence. The GAO [did an analysis](https://www.gao.gov/products/b-317742) when it was analyzing whether there was a constitutional problem with making Capitol Police IG personnel into special deputy US marshals, and it concluded that there was no issue with congressional employees exercising arrest powers in order to physically protect the legislative branch.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A federal agency is planning to establish a nationwide protection unit for members of Congress.

The Capitol Police already have nationwide arrest powers \"in the performance of their protective duties,\" which is a limited scope tied directly to their function of protecting Congress.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it would likely exceed the enumerated powers of the federal government by creating a broad, unrestricted nationwide police force, which is not supported by the current constitutional interpretation.\n\nOption B goes too far by expanding arrest powers for all crimes against Congress members, which extends beyond the protective duties mentioned in the existing statute and constitutional analysis.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it misapplies the interstate commerce clause. While Congress has broad power under this clause, delegating federal protection duties to state and local agencies would not fit within this framework and would likely violate principles of federalism.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about the balance between federal and state powers, the scope of enumerated powers, and the specific constitutional justification for protecting the legislative branch.

The correct answer is C because using someone else's license plate tabs is not just a simple registration violation.

As stated in the documentation, \"if you can prove independent authorship, there cannot be liability no matter how similar your work is to the prior work.\" Proof that Sarah was living in a remote area without internet access during her writing process would strongly suggest she had no access to the older work, making it more likely that her similar plot was a result of independent creation rather than copying.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a consistent writing style doesn't prove lack of access to the other work or independent creation of the plot.\n\nOption C might seem plausible, but editorial suggestions don't negate the possibility that the original draft was copied, and this doesn't address the core issue of access and independent creation.\n\nOption D focuses on output similarities and differences, which can be circumstantial evidence, but is less strong than proof of no access.

The validity of the Section 21 notice depends on whether there's a break clause in the contract allowing early termination. Without seeing the full contract, we can't be certain.\n\n2. The notice's wording \"after November 16, 2015\" is ambiguous and could mean any time up to the end of the fixed term on December 15, 2015, or beyond.\n\n3.

A geographical community-based cooperative focusing on local development is explicitly mentioned as an acceptable form of membership restriction.\n\n3. Option A could potentially violate human rights laws by being overly restrictive and discriminatory based on lifestyle choices.\n\n4. Option C limits membership to employees of specific companies, which doesn't align with the community-wide focus of the proposed cooperative and may be too restrictive.\n\n5. Option D, while related to the cooperative's mission, could be seen as an unreasonable barrier to entry and potentially discriminatory.\n\n6. Option B aligns with the concept of a \"community cooperative\" mentioned in the question, and uses a geographical boundary as a membership criterion, which is likely to be considered reasonable and non-discriminatory under cooperative laws.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal concepts to a practical scenario, requiring integration of multiple ideas from the documentation and critical thinking about the implications of different membership structures."}, "92": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29486/public-trespass", "docs_id": 29486, "title": "Public Trespass", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The Town Adminstrator of my town has issued a NO TRESPASS order on me personally.

Is this against my civil rights?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What do you mean by \"a public building\"? \n\nJust because a place is owned by the public, doesn't mean anyone can go there any time they wish. Military bases, firehouses, and jails are owned by the public, but many of these have limited access to the public.\n\nIt may be open to the general public, but that does not mean restrictions cannot be put into place, either on times, or activities, or individuals. For example, public parks often have time and activity restrictions; schools have the power to restrict individuals from their premises, either specifically or by general category.\n\nAs a general point of law, the owner of any property, or their agent, can order anyone without the right to stay (e.g. not a co\\-owner or tenant), and that person must depart, otherwise that person is tresspassing. Assuming that the Senior Center is owned by the town, it is probable that the Administrator is empowered to act as the town's agent in this matter.\n\nNow, since this \"No Trespass order\" is specifically directed at you, there is a reason behind it. It may be something you've done. It may be that complaints have been received about your behavior. It may be an actual abuse by someone who doesn't like you. We have no way of knowing. It the order itself doesn't give you a hint as to why, you can ask the town administrator for the reason.\n\nAs for being against your rights, there is nothing inherently illegal about this situation(that is, an agent of a property owner exercising the latter's right to prohibit an individual from said property), but some of the details, especially why it was specifically applied to you as an individual might be a civil rights violation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A community activist has been frequenting a town's Senior Center for years without incident. Recently, the Town Administrator issued a personal No Trespass order against the activist, barring them from the Senior Center grounds and building. The activist believes this violates their civil rights as it's a \"public building.\" Which of the following best analyzes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The No Trespass order is inherently illegal because the Senior Center is publicly owned and must remain accessible to all citizens at all times.\n\nB) The order is likely legal, but the Town Administrator must provide a detailed justification for singling out this individual to avoid potential discrimination claims.\n\nC) The activist has an absolute right to challenge the order in court, and it will automatically be overturned as a violation of First Amendment rights.\n\nD) The order may be legal, but its validity depends on factors such as the Town Administrator's authority, the reason for the ban, and whether proper procedures were followed.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their real-world application. The correct answer, D, reflects the nuanced nature of the situation:\n\n1. Public ownership doesn't guarantee unrestricted access. As the documentation states, \"Just because a place is owned by the public, doesn't mean anyone can go there any time they wish.\"\n\n2. The legality of the order depends on several factors:\n   - The Town Administrator's authority to act as an agent for the property owner (the town)\n   - The existence of a valid reason for the ban, which may or may not be discriminatory\n   - Adherence to proper procedures in issuing the order\n\n3. While the order isn't inherently illegal, its specific application to an individual could potentially raise civil rights concerns, depending on the circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the concept of public property access. Option B goes too far by stating the Administrator must provide a detailed justification, which may not be legally required. Option C is incorrect because it overstates the guarantee of a successful legal challenge and misapplies First Amendment protections.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and avoid common misconceptions about public property and individual rights."}, "93": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80156/can-i-legally-take-liability-from-a-previous-tenant-what-are-the-limitations-of", "docs_id": 80156, "title": "Can I legally take liability from a previous tenant? What are the limitations of this?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a question regarding tenancy laws in the UK.\n\nI took over the tenancy for the place that my dad was living in as I needed somewhere to go in an emergency. I didn't have a deposit so my dad told the landlord to keep his deposit. The landlord didn't bother inspecting the property when my dad moved out, instead he asked me to sign a contract stating that I would take liability for the state of the property \\- I signed this since it was my dad's deposit anyway and I needed to move out ASAP.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed about the property was that the carpets are in disrepair. There are stains, frays and matted areas all over. It is impossible to keep feet or socks clean and the dirt from the carpets is enough to permanently stain socks. I started wearing flip\\-flops indoors as a hygienic solution.\n\nSince the carpets are in disrepair, I sent an email to the landlord asking for him to replace the carpets. The landlord's response was that it must be a cleaning issue and therefore he will not be replacing the carpets.\n\nMy dad lived in the property for 5 years and did not once clean the carpets. I wouldn't be surprised if he barely used a vacuum cleaner in that time either. That being said, the landlord said that the carpets were \"like new\" when my dad moved in. I have been here for 8 months now. This means the carpets are likely around 6 years old.\n\nMy dad is disabled and was paying for rent with disabled benefits. My brother and his girlfriend lived with him for a few years and I lived with them all for about a year. This means there was probably substantial wear \\& tear to consider on the carpets (which span the entire house except for the bathroom, which is lino).\n\nIn addition to all of the above, when I mentioned the carpets to the landlord during an inspection, he said \"We have already noted the carpets. We will replace them after you've left.\" This to me says both that they were aware they needed replacing *before* I signed the contract to transfer liability, and that they recognise that they need replacing.\n\nMy questions are as follow:\n\n1. Should the landlord not replace the carpets regardless of the situation, since they are presumably at the end of their lifespan and they have practically admitted that they need replacing?\n2. Just how much liability have I taken over from my dad? Is it even possible for someone *without* a disability to take liability from someone *with* a disability?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm going to take different view to @DaleM and say you cannot take liability for damage caused by a previous tenant, notwithstanding that you purported to agree to that.\n\nI know you stated that you \"took over the tenancy\" but I'll start with the assumption that what you mean is that you signed a new tenancy agreement with the landlord (containing a clause agreeing to be liable for past damage), as this is by far the most common scenario in practice. I'll then examine the alternative scenario. I've asked in the comments for you to clarify how you entered into the tenancy agreement.\n\nNew tenancy agreement\n---------------------\n\nIn a new tenancy agreement, you *cannot* take liability from a previous tenant in [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\"), due to the provisions of the [Tenant Fees Act 2019](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/4/contents). I'm open to being convinced otherwise if anyone has an alternative interpretation of those provisions.\n\nA landlord must not require a tenant to make a prohibited payment:\n\n> **Section 1(1\\)**: A landlord must not require a relevant person to make a prohibited payment to the landlord in connection with a tenancy\n> of housing in England.\n> \n> \n> **Section 1(9\\)**: In this Act \u201crelevant person\u201d means \u2014 (a) a tenant, \\[...]\n\nThe starting point is that *all* payments are prohibited. Exceptions to this are then listed in Schedule 1 of the Act. If it's in the Schedule, you can require payment; if it isn't, you can't.\n\n> **Section 3(1\\):** For the purposes of this Act a payment is a prohibited payment unless it is a permitted payment by virtue of\n> Schedule 1\\.\n\nPayment for damages relating to breach of contract is permitted:\n\n> **Schedule 1, Paragraph 5**: A payment of damages for breach of a tenancy agreement or an agreement between a letting agent and a\n> relevant person is a permitted payment.\n\nIn a typical tenancy agreement, failure to return the property in the condition you found it (allowing for fair wear and tear) is a breach of contract. Hence, it is not prohibited for landlords to require their tenants to pay for damage to property.\n\nThe issue here is that *your dad* committed the breach under *his* tenancy agreement. Under your tenancy agreement there has been no breach. Therefore, requiring payment from your dad is permitted; requiring payment from you is not. Any clause which purports to do so is unenforceable on the tenant:\n\n> **Section 4(1\\)**: A term of a tenancy agreement which breaches section 1 is not binding on a relevant person.\n\nNovated tenancy agreement\n-------------------------\n\nIt's possible that instead of signing a new tenancy agreement, you [novated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novation) the old one. This means that *all three* parties (the landlord, your dad, you) agreed to substitute you for your dad as a party. It is not possible for only you and the landlord to agree to a novation. That's because the outgoing party gives up their rights as well as obligations; hence their consent is required.\n\nAlthough this is commonly be described as \"stepping into the shoes\" of the outgoing party, strictly speaking this is not what happens. Rather, the old contract (between A and B) is extinguished and a new contract (between A and C) is formed on the same terms (or partially on the same terms, depending on what the novation states).\n\nUnder a novation, the default position is that pre\\-novation liabilities remain with the outgoing party. It's possible (and common) to expressly provide something different, which is what has purportedly happened in your case.\n\nThat raises an interesting question as to the effect of Schedule 1, Paragraph 5\\. In my view, while you can expressly provide that *liability* can transfer from B to C in a novated contract, you cannot provide that *breaches* can transfer. A breach is a factual occurance and it's nonsensical to rewrite history by saying that C committed a past breach which in fact B committed. Instead, what you can do is say that C agrees to be *liable* for that past breach. Saying otherwise would be incompatible with the principle that a novated contract is a new contract which extinguishes the old.\n\nAccordingly, my view with regards to Schedule 1, Paragraph 5 is the same as if you had signed a new tenancy agreement (which is effectively what you have done with a novated tenancy agreement). You did not commit the breach, therefore asking you to accept liability for it under the novated contract is prohibited.\n\nNote also that it is permitted to require payment of \u00a350 or the landlord's *costs* in relation to the novation, whichever is greater. However, in my view this applies to only to the outgoing party, being \"the tenant\" who makes the payment \"in consideration\" of the novation of \"the tenancy\" which is done \"at the tenant's request\" (all of which implies we're talking about the existing tenancy, not the new one). The language would appear to exclude the possibility that the incoming party can legally be required to make the payment:\n\n> **Schedule 1, Paragraph 6**:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) A payment is a permitted payment if it is a payment \u2014 (a) to a\n> landlord in consideration of the variation, assignment or novation of\n> a tenancy at the tenant's request, \\[...]\n> \n> \n> (2\\) But if the amount of the payment exceeds the greater of \u2014 (a) \u00a350,\n> or (b) the reasonable costs of the person to whom the payment is to be\n> made in respect of the variation, assignment or novation of the\n> tenancy, the amount of the excess is a prohibited payment.\n\nIf I'm wrong **and** the landlord also released your dad from liability for damage to the carpet (which is not necessarily implied by the fact that you agreed to be liable), then it could perhaps be argued that such release is a \"cost\" for the purposes of sub\\-paragraph 1(b) above. However, I would counter\\-argue that it isn't really a \"cost\" since it was taken on voluntarily (the landlord could have simply had your dad remain liable which is the default position) and it isn't \"reasonable\" for the same reason.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a suitable question:\n\nQuestion: A tenant has recently taken over a tenancy from their disabled father, signing a contract agreeing to take liability for the property's condition. The carpets are in poor condition, and the landlord refuses to replace them.

This is due to the Tenant Fees Act 2019, which prohibits landlords from requiring tenants to make payments that are not permitted under the Act. The Act allows for payments related to damages for breach of a tenancy agreement, but only for breaches committed by the current tenant under their own agreement. In this case, any damage to the carpets occurred during the father's tenancy, not the current tenant's. Therefore, requiring the new tenant to pay for this damage is not permitted, and any clause in the contract stating otherwise would be unenforceable. This applies whether the tenant signed a new tenancy agreement or novated the existing one. The answer also notes that it's not possible to transfer past breaches of contract, only liability for them, which further supports the conclusion that the new tenant cannot be held responsible for the carpet damage."}, "94": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32384/what-is-a-condition-precedent", "docs_id": 32384, "title": "What is a condition precedent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_precedent) is a Wikipedia definition, of something that must happen before something else happens, but I'm not sure how to apply it to the law.\n\nLet's say that there is an angel investor that meets a company with an interesting technology, and proposes to invest an amount, X, in the company for a certain percentage. The contract says something like, \"a condition precedent for the investment of X is a demonstration of the company's technology to the investor's reasonable satisfaction.\" The company delays in doing the demo, but asks for the money. The investor says, \"no demo, no money.\" Is this what \"condition precedent\" is meant to say? \n\nIf there is no express time limit written into the contract, is there an implied, or \"reasonable\" time limit after which the investor is off the hook?

So, yes, \"no demo, no money\" is another way to put it.\n\nThe \"investor's reasonable satisfaction\" is the standard used to determine whether the condition has been satisfied (and thus whether the obligation will be triggered). The reasonableness standard falls somewhere in the middle segment on a scale of investor\\-friendly to inventor\\-friendly contract language. For example, \"the investor's sole discretion\" is investor\\-friendly (though likely subject to a good faith duty); \"the investor's discretion\" is still investor\\-friendly and is limited by a good faith duty; \"the investor's reasonable discretion\" anchors the discretion not in what the investor would want to do but in what would be objectively reasonable.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The demonstration is clearly defined as a condition precedent in the contract, meaning it must occur before the investor is obligated to provide the funds.\n\n2. While there is no express time limit in the contract, the law generally implies a \"reasonable time\" for performance of contractual obligations. Six months is likely to be considered an unreasonable delay for a technology demonstration in most industries, especially given the fast-paced nature of startups and technology.\n\n3. The startup's failure to provide the demonstration within a reasonable time frame could be considered a material breach of the contract. This gives the investor grounds to potentially terminate the agreement or, at minimum, continue to withhold funds.\n\n4. The investor's concern about potential obsolescence of the technology after six months is a valid consideration that supports the reasonableness of terminating the agreement or refusing to invest at this point.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the investor is not obligated to provide funds without the condition precedent being met, and six months is likely not considered reasonable in this context.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the investor can refuse to provide funds, they cannot do so indefinitely.

Balancing investigation needs and privacy: This approach allows police to maintain chain of custody and reduce risks of evidence tampering, while also respecting Alice's privacy by limiting the extraction to relevant data.\n\n4. Proportionality: A Level 1 extraction is more proportionate to the needs of the investigation, as opposed to more invasive Level 2 or 3 extractions.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect as they don't align with recommended practices. Option B is overly invasive for a witness and doesn't consider the consent-based approach recommended for non-suspects.

Can the company legally require her not to disclose the conduct of an illegal activity?\n\nI remember reading that contracts cannot be legally binding if there is a requirement of criminal acts, am I wrong to assume this for NDA's?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The validity of the NDA is not an easy question, but a related one is more clear.\n\nA lawyer in the U.S. in most states is not permitted to threaten criminal or administrative action (e.g. reporting someone to immigration or tax officials), to gain advantage in a civil case. You can unilaterally bring criminal charges or take administrative action, but it is deemed to be unethical and against public policy to refrain from bringing criminal charges or taking administration action to gain civil advantages.\n\nAn NDA of the type described arguably violated the same public policy and might be invalidated as a result. \n\nPut another way, there is a privilege to make certain reports to public officials without legal consequences and such an NDA might violate that privilege. Some of these privileges found in what are called \"whistle blower\" statutes specifically prohibit this kind of agreement as to some specific kinds of illegal conduct, but not others. There isn't a general rule.\n\nThis said, it is not black and white. For example, a private NDA can't prevent someone from testifying under subpoena, but can prevent someone from voluntarily testifying in the absence of a legal compulsion to do so such as a subpoena.\n\n> Suppose a woman is sexually assaulted at work, and is given an NDA to\n>  sign. Can the company legally require her not to disclose the conduct\n>  of an illegal activity?\n\nI can imagine this example coming out different ways in different jurisdictions. \n\nFor example, some states have a legal duty (rarely enforced) that requires people to report felonies, and an NDA in this case would contradict that affirmative legal duty, while others do not.\n\nAnother source of gray in the analysis is that there is a difference between not reporting a sexual assault that actually happened, and, as part of a larger settlement, executing an affidavit stating under penalty of perjury and under oath that a sexual assault didn't happen. The first is potentially an NDA that is void as a matter of public policy. The other, in principle, is a settlement that the person signing the affidavit can only enter into if it is true. There is nothing, in general, wrong, about requiring someone to confirm that certain representations are true as part of a business transaction or contract and allowing the contract to go forwards only if certain facts are true.\n\nThe gray gets deeper, because whether a sexual assault happened or not is not always a subjectively black and white clear issue of pure fact. (It is subjective because an affidavit or affirmation is made to the best of the declarant or affiants' knowledge and belief, not as a matter of objective fact.)\n\nFor example, someone may not have perfect memory of what happened, or there could be doubt over the question of whether the perpetrators acted recklessly (the Model Penal Code intent requirement for sexual assault) or merely with criminal negligence (which would not be sexual assault under the Model Penal Code).\n\nA statement made under oath about whether a sexual assault happened to the best of your knowledge, thus, might be a mixture of factual issues (A penetrated B at a certain date and time) and legal or not perfectly factually known ones (A acted with X intent regarding consent during that act).\n\nSo, in a case where there was some room to argue either way about how to characterize what happened and about what actually did happen, there might be some room for a settling party to make a non\\-perjured statement consistent with the settlement and then to agree not to a true NDA, but instead to not make statements which, if the affidavit is true, would be false.\n\nIn a plea bargain in a criminal case, one can plead \"no contest\" without agreeing that the crime factually happened, but that isn't really possibly in the context of an affidavit about what really happened, with an NDA limited to not disclosing the incident since it was already agreed as a matter of sworn fact that there is nothing to disclose that rises the level of a crime.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A large tech company is facing multiple sexual assault allegations from employees.

The correct answer, D, reflects the complexity and nuance of the legal situation described. \n\nThe documentation states that the validity of NDAs in such cases is \"not an easy question\" and can vary based on several factors.

However, usually unpaid utility bills do constitute a lien against the property that is enforceable against a subsequent purchaser, which has the same practical effect. This kind of obligation is also sometimes described as an \"encumbrance\".\n\nUsually, in an arms length sale of real estate through real estate agents, a title insurance company is hired and is responsible for determining if there are any outstanding liens, pro\\-rating utility bills, pro\\-rating property taxes, etc. at closing. If the title company fails to find a lien and there is one, the title company is responsible for paying off the lien that it failed to find (although it can often force the previous owner to indemnify it for the payment it has to make).\n\nIt could be that since water service was not currently being delivered, that the title company did not search in the manner that it should have to find this lien, or it could be that there was no title company used and so no one ever checked.\n\nAlso, if the property was conveyed with a \"warranty deed\" such a deed contains a promise from the seller that there are no liens or encumbrances not listed on the face of the deed that have to be paid, and the seller has liability for breach of the warranty of title.

If you were to compile them into a report, would it be legal to sell it to that company (in the United States)?\n\n**Edit:**\n\nIn cybersecurity, there's a term called responsible disclosure. In essence, you notify the company of a vulnerability and give them plenty of time to take care of it. Typically, if the company doesn't do anything about it, the person will publicly disclose the vulnerability to get the full attention of the company (full disclosure). What are the legal implications of full disclosure?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Well, as always, the answer is \"it depends\".\n\nIt isn't illegal per se.\n\nIf both parties agree, it's good business. You get paid for the work of compiling the report. For example, let's say you leave and are no longer working for them, and they call you and say \"hey, you know those security vulnerabilities you were talking about last year? Yeah, the boss finally decided to give it priority, but it seems we kept no notes in that meeting. Could you compile a report for us? I know you no longer work here, but we would pay you a little more than the normal contractor rate if you are interested\". That's perfectly fine.\n\nNow, *not* disclosing them when you found them could be seen as a breach of contract, which implicitely includes the duty of loyalty. Keeping it a secret to cash in on later is certainly sleazy.\n\nThe compiled report might, depending on state laws, your specific contract, and who can pay the better lawyer, end up as their's. You can only compile that report because you worked there and you got knowledge of those vulnerabilites only as a part of your job.\n\nAnd finally, even if you did compile a report and it is waterproof and it is yours exclusively, it very much depends on the \"else\". What if they just say \"no thanks\"? Selling that report *to someone else* **is** illegal. So you have exactly *one* legal buyer and that buyer knows it. Does not sound like a great bargaining position.\n\nIf you approach them, it takes a lot of skill and maybe a bit of legal training to make sure it does come across as an offer of \"good business\". I think it would be easy to be misinterpreted as either blackmail or selling them knowledge they legally probably already own.\n\nSo unless you are certain you can fit into that \"good business\" model of selling your work compiling a report, instead of selling the knowledge of their secrets, it might be safer to not do that.\n\nIf they approach you, it should not be a problem, but if you approach them, it will be a mess, no matter how well you mean it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A cybersecurity researcher discovers several critical vulnerabilities in a company's software while employed there.

The correct answer, C, aligns with the \"good business\" model described in the top answer. Waiting for the company to reach out eliminates potential issues of breaching the duty of loyalty or appearing to engage in blackmail. It also ensures that the company is the one initiating the transaction, which the documentation suggests is safer legally.\n\nOption A, while potentially legal, risks being misinterpreted as blackmail or selling information that the company might legally own, as mentioned in the documentation. \n\nOption B relates to the concept of \"full disclosure\" mentioned in the edit, but this approach can have legal implications and doesn't directly address the monetization aspect.\n\nOption D is clearly illegal according to the documentation, which states that \"Selling that report to someone else is illegal.\"\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts, including responsible disclosure, duty of loyalty, legal ownership of information, and the nuances of approaching former employers with sensitive information.
