In Finland where I'm from, the charge for causing a death in any way is always a criminal charge; you can't start a civil suit over it (as far as I know).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: They are two different courts, with different standards of proof. In a criminal court, the standard of proof is \"guilty beyond any reasonable doubt\". In a civil court, the standard of proof is \"more likely guilty than not guilty\". Actually, in a civil court it's not \"guilty\", it's often \"liable for damages\". \n\nIt's obvious that there will always be cases where the evidence lies somewhere between these two. \n\nConsider what the reasons for both court cases are: In the first case, it's the state against you. The state doesn't suffer any injustice if you are not convicted, and the state is very powerful, that's why the standard of proof is high. In a civil court, you have often two private persons fighting it out. If you are correctly accused of breaking my arm and I sue you for damages, then if you are not convicted, I am suffering a broken arm and all the associated pain and cost.

Civil courts have a lower standard of proof (\"more likely than not\" or \"preponderance of evidence\") compared to criminal courts (\"beyond reasonable doubt\"). This difference can lead to situations where a person is found not guilty in a criminal court but liable in a civil court for the same event, as happened in the O.J. Simpson case.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because criminal and civil courts have different standards of proof, not just different punishments.\n\nAnswer B is false because criminal and civil cases are separate, and a verdict in one does not automatically determine the outcome of the other.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because, as the question states, some legal systems (like in the U.S.) allow for both criminal and civil cases related to deaths, contrary to the system in Finland mentioned in the original question."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33430/what-exactly-does-the-law-say-about-bias-in-court-does-it-cover-unconscious-bias", "docs_id": 33430, "title": "What exactly does the law say about bias in court/does it cover unconscious biases?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If possible, what is the specific wording for the law(s) about bias in court, what are the repercussions for someone who is found guilty of bias in court, and do the laws extend to unconscious bias (i.e, would a trial be redone if it was found that unconscious bias had played a role in the final decision). This is for a research project lasting one year with the question to what extent does cognitive bias play a role in court/businesses?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The law doesn't directly address mental states, it addresses actions, and a law may (or may not) have a \"mental state\" requirement as part of the determination of liability. For example, abstractly hating a person for their race is not a crime and you cannot be sued for abstractly hating a person because of their race, but you can be punished or made to pay damages because of your actions \u2013 beating them or refusing to sell to them \u2013 and that mental state may figure into the determination of guilt. There are [hate crimes laws](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.36.080) in the US whereby criminal actions are given stiffer punishments, where in Washington the distinguishing element is motivation: \"because of his or her perception of the victim's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or mental, physical, or sensory handicap\". The government must prove that the victim was assaulted because of his race, and not because the assailant thought the victim was an easy mark. This is an instance of the popular concept of \"bias\".\n\nCognitive bias, however, is extremely broad, and there are literally hundreds of possible answers. For example, cognitive bias figures into visual perception (let's say of color), which means the law has to have a way to deal with eyewitness testimony. Expert testimony could introduce reasonable doubt as to the reliability of witness testimony based on scientific testimony to the effect that humans have a cognitive bias in a particular direction, which may show that the eyewitness testimony is unreliable. What the law has to deal with is whether such scientific testimony is pertinent (admissible). There is a body of law surrounding the [Daubert Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard) which answers that question. The key here is that the attorney has to know to call up an appropriate expert witness to impeach eyewitness testimony. Or circumstantial evidence, when the evidence is based on a subjective assessment by an expert (that is, when a lab tech makes a professional judgment as to fact, such as whether this voiceprint matches that voiceprint).\n\nCognitive bias is a fact of human psychology and is not punished.

The law primarily deals with actions rather than mental states, but certain biases can influence liability in specific circumstances. For example, hate crime laws consider motivation based on bias against protected characteristics when determining punishment severity. Additionally, cognitive bias research can be used to challenge the reliability of eyewitness testimony through expert witnesses, provided it meets admissibility standards like the Daubert Standard.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because cognitive bias itself is not directly addressed or punishable in law. Answer B is incorrect as there's no automatic retrial for unconscious bias; legal proceedings focus on actions and provable motivations.

One idea to overcome this issue might be to have someone else read the documentation and write down the necessary API calls and then have someone else given only those notes figure out how to set everything up by just looking up the plain API calls like [CreateWindowEx](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowexa).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The example code explains a procedure or method of accomplishing a goal, in the process conveying certain ideas.\n\n[17 USC 102 (b)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102) provides:\n\n> (b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\n\nThe laws of other countries are similar on this point. Making use of the procedure or method is not copyright infringement. Under US law, making use of the example code would probably be a fair use, whatever the license may say. But even if it were not held to be a fair use, writing code that is similar to implement the same procedure is not infringement, because there are only a limited number of ways to implement this procedure, and to protect all of them, would be to protect an idea, which copyright never does.\n\nIn general when there are only a few ways to express an idea, or implement a procedure, copyright cannot be used to protect any of them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of software development and copyright law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of example code from official API documentation?\n\nA) Using any code from official documentation is always copyright infringement, regardless of how it's implemented.\n\nB) Copying example code verbatim from documentation is allowed as long as it's for personal, non-commercial use.\n\nC) Implementing the procedure or method demonstrated in example code, even if the resulting code is similar, is generally not considered copyright infringement.\n\nD) Creating a derivative work by slightly modifying the example code is a reliable way to avoid copyright issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to copyright law, particularly 17 USC 102 (b), copyright protection does not extend to ideas, procedures, processes, systems, or methods of operation. The example code in API documentation typically demonstrates a procedure or method for accomplishing a specific task. Implementing this procedure, even if the resulting code is similar to the example, is generally not considered copyright infringement. This is because there are often limited ways to implement certain procedures, and protecting all possible implementations would effectively protect the idea itself, which copyright law explicitly avoids.

It was patented in US. I have few questions:\n\n1. *Basics* Although it is patented in US, is it \"working\" worldwide? Could two countries have the same patent from different inventors? When someone brings patent to patent service in his country, the patent service will check if there same patent anywhere in the world?\n2. *Basics* If last sentence is false, \\- if someone from country A stole patent from country B, then inventor from country B should go to country A court?\n3. How (US) law describes expiration of patent? What does it mean? Can it be repatented? Can anyone free use expired patent?\n4. In the page I provided the status of patent is `Expired - Fee Related` \\- was does it mean?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For the first question \\- **No, patents are territorial**. A US patent is not \"working\" anywhere else. Of course one can apply in multiple countries if the proper time frames and procedures are followed. There is a mechanism (PCT Treaty) that allows a straightforward way to *apply* in over a 140 countries simultaneously. Although it is frequently used, it is expensive to continue to prosecute the application in each place and even in high\\-value inventions only a handful of places are eventually chosen to actually pursue patents. Each country's/region's laws and processes are different and success in patenting can vary.\n\nNormally two countries would not have the same thing patented by different inventors. The patenting or publication of the first one would make it prior art to the second filed one. This should be found by the second examiner and stop a duplicate patent by a second inventor. However there can be subtle differences between similar inventions and mistakes do happen. In the case of true simultaneous invention this can happen.\n\nTo get a patent, the invention must be novel \\- that means no one has published or patented it anywhere in the world at any time in any language. Before the AIA law in the U.S. the law said \"or known in this country\". It could have made a loophole where something was known publicly elsewhere but did not constitute prior art in the U.S. That is now changed to be world\\-wide.\n\nEven if the examiner does a world wide search they might miss something and a patent might get issued even though the invention was not novel and a patent elsewhere is granted. To invalidate it the original patent owner would need to look into available procedures in country A. It might be court or it might be administrative.\n\nIn most places an annual \u201crenewal\u201d fee must be paid to keep a patent in\\-force. In the U.S. a \u201cmaintenance\u201d fee must be paid at the 3\\.5 year, 7\\.5 year and 7\\.5 year points in order to stay in\\-force.\n\nA patent who\u2019s renewal or maintenance fee hasn\u2019t been paid is expired for fee reasons. That can imply that it can be revived by the *patent owner* by paying the fees and usually a penalty. There may be a time limit or a small set of allowable circumstances to revive.\n\nA patent labeled expired for fee reasons might now be past its normal lifespan and therefore not revivable.\n\nIn general patents are given to inventors and those an inventor assigns their rights to.

Six months later, an American company independently develops a nearly identical mouse and files a patent application in the United States. What is the most likely outcome?\n\nA) Both companies will be granted patents in their respective countries, as patents are territorial.\nB) The Japanese company's patent will be considered prior art, preventing the US company from obtaining a patent.\nC) The US company will be granted a patent, as the Japanese application was not filed in the US.\nD) Neither company will be granted a patent due to simultaneous invention.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While patents are indeed territorial (as mentioned in answer A), the key factor here is the novelty requirement for patents. As stated in the documentation, \"To get a patent, the invention must be novel - that means no one has published or patented it anywhere in the world at any time in any language.\" The Japanese company's earlier patent application, even though filed in Japan, would constitute prior art on a global scale. This would likely prevent the US company from obtaining a patent, as their invention would no longer be considered novel.

If the other licenses are not compatible with the GPL license, then you can't publish with the different licenses.

The 4th Amendment may prohibit them from searching the phone: nothing authorizes a school to delete files from a phone. Whether they may search would primarily have to do with urgent safety concerns. Schools have broader authority over students because they are acting *in loco parentis*, but that is distinct from *carte blanche* (especially since the courts now recognise that school attendance is mandated by law, thus intrusions on constitutional rights receive narrower scrutiny). Warrantless searches are allowed, based on a \"balancing\" of the item searched, the infraction, and the quality of the suspicion ([New Jersey v. T.L.O](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1983/83-712)).\n\nOne of the problems is that there is a certain baseline of expectation of privacy against which searches are to be judged, but, frankly, teen\\-agers have highly variable privacy expectations ([Safford v.

[This article](http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&context=bjcl) is about the question of student cell phone privacy rights.\n\nThe general pattern, I have to say, is to start with the assumption that the school has a particular right, so they do something, and the student sues until the state or US Supreme Court articulates principle recognizing the student's constitutional right, at which point districts change their behavior.

Searches may be conducted for urgent safety concerns, based on a balancing test established in New Jersey v. T.L.O.

Cars that are rented to customers for insurance reasons (accidents, etc) are supposed to match the size of the car that was damaged as close as possible.

In most insurance rental situations, the company provides \"X\" amount of dollars per day, generally between $20\\-25\\. These insurance companies have deals with rental agencies to secure rates that align with these low daily costs \\- the same car they get for $20 a day would cost a walk in customer double or triple that. You could use that $20\\-25 a day towards the cost of your rental and then just pay the difference on the larger car if you'd like. \n\nSo to answer your question, yes you can push back all you want. Direct your concerns to their insurance company. In my experience, I've seen more often than not they agree to the larger vehicle.

The executor (in this case, the daughter) would likely need to sign the title transfer, provide a death certificate, and potentially submit a letter of testamentary. John would then need to file these documents with the state DMV, pay any required fees, and possibly get new plates.

In movies, I only hear \"Sustained\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It doesn't really matter exactly what the judge says as long as it's clear whether the judge is sustaining or overruling the objection. With that said, in movies you'll rarely see the person asking the question get to respond to the objection, but you'll notice in the trial that happens in most cases. For example, if one party objects that a question calls for hearsay, the examiner may defend their question by pointing out that the statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, or that it falls into one of the hearsay exceptions. At that point the judge is responding to both parties and someone else or possibly multiple people have spoken since the objection was originally raised, so she might specify that she's \"overruling the objection\" as opposed to just saying overruled, so it just makes it clearer on the record what she's ruling about.\n\nIt's worth noting as well that she might need to specify which objection she's sustaining if more than one objection is raised. In this trial both hearsay and relevance objections have been raised at the same time, and the judge might specify that she's sustaining e.g. only relevance.

The documentation explains that judges may use more verbose language like \"I will sustain/overrule the objection\" to provide clarity, especially when there have been multiple speakers or objections raised. This phrasing helps to specify exactly what the judge is ruling on, which is particularly important when there are complex objections or when multiple objections have been raised simultaneously (e.g., for both hearsay and relevance). This approach ensures that the record is clear and that all parties understand which specific objection(s) the judge is addressing. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no formal requirement for verbose language; clarity is the goal, not formality.

Your solicitor is the only person who can advise you properly, since he knows all the details; but ultimately you will have to choose between being on bad terms with these neighbours (including suing them for possession) and losing the garages.\n\nTo deal with your edit: normally, just requesting the rent is enough, even if the tenants ignore every request. However, if they specifically refuse to pay anything, they are claiming that they own the garages not you, and if you do nothing you will lose possession eventually.

The situation described presents a risk of adverse possession, where the tenant could potentially claim ownership of the garage if the homeowner fails to assert their rights for an extended period (typically 12 years in the UK). By refusing to pay rent and claiming future ownership, the neighbor is challenging the homeowner's property rights.

I've researched placing a lien or garnishing wages on the individual but can you do that against a company?\n\nJurisdiction: NV, US\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, you should simply **write them a letter demanding payment of the judgment**. You can keep sending them demand letters updating the interest on the judgment regularly (e.g. every month) and call them demanding to be paid on a regular basis so that your claim is annoying to them.\n\nSecond, you can **use legal tools at your disposal**. In the approximate order of the likelihood that you would resort to them and the ease of using them, these are:\n\n1. You can record a judgment lien against any real property it owns, if any. This must be cleared when the property is sold and hurts the credit record of the company. You can also foreclosed on the lien although doing so involve quite a bit of legal technicalities and process and may require you to assume or pay off mortgages and liens higher in priority than your own. Basically, this involves getting the right kind of proof that the judgment was entered (in Colorado one gets a \"transcript of judgment\" from the clerk, but Nevada process may vary) and recording it in the real property records of the county where the real estate owned by the company is located.\n2. You can garnish its bank accounts, if you know where the company banks, if not, you can learn this in the next step. This involves filling out a garnishment form (which may need a clerk of court's stamp) and then mailing it to the judgment\\-debtor and the bank (local practice might require a process server to deliver it).\n3. You can issue interrogatories or take depositions of corporate officials to have them disclose what assets and sources of income it has (pursuant to Rule of Civil Procedure 69\\). This is somewhat of an involved process with legal rules and forms involved but if you don't know where the company has assets, you have few other choices but to do this and it gets their attention as well. You could also hire a private investigator to try to locate the company's assets.\n4. You can obtain a writ of execution and attachment to have the sheriff seize tangible personal property belonging to the company. This involves multiple court form filings, fees, and coordination with the civil division of the sheriff's department that will often require you to post a liability bond, to hire people to carry away the property to a secure storage unit when it is seized for later auction, and for you to pay to publish notice of a sheriff's sale with a newspaper authorized to give legal notices. It may also require you to hire a locksmith and/or some to document the assets seized and to value them in real time during the seizure.\n5. You can garnish accounts payable to the company from individuals and businesses who owe it money. The paperwork is similar to a bank account garnishment but it often doesn't go as smoothly and has to be more actively litigated since non\\-bank persons aren't as familiar with the process.\n6. If you learn through Step 3 that the company has transferred assets to its owners or others while insolvent without receiving reasonably equivalent value in exchange, you can sue the recipient of the assets under the fraudulent transfers act in a separate lawsuit. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.\n7. In an extreme case (probably not justified by a small claims court judgment) you have force the judicial dissolution of the company and liquidation of its assets for failure to pay its debts in a separation lawsuit. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.\n8. In combination with other creditors of the company who are also unpaid, you can force the company into an involuntary bankruptcy. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.\n9. Wait for the company to go bankrupt (if this is likely) and file a claim in the bankruptcy. This involves filling out a one or two page form and filing it with the bankruptcy court.\n\nIn my experience in Colorado which has similar rules on this subject, companies with real estate usually pay upon demand (especially if they have a mortgage since an unsatisfied judgment is a condition of default on most business mortgages). But, if the company owns no real estate, commencing collections actions combination of 2, 3 and 4 is usually sufficient to get the company to simply pay the judgment without having to take the processes involved to completion.\n\nThis said, most of the options above involve fairly complicated paper work and procedural requirements. The average person who doesn't have a graduate degree or a business background would really struggle to do it right and there are sometimes significant fees involved.\n\nThird, you can use other methods that don't involve the legal process that involve **notifying people of their non\\-payment of a judgment**.\n\nOne trick is to learn who it has major contracts like leases and large loans with, and advise them that there is an outstanding judgment against the company, which is often a condition of default under those contract that must be cured quickly.\n\nSimilarly, complaining about the company's non\\-payment of the judgment on customer review sites and social media can work sometimes.\n\nFourth, you can **hire someone to do it for you**. Often lawyers and collection agencies are more willing to collect a true money judgment from a court than they are to take on a claim that hasn't yet been reduced to judgment and will have to be litigated.\n\nSo, because it is so technically difficult to enforce your legal rights without a lawyer, even if you obtained the small claims court judgment without a lawyer, it may be worth the money to hire a lawyer to collect the judgment obtained, or to turn the judgment over to a collection agency (which also hurts the company's credit record) and to pay what that costs.\n\nOn a contingent fee basis, a 33%\\-50% contingent fee would be customary. Hourly legal fees can run from $150 to $450 per hour in Nevada for this kind of work and it would take at least several hours of work.\n\nIf the judgment is too small, it may not be cost effective to hire anyone to collect it on an hourly basis, and even collection agencies may decline to take on the case on a contingent fee basis because the work required would cost them more than the fee they would obtain if they won.\n\nIn the case of a small claims court judgment that isn't very large it is often not cost effective or worth your time and effort to pursue it actively.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: After winning a small claims court case against a company in Nevada, you decide to pursue collection of the judgment. Which of the following sequences of actions would be most appropriate and effective for collecting the judgment, assuming the company is unwilling to pay voluntarily?\n\nA) Send a demand letter, place a lien on the company's real property, garnish its bank accounts, and then conduct a deposition of corporate officials.\n\nB) Hire a private investigator to locate assets, force the company into involuntary bankruptcy, and then file a claim in the bankruptcy court.\n\nC) Post negative reviews on social media, hire a collection agency, and then sue the company's owners for fraudulent transfers.\n\nD) Record a judgment lien, issue interrogatories to corporate officials, obtain a writ of execution, and then garnish the company's accounts receivable.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Option A presents the most logical and effective sequence of actions for collecting a judgment, as outlined in the documentation. It starts with the simplest step (sending a demand letter) and progresses through increasingly complex but commonly used methods. Placing a lien on real property is often effective, especially if the company has a mortgage. Garnishing bank accounts is a straightforward next step, and conducting a deposition allows you to gather more information about the company's assets if needed.\n\nOption B involves more extreme measures that are typically not justified for a small claims judgment and would be difficult to execute without a lawyer.\n\nOption C mixes non-legal methods with more complex legal actions that may not be appropriate or feasible in this situation.\n\nOption D, while containing valid steps, is not in the most effective order.

What about backups that go beyond the *subject* realm (e.g. database backups, disk backups, ...)? \n\nOne idea to solve a part of the problem would be to [crypto\\-shred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-shredding) data. So when a *subject* asks to erase him/her *personal data*, we simply **erase the encryption key**. That would render all data unusable. However, data encrypted with what is considered a strong encryption method might not be strong anymore in a not\\-so\\-distant future (e.g. quantum computing, new algorithms, or a weakness found in the encryption mechanism).\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n1. Is crypto\\-shredding considered a valid erasure method?\n2. What storage mediums are affected by the so\\-called **undue delay**?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In my opinion, this should be enough. The GDPR regulation is general \\- it does not attempt to address these issues directly, precisely for the reasons we see here: You can never predict how the technology will develop.\nWhen interpreting the GDPR, we must keep the intended goal in mind. What is the purpose of the \"right to erasure\"? To prevent anyone from further processing the personal data. If you \"crypto\\-shred\" it, it can't be processed anymore, not even theoretically. The encryptec file cannot be used to identify the subject, therefore it is not even personal data anymore.\n\nIn case it can be decrypted in the future... Well, that is just a speculation. The courts can go to great lengths in interpreting what personal data is (dynamic IP address is considered personal data, since it can be linked to a person by the police with a court order), but i am pretty sure that \"it can be theoretically possible in some distant future\" is beyond the limit.\n\nAs for the second question, I am not aware of any applicable case\\-law, but I guess that current security and technological standards will be used to assess the delay. You have a right to protect your data, the subject has a right to erase them.

The LLC owns property. The value of the property is essentially the entire value of the company. Is the individual's ownership of the company considered \"real property\" or \"personal property\"? Or something else?\n\n**Edited for context**\n\nI'm named as executor in a will for a close relative who passed away suddenly. The decedent was sole proprietor of two closely held companies. One was a small business (\"INC\") doing actual work, with customers, suppliers, revenue, phones, and all. The other business (\"LLC\") owns the commercial building, in which the first business was one tenant, and just collects rents, and maintains the property. The property was heavily mortgaged but self\\-sustaining.\n\nOne doc the probate attorney sent me says I will bind myself (\"Bond of legal representative of surety\") to discharge faithfully the duties as executor. This bond amount is twice the market value of the property held by the LLC, ignoring mortgage and debt, so it's millions of dollars. Um, yikes?!? \n\nPer Google, the state says the bond must be 200% of the value of personal property, excluding real property.\n\nObviously, I'll get a real opinion from an attorney whom the estate pays, and who knows the details. \n\nBut in the meantime I'm curious \\-\\- if you own a company that's little but a shell around real property, is equity in the company itself real property or personal property? Or neither?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think it's personal property.\n\nHere's why.\n\nI think the purpose of the bond is to protect the estate from malfeasance of the executor. I.e., to deter an unscrupulous executor from transferring the personal property of the decedent out of the estate at below market value and, thus, inequitably damaging the value of the estate. The bond gives the estate equitable recourse. The estate's remedy is to enforce a potential judgment by collecting against the bond.\n\nSo, in this case, in theory, because the executor *might* have the power to transfer *ownership* of the LLC (or its *equitable interest*, hat tip: @Scott) to a third party at below market value (subject to the Operating Agreement; but then, who would complain anyway against an inappropriate sale of membership interest, if not the estate?), the state will require a bond to ensure the estate is protected against potential malfeasance by the executor.\n\nI believe the reason for excluding real property from the bond requirement is because in order to clear title, the probate judge must specifically approve the sale of any real estate. At which time s/he will withhold her approval if the sale price is out\\-of\\-line with market.\n\nOne can imagine this is done as a practical matter. In other words, it would be impractical to have the judge personally approve the sale of lots of low\\-value items (personal property). But more practical to have the judge approve the sale of a few high\\-value items (real property).\n\nBut, as above described, if the sale could circumvent the probate court (as in the case of an LLC membership interest) then the sale should be required to be covered by the bond.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not an attorney.

The ownership interest in the LLC would likely be classified as personal property for the purpose of determining the bond amount. This is because:\n\n1. The executor potentially has the power to transfer ownership of the LLC or its equitable interest without direct court approval, unlike the sale of real property which typically requires specific approval from a probate judge.\n\n2. The purpose of the bond is to protect the estate from potential malfeasance by the executor, particularly in cases where assets could be transferred at below market value without court oversight.\n\n3. Even though the LLC's primary asset is real estate, the ownership interest in the LLC itself is considered personal property. The LLC, as a separate legal entity, owns the real estate, not the individual directly.\n\n4. The bond requirement typically excludes real property because its sale requires court approval, providing a safeguard against undervalued sales. However, the LLC interest, being personal property, does not have this built-in protection.\n\n5.

Can a law firm submit a corrected complaint and still have it\n> be accepted even though time has run out?\n\nThis depends on what you mean by \"rejected\":\n\n1. If you mean that judgment was issued in favour of the defendant then under the principle of [res judicata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_judicata) you will not be able to file a \"corrected\" complaint relating to the same cause of action. This is the case regardless of whether or not the limitation period hass expired. You would need to use the usual remedies available to a losing party (e.g. appeal, setting aside, varying, etc.). You may find it challenging to introduce new arguments at appeal which could have been raised in the first instance case but were not.\n2. If you mean that you made some procedural error in relation to the claim, then it will depend on which [rule of court](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules) you contravened. Some rules permit the court to exercise its discretion while others do not. If the court has invalidated your claim without allowing you to fix the error then you will only be able to bring a fresh claim if you are still within the limitation period. A claim is \"brought\" when a request for the issue of a claim form is delivered to the correct court office during its opening hours (Barnes v St Helens MBC \\[2006] EWCA Civ 1372\\).\n3. If you mean that you have become aware that your statement of case contains errors or other content that you would like to change, then you can try to have it amended. If you have not yet served it on the other party then you can do so without the court's permission ([CPR 17\\.1(1\\)](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part17#17.1). If you have already served it then you will need either the other party's consent or the permission of the court ([CPR 17\\.1(2\\)](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part17#17.1)). [CPR 17\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part17#17.4) provides that where a party applies to amend a statement of case and a limitation period has expired, \"*the court may allow an amendment whose effect will be to add or substitute a new claim, but only if the new claim arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a claim in respect of which the party applying for permission has already claimed a remedy in the proceedings.*\" Other rules apply in the case of changing the name of a party or altering the capacity in which the party brings the claim (CPR 17\\.4(3\\) and (4\\), [19\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part19#19.4), and [19\\.5](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part19#19.5)).\n\nMore generally, bringing a claim at the last minute can have some disadvantages. If you are seeking interest on a money claim, the court may be reluctant to award it at the rate and for the period that you would have hoped for if it is not the defendant's fault that you delayed. There could also be cost implications based on your conduct before the proceedings ([CPR 44\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#rule44.4)).\n\nThe court will generally take a dim view of \"tactical\" use of a limitation period if doing so goes against the court's overriding objective and the duty of the parties to further that objective ([CPR 1\\.1](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part01#1.1) and [1\\.3](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part01#1.3)). There can also be cost implications if you have issued a last\\-minute claim without observing the [practice direction on pre\\-action conduct and protocols](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/pd_pre-action_conduct). However this last point can be fixed by issuing the claim in time and then applying to court for a stay of proceedings while you comply with the pre\\-action PD ([Pre\\-action PD paragraph 17](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/pd_pre-action_conduct#17.1)).\n\nAlso, for some causes of action, the speed at which you bring a claim may be a factor in your chances of success. For example, the governing law for that cause of action might provide that it is a factor. Physical evidence can become lost or unavailable.

My understanding is that for first offences, it's possible that a mandatory session with a therapist or psychologist may be appointed. The student then has to have at least one session with the therapist before any other action is taken towards making a judgement call on the student's acts.\n\nUnder what circumstances is this common, and what roles of the law or court system actually handle this kind of processing and interfacing with the therapist and offender?\n\nThe U.S. system is the law system I'm focused on, specifically with respect to high schools (if that helps).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Usually what would happen would be that the charge would be referred to juvenile court following the arrest of the juvenile or issuance of a citation to the juvenile for that offense by law enforcement. The juvenile court (or the juvenile division of some other court) would then have discretion to impose a variety of sentences if it found that the juvenile was guilty or if there was a plea bargain (plea bargains would typically resolve 85%\\+ of cases).\n\nThe default sentence would typically be a modest fine and/or a brief period of incarceration in a juvenile facility.\n\nBut, the juvenile court, often as part of a plea bargain proposed by the juvenile's counsel could call (sometimes with the required approval of the prosecutor) for a \"deferred judgment\" in which the case would be dismissed as if it had never happened if certain conditions were met, or probation subject to conditions including attendance at therapy, in lieu of a fine and/or period of incarceration. The resolution you describe in your question sounds more like a deferred judgment than a probation sentence, although the differences are subtle.\n\nInstead of therapy, another possibility would be community service, typically as a probation condition.\n\nTherapy or a deferred judgment, in general, wouldn't typically be limited as a matter of law to first offenses, and would be guaranteed as a remedy in any particular case. It would simply be a common resolution in some particular juvenile courts with a particular set of judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys.\n\nIn practice, often this kind of resolution (i.e. a deferred judgment conditioned on attending therapy or alcoholics anonymous or both) would be proposed by a private lawyer hired by the juvenile's parents who would offer to pay for the therapy at their own expense. \n\nA public defender for an indigent juvenile would often not have the time to arrange the therapy setup and would not have a client with the means to pay for it, so a fine and/or incarceration sentences and/or community service would be a more likely sentence for an indigent (i.e. poor) juvenile.\n\nStill, a lot depends upon the attitude of the prosecutor and judge. Some prosecutors and judges might be inclined to take a hard line (this is particularly common in minority neighborhoods and in a case where a juvenile had many prior offenses); others might be inclined towards leniency and seeing a prospect for rehabilitation (particularly for a white or Asian defendant from a middle class family without many prior offenses).

A school district may not encourage classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in primary grade levels or in a manner that is not age\\-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.\n\nExactly what it means for \"A school district\" to \"encourage classroom discussion\" is less than clear. If such discussion is not on the syllabus, nor suggested by the administration, but a teacher starts it, would this law ban it? Note that no penalty is specified for violation, although parental suits against a school district are authorized by the new subsaection 1001\\.42 (8\\)(c)(4\\).\n\nOn its face the bill appears to prohibit the district from \"encouraging\" any such discussion in the primary grades (K\\-3 it seems), and from encouraging it if such discussion is not \"age\\-appropriate\" in other grades.\n\nAs to the question of whether this bill, if it becomes law (as seems likely) would violate anyone's constitutional rights, that is a bit tricky. Teachers and students both have First Admendment rights even during school (see [*Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District*, 393 U.S. 503 (1969\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District) for the key case) but this bill does not purport to prohibit a teacher from making any particular statement.

The bill does not explicitly prohibit all discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity, but rather limits \"encouraging\" such discussions in certain grade levels or in ways deemed not age-appropriate. The vagueness of terms like \"encourage\" and the lack of specified penalties make the bill's actual impact on speech unclear. While states do have authority to regulate school curricula, this authority is not unlimited and must be balanced against First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court has established that teachers and students retain some First Amendment rights in school settings (e.g., Tinker v. Des Moines). Therefore, how the bill affects actual speech in practice would be crucial in determining its constitutionality. Options A and B are too extreme and don't account for the nuances of the situation.

This will typically be personally identifying information, since it is commonplace for people to consistently use a chosen pseudonym/handle across their online presence.\n* Users may post messages to one another.

I daresay that the moment they make such a post, I am in receipt of the demand and legally required to act on it. \"Acting on it\" in this specific case would probably entail deleting all messages posted by the user, and anonymizing the user's username on the site.\n\nWhat happens if the following chain of events occurs:\n\n1.

This means that the user can contact the data controller (me) and demand that their data be deleted.\n\nMore or less, but there are some details. In my view the term \"right to be forgotten\" is unfortunate, because it raises expectations that the GDPR does not fulfill. What there is, is a right to have personal data (PD) deleted or anonymized, but there are a number of exceptions where the right does not apply.\n\nThe right to deletion is provided for in [GDPR Article 17](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/). (Recitals 65 and 66 are also relevant.) There are six points in Article 17(1\\), and only when at least one of them applies is deletion (erasure) requited. Probably the most common in the sort of situation described in the question is: 17(1\\)(b) which reads:\n\n> the data subject \\[user] withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1\\), or point (a) of Article 9(2\\), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;\n\nBut note that point (b) applies only when \"there is no other legal ground for the processing\". Points (a), (c), or (e) might well also be relevant in the situation described in the question.\n\nHowever, Article 17(3\\) lists five exceptions (points (a) to (e)). If any of these apply, the Data Controller (DC) is not required to delete the data as requested by the DS. Particularly relevant may be point (a) of Article 17(3\\), which reads:\n\n> for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;\n\nWhere a message posted to the site is part of a public exchange of messages, and removing it would render the messages of others unclear so that their expression is hindered, this point may apply and deletion may not be required.\n\nNow to come to the specific situation in the question.\n\nThe result of the chain of events is that Bob has made a request for erasure, but through no intent of anyone's that request was lost and the DC never received it. To Bob it may seem as if it was intentionally ignored.\n\nIf the DC posts an announcement on the site that posts between Time X and Time Y may have been lost, Bob may well see it and know that a re\\-send of the article 17 request would be needed.\n\nBob would in any case be well advised to send a follow\\-up request/demand. If Bob does this the DC will presumably comply, or if an exception applies, tell Bob of the exception, including any needed supporting information. Problem solved.\n\nBut Bob may not make a 2nd request. If Bob complains to a Data Protection Authority (DPA) the DPA may forward this to the DC. In which case the DC will presumably respond that there is no record of the request having been made, and treat it as a new request. If the DPA is at all reasonable, and there is no indication that this DC is in the habit of ignoring Article 17 requests, that may well end the matter. If Bob provides the exact timestamp of his article 7 request, the DC may be able to trace the DB crash and restoration, which should settle the matter.\n\n> Bob's action at step 5 creates an obligation on my part to delete all of Bob's data.\n\nThat is stating the matter overly strongly. My understanding ism that if Bob has included personal information in forum posts or other public posts to the site, and others have then quoted this, the DC has no obligation to edit other people's posts to remove info about Bob. Aside from that, various exceptions may apply, described in Article 17(3\\). If one does apply, the DC has no such obligation. But in any case the DC should acknowledge the request (once the DC learns of it) and if the DC thinks an exception applies, should notify Bob of the exception and why it applies.\n\nIt is not yet clear to what extent the DC is obliged to remove Bob's info from stored backups, or to somehow ensure that if a backup is restored, Bob's data is not restored with it, or else is promptly removed again. Bob's obligation does not extend to cases where unreasonable time and effort would be required, considering the nature of the data involved.\n\nI cannot speak to how reasonable or unreasonable the DPA might be. My understanding is that individual complaints against non\\-commercial sites are not usually a high priority at DPAs, but that may not always be correct.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the website owner's obligations under GDPR in this scenario?\n\nA) The website owner is immediately liable for GDPR violations and must pay a fine.\n\nB) The website owner has no obligations under GDPR since it's a non-commercial hobby site.\n\nC) The website owner must proactively search for and comply with any lost deletion requests, even without user follow-up.\n\nD) The website owner should be prepared to explain the situation to the user or data protection authority if a complaint is made, and comply with any re-sent deletion requests.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most appropriate response in this situation. The website owner is not immediately liable (A) as the failure to comply was due to an accidental data loss, not intentional negligence. Even as a hobby site, GDPR still applies if personal data is processed (B is incorrect). The owner is not required to proactively search for lost requests (C) as this would be unreasonable. Instead, the correct approach (D) is to be prepared to explain the situation if a complaint is made, potentially by demonstrating the timing of the database crash and restoration.

But note that you can't just add such license terms.\n\n\t+ Either, the license is still the LGPL with some extra terms. But then, the terms of the LGPLv3 allow recipients to remove the additional restrictions.\n\t+ Or, this is an entirely separate license. But then it would no longer be the LGPL, and no longer be an Open Source license.Whether such additional terms create a separate license or can be removed from the license is currently being litigated in the US in the context of the Neo4J database, which added the \"Commons Clause\" restrictions to the AGPLv3\\.

This is sometimes known as an \u201copen core\u201d business model.\n\nDue to the limited copyleft effect of the LGPL, you can still combine the proprietary parts and the LGPL\\-covered parts into a single program, but doing so may be confusing for users. It should be absolutely clear which parts are LGPL\\-covered, and which are your proprietary parts that cannot be modified. However, you would not be able to prevent recipients from using the LGPL\\-covered parts without your proprietary components, i.e. they would always be able to remove any licensing checks etc.\n\nMore generally, it could make sense to think about why you want to publish any part of the software as Open Source.

The LGPL explicitly allows modification.\n\nOption B is the correct approach. By maintaining separate LGPL and commercial versions, the developer can protect the paid features while still offering an open source option.

But I am thinking it is best if I quit, move back in with my parents, get a different job, and then await the payment of previously earned salary. This is unless of course I have no legal claim to accrued wages unpaid.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What legal options do I have here?\n\nIt depends on how much you are owed. If it is less than $5000 (in a city court) you can sue them in small claims. If it is more than that, you'll have to sue them in a different court. \n\n> Do I have a claim to salary if I quit?\n\nYes, absolutely. You quitting does not relieve the business of its obligation to pay you for work you have already performed. In some states, they may also be required to pay you for accrued leave (sick/vacation time). You should not have to work for a company that does not pay you, we got rid of slavery a long time ago.\n\n> I'm nearly positive I would not have a claim to the 100% discretionary bonus.\n\nMaybe, maybe not. This depends on your contract and what you've been told. If you were told (in writing) that you would be given $X amount for a bonus for work performed in 2018, the bonus may no longer be discretionary because the company obligated themselves to pay it via a promise. Bonuses may be harder to argue in court, but if you have sufficient documentation that you were promised this bonus then you may have a claim to it. \n\nIf you do decide to go to court with this, gather up as much documentation as you can before quitting, print it out and save it to bring to court or to your lawyer. Make sure to get as much as possible, for example if it is an email, get the whole chain, as much of the headers as possible, etc. If you have voicemails, see if you can save them or record them for later. \n\n**Do not wait too long**, have a lawyer draft up a demand letter the moment you quit outlining exactly everything you are owed, including the bonus, vacation, sick days, etc. Deliver this via certified mail. Don't let them say \"well we'll get you taken care of next week/month/pay day\".

Three of the women were underage at the time this abuse is alleged to have occurred.\n\nIn the Law and Order episode \"Nocturne\", it is mentioned \"Child abuse can be prosecuted up to five years after the child's 18th birthday.\"\n\nOf course, that only applied to NYC. But in the state where these children claimed they were abused (Illinois) \\- which is back in 1998, TWENTY\\-ONE YEARS ago, is the claim even holdable in court?\n\nNote that in the episode they couldn't prosecute the molester on 151 counts (the amount of videos they found was 151\\), only two because two videos were the most recent.\n\nWhy are these charges being brought? Aren't they barred by the statute of limitations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In 2017 Illinois changed its law so that criminal charges for child abuse have no statute of limitations, and can be prosecuted as long as the accused is alive. This applies to all such crimes that occur after the new law was passed, and to all prior crimes on which the previous statute of limitations had not yet expired. See [this news story on the change](https://news.wttw.com/2017/08/14/illinois-eliminates-statutes-limitations-child-sex-abuse-crimes)\n\nPreviously, Illinois law allowed for prosecution for up to 20 years after the victim turned 18\\. Since the women Kelly is accused of having abused were 16 or younger in 1998 or later, the older statute of limitations would not have expired until at least 2020\\.\n\nMore than 35 states now have no statute of limitations for child abuse. \n\nBy the way, for civil actions, as opposed to criminal charges, the [Illinois law](https://corporate.findlaw.com/litigation-disputes/the-statute-of-limitations-for-childhood-sexual-abuse-in-illinois.html) now says:\n\n> an action for damages for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse must be commenced within 10 years of the date \\[a person turns 18] or within 5 years of the date the person abused discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover both (i) that the act of childhood sexual abuse occurred and (ii) that the injury was caused by the childhood sexual abuse. The fact that the person abused discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover that the act of childhood sexual abuse occurred is not, by itself, sufficient to start the discovery period under this subsection (b). Knowledge of the abuse does not constitute discovery of the injury or the causal relationship between any later\\-discovered injury and the abuse.\" (*ILCS \u00a7 5/13\\-202\\.2(b)*)\n\nThus, a civil suit by one of the alleged victims might or might not be barred by time, depending on details of the date of the abuse and the victim's age.\n\nIn short, do not take a drama as a source of legal advice.

In 2017, Illinois eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse crimes. This change applies to all new cases going forward and to all previous cases where the statute of limitations had not yet expired under the old law. The new law allows for prosecution at any time, as long as the accused is still alive. \n\nOption A is incorrect as it refers to an outdated law mentioned in the TV show \"Law & Order,\" which is not applicable to Illinois.\nOption B is partially correct but incomplete, as the new law also applies to older cases where the statute of limitations hadn't expired.\nOption D was the previous law in Illinois before the 2017 change, allowing prosecution up to 20 years after the victim turned 18, but is no longer accurate."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27633/can-only-the-government-official-who-appointed-an-employee-fire-that-employee", "docs_id": 27633, "title": "Can only the government official who appointed an employee fire that employee?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the PolitiFact article [Can Donald Trump fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller?](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/apr/12/can-donald-trump-fire-special-counsel-robert-muell/), [law professor Ric Simmons](http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/professor/ric-simmons/) is quoted:\n\n> The Supreme Court has stated (outside the special counsel context) that only the government official who appointed an employee has the power to fire that employee.\n\nTo what extent is this statement, supposedly by the US Supreme Court, true?\n\nI would like to learn more about this, but I was not able to find any relevant cases or other material.

For the right to assemble, this was recognized in [*De Jonge v. Oregon*, 299 U.S. 353 (1937\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Jonge_v._Oregon).\n\nBut note that the right only protects **peaceable** assembly. When it is alleged that improper violence or other properly unlawful action has occurred, the state may make that criminal, and indeed laws against rioting have existed throughout the history of the US. Whether a law is criminalizing peaceful assembly or prohibiting unlawful violence is a question that depends on th wording of the law, and the way it is applied\n\nIn [the *De Jonge* opinion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/299/353/) the Court wrote:\n\n> The broad reach of the statute as thus applied is plain. While defendant was a member of the Communist Party, that membership was not necessary to conviction on such a charge. A like fate might have attended any speaker, although not a member, who \"assisted in the conduct\" of the meeting. However innocuous the object of the meeting, however lawful the subjects and tenor of the addresses, however reasonable and timely the discussion, all those assisting in the conduct of the meeting would be subject to imprisonment as felons if the meeting were held by the Communist Party.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> While the States are entitled to protect themselves from the abuse of the privileges of our institutions through an attempted substitution of force and violence in the place of peaceful political action in order to effect revolutionary changes in government, none of our decisions goes to the length of sustaining such a curtailment of the right of free speech and assembly as the Oregon statute demands in its present application. In Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, under the New York statute defining criminal anarchy, the defendant was found to be responsible for a \"manifesto\" advocating the overthrow of the government by violence and unlawful means. Id. pp. 268 U. S. 656, 268 U. S. 662, 268 U. S. 663\\. In Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, under the California statute relating to criminal syndicalism, the defendant was found guilty of willfully and deliberately assisting in the forming of an organization for the purpose of carrying on a revolutionary class struggle by criminal methods ...\n> \n> \n> Freedom of speech and of the press are fundamental rights which are safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. *Gitlow v. New York*, supra, p. 268 U. S. 666; *Stromberg v. California*, supra, p. 283 U. S. 368; *Near v. Minnesota*, 283 U. S. 697, 283 U. S. 707; *Grosjean v. American Press Co*., 297 U. S. 233, 297 U. S. 243, 297 U. S. 244\\. The right of peaceable assembly is a right cognate to those of free speech and free press, and is equally fundamental. As this Court said in *United States v. Cruikshan*k, 92 U. S. 542, 92 U. S. 552:\n> \n> \n> \n> > implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances.\n> \n> \n> The First Amendment of the Federal Constitution expressly guarantees that right against abridgment by Congress. But explicit mention there does not argue exclusion elsewhere. For the right is one that cannot be denied without violating those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all civil and political institutions \\-\\- principles which the Fourteenth Amendment embodies in the general terms of its due process clause. *Hebert v. Louisiana*, 272 U. S. 312, 272 U. S. 316; *Powell v. Alabama*, 287 U. S. 45, 287 U. S. 67; *Grosjean v.

The Supreme Court's ruling in De Jonge v. Oregon established that the right to peaceable assembly, as protected by the First Amendment, applies to state laws through the Fourteenth Amendment. However, this protection only extends to peaceful assembly. States retain the authority to enact laws that criminalize violent or unlawful actions during public gatherings. \n\nOption A is incorrect because states do have some authority to regulate public gatherings, particularly when they involve violence or unlawful actions. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the First Amendment's protections have been incorporated to apply to state laws through the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\nOption D is incorrect as there is no such numerical threshold in constitutional protections for assembly.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the balance between constitutional protections and state authority in regulating public gatherings."}}
