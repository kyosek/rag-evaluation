If so, how significant of a contractual breach would be required. I\u2019m looking for a hypothetical example or even better some case law if it exists.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under U.S. law, the answer is no.\n\nYou can defeat an arbitration agreement on the grounds that the contract containing an arbitration agreement was not entered into in the first place (e.g. the person who signed the agreement was not you but was instead another person whose name is also John Lee who also lives in Los Angeles, but is ten years older than you; or the person who agreed to the arbitration agreement was a two year year old randomly pushing buttons on a smart phone). \n\nBut, if a contract was formed, to the extent that the arbitration agreement so provides, all breaches of the contract, no matter how material, are subject to arbitration. Generally, this will be true, even if the contract was a contract of adhesion (e.g. a clickwrap contract).\n\nThe law outside the United States may differ materially from this rule.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company, TechGiant, has an employment contract with Sarah that includes an arbitration clause. Sarah later discovers that TechGiant has been systematically underpaying her for overtime work, which is a clear violation of labor laws and a material breach of her employment contract. Sarah wants to sue TechGiant in court, arguing that their material breach should invalidate the arbitration agreement. Under U.S. law, what is the most likely outcome?\n\nA) The court will throw out the arbitration agreement due to TechGiant's material breach, allowing Sarah to proceed with her lawsuit in court.\n\nB) The court will uphold the arbitration agreement, but will allow Sarah to choose whether to proceed with arbitration or litigation.\n\nC) The court will uphold the arbitration agreement, requiring Sarah to resolve her dispute through arbitration as specified in the contract.\n\nD) The court will invalidate the entire employment contract, including the arbitration clause, due to TechGiant's material breach.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Under U.S. law, a material breach of contract cannot be used to invalidate an arbitration agreement within that contract. As long as the contract was validly formed in the first place, all disputes arising from the contract - including claims of material breach - must be resolved through arbitration if the agreement so stipulates. This is true even if the contract is considered a contract of adhesion. The only way to defeat an arbitration agreement is to prove that the contract itself was never validly formed, such as through fraud or lack of capacity. In this case, since Sarah's employment contract was validly formed and includes an arbitration clause, she would be required to pursue her claims through arbitration rather than in court, regardless of the materiality of TechGiant's breach."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60731/recording-phone-calls-in-florida-and-obtaining-all-party-consent", "docs_id": 60731, "title": "Recording Phone Calls in Florida and Obtaining All-Party Consent", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to [FL Statute 934\\.03](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0900-0999/0934/Sections/0934.03.html) (outside of limited exceptions), you are required to gain all\\-party consent to record communications deemed to have an expectation of privacy.\n\nIt seems this includes when a customer calls a business although I would argue in 2021 no one would be shocked to find out calls to a business are recorded.

If there are some countries that are known to or expected o not recognize Web Wed marriages, I would appreciate the clarification.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n* I am aware of the new laws (sometimes temporary) put in place because of Covid\\-19 restrictions, but I am not asking about that. Web Wed claims that they have been arranging weddings since 2015, so apparently their legal framework has nothing to do with the temporary Covid\\-19 provisions. My question is about if Web Wed as a specific company provides legally recognized services (with or without Covid\\-19 allowances).\n* Web Wed explicitly claims that their arrangements are NOT proxy marriages, so my question is about the legality of the alternative approach that they take.\n* I am hoping for answers more specific than generic \"this is not possible\" responses without knowing Web Wed's specific approach (such as the answers offered to [Quora's question on the same topic](https://www.quora.com/Is-webwed-site-that-marries-people-online-legit), not posted by me).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: According to an article in *Bride's* [\"Zoom Weddings Are Now Legal!\"](https://www.brides.com/virtual-weddings-legal-new-york-4842735) dated April 2021,several states including California, New York, Ohio, and Colorado have made **temporary** arrangements to make it legal for weddings to take place over video conference in response to the pandemic. Several also permit remote applications for marriage licenses.\n\nAccording to the June 2021 article [\"Is it legal to have a virtual wedding?\"](https://wedfuly.com/is-it-legal-to-have-a-virtual-wedding/) from *Wedfuly* states permitting such weddings include New York, California, and Illinois. However, in Florida, Hawaii, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas the article says that both parties to the wedding, and the officiant must all be physically present in the same place, although the wedding may be displayed on video for people at other locations.\n\nAccording to the *New York Times* article [\"Why Virtual Weddings Are No Longer Legal in New York\"](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/nyregion/legal-virtual-weddings-marriages.html) dated July 16, 2021, on June 25, 2021 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo **ended** the executive order he originally issued in April 2020 allowing couples to be married online.\n\nAccording to that NYT article new legislation would be required for such weddings to be legal in New York again.\n\nOther states might cancel or change their temporary rules allowing \"virtual\" weddings at any time. The New York decision apparently came as a surprise, causing a number of scheduled weddings to be canceled or changed to in\\-person events. One planning such a wedding would do well to check current rules in the state involved.\n\nCitizenship or permanent residence should not matter to the validity of such weddings, as it does not matter for in\\-person weddings. However, it seems that both parties and the officiant must all be physically present within the same US state or other jurisdiction for the marriage to be valid.\n\nNot all countries recognize the validity of such \"virtual\" marriages. It is specifically mentioned that the UK does not.\n\nAlso, it seems that while such weddings were lawful in New York, the temporary rules required that both members of the couple, and the officiant, be physically within the state of New York for the wedding to be legal. Other states seem to have similar rules.\n\nIf the members of the couple are not in the same state, it seems that the wedding becomes a [\"proxy wedding\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_marriage). This is a process where one person is not present at all, but is represented by a \"proxy\". Proxy weddings have been lawful far back in history, at least as far as the middle ages in Europe, and perhaps farther. They are currently lawful in only a few US states. According to the Wikipedia article linked above these are: Texas, Colorado, Kansas, and Montana. Such weddings are invalid in all other states. Some of those states limit proxy marriages to active members of the US Military on deployment.\n\nThe service *Web Wed* seems to claim that members of a couple may be located anywhere or the virtual wedding, but this appears incorrect. They also claim a patent on some forms of this process, and seem to say that they are the only legitimate provider of virtual weddings, but the articles linked above quote various officiants and services that have performed hundreds of such marriages.\n\nUnder the \"full faith and credit\" clause of the US Constitution, marriages that are legal under the laws of any US state must be recognized by all other US states. Other countries may or may not recognize such marriages, depending on their own laws.\n\nI do not find any court case in which such a wedding was challenged and a court ruled on its validity, one way or the other.\n\n**Additional info**\n\nAn answer by user Roberto says that Web Wed does this by having an officiant in Utah County, Utah. The Utah County Clerk's office [page on Web Ceremonies](https://www.utahcounty.gov/Dept/ClerkAud/WebCeremonyFAQ.html) does say that the counter permits weddings by video conference as long as the \"host location\" is in the state of Utah. However, it does not mention WebWed specifically, and some of the information does not match. WebWed's site says:\n\n> Once you have the license, there is no rush to perform the ceremony. Once issued thru the courts the marriage licenses never expire, so once you have it you can get legally married whenever you wish. However, please note that each state expiration is different. You must adhere to that specific state policy. In most states, you have 30 days to get married after the license is issued.\n\nUtah marriage licenses are valid for only 30 days and are not issued by a court, so that does not seem to be what WebWed is talking about. The public pages of their site do not seem to mention Utah specifically.\n\nThe WebWed site also says:\n\n> A state issued marriage license is required to use this service. Please note that it is the registers/users responsibility to verify and abide by state, county, and armed forces marriage laws prior to using this service.\n\nWebWed's site advises government officials to reject any online marriage not preformed through their service. If such marriages are lawful and valid, they will be available to anyone that follows the proper rules. US states do not grant exclusive rights to specific commercial services in such cases.\n\nUS Federal Law\n--------------\n\n[8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101) which is the Definitions section for CHAPTER 12\u2014 IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY, says that:\n\n> (a) As used in this chapter\u2014\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (a) (35\\) The term \u201cspouse\u201d, \u201cwife\u201d, or \u201chusband\u201d do not include a spouse, wife, or husband by reason of any marriage ceremony where the contracting parties thereto are not physically present in the presence of each other, unless the marriage shall have been consummated.\n\n\"consummated\" is not defined in this section, and so presumably has its normal meaning in regard to marriage, that is, that the parties have had sexual relations at least once after the marriage occurred.\n\nThis section would apply to proxy marriages as well as to \"virtual\" marriages, but applies only in the context of immigration law.\n\nNormally US Federal law leaves the issue of marriages to the states, except where there is a claim that Federal constitutional rights are being infringed, such as in the cases of [*Loving v. Virginia*, 388 U.S. 1 (1967\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia) which forbade states to prohibit interracial marriage, and [*Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644 (2015\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) which forbade states to prohibit same\\-sex marriage.\n\nUtah Law\n--------\n\n[Section 30\\-1\\-6 of the Utah Code](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title30/Chapter1/30-1-S7.html) provides that:\n\n> 30\\-1\\-7\\. Marriage licenses \\-\\- Use within state \\-\\- Expiration.  \n> \n> (1\\) No marriage may be solemnized in this state without a license issued by the county clerk of any county of this state.  \n> \n> (2\\) A license issued within this state by a county clerk may only be used within this state.  \n> \n> (3\\) A license that is not used within 32 days after the day on which the licensed is issued is void.\n\nNote that 30\\-1\\-6(2\\) says that any such marriage shall take place \"within the state\". Nothing in this section, or any other section of chapter 30, specifically authorizes a marriage by video conference where one or both parties are not within the state when the marriage occurs. It is not clear on what basis the Utah County clerk's office considers such marriages valid.\n\n[Section 30\\-1\\-8 of the Utah Code](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title30/Chapter1/30-1-S9.html) provides that:\n\n> (b) Each applicant and if an applicant is a minor, the minor's consenting parent or legal guardian, shall appear in person before the clerk and provide legal documentation to establish the following information ...\n\nHowever that may be relevant only when one or both parties to the marriage is a minor.\n\nI can find no other provisions of the Utah code which control applications for a license by web, or specifies where a marriage may or may not be held, or who is or is not required to be physically present at a valid marriage ceremony.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on current U.S. laws regarding virtual weddings, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Virtual weddings are now permanently legal in all 50 U.S. states due to changes implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nB) Virtual weddings are only legal for U.S. citizens and permanent residents, regardless of their location at the time of the ceremony.\n\nC) Virtual weddings may be legal in some states, but typically require both parties and the officiant to be physically present within the same state.\n\nD) Virtual weddings conducted by Web Wed are legally recognized in all countries due to their patented process and apostille service.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While some states temporarily allowed virtual weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic, the legality varies by state and is subject to change. Most states that permit virtual weddings require both parties and the officiant to be physically present within the same state for the ceremony to be legally valid. Answer A is incorrect because virtual weddings are not permanently legal in all states, and some states have already ended temporary allowances. Answer B is false because citizenship or residency status doesn't typically affect the validity of the marriage, but location does.

Is it common, or is the below example just a legal anecdote that ideally needs to be fixed by lobbying/pushing the law makers in the right direction?\n\n---\n\nIn New Zealand, people over 18 can [freely buy and sell](https://www.trademe.co.nz/sports/hunting-shooting/air-guns-parts/air-pistols) air pistols. No firearms license is required (unless you are younger than 18\\).\n\nHowever, if Bob wants to buy an air pistol from say Amazon, he needs to apply to the Police for a [permit to import](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/whole.html#DLM72906). The most amazing/amusing thing here is that, unlike *real*, non\\-air guns (e.g. a regular rifle, an application to import which can be considered just by any \"member of the Police\" who \"must\" grant it if certain criteria is met as per section 18(2,3\\)), an application to import an air pistol (which is [\"restricted airgun\"](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/DLM72627.html#DLM5829905)) has to be considered by the Commissioner (the head of the NZ Police themselves) who only \"may\" grant it, and *only* if there is a \"special reason\" to it (section 18(4,5\\)).\n\nThe law does not elaborate on what \"special reasons\" are, but the Police still [has its idea](https://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/sights-imported-airguns-and-military-style-firearms-new-gun-laws). In a nut shell, if Bob simply wants to practice target shooting with an air pistol at his rural backyard, or control the population of rats threatening his duck flock, he is out of luck: import is effectively banned for him. But he still can just buy the same thing locally \u2014 if he is lucky enough to find it.\n\nNow, there is more to it. Say Bob, who routinely buys stuff from Amazon, sees there an air pistol he wants for only $50, *new*, whereas locally he can find it only for no less than $500, *used*. He orders it without hesitation, thinking that if he can freely trade and use it locally, surely there will be no troubles buying it from overseas. He has no idea that there is section 16 which, in its [previous version](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/43.0/DLM72903.html) could send him to jail for 1 year (in the [current version](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/DLM72903.html) they've added \"without reasonable excuse\" which now could possibly save Bob from becoming a prisoner). Bob's Amazon order arrives at the customs which, upon not finding a matching import permit, forfeits it by way of transfer of title to the Crown. Bob loses the money \u2014 getting punished for not being clairvoyant enough to expect that such a law could exist. Moreover, he should be thankful that no charges get laid against him.\n\nApparently, the legislative intent here was to limit the number of air pistols in the country: if they were as accessible as they are in the world, the number of crimes involving them would have gone up. However, managing the risk of unlawful use just by keeping the prices 10 times higher (as opposed to either completely banning trade/possession or applying the same \"special reason\" threshold as for import) does seem like a very odd, peculiar solution.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The import of slaves into the United States was [banned in 1808](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_Prohibiting_Importation_of_Slaves), although slavery itself and the buying and selling of slaves [remained legal on a Federal level until 1865](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).\n\nThere were, of course, many many violations of the law against importing new slaves.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of historical U.S. legislation regarding slavery, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The importation of slaves and domestic slavery were both banned simultaneously in 1808.\n\nB) The importation of slaves was banned in 1808, but domestic slavery remained legal at the federal level until 1865.\n\nC) Domestic slavery was outlawed in 1808, but the importation of slaves continued to be legal until 1865.\n\nD) Both the importation of slaves and domestic slavery remained legal at the federal level until 1865.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, which came into effect in 1808, banned the import of new slaves into the United States. However, this did not outlaw slavery itself within the country. Domestic slavery, including the buying and selling of slaves already in the U.S., remained legal at the federal level until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, which abolished slavery throughout the nation.

For example, a person planning to kill their neighbor in what is supposed to look like an accident would be different than a fight escalating and leading to the death of one of the people involved.\n\nOne distinguishing factor between \"murder\" and \"manslaughter\" is whether or not there was premeditation, meaning the perpetrator made the decision to kill someone before it occurred. However, I wonder, how long before the actual killing does this decision need to be made for it to be considered \"murder\" as opposed to \"manslaughter\"?\n\n---\n\n*Note:* I am mostly interested in answers regarding laws in Europe, but answers regarding other jurisdictions are welcome as well.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on the jurisdiction, but in the U.S. first degree murder will always require premeditation. The time required can be quite short too... down to nearly instantly in some jurisdictions.\n\nSecond degree Murder will typically cover Murder that is \"a crime of passion\" (i.e. you come home to find you spouse in bed with another man/woman and fly into a violent rage and kill the intruder.). Generally in jurisdictions that don't have instantaneous premeditation, this is used. If they do, 2nd degree includes crimes where you intend to harm the victim and got to carried away and killed them (often called Felony Murder... this could bump it to Murder in the First Degree).\n\nManslaughter usually implies no intent at all, but either negligence or a death that occurred as an unintended result of a lesser crime (Misdemeanor crimes generally net Manslaughter if they caused a death).\n\nIn Common Law, the intend doesn't play much of a role in the charge as it does in the sentencing. Common Law trials will first establish that a crime occurred, so intent has little to do with verdict, but with jail time (And in the U.S., depending on the state, Death Penalty. While not the only crime on the books that can get death penalty convictions, First Degree Murder is far and away the most common.

Again returning to the point that the TOS may itself say \"No you may not\", the interesting question is what to conclude if there is no such statement, for example I did not see anything in the PBS TOS that restricts access to the US (I didn't look very deeply). Terms of service can't be secret: you can't be held to following rules that you cannot reasonably know of. If you attempt to access a page that uses un\\-announced geo\\-blocking technology and it informs you that you can't use the page because of your location, then you have effectively been put on notice that there is a rule.

Anyway, I have already said that \u2013 my point here was that regardless if the authorities do not perform such exploit, it is a very real possibility that should material claimed to be plaintext ever be considered evidence, that other parties such as the prosecution (who will most likely have had access to examine/read/copy the hard drive for their own independent examination) would be able to perform such attack. Such attack would not be necessarily complex, though I\u2019m not saying it would be in any means easy (or computationally cheap), I am just saying it is entirely possible, and again the overarching point being it is impossible to prove the key is ever said key.\n\nAnd yes, I realise that a good prosecution could provide such circumstantual evidence, though in my belief circumstantual, such as:\nData y was stored by/accessed by defendant, we can prove this (though not actually prove its the key), we believe this is the key (because of a,b,c,) and hence this is the plaintext of the defendants hard drive, which is therefore incriminating.\n\nMY PRIOR RESEARCH:\nOf course without the key it is impossible to actually \u2018decrypt\u2019 said data (provided no key reuse), I know that authorities/prosecution wouldn\u2019t be able to \u2018decrypt\u2019 the hard drive if they didn\u2019t have the key. The point is, again to reiterate, that the very mathematical nature of this predicament further creates/also is the predicament that it is impossible to prove the data produced is actually the \u2018original\u2019 plaintext. Hence, given that the authorities cannot actually \u2018decrypt\u2019 the data without the key that is used, I would like to know if it is legally valid for them to say that they have done so in any case? \n\nI am asking this as I have researched and have not found any cases that are public, neither in the scenario/principle described, nor have I even found any that actually involve unbreakable \u2018one\\-time\\-pad\u2019 encryption. I ask this as again, if it were to be legally valid then it would enable anybody to perform some clever calculations to effectively invent incriminating evidence.\n\n<https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/10/uk_police_can_n.html>\nThe comments section of this page provides interesting discussion on the topic, of which is scarce generally.

In contrast, if it is self\\-executing then it can be used as a defense. \n\nThe legal effect of the 1967 Refugee Protocol, \"Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees\", 19 U.S.T. 6223, 606 U.N.T.S. 267 (January 31, 1967\\), and in particular the question of whether it is self\\-executing is disputed, at least, academically. \n\nBut, a State Department legal opinion which has not clearly and explicitly been overruled by the courts, states that it is not self\\-executing, despite the fact that a lower Article I court in *In re Dunbar*, 141\\. \\& N. Dec. 310 (Board of Immigration Appeals 1973\\), had previously held that the Protocol was self\\-executing (despite ruling against the immigrant on the merits in interpreting the obligations created under the Protocol).\n\nThe issue was raised and not resolved in a case related to mass migration from Haiti during the George H.W. Bush administration, but that issue was not reached in the judgment in that case. This position was supported by a [1991 State Department legal memorandum](https://www.justice.gov/file/23326/download), which claimed that the 1967 protocol was not self\\-executing. A [law review article from 1993](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/997/) examined this issue rather comprehensively, questioning the conclusion of the State Department Memo. A [1997 law review article](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1154&context=bjil) argues that it does have binding effect but that the U.S. has erroneously failed to treat it that way in either the courts or in some of its administrative policies.\n\nThe thrust of the executive branch legal opinions and case law regarding the Protocol appears to be that it is not self\\-executing.\n\n**The Protocol As A Guide To Statutory Interpretation**\n\nOn the other hand, even though there is not an explicit U.S. law statute providing a defense to illegal entry, one could argue that since refugee status is recognized in the U.S. that the entry is not illegal. And, the Refugee Convention could definitely be used as evidence of legislative intent in interpreting the law to determine if U.S. law implicitly prohibits such a prosecution, in the face of the question of whether or not other legal authorization to give someone refugee status makes the entry not illegal. \n\nIn particular, \"it is absolutely clear that the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980 \\[Pub. L. No. 96\\-212, 94 Stat. 102] was intended to implement American obligations under the Protocol.\" (from a [2000 law review article](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=2482&context=articles)).

The self-executing status of the 1967 Refugee Protocol is disputed, with some lower courts and academic opinions supporting its self-executing nature, while the State Department has argued it is not self-executing. However, even if not directly applicable as a defense, the Protocol could be used to guide the interpretation of U.S. refugee laws, particularly the Refugee Act of 1980, which was intended to implement U.S. obligations under the Protocol. Courts have previously used the Protocol to interpret U.S. refugee laws, making this the most accurate statement among the options provided.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Protocol's self-executing status is not definitively established. Option B is too absolute, as the Protocol could still influence interpretation even if not explicitly mentioned in illegal entry laws.

However, in this case, there was a verbal agreement that could potentially be enforced. The outcome depends on several factors:\n\n1. The lack of a written agreement containing the money-back guarantee weakens the buyer's position.\n2. The presence of a third-party witness strengthens the buyer's claim about the verbal agreement.\n3. The court would need to determine which version of events (buyer's or seller's) is more credible.\n4. The existence of a written bill of sale without the guarantee clause complicates the situation.\n\nTherefore, while the buyer may attempt to enforce the verbal agreement in court, success is not guaranteed and depends on the presentation of evidence and the court's judgment of credibility.

Or, suppose that additional elections produced Senate majorities of a different party than the President, such as a continuation of the 2016 arrangement. Could the Senate simply decide to stop confirming Presidential nominees to be judges on the Supreme Court, even after there are no judges left on the Supreme Court? If not, why not? \n\nIf unclear, absent a Supreme Court to authoritatively interpret the constitution, who would decide the answer? \n\n*While we would hope the \"no judges remaining\" would take a while, a disaster or major attack could cause such a situation to arise within a short period.*\n\nIf so, this would be an interesting twist in constitutional law, that the Founding Fathers may not have considered. \n\n---\n\n[Article II, Section 2, of the US Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section2) states:\n\n> \\[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law\\[.]\n\n*A separate question about if the President could do something similar is [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7189/could-the-president-abolish-the-supreme-court); they seem separate because of the stronger duty to nominate (\"shall\") imposed on the President.*\n\n*Could* is intended to refer to *legally could;* political feasibility considerations would be at [Politics](http://politics.stackexchange.com), not Law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the Senate took the extreme measure of attempting to abolish the Supreme Court, there's nothing in the Constitution that requires them to confirm any of the President's nominees. However, attempting to dismantle one of the three branches would be nothing short of a coup d'etat.\n\nThe president has some options here:\n\n> He \\[the President] may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses \\[of Congress], or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper. \\-\\- Article 2, Sec. 3\n\nBasically, this means that, in an extraordinary circumstance (total defiance of the entire Senate would easily qualify), the President can lock the Senate in their chamber until they straighten their heads out. And when I say \"lock them in\", I don't mean that figuratively. The Constitution requires that a majority of each house be present to constitute a quorum to do business. The President could order up to 51 Senators to convene, and if they refused, could order the FBI or whoever to physically arrest them and drag them to the capitol building. This was actually done in Wisconsin by Gov. Scott Walker in 2011 when 14 Democrat Senators fled the state to avoid the quorum needed to vote on a controversial bill that they couldn't block. It would be messy for sure, and as far as I know, has never been done with the U.S. Senate. But there is precedent for it.\n\nAdditionally, the President could use his vacancy power and just appoint a justice. Legally, he would have to wait for the Senate to be in recess, and the Senate would likely arrange things so that never happens. However, if there were no justices left, he could just appoint a Chief Justice (the Constitution provides that there be at least one justice). Even if he did this in the most \"in\\-your\\-face\" illegal way, with both middle fingers extended, the only judge that can tell him he did wrong is the guy he just seated. Of course, the Senate would move to impeach that judge, and probably the President too for having appointed him illegally, but you need a supermajority of both houses to remove them from office. If you had such a supermajority, then the game is over at this point; there's no way the President would step down in such a situation (who would force him?) and we're in a civil war because we don't have a functional government anymore.\n\nIn reality, this isn't an \"interesting twist in constitutional law that the Founding Fathers may not have considered.\" It's that if Congress ever went totally off the rails like that, the President, or the people would have to step up and hope they could end the standoff peacefully without resorting to violence, because this is the kind of thing that revolutions are fought over.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a scenario where the Senate refuses to confirm any of the President's Supreme Court nominees, even after all justices have left the court, which of the following actions would the President have the constitutional authority to take?\n\nA) Unilaterally appoint a Chief Justice without Senate confirmation\nB) Order the FBI to physically arrest Senators and force them to convene\nC) Adjourn both Houses of Congress indefinitely\nD) Use the vacancy power to appoint a justice during a Senate recess\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \n\nA) is incorrect because the President does not have the authority to unilaterally appoint a Supreme Court Justice without Senate confirmation, even in extreme circumstances.\n\nB) is incorrect.

Any specific state laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of immigration status might apply. \n\nIn short, this is an issue still not clearly settled. There seems to be no law or regulation requiring banks to ask for citizenship information, much less to deny accounts based on it, and it would be well to seek a bank with a different policy if possible.\n\nThe above is very US\\-specific.

While FDIC Regulation 500 prohibits discrimination based on national origin for loans, it does not explicitly cover immigration status or bank account openings. Cases like Perez v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. are challenging such practices, but there is no definitive ruling yet. The issue is not clearly settled, and banks argue that they have the right to deny accounts based on increased risks associated with non-citizen status.

There seem to be quite a few countries where there are few*er* protections for criminal defendants, but I can't find any where \"guilty until proven innocent\" is literally the case. What I mean by this is that there are non\\-US jurisdictions that allow defendants to be convicted on evidence that would be thrown out of a US court as unconstitutionally obtained, but the prosecution still has to present this evidence and use it to convince the court of the defendant's guilt. The court does not simply assume, \"The prosecutor said it so it must be true, GUILTY!\".\n\nI would define a \"guilty until proven innocent\" legal regime as incorporating most, if not all, of the following criteria:\n\n* The contents of an indictment or other formal accusation are presumed true unless specifically rebutted in a court of law.\n* Defendants in court who plead Not Guilty are required to prove their innocence in order to obtain an acquittal.\n* Simply disproving the prosecution's evidence is insufficient for an acquittal unless the defendant *also* affirmatively proves their innocence.\n\nAre there any jurisdictions anywhere in the world where \"guilty until proven innocent\" is the rule for criminal cases?\n\nJust to be clear, I'm *not* asking for examples of jurisdictions that are not as friendly to defendants (e.g. hearsay is admissible, no doctor\\-patient privilege, trial by jury not guaranteed, expanded authority of judges to issue search warrants, no right to a \"speedy\" trial, etc.), but something more approaching, \"Oh no, John accused me of breaking into his garage. If I can't affirmatively *prove* to a jury that I was in America all of last month and couldn't have broken into his garage here in Ruritania, I'm going to prison!\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: English defamation law is considered to put the burden of proof on the defendant, and until 2010 English law supported a criminal charge of libel\\- so called \"criminal libel\" or \"defamatory libel.\" It should be noted that criminal libel was never affirmatively enshrined in English law, but it came about as an outgrowth of English common law. It was never heavily prosecuted, but was a crime and did carry a potential sentence of one to two years in jail.\n\nA comprehensive review of criminal libel in English law was published as \"Working Paper No. 84 Criminal Libel\". [You can read it here.](https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lawcom-prod-storage-11jsxou24uy7q/uploads/2016/08/No.084-Criminal-Libel.pdf)\n\nIn England, when actions for libel are brought, the *defamatory statements are assumed to be false.* This assumes the defendant/publisher to be in the wrong, and they must demonstrate their actions to be reasonable. At the time, the defenses available (see paragraph 3\\.17 in linked reference) to the defendant/publisher were either:\n\n* Assert that the statements are not actually defamatory, or do not constitute libel on other technical grounds (e.g. were not actually published in a fixed medium)\n* Make an affirmative defense of \"justification\"\\- proving both that the defamatory statements were actually true AND that that there is a public interest in publishing the statements.\n* Make an affirmative defense of \"fair comment\"\\- similar to justification but for statements that are a matter of opinion rather than a matter of objective fact.\n\nThis satisfies your first condition\\- the statements named by the plaintiff/prosecutor are assumed to be false and defamatory (note another peculiarity of English common law was that actions of libel could be brought by a prosecutor but could also be brought by private citizens... even if they weren't the ones being libeled). This means the prosecutor was assumed to be in the right, and the defendant was assumed to be in the wrong.\n\nParagraph 3\\.19 in the linked document lays it out for us:\n\n```\nThe onus of proving the truth of the statement lies on the \ndefendant who must also prove the facts by reason of which \nit was for the public benefit for the statement to be \npublished. Accordingly, the person defamed need give no \nevidence to rebut the allegations made in the plea of \njustification, leaving the defendant to prove that the \nlibel was true and that the publication was for the public \nbenefit.\n\n```\n\nNote that this is a departure from most other western legal systems in two ways. In the US we say that \"Truth is an absolute defense against libel claims.\" If the statement is true, then you can say it under US law, no matter how badly it damages someone's reputation. Note that this is not true for common law criminal libel\\- merely being true is not sufficient defense, the statements must both be true AND there must be a public interest in publishing the statements. Thus a newspaper or gossip rag that published lovers' intimate details could be prosecuted for criminal libel even if those details are true. Truth is not an absolute defense.\n\nAt this point we have also satisfied your second condition. Once an action of libel has successfully been brought, the defendant must assert some defense or else they automatically lose. Either they must contend that the alleged defamatory statements don't technically rise to the level of libel under the law, or they must prove the truth of their statements and provide a compelling public interest in making those statements.\n\nOther legal systems handle libel very differently. In the USA, libel laws vary on a state\\-by\\-state basis. In general however, a plaintiff wanting to bring suit for libel must provide evidence that the libelous statements are in fact false. If they cannot provide some evidence to that effect, there is no prima facie case of libel and the defense could move for a summary judgement. As has already been said, truth is an absolute defense in the USA.\n\nWhile the crime of libel no longer exists in England, all of this carries over into modern\\-day civil libel actions. The onus is still on the defendant to prove their innocence. Modern observers have coined the terms \"libel tourism\" and \"libel terrorism\" to refer to the practice of attacking critics in English courts rather than more appropriate venues specifically because of the fewer protections afforded to defendants there. The US in particular passed the SPEECH Act in 2010, saying that findings of libel from foreign courts are unenforceable in the US, largely due English libel tourism.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In English defamation law prior to 2010, which of the following statements is true regarding the burden of proof in criminal libel cases?\n\nA) The prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant made false and defamatory statements.\nB) The defendant had to prove that the statements were true, but did not need to show public interest in their publication.\nC) The defendant had to prove both the truth of the statements and that there was public interest in their publication.\nD) Truth was an absolute defense against criminal libel charges, regardless of public interest.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In English defamation law before 2010, the burden of proof in criminal libel cases fell on the defendant. The correct answer is C because the defendant had to make an affirmative defense of \"justification\" by proving both that the defamatory statements were actually true AND that there was a public interest in publishing the statements. This differs from many other legal systems, including the US, where truth is typically an absolute defense against libel claims. Options A and D are incorrect as they reflect more defendant-friendly systems not applicable to English law at the time. Option B is partially correct but incomplete, as proving truth alone was not sufficient - public interest also had to be demonstrated."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87330/what-makes-something-qualify-as-indirect-unlawful-discrimination-versus-simply-b", "docs_id": 87330, "title": "What makes something qualify as indirect unlawful discrimination versus simply being lawful practice?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Imagine that Nike makes a particular model/style of trainer, for example, called the Nike Jordan 4128s, which come in a men's and women's version respectively.

I know that [Canada avoids inquiring into the \"source\" of the disadvantage or blaming it on an individual's choice](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18510/index.do), but I have no idea what the approach in the U.K. is to this aspect.)\n\n### 19(2\\)(c): would this practice put a particular male claimant at that disadvantage?\n\nDepending on evidence showing that the particular claimant wants to purchase the Nike Jordan 4128s (men's), then yes.\n\n### 19(2\\)(d): is it the case that the Nike store cannot show the practice to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim?\n\nMy prediction is that the store would be able to justify the practice as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.\n\nOne example of a legitimate aim: a charging policy at swimming pools that disproportionately affected \"disabled swimmers\" was found to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, being part of \"an overall financial structure which covers the provision of a wide range of public services\" ([https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2022/1588\\.html](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2022/1588.html))\n\nOther [examples of legitimate aims](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/check-what-type-of-discrimination-youve-experienced/justifying-discrimination/): \"running an efficient service,\" \"requirements of a business,\" \"desire to make a profit.\" However,\n\n> Economic reasons alone are not enough to justify discrimination. Someone can\u2019t justify discrimination by saying it\u2019s cheaper to discriminate. But costs can be taken into account as part of the justification if the person can show there are other good enough reasons for the treatment.\n\nSo, depending on the business rationale, and the proportionality of the discount compared to the business need (e.g. cost of holding extra stock, risk of failing to sell stock as a new model comes in, etc.), the price differential could be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. This will depend on the evidence. I predict most stores would be able to justify a modest and occasional price differential, even in the case that the production costs of each shoe are identical.\n\n### Summary\n\nI see four ways through this analysis, each leading to the conclusion that this would not be indirect discrimination:\n\n* a narrow characterization of the \"practice\" as simply selling the women's version at \u00a3150 (probably too narrow of a view)\n* a broad characterization of the \"practice\" as selling all versions at a discount from time to time, albeit not necessarily at the exact same time\n* a view that any disadvantage experienced by men is due to their choice not the price discrepancy (dubious)\n* the price discrepancy is a proportionate means to achieve a legitimate aim (admittedly, a thin analysis requiring more research)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here is a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A shoe store is selling Nike Jordan 4128s, with the men's version priced at \u00a3200 and the women's version on sale for \u00a3150. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential indirect discrimination under the UK Equality Act 2010?\n\nA) This pricing strategy clearly constitutes unlawful indirect discrimination against male customers and cannot be justified.\n\nB) As long as both men and women are allowed to purchase either version, there is no possibility of indirect discrimination occurring.\n\nC) This could potentially be indirect discrimination, but would likely be justifiable if the store can demonstrate it is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate business aim.\n\nD) The pricing difference is too small to be considered discriminatory under the law, regardless of any disparate impact on male customers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario could potentially meet the criteria for indirect discrimination under Section 19 of the Equality Act 2010, as it may put male customers at a particular disadvantage. However, the pricing strategy would not automatically be unlawful. If challenged, the store would have the opportunity to show that the practice is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, such as managing inventory or overall business efficiency. Courts have accepted business and economic factors as potentially legitimate aims, though cost alone is not sufficient justification. The store would need to provide evidence that the pricing strategy is proportionate to the business need. Therefore, while this could be indirect discrimination, it would likely be justifiable if the store can demonstrate a legitimate aim and proportionality, making option C the most accurate statement."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35770/what-recourse-do-i-have-when-someone-has-bought-an-old-domain-of-mine-and-mirro", "docs_id": 35770, "title": "What recourse do I have when someone has bought an old domain of mine, and mirrored my content (badly)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am based in the UK and I have run the [opendomesday.org](https://opendomesday.org) website as a free, non\\-profit history site for many years.\n\nWhen I originally built the site, about 8 years ago, I registered it at [domesdaymap.co.uk](http://domesdaymap.co.uk).

(This\n> is in the state of Georgia, USA.) I prefer approaches that do not\n> involve paying an attorney, since that fast becomes expensive and\n> counterproductive.\n\nChild support generally either is, or can be reduced to, by court process, a money judgment. The money judgment can then be enforced by writ of execution and levy attaching tangible personal property of a debtor, to the extent that the asset is not exempt from creditors claims. The money judgment can also be used to garnish bank accounts.\n\nIf someone has a manifest ability to pay child support, but has willfully failed to do so, a court can incarcerate the child support debtor for contempt of court until such time as the child support debt voluntarily turns over the assets that the debtor has an ability to pay the child support debt with. In theory, however, an inability to pay child support is a full defense to a contempt of court proceeding.\n\nAll of these kinds of legal child support collection proceedings are technical, and it would be very challenging to accomplish these goals through the court process without a lawyer. The going rate for contingent fee collection of child support debts is usually 50% of the gross amount recovered, plus out of pocket costs for filing fees and process servers out of your half, if you can find an attorney willing to take on a child support collection case at all.\n\nSometimes collection agencies will agree to collect child support for a similar fee. Collection agencies can make negative credit reports, and nag the child support debtor regularly, but otherwise have the same remedies available to them as a lawyer.\n\nMany states have procedures for the state child support collection agency to seize tax refunds, to revoke occupational and professional licenses, and to revoke driver's licenses if child support is not paid. Usually, state child support collection agencies either exclusively serve, or prioritize, cases where child support is owed to someone who has received state welfare benefits, and it applies some or all of the proceeds received to the welfare payments made to the child support beneficiary.\n\nNot paying child support might be a probation violation that could be reported to the child support debtor's probation officer. But, causing the child support debtor to be incarcerated for failing to observe probation terms doesn't naturally or easily translate into providing the child support creditor with money.\n\nUltimately, you can't get blood out of a turnip. If someone doesn't have an ability to pay child support, they won't. A new car is suspicious and probably indicates that there was some under the table work done. But, by the time it is seized, it is a used car, and its fair market value at auction may be quite modest. Whether or not it is cost effective is for you to decide.\n\nI once tried to collect a money judgment of about $100,000 from a drug dealer which presented similar problems. It wasn't easy.

For example, if the recipient of a forged check has a fatal allergic reaction to the ink, most courts will not hold the forger guilty of murder, as the cause of death is too remote from the criminal act.\n\nFloyd was arrested on an accusation that he passed a counterfeit $20 bill. This is not an \"inherently dangerous\" felony. Nor has it ever been established that he had the criminal intent that would have been required to convict him of a crime. Indeed it has not been proved that he knew the bill was counterfeit. But a finding of criminal intent to commit the underlying felony is essential to invoking teh felony murder rule. [MN code 609\\.632](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.19) subdivision 3 requires \"intent to defraud\" and \"having reason to know that the money order, currency, note, or obligation or security is forged, counterfeited, falsely made, altered, or printed\". Moreover when the value is under $1,000 the possible penalties are much lighter and may not even be a felony.\n\nIn any case passing a phoney $20 is not the kind of offense for which the felony murder rule is normally invoked, nor is being killed by an arresting officer a plausible, outcome, althoguh obviously it is possible.\n\n### Further sources\n\nThe University of Minnesota's page on [\"felony Murder\"](https://open.lib.umn.edu/criminallaw/chapter/9-4-felony-murder/) says:\n\n> When the defendant commits a felony that is inherently dangerous to life, he or she does so knowing that some innocent victim may die. In essence, this awareness is similar to implied malice, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. What is difficult to justify is a conviction for felony murder when the felony is not inherently dangerous to life. Thus most jurisdictions limit the felony murder doctrine to felonies that create a foreseeable risk of violence or death. ...\n\n> Joaquin, who has just lost his job, decides to burn down his apartment building because he can\u2019t afford to pay the rent. Joaquin carefully soaks his apartment with lighter fluid, exits into the hallway, and throws a lit, lighter\\-fluid\\-soaked towel into the apartment. He then runs outside to watch the entire building burn down. Several tenants die of smoke inhalation because of the fire. In jurisdictions that recognize felony murder, Joaquin can probably be charged with and convicted of murder for every one of these deaths.\n> \n> \n> In this example, Joaquin did not intend to kill the tenants.

For example, the acquisition of [two Chinese companies were ordered](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/order-regarding-acquisition-stayntouch-inc-beijing-shiji-information-technology-co-ltd/) to divest themselves from Stayntouch, a US company. The sale of Qualcomm, a US company, to two foreign companies [was blocked](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-order-regarding-proposed-takeover-qualcomm-incorporated-broadcom-limited/) under that same law. The transactions affected are described in\n50 USC 4564(a)(4\\)(B), all of which involve acquisition of a US business by a foreign person. This is the opposite of the proposal that a foreign company be acquired by a US company (I am setting aside the possibility that the government could threaten MS with antitrust action).\n\nSubsection (d) concerns when and how the president can take action regarding a covered transaction, namely that the president deems that it threatens to impair the national security of the United States, and allowed legal actions (in US district courts) are to implement and enforce this particular law. A kickback does not relate / eliminate a national security threat.\n\nAcquisition of a foreign entity by a US entity is not a covered transaction, and Congress did not authorize taxing a US company for the acquisition of a foreign concern.

If someone was smoking in a no\\-smoking area, could you take them to court? Does this mean they can sue them? I think there has to be some damages. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, only the state, usually through the police or a public officer can take someone to court for a crime. If it is a crime then it is at their discretion if they believe the offence is serious enough to warrant this.\n\nAnyone can take anyone to court for a civil wrong (e.g. Breach of contract, a tort etc.). **One** of the many things that they will have to prove are damages *if* they are seeking damages. The defendant can argue in court that there were no damages as part of the defence. A judge will look at the evidence and, if there appear to be no damages they can make a summary judgement either with or without prejudice.\n\nOf course, damages are only one remedy for a civil wrong. To take your \"smoking in a no smoking area\" example: you could take the person to court to get a court order (an injunction) that they are not to smoke in that no smoking zone again.

Individual citizens cannot directly file criminal charges.\n\nB is partially correct, as John could sue Sarah in civil court. However, proving damages is only necessary if seeking monetary compensation, which may not be applicable in this case.\n\nC is incorrect because legal options do exist, even for seemingly minor infractions.\n\nD is the most accurate answer. As stated in the documentation, John could take Sarah to court to obtain an injunction (a court order) prohibiting her from smoking in the no-smoking area in the future. This action doesn't require proving damages, making it a viable option even without monetary loss.

Fair use is a complex legal concept that doesn't have fixed percentages or word counts that automatically qualify. Instead, it depends on several factors, including the purpose of the use, the effect on the market value of the original work, and the nature of the copyrighted material. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no fixed percentage that guarantees fair use.

While using short excerpts may be more likely to be considered fair use, it's not a guarantee.
