            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recently there was a routine fire drill in an office building. As with most fire drills, it took about half an hour for the fire drill to complete and for everyone to get back to work.\n\nWhen the employees got back to their desks, they were told to charge 30 minutes of time to an overhead charge number, but then management sent out a correction saying that they were not allowed to charge the time lost during the fire drill. Instead, they had to \"flex\" their time (that is, make up the 30 minutes at some other time during the pay period, or else take vacation time).\n\nIs this illegal, or just bad practice? Do these employees have any recourse? Any examples of similar times when an employer mandates a period of time that an employee NOT be allowed to work during normal working hours are welcome also.\n\nJurisdiction is in Virginia, USA, but input from other areas welcome for my curiosity.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An employer in Virginia, USA conducts a mandatory fire drill during normal working hours, lasting 30 minutes. After the drill, the employer informs employees that they cannot charge this time to their regular work hours and must either make up the time or use vacation time. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this practice?\n\nA) This practice is clearly illegal under federal labor laws and the employer must pay employees for the time spent in the fire drill.\n\nB) The practice is legal as long as the employer provides advance notice of the policy before conducting fire drills.\n\nC) The legality depends on whether the employees are exempt or non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n\nD) This practice is always legal because safety drills are not considered work time under labor regulations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of not paying employees for time spent in a mandatory fire drill depends on the employees' classification under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). For non-exempt employees, the time spent in mandatory fire drills is generally considered work time and should be paid. However, for exempt employees, short periods of time (like a 30-minute drill) may not need to be compensated if it doesn't affect their salary basis. The question doesn't provide enough information about the employees' status, so the most accurate answer is that the legality depends on their FLSA classification. Options A and D are too absolute in their claims, while B is incorrect because advance notice doesn't make an otherwise illegal practice legal."

However, whenever I download my videos this way, their resolution gets lowered to 480p, compromising the picture for when I upload it to YouTube. If I could use third\\-party software, I could download the videos in their full resolution.\n\nIn a related thread, someone stated, \"Downloading Facebook videos are not allowed by Facebook TOS.

However, I tried to find such a statement in Facebook's terms myself but did not find such a statement.\n\nDo I have the right to use third\\-party software to download Facebook videos I livestreamed?

The answer is only valid until they change their terms: today is Dec. 27, 2021\\. The first part regards the [Facebook TOS](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php). In \u00a73, they state that\n\n> You may not use our Products to do or share anything \\[t]hat violates\n> these Terms, our Community Standards, and other terms and policies\n> that apply to your use of Facebook.\n\nThis explicitly includes infringing the IP rights of another \u2013 which is not applicable in this instance. \u00a75 includes a long list of supplemental policies related to community standards, commercial use, advertising, program development and so on, none of which appear to address how one can download content. It is probably unknowable whether there is/was/will be a version of the TOS in some jurisdiction or time that prohibits using a third party program to download content (distinct from the ban on data\\-mining which *is* stated), but from the stated perspective, the only restriction is that intellectual property right must be respected. However, there is no evidence that there exist any hidden prohibitions on using a third party app to download content.\n\nBefore leaving this, there is also a [\"Live\"](https://www.facebook.com/policies/live) option that one might use. The policies for live streaming pertain to content (mainly non\\-deceptiveness, also a ban on looping and static content), and do not specific how a user might access such content.",

The TOS does, however, emphasize respecting intellectual property rights. The answer notes that while there are restrictions on data-mining and content guidelines for livestreaming, there is \"no evidence that there exist any hidden prohibitions on using a third party app to download content.\" Option A is incorrect as no such explicit prohibition is mentioned. Option C is not supported by the given information, as fair use is not discussed in relation to Facebook's policies. Option D is incorrect because the Live policies mentioned do not address downloading content, but rather focus on content guidelines."

This is a question about what type of expression may not be copyrighted at all.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The issue is discussed in quite a few cases, including an in depth discussion in *Eldred v. Ashcroft*, [537 U.S. 186](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/537/186/) (2003\\). The Official Syllabus of that decision summarizes its analysis:\n\n> The Copyright and Patent Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8,\n> provides as to copyrights: \"Congress shall have Power ... \\[t]o promote\n> the Progress of Science ... by securing \\[to Authors] for limited Times\n> ... the exclusive Right to their ... Writings.\" In the 1998 Copyright\n> Term Extension Act (CTEA), Congress enlarged the duration of\n> copyrights by 20 years: Under the 1976 Copyright Act (1976 Act),\n> copyright protection generally lasted from a work's creation until 50\n> years after the author's death; under the CTEA, most copyrights now\n> run from creation until 70 years after the author's death, 17 U. S. C.\n> \u00a7 302(a). As in the case of prior copyright extensions, principally in\n> 1831, 1909, and 1976, Congress provided for application of the\n> enlarged terms to existing and future copyrights alike.\n> \n> \n> Petitioners, whose products or services build on copyrighted works\n> that have gone into the public domain, brought this suit seeking a\n> determination that the CTEA fails constitutional review under both the\n> Copyright Clause's \"limited Times\" prescription and the First\n> Amendment's free speech guarantee. Petitioners do not challenge the\n> CTEA's \"life\\-plus\\-70\\-years\" timespan itself. They maintain that\n> Congress went awry not with respect to newly created works, but in\n> enlarging the term for published works with existing copyrights. The\n> \"limited Tim\\[e]\" in effect when a copyright is secured, petitioners\n> urge, becomes the constitutional boundary, a clear line beyond the\n> power of Congress to extend. As to the First Amendment, petitioners\n> contend that the CTEA is a content\\-neutral regulation of speech that\n> fails inspection under the heightened judicial scrutiny appropriate\n> for such regulations. The District Court entered judgment on the\n> pleadings for the Attorney General (respondent here), holding that the\n> CTEA does not violate the Copyright Clause's \"limited Times\"\n> restriction because the CTEA's terms, though longer than the 1976\n> Act's terms, are still limited, not perpetual, and therefore fit\n> within Congress' discretion. The court also held that there are no\n> First Amendment rights to use the copyrighted works of others. The\n> District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. In that court's unanimous view,\n> Harper \\& Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539,\n> foreclosed petitioners' First Amendment challenge to the CTEA. The\n> appeals court reasoned that copyright does not impermissibly restrict\n> free speech, for it grants the author an exclusive right only to the\n> specific form of expression; it does not shield any idea or fact\n> contained in the copyrighted work, and it allows for \"fair use\" even\n> of the expression itself.

The court ruled that Circuit\n> precedent precluded petitioners' plea for interpretation of the\n> \"limited Times\" prescription with a view to the Clause's preambular\n> statement of purpose:\n> \n> \n> \"To promote the Progress of Science.\" The court found nothing in the\n> constitutional text or history to suggest that a term of years for a\n> copyright is not a \"limited Tim\\[e]\" if it may later be extended for\n> another \"limited Tim\\[e].\" Recounting that the First Congress made the\n> 1790 Copyright Act applicable to existing copyrights arising under\n> state copyright laws, the court held that that construction by\n> contemporaries of the Constitution's formation merited almost\n> conclusive weight under Burrow\\-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111\n> U. S. 53, 57\\. As early as McClurg v.

It held that originality, for copyright purposes, is constitutionally mandated for all works. *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc.*, 499 U.S. 340 (1991\\).\n\nSee also:\n\n* Under the Copyright and Patent Clause, Congress' copyright authority is tied to the progress of science; its patent authority, to the progress of the useful arts. *Golan v. Holder*, 565 U.S. 302 (2012\\).\n* Under this clause, Congress, to encourage people to devote themselves to intellectual and artistic creation, may guarantee to authors and investors a reward in form of control over sale or commercial use of copies of their books. *Goldstein v. California*, 412 U.S. 546 (1973\\).\n* This clause is both grant of power and limitation; this clause is limited to promotion of advances in useful arts. *Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City*, 383 U.S. 1 (1966\\).\n* The economic philosophy behind this clause empowering Congress to grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is best way to advance public welfare through talents of authors and inventors in Science and useful Arts. *Mazer v. Stein* , 347 U.S. 201 (1954\\).\n* The Copyright Act of Congress, R.S. \u00a7\u20024952, as amended by the Act Mar. 3, 1891, c. 565, 26 Stat. 1106, giving to authors the exclusive right to dramatize any of their works, is valid as applied to pantomine dramatization by means of moving picture films. *Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros.*, 222 U.S. 55 (1911\\).\n* This section does not limit the useful to that which satisfies immediate bodily needs, and painting and engraving not intended for a mechanical end are among the useful arts, the progress of which Congress is empowered by this section to promote. *Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co.*, 188 U.S. 239 (1903\\).\n* No authority exists for obtaining a copyright beyond the extent to which Congress has authorized it; \u2009a copyright cannot be sustained as a right existing at common law, but depends wholly on the legislation of Congress. *Banks v. Manchester*, 128 U.S. 244 (1888\\).\n* Legislation concerning trademark protection is not authorized by this clause. *In re Trade\\-Mark Cases*, 100 U.S. 82 (1879\\).\n\nA [list of U.S. Supreme Court cases on the issue of copyright at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_copyright_case_law) includes many additional copyright cases that don't implicate the U.S. Constitutional language.\n\nIt is also worth noting that while the U.S. Supreme Court is the final and most authoritative interpreter of the U.S. Constitution, that any court presented with an issue of constitutional interpretation can, and indeed, is duty bound, to interpret the constitutional in a legally authoritative way, which in the case of appellate courts (state and federal) serves as a legal precedent for other cases that \"makes law\" on the issue.",

The Court has generally interpreted \"useful arts\" and \"progress of science\" broadly, allowing Congress considerable latitude in determining what can be copyrighted. However, the Court has also recognized some constitutional limitations, such as requiring originality for copyright protection (Feist case) and acknowledging that copyright duration must be for \"limited times\" (Eldred case). The Court has not restricted \"useful arts\" to only physical inventions or \"progress of science\" to only academic research. Instead, it has recognized that these concepts can include a wide range of creative and intellectual works, including artistic creations like paintings and engravings (Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co.). While the Court has set some boundaries, it has generally deferred to Congress' judgment in copyright matters, as long as constitutional requirements are met."

This is extra ironic because as far as I can tell by scanning the previous brief it looks like PA case law falls strongly on the side of not respecting donor contracts (though I haven't fully researched the fact, the presidents the brief cites definitely support the idea that parent's can't sign away their child's right), so it seems like the firm is misleading people about the law so they can offer to write contracts that likely won't be respected.\n\nI know the website is not technically lying in what they say, but it seems intentional misleading. I doubt a legal firm would break the law so blatantly, so I assume the claims on the website must be legal. However, that surprises me since what little I do know about common law situations it seems like 'technical truths' that are intentionally misleading usually are treated as falsehoods in other situations, for instance slander/libel laws or contract rulings trying to emphasis intent of contract instead of just the letter of the contract.\n\nSo, why is a claim like this allowed? Is this either not as clear cut a lie of omission as it seems to be to me, or are such lies by omission actually allowed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's look at what they say:\n\n> Pennsylvania does not have any statutory laws governing assisted reproductive technology.\n\nTrue\n\n> Pennsylvania\u2019s laws regarding sperm donors come only from case law that are specific to the facts of the case being considered by the court.\n\nTrue and trivial given the previous sentence.\n\n> Pennsylvania courts have found sperm donor contracts to be legally enforceable.\n\nTrue, that's what [Ferguson v McKiernan](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/pa-supreme-court/1033446.html) says in the first paragraph of the decision.\n\nYour statement that \"PA case law falls strongly on the side of not respecting donor contracts\" is, at least as far as the case you cite, flatly wrong. In other cases, the contract may or may not be enforcable indeed the court agrees with this specifically:\n\n> Although locating future cases on this spectrum may call upon courts to draw very fine lines, courts are no strangers to such tasks, and the instant case, which we must resolve, is not nearly so difficult.\n\nThis also directly supports the previous sentence.\n\n> Therefore, even if you go through a fertility clinic, a contract between the donor and the intended parents would need to be in place before the conception.\n\nTrue, this is exactly what Ferguson v McKiernan says. You assert that Ferguson v McKiernan says \"donation through a clinic does not make a sperm donor the legal father\", however, it doesn't say that at all. \n\nThe status of the doner as the father was never an issue \\- both parties agreed that he was the biological father and the court accepted that. What was at issue is if he had the rights and obligations of a father that had been removed by the contract. \n\nThe lower courts held that the contract was unenforcable as being contrary to public policy because it removed rights from the children who were not parties to the contract. However, the State Supreme Court held that the contract was enforcable. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWhat they say on their website is not misleading.",

What is the bare minimum they need to give so that the contract is legally valid?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The contract is valid if the party to be bound authenticates the record they are affirming, even if nothing other than the authentication itself identifies the party to be bound by name or anything else in the contract, or for that matter, even if the name provided and used in the contract is an alias.\n\nAs a practical matter, to enforce the contract, it must be possible by some means, not necessarily present on the face of the contract, to identify who affirmed the record sufficiently to be able to bring suit against the right person by naming the breaching party in a legal complaint and serving legal process upon the breaching party.\n\nIn the case of someone with a common name, Yuri Fujimori, for example, in Tokyo, or Jesus Gonzales, in Los Angeles, it would be prudent to somehow identify the individual more specifically, either on the face of the contract or otherwise, to avoid confusion. In contrast, if my name, Andrew Oh\\-Willeke, were on the contract, you wouldn't need any more information, because I am the only person with that name in the entire world and my contact information is widely available on the Internet from sources not subject to question such as the attorney registration lists in my state, as a matter of my licensure obligations and out of business necessity.\n\nOne of the more common ways to accomplish this end would be to have a formal address for notice to the parties in the contract and to have the parties to consent to service of process by mail at that address, or at the last known other address provided at a later date to the other party in writing. In that way, you narrow the list of defendants to the person with that name who is associated with that address. Another alternative would be to have the party designate an agent for service of process in the contract, although that would be more unusual.\n\nBut, because the need to give notice under the contract is usually necessary to carry out the terms of the contract, it doesn't feel as intrusive as asking for a birthday or other identifying information.",

A formal address for notice and service of process allows for proper identification and location of the parties without requiring overly personal information.\n\nOption A is incorrect because date of birth and current residential address are not strictly necessary and may be considered too intrusive for international deals.\n\nOption B is incorrect as country of birth and passport number are not required for contract validity and may be seen as unnecessarily invasive.\n\nOption D is incorrect because social security numbers and driver's license numbers are highly sensitive personal information not required for contract validity, and may not even be applicable in international contexts.\n\nThe key is to provide enough information to identify and locate the parties for potential legal proceedings, while respecting privacy concerns in international deals. A formal address for notice and service of process achieves this balance effectively."

If I'm reading the relevant law ([ORS 811\\.507](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_811.507)) correctly, if merely listening to a device that was already configured constituted using it, an adult could only listen to a radio if it could be controlled by voice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Listening to navigation instructions coming from a phone would meet the definition of:\n\n> (1\\)(e) \u201c**Using** a mobile electronic device\u201d includes but is not limited to using a mobile electronic device for text messaging, voice communication, entertainment, **navigation**, accessing the Internet or producing electronic mail.\n\nThe next section goes on to say that:\n\n> (2\\) **A person commits the offense** of driving a motor vehicle while using a mobile electronic device if the person, while driving a motor vehicle on a highway or premises open to the public:\n\n> (b) Uses a mobile electronic device for **any purpose**.\n\nLater in section (4\\) it states \"It is an **affirmative defense** to a prosecution of a person under this section that the person:\"\n\n> (b) Was **18 years of age or older** and was using a hands\\-free accessory;\n\nSince your minor in question was using a portable electronic device for navigation, and due to their age cannot exercise the \"hands\\-free\" defense, it is logical to conclude that your scenario would be a violation of this statute.\n\nSilly as it might seem, this apparently wouldn't preclude them from interacting with a permanently installed navigation unit while driving unless it was observed to be causing a distraction since (1\\)(d)(A) states:\n\n> \u201cMobile electronic device\u201d means an electronic device that is **not permanently installed** in a motor vehicle.",

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) This is legal because the driver is not physically interacting with the phone while driving.\nB) This is illegal because using a mobile device for navigation while driving is prohibited for all ages.\nC) This is legal because voice navigation is considered a hands-free accessory.\nD) This is illegal because the driver is a minor and cannot use the hands-free defense.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to ORS 811.507, using a mobile electronic device includes using it for navigation purposes. The law states that it is an offense to use a mobile electronic device for any purpose while driving, regardless of whether physical interaction occurs. While there is an affirmative defense for using a hands-free accessory, this only applies to individuals 18 years of age or older. Since the driver in this scenario is 17, they cannot use this defense. Therefore, even though they set up the navigation before driving and didn't touch the phone while driving, it would still be considered illegal use of a mobile electronic device for a minor."

The news channel does not want to get involved and would retract any articles, but the company made it clear they would sue them anyway.\n\nIf they are written in the same lawsuit (*BT Baby Toys vs Alex A, Bobby B and XYZ News*), are they sued separately or all together? Can the news organization bail out of the lawsuit early and pay a settlement fee or something?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Either is possible\n==================\n\nLet's look at a very recent example: [Dominion sued Guliani and Powell separately.](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60549/rudy-giuliani-sued-why-ask-for-1-3b/60552#60552) But [Smartmatics sued both plus Fox at once](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/04/media/read-smartmatic-lawsuit-fox-news/index.html).

Is it only manufacturers, distributors, and doctors who are bound by the FDA regulations, or would consumers face criminal or civil penalties if they use it without FDA approval?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The FDA approved the device as [requiring a prescription](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpma/pma_template.cfm?id=p150021) (not OTC). FDA regulations govern the manufacture or distribution of devices and drugs, not the consumption. An overview of FDA regulation is [here](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/ucm2005300.htm). They say they they are \"responsible for regulating firms who manufacture, repackage, relabel, and/or import medical devices sold in the United States\". The entire pile of regulations (21 CFR) is [here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm). There has to be an underlying statute that authorizes the FDA to impose restrictions: that would be in [Title 21 of the US Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21). The specific law regulating medical devices is [21 USC 360](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/360). Congress can easily pass laws that restrict what businesses do (a consequence of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution), but they (theoretically) have a more limited ability to restrict what an individual does. Since there is no federal law prohibiting the *use* of a prescription device, it is not a crime to possess or use such a device.",

While the Freestyle Libre Pro is approved only for professional use and requires a prescription, there is no specific federal law that makes it illegal for an individual to possess or use such a device. The FDA's authority is mainly over businesses involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, not end-users. However, obtaining the device without a prescription may violate other healthcare regulations or laws. This situation highlights the complex nature of medical device regulation and the distinction between FDA approval and the legality of individual use."

If this stateless person (under 18\\) is born and lived in the US for is entire life is found by the EU (local police of the country like France, Germany...) authorities can be automatically or ask to be deported to the US with no documents/proof that this person is born (and normaly a US citizen), will be deported to US soil or US ambassy/consulate ?

If one is born in the US, then they cannot lose their citizenship before they turn 18 (and it is rather difficult to lose it accidentally; in order to lose *jus soli* citizenship in the US, one must \"intentionally revoke it\"; generally speaking, you have to go to a US consulate (in another country) and formally renounce your citizenship.

According to U.S. law, anyone born on U.S. soil automatically acquires U.S. citizenship (jus soli). This citizenship cannot be lost before the age of 18, and even after that, it's very difficult to lose accidentally. The individual in question, being 16 years old, would still be considered a U.S. citizen if their claim of being born in the U.S. is true. They cannot be stateless in this scenario.\n\nOption A is incorrect because deportation isn't automatic, especially without proof of citizenship. Option B is wrong because if the person was indeed born in the U.S., they are not stateless. Option C is incorrect because if the individual is a U.S. citizen by birth, the U.S. cannot deny them entry, although they may need to verify the claim of citizenship.\n\nThe challenge in this situation would be proving the individual's place of birth and identity, but from a legal standpoint, if they were born in the U.S., they are a U.S. citizen regardless of current documentation."

Under US law people have the right of defending their property, but it is not clear for me what would constitute the \"defending\".\n\nWhat is the farthest extent that one could go to defend property, when no life was in danger?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There isn't a national answer, but every state has laws that set that limit \u2013 there is a lot of variation. California defines and criminalizes homicide in the penal code [here](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=187-199), and section 195 starts setting forth circumstances where homicide is excusable. 197\\.2, for example, includes when\n\n> committed in defense of habitation, property, or person, against one\n>  who manifestly intends or endeavors, by violence or surprise, to\n>  commit a felony, or against one who manifestly intends and endeavors,\n>  in a violent, riotous or tumultuous manner, to enter the habitation of\n>  another for the purpose of offering violence to any person therein\n\nThe jury then has to decide if the facts match the various conditions enumerated throughout the criminal code as justifications, so there are specific instructions that the judge reads, given [here](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/3400/3476.html). (This is a generic self\\-defense instruction, not just aimed at homicide). They are told that the accused \"may use reasonable force to protect that property from imminent harm\", and that reasonable force is \"the amount of force that a reasonable person in the same situation would believe is necessary to protect the property from imminent harm\". So if the prosecution cannot prove \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used more force than was reasonable to protect property from imminent harm\", they are supposed to acquit. Now, suppose that you're sitting at a sidewalk cafe and some passing perp reached for your cell phone on the table. Blowing off his head would be an unreasonable degree of force.\n\nThere are additional instructions aimed at specific situations, such as the [right to eject a trespasser](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/3400/3475.html) that allows you to use reasonable force to eject a trespasser who refuses to leave, and again that degree of force is whatever the reasonable man would do in the circumstances that the victim reasonably believed existed (regardless of whether there was an actual threat). Deadly force is specifically allowed in self\\-defense against a \"[forcible or atrocious crime](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/500/505.html)\", which includes robbery. This does not include deadly force to prevent vandalism. \n\nYou will have noticed that it comes down to the jury making a subjective judgment call as to whether the degree of force used was beyond what the hypothetical \"reasonable man\" would use. \n\nTo clarify in response to the comment, the thing that all of the justified force defenses have in common is that the force be reasonable *in order to stop the aggressor*. If you can (safely) stop the vandal by smacking him once, but it would be satisfying to turn him into paste, you have to remain unsatisfied. Individuals can use force in defense of self or property, but only the law can use force punitively (and as I assume you know, that never includes beating a person up).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In California, under what circumstances would the use of deadly force be considered legally justifiable in defending property?\n\nA) When preventing any act of vandalism on one's property\nB) When stopping a burglar from stealing a valuable item from inside one's home\nC) When confronting someone who is spray-painting graffiti on the exterior of one's business\nD) When protecting one's cell phone from being snatched by a passerby on the street\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to California law, deadly force can be justified in defense of \"habitation, property, or person, against one who manifestly intends or endeavors, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony.\" Burglary (entering a home with intent to commit theft) is considered a felony, and thus deadly force could potentially be justified in this scenario. \n\nOptions A and C involve vandalism, which is typically not considered a \"forcible or atrocious crime\" that would justify deadly force. Option D describes a theft in a public place, which, while illegal, would not typically warrant deadly force as a reasonable response. The law emphasizes that the force used must be \"reasonable\" and proportional to the threat, and deadly force is generally only justifiable in response to threats of death or severe bodily harm, or in the case of certain felonies committed in one's home."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An American citizen and their non-US citizen spouse plan to move to the spouse's home country. They want to start a company in that foreign country before leaving the US. The American spouse will work for the company while still in the US, but won't receive payments or own shares. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their US tax obligations?\n\nA) The American spouse must report all company earnings on their personal US tax return, regardless of ownership or compensation.\n\nB) As long as the American spouse doesn't own shares or receive payments, there are no US tax reporting requirements for the company's earnings.\n\nC) The couple must file a Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) report for the company, even if they don't personally receive funds.\n\nD) The American spouse should report their work for the foreign company as self-employment income on their US tax return.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In this scenario, the American spouse is working for a foreign company without receiving compensation or owning shares. As long as they don't personally benefit from the company's earnings and the company is truly owned and controlled by the non-US citizen spouse, there are no immediate US tax reporting requirements for the company's earnings.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the American spouse doesn't own the company or receive payments, so they're not required to report the company's earnings on their personal tax return.\n\nOption C is incorrect because FBAR reporting is typically required for personal foreign financial accounts, not for work performed for a foreign company without receiving funds.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the American spouse is working as an employee of the foreign company, not as a self-employed individual. Without compensation, there's no income to report as self-employment.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this situation could raise red flags with tax authorities and might be scrutinized for potential tax evasion. Consulting with a tax professional specializing in international tax law would be advisable to ensure full compliance and proper reporting."

(I've seen this most frequently on YouTube videos, but I've also seen it after quotes by some people here on StackExchange.)\n\nIs there any legal basis for attaching this disclaimer to posts on the internet? \\-\\- If not in changing whether or not the posting is infringing, then perhaps in changing the severity? (e.g. \"willful infringement\" versus inadvertent infringement)\n\n*Jurisdiction is primarily the United States, as that's where most major English\\-language websites are based, but as this is an \"on the internet\" question, if there are jurisdictions where the answer is substantially different than that for the United States, that information would also be welcome.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The significant question is whether such a statement as \"no copyright infringement intended\" will be viewed by the courts as evidence to suggest innocent infringement or rather as evidence to support *willful* infringement. This consideration of willful versus innocent is relevant when a copyright holder seeks statutory damages.\n\n[17 USC \u00a7504(c)(2\\) says](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504) (emphasis mine):\n\n> In a case where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that infringement was committed willfully, the court in its discretion may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of not more than $150,000\\. In a case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that such infringer was not aware and **had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright**, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200\\.\n\n[Branch v. Ogilvy \\& Mather, Inc.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6743155512361007994) says of willfulness (emphasis mine):\n\n> Thus, in order to prove willfulness, a plaintiff must show that the defendant knew or should have known that its conduct constituted copyright infringement. Similarly, in order to establish innocent intent, the defendant must prove that it did not know and **should not have known** that its conduct constituted infringement. One defense to an allegation of willfulness is **the defendant's reasonable and good faith belief** that its actions do not constitute copyright infringement.\n\nThe central question, then, seems to be whether the notice \"no copyright infringement intended\" aids or harms an argument that the infringer \"did not know or should not have known\" that they were infringing copyright, or else that they had a \"reasonable and good faith belief\" of non\\-infringement.\n\nI am not aware of any case law that concerns such a notice, but my layman intuition suggests to me that\n\n1. such a notice lends evidential weight that the defendant did indeed know the work in question was under copyright;\n2. since the defendant was therefore aware the work was under copyright, it is unlikely that they could successfully claim a reasonable belief that publicly distributing the entirety of (or a substantial portion of) the work without permission was not infringement.\n\nUltimately, I don't think such a notice does anything to aid the defendant's argument that they \"should not have known\" their use was infringing. Nor do I think it furthers an argument of \"reasonable and good faith belief\" by the defendant: the reasonableness of such a belief will rest significantly on the facts of the infringement, not only on how loudly they shouted, \"I *swear* this isn't infringement!\" Conversely, such a notice may further the idea that the defendant did know that copyright applied to the work, strengthening the plaintiff's argument that the defendant should have known the use was infringing.",

While the defendant might hope this shows innocent intent, it can instead be seen as evidence that the defendant was aware of copyright issues. This awareness could support a finding of willful infringement, as it suggests the defendant knew or should have known their actions might constitute copyright infringement. \n\nIn U.S. copyright law, willful infringement can increase statutory damages up to $150,000, while proving the infringer had no reason to believe they were infringing can reduce damages to a minimum of $200. The key is whether the infringer \"knew or should have known\" their actions were infringing.\n\nThe disclaimer doesn't automatically reduce damages (A is incorrect) or prove non-willful infringement (B is incorrect). It is considered relevant evidence (D is incorrect), but in a way that may harm rather than help the defendant's case."

A trademark is descriptive when it describes the properties of the product or service or promotes these. For example: the words 'super fast bike' for the product category 'bicycles'.\n> \n> \n> Please note: the wording here is not always in common usage. The trademark 'medi' is not listed in the dictionary as a common abbreviation for 'medical'. All the same, it is a common designation that consumers will understand right away in the discriptive sense. So, this type of trademark could also be descriptive and hence declined.\n\n*Computerrepair* is a literal description of what the business does, just like *Biomild* on a mild biological yogurt just describes it.",

According to the information from the Netherlands Trademark Office, trademarks should not literally describe or depict the goods or services offered. In this case, \"QuickFix\" directly implies a fast repair service, which is descriptive of the company's primary activity. While \"Electronics\" is a broader term, the combination with \"QuickFix\" makes the overall name too descriptive of the service provided.

Could this technical standard be patented? Licensed? What is the legal status of such a standard? Could fixing this standard in any tangible form change anything in its patent\\-ability?\n\nAs far as I understand, should somebody implement the aforementioned communication protocol or algorithm in software or hardware, then *this implementation* becomes a separate entity and could in turn be patented and licensed. Am I correct? Could initial standard somehow prohibit creating such implementations? Could it require a license of some sorts for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright and patents are two very very different things. Copyrighting a standard means the wording of the standard can not be copied without the copyright holders permission. It does not protect the ideas expressed in the document, just the way those ideas are expressed. IEEE standards, for example, are copyrighted by the IEEE and therefore you can't make a copy of the Ethernet specification, you need to buy it from them. That has nothing to do with implementing an Ethernet device.\n\nTo implement something described in a technical specification might or might not require one or more patent licenses. The authors of the standard may not even be aware that something they require for the standard has already been invented and patented by someone else.\n\nMany standard bodies do impose a requirement on participants in the standard's creation that they offer licenses to any patents they own that are needed to implement the standard on a fair and equal basis to all.

Patents protect inventions, not abstract ideas.\n\nB is incorrect because copyright on a technical standard only protects the specific expression (wording) of the standard, not the ideas or protocols described within it.

Now they both inform an adversary where that person will be during their working hours.\n* If we assume that each employee has a car parking space then the car parking space number can be used to identify the person. Again, an adversary could use this information for nefarious acts.\n\nThe reference document does give me an option for \"Unsure\" for answering question 2, in which case the next question is:\n\n3. Is the data \u2018obviously about\u2019 a particular individual?\n\nThis, and the subsequent questions are where I'm starting to get unsure. Office, department and car parking space don't *feel* like PII. The document and my reasoning seem, to me, so suggest they would.\n\nNB: I'm used to working with computers where things are generally black or white. My argument above would hold if I was working with a security architecture, but maybe not with defining PII.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The guidance on the third question is not particularly useful, since they give an example of a \"yes\" situation, but do not indicate what would be a \"no\". The reason no doubt is that they do not want to be put in the position of saying \"that is not\", when a court may later decide \"yes it is\". You have to rely on the wording of the question, specifically the fact that it refers to being obviously about a particular individual. The two key terms here are \"particular\" and \"obviously\". The former means \"uniquely\", so a half\\-eaten sandwich is \"about\" some human, but there are billions of people that it could be about. \"Obviously\" is more a judgment call, but comes down to the question of whether there is a path between the datum and the specific person which a person of average intelligence can see, versus (non\\-obviously) a hypothetical scenario whereby one might be able to connect a datum to a specific person.\n\nThe fourth question relies on relating \"an individual\", which in context we have to interpret as meaning relating \"a specific individual\" to the datum, as opposed to relating some set of individuals. Their example of a single person in a post being a \"yes\" (actually they just say it is \"an example\", but not what it is an example of) indicates that if the datum could be true of a number of individuals, then it is not established as being personal data (yet).\n\nQ5 oddly implies that what you might do with data defines whether the data is \"personal data\", which is confusing, but amounts to saying \"even if this is in the ordinary sense 'personal data', it is not subject to the protection requirements\" \u2013 this is not uncommon in law, where rules are stated in terms of a label ('personal data\"), and the rules are very simple, but the definition of the label can be complicated.\n\nQ6 distinguishes \"incidental\" facts from \"significant\" facts. As they say, the fact that X attended a meeting is personal data; the fact that coffee was served is *not*, even though it is a fact connected to the meeting which is connected to the person. The fact that X (alone) had black coffee would be PD. Q7 is quite vague, but reduces to asking \"what is the purpose of gathering the data\": if the purpose is \"about\" individuals, it is PD, but if it is about processes / machines, move on to the next question. Finally, they ask whether the data \"can impact\" an individual (similar to Q5 but without the implication of specific intent to do so). Ordinarily, one would think the datum \"has red hair\" can't have an impact on an individual, but with a bit of creativity, one can construct a reasonable scenario where this could have an effect (such as tending to prejudice people against the individual).\n\nThe guidance that you are looking at is an interpretation of what the law requires, and it is helpful to look at multiple interpretations, such as [this one](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/).",

Rather than prohibiting the purchase of tobacco products altogether, [the law instead prohibits their purchase by anyone born after 2008](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/14/new-zealand-tobacco-cigarettes-ban/) and would require stores to refuse to sell tobacco products to such people.\n\nTo my understanding, the [Human Rights Act of 1993 prohibits discrimination based on age unless the person discriminated against is under 16\\.](https://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304475.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_Human%20Rights%20Act%201993_resel_25_a&p=1%2F) The New Zealand supreme court apparently [recently ruled](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/world/australia/new-zealand-and-australia-ponder-a-lower-voting-age.html) that things such as a voting age of 18 violate these rules. Currently, anyone born after 2008 is under 16, but the law will presumably apply equally in, say, 2025\\.\n\nDoes the new tobacco legislation run afoul of the Human Rights Act? Or does it avoid any issues or create an exception?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It\u2019s probably fine\n------------------\n\nI refer you to para 41 of the judgement:\n\n> For ease of reference we note that s 5 provides that the protected rights and freedoms \u201cmay be subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society\u201d.\n\nRestrictions on eligibility to vote are hard to justify in a free and democratic society. Tobacco use is not so central.\n\nWere the issue to come to trial the government could argue:\n\n* it has the power to prescribe substances that are injurious and addictive, which it undoubtably does.\n* There are many people born after 2008 who are addicted and cutting off their access would create great personal hardship for them.\n* Furthermore, the ongoing demand would create incentive for criminal activity in smuggling illegal tobacco.\n* Everyone born in or after 2008 is not addicted to tobacco so banning it would not cause hardship\n* Similarly, the waning demand from older people could be met legally reducing the scope for organised crime.\n\nIn brief, the ban is probably \u201cdemonstrably justified\u201d.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation given, which of the following best represents why the new tobacco legislation in New Zealand is likely to be considered compliant with the Human Rights Act of 1993, despite its age-based restrictions?\n\nA) The legislation only applies to those under 16, who are not protected by the age discrimination provisions of the Human Rights Act.\n\nB) The legislation creates a specific exception to the Human Rights Act for tobacco-related policies.\n\nC) The legislation can be considered a \"reasonable limit\" on rights that is \"demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society\" due to public health concerns and practical implementation considerations.\n\nD) The New Zealand Supreme Court has ruled that age-based restrictions are generally permissible under the Human Rights Act.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that while the Human Rights Act prohibits age-based discrimination, there is a provision (Section 5) allowing for \"reasonable limits\" on rights that can be \"demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\" The government could argue that the tobacco legislation meets this criterion due to public health concerns (tobacco being injurious and addictive) and practical considerations (avoiding hardship for current addicts, reducing incentives for criminal activity). Unlike voting rights, which are central to democracy and hard to restrict, tobacco use is not considered as fundamental, making the restrictions easier to justify.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the legislation will apply to people over 16 in the future. Answer B is incorrect as there's no mention of a specific exception being created. Answer D is incorrect because the Supreme Court ruling mentioned actually went against age-based restrictions for voting, not in favor of them generally."

Obviously I will need to refinance it and pay him his share of the equity to get the deed solely in my name, which will take time. My ex is dragging his feet about moving out, and our divorce decree says nothing about occupying the home. Can I serve him an eviction notice now since the house was awarded to me, or do I have to wait until I complete the refinance and get his name off the deed?\n\nIf for some reason I can't refinance, the house would be sold. He has no interest in staying in the house either way. That's not documented anywhere though. He's also perfectly able to afford to live elsewhere.\n\nI found lots of info about getting temporary orders for occupancy during the divorce (which doesn't apply because it's already finalized), and evicting someone from a home if it's solely in your name, but nothing about the time period between those two events.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No.\n\nAn eviction notice served while someone is an owner of record of a house would not be enforced.\n\nBut, generally speaking, a divorce court retains jurisdiction to enforce its decrees after they are entered, and to clarify its existing orders.\n\n> Obviously I will need to refinance it and pay him his share of the\n>  equity to get the deed solely in my name, which will take time.\n\nUsually, the ex's duty to get the deed in your name would precede the duty to refinance it. A deed from one owner of real estate to another co\\-owner doesn't violate a due on sales clause of a mortgage or deed of trust, and the fact that both of you are on the mortgage or deed of trust does not mean that both of you need to own it. Unless the decree says otherwise, the ex would usually have to transfer the property even if the mortgage is not yet refinanced. But, not all decrees and not all separation agreements have the same requirements and provisions. The exact language in the governing document would matter.\n\nIf the decree doesn't say who gets to occupy the house, you could and probably should go to the court to have that issue clarified. Since violating a clear court order can give rise to contempt of court sanctions of incarceration or fines, often someone will comply with it without having to have the police intervene to remove someone.\n\nConceivably, if the ex did not leave, you could seek to hold the ex in contempt of court for violating the divorce decree if it implies that the ex's right to occupy the house has ended. If the ex is found by the court to have willfully violated a court order following notice to the ex, an arraignment and a hearing if the violation was not conceded at the arraignment, the ex could face incarceration and/or fines (contempt proceedings are rather complicated and exactly how you do this is beyond the scope of a simple answer). \n\nYou could also seek to hold the ex in contempt of court for not promptly signing the quitclaim deed (assuming that the decree does not condition the duty to do this on the refinancing of the house), but this would not be the best solution to that problem. This is because you could also go to the court and have it appoint the clerk of the court as the husband's agent to sign the quitclaim deed on behalf of the ex (assuming again that the decree does not condition the duty to do this on the refinancing of the house), if the ex failed to do so as required by the divorce decree by the deadline set forth in the decree, or a new court order, or within a reasonable time if not deadline is set. Then, after you were in title, you could bring an eviction action if necessary. It is much easier and faster to get an order directing the clerk to sign something on behalf of a party to a lawsuit than it is to hold someone in contempt of court.\n\nYou could also ask the court to issue a protection order prohibiting him from occupying the house at any time prior to the title being put into your name pursuant to the decree. This could take effect as soon as the protection order signed/authorized by the judge is served upon the ex. A protection order (in most states) is directly enforceable by the police, unlike most court orders which are only enforceable by bringing contempt of court charges in the court that issued the order. But, a court would usually be reluctant to issue a protection order unless there was a clear and present risk of physical harm, or severe emotional harm to you from a violation of the decree.\n\nAlso, while the ex wouldn't be committing the crime of trespassing by occupying the house, it wouldn't be unprecedented for you to persuade a police officer to remove the ex from the house after explaining the situation to prevent a breach of the peace between you, or because the ex's conduct in overstaying his right under the decree to be in the house constitutes \"disorderly conduct\" or \"loitering\" or \"harassment\" or some other minor offense in the opinion of the police officer, even if that charge might not hold up if prosecuted in court. But, there is really no way to compel a police officer to do that and it is close to the boundary of what a police officer does and doesn't have the authority to do.\n\nMost of these remedies would take several weeks, at a minimum, to complete. A protection order could be done in a day or two, subject to a prompt follow up hearing within a week or two after the fact. A court might also rule on a clarification order on an expedited basis by setting a shorter than usual deadline for the ex to respond given the urgency of the matter.",

Petitioning the court for a clarification order on occupancy is the most appropriate and efficient action. The divorce court retains jurisdiction to clarify its existing orders, and this would provide a clear legal basis for occupancy rights.\n\nD) is incorrect because the ex-spouse is not technically trespassing if they are still on the deed, and police generally won't intervene in such civil matters without a court order."

Option C is the correct answer because it allows for religious garments (such as hijabs and niqabs) while still maintaining restrictions on non-religious face coverings. This policy complies with anti-discrimination laws while allowing the business some control over face coverings.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't make exceptions for religious garments, which would be considered discrimination based on religious beliefs. Option B is also incorrect as it still doesn't account for religious face coverings. Option D, while not discriminatory, doesn't align with the store owner's desire to implement restrictions on face coverings.\n\nIt's important to note that any policy must be applied consistently and not used as a pretext for discrimination against particular groups. The store owner should also be prepared to make reasonable accommodations for religious practices to avoid potential legal issues."

Or is it okay to present the warrant after the item(s) have been seized?\n\nIf it makes a difference, I'm specifically wondering in the scenario that the item is on your person.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We should start with the rule regarding presentation of search warrants. The [US Court search and seizure warrant form](https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/ao093.pdf) explicitly says\n\n> Unless delayed notice is authorized below, you must give a copy of the\n> warrant and a receipt for the property taken to the person from whom,\n> or from whose premises, the property was taken, or leave the copy and\n> receipt at the place where the property was taken.\n\nState will have similar rules, e.g. [Washington's CrRLJ 2\\.3](https://www.courts.wa.gov/court_rules/pdf/CrRLJ/CLJ_CRRLJ_02_03_00.pdf).\n\n> (d) *Execution and Return with Inventory*. The peace officer taking\n> property under the warrant shall give to the person from whom or from\n> whose premises the property is taken a copy of the warrant and a\n> receipt for the property taken.\n\nThis does not explicitly say \"before starting the search,\" and the wording \"shall give ... a copy of the warrant and a\nreceipt for the property taken\" implies that the two documentary items can be presented at the same time (therefore after the search). Arkansas's rule [Ark. R. Crim. P. 13\\.3](https://casetext.com/rule/arkansas-court-rules/arkansas-rules-of-criminal-procedure/rule-13-search-and-seizure-pursuant-to-warrant/rule-133-execution-of-a-search-warrant) is slightly different\n\n> (b) Prior to entering a dwelling to execute a search warrant, the\n> executing officer shall make known the officer's presence and\n> authority for entering the dwelling\n\nwhich is not a requirement to present the warrant itself, and then\n\n> (c) In the course of any search or seizure pursuant to the warrant,\n> the executing officer shall give a copy of the warrant to the person\n> to be searched or the person in apparent control of the premises to be\n> searched. The copy shall be furnished before undertaking the search or\n> seizure unless the officer has reasonable cause to believe that such\n> action would endanger the successful execution of the warrant with all\n> practicable safety, in which case he shall, as soon as is practicable,\n> state his authority and purpose and furnish a copy of the warrant.\n\nSo there is some variation in the requirement for handing over a copy of the warrant.\n\nBody searches might be subject to different standards per jurisdiction. [Washington search law](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=10.79&full=true) has extensive limits on strip and body cavity searches, whereas searching pockets is like searching a premise (a copy of the warrant must be eventually presented, along with an inventory of items seized).\n\nIt is typically stated that ideally, police will show a copy of the warrant to the person being searched or whose premise is being searched, but ideally does not mean \"must always\". I have not found any case where an officer reasonably could have shown the warrant prior to conducting a search (when so requested by the searchee) but unreasonably refused.",

Generally, officers should present the warrant if possible, but are not always strictly required to do so before beginning the search. Many jurisdictions allow officers to provide the warrant and an inventory of seized items after the search is completed. Some states, like Arkansas, have specific rules about announcing presence and authority before entering a dwelling, but even then, the full warrant doesn't necessarily need to be shown immediately. The key is that officers must eventually provide a copy of the warrant and an inventory of seized items. However, if showing the warrant would endanger the successful execution of the search, officers may delay presenting it until it's practicable to do so. This nuanced approach, accounting for jurisdictional differences and situational factors, makes D the most accurate answer."

The corporate veil is a legal concept that separates the LLC's liabilities from the personal assets of its owners. Insurance cannot prevent a court from deciding to pierce the corporate veil if proper business practices are not followed (such as commingling personal and business finances).

It was unexpected but much appreciated. Should I withhold the overpayment of the first month from the second month or will you refund it?\" it's quite likely that you could make the lower rent stick.

By signing the contract with the lower rent and sending a note expressing gratitude, the tenant creates a situation where they appear to be acting in good faith, unaware of any mistake.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of such an action?\n\nA) It is legal under Indonesian law as long as the citizen can prove the websites are offering illegal services.\n\nB) It is illegal under Indonesian law, but the citizen cannot be prosecuted under foreign laws due to jurisdictional limitations.\n\nC) It is legal under Indonesian law and considered a form of civic duty to assist the government in enforcing online regulations.\n\nD) It is likely illegal under both Indonesian law and the laws of the country hosting the targeted websites, potentially exposing the citizen to domestic and international legal consequences.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The information provided indicates that launching a cyber-attack is probably illegal under Indonesian law, as the government reserves the right to judge guilt and administer punishment. Additionally, such actions are explicitly stated to be illegal under US and UK laws, and likely other countries as well. The citizen could face prosecution not only in Indonesia but also in the country where the targeted website is hosted. Furthermore, Indonesia's extradition laws allow for the possibility of extraditing its citizens to face charges in other countries, although specific treaties may vary. This situation exposes the citizen to potential legal consequences both domestically and internationally."

Stat. 83\\.49](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2019/0083.49) states:\n\n> Whenever money is deposited or advanced by a tenant on a rental\n> agreement as security for performance of the rental agreement or as\n> advance rent for other than the next immediate rental period, the\n> landlord or the landlord\u2019s agent shall the total amount in an account\n> at a Florida banking institution for the benefit of tenant\n\nThe closest thing to \"a separate account at a banking institution \" in the mortgage industry is called an escrow account. It is held by a neutral third party, which presumes that it is tied by contract to the other two. Now, I've never seen such a contract with leases even when they state \"security deposit will be held in a separate account\". So here's my question: what should one ask from a landlord to verify this clause is in effect?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statute is not talking about an escrow account\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIt\u2019s talking about a trust account \\- where one party (the landlord/agent) legally owns the account, but it\u2019s held for the benefit of another (the tenant).\n\nNote that the agent will not have seperate accounts for each tenant, but a single trust account where all the tenants deposits are comingled and keeping it all straight is an accounting problem for the agent, but one that agents and lawyers have been doing for centuries.\n\nYou could ask to see the bank deposit slips.",

The statute requires landlords or their agents to hold security deposits in an account at a Florida banking institution for the benefit of the tenant. The top answer clarifies that this is not an escrow account, but rather a trust account. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the law does not require individual escrow accounts for each tenant. In fact, the explanation states that agents typically use a single trust account where all tenants' deposits are commingled.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the funds must be held in a separate account for the benefit of tenants, not in the landlord's personal account.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the purpose of a security deposit is to be held during the tenancy, not returned immediately after signing the agreement.\n\nThe correct interpretation (C) aligns with both the statute and the explanation, emphasizing that the deposits should be held in a trust account at a Florida banking institution, benefiting the tenants while being managed by the landlord or agent."

It's mainly in the news because of how obviously absurd the claims are, and even NASA has commented saying that the whole idea is scientifically laughable.\n\nI'm sure these magic stickers don't cause much harm, if any, to the user. Would a company still be doing anything illegal by selling something which can be scientifically proven to not do what they claim it does?\n\nI understand some related legal concepts, like a person not receiving a product as it was described (like a used car with undisclosed problems, in the \"Lemon Law\", for example). But I'm wondering if there's anything specifically related to this type of business?\n\nTo put it more simply: how and/or when is making and selling snake oil against the law?\n\nNote: I am from the United States, but I would also be interested to hear other major countries' laws related to this issue.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Making and selling snake oil are okay, the problem arises with advertising it. The specific problem could be making deceptive claims, which would run afoul of all sorts of regulations. We can start with the quote alleged in the article, that purportedly Goop said:\n\n> Human bodies operate at an ideal energetic frequency, but everyday\n>  stresses and anxiety can throw off our internal balance, depleting our\n>  energy reserves and weakening our immune systems. Body Vibes stickers\n>  *(made with the same conductive carbon material NASA uses to line space\n>  suits so they can monitor an astronaut\u2019s vitals during wear)* come\n>  pre\\-programmed to an ideal frequency, allowing them to target\n>  imbalances.\n\nSuch a claim is not currently made on their web site, but a similar claim is [here](http://goop.com/wearable-stickers-that-promote-healing-really/)\n\n> Human bodies operate at an ideal energetic frequency, but everyday\n>  stresses and anxiety can throw off our internal balance, depleting our\n>  energy reserves and weakening our immune systems. Body Vibes stickers\n>  come pre\\-programmed to an ideal frequency, allowing them to target\n>  imbalances.\n\nIt appears that they retracted the italicized bit about NASA. The article says that 'the brand is now promoting stickers called \u201cBody Vibes\u201d', presumably \"the brand\" referring to Goop. It does seem to be true that they are *promoting* it, but they are not selling it: they do refer to a different web page for [shopbodyvibes.com](https://www.shopbodyvibes.com), and those folks are selling [something](https://www.shopbodyvibes.com/variety-packs/variety-12-pack), but they don't actually say what the things are, much less what they do. The apparent manufacturer / creator of the product, [AlphaBio Centrix](https://alphabiocentrix.com), states that they [developed an \"energy\" patch](https://alphabiocentrix.com/product-info-updates/alphabio-centrix-rd-announces-a-new-energy-patch-for-reducing-migraine-headaches/), and have other information [here](https://alphabiocentrix.com/bioenergy-patches-for-balancing-and-frequency-science/) on \"BioEnergy patches\". That blurb says, in part that\n\n> The patches are made from a specialized Biofeedback material designed\n>  for NASA to inner line the space suits.\n\nThis is a different claim from the one made on Goop, and for all we know somebody did design it for NASA (though NASA does not use it).\n\nThe article also claims\n\n> The stickers\u2014which run as high as $120 for a pack of 24\u2014promise to\n>  assuage various ailments, including anxiety and pain, using something\n>  called \u201cBio Energy Synthesis Technology.\u201d\n\nbut the [aforementioned actual sellers](https://www.shopbodyvibes.com/variety-packs/variety-12-pack) do not make any claim at all, they just have a set of words (Anti\\-Anxiety, At The Beach, Beauty Sleep, Chill etc.)\n\nThere are federal regulations about [truth in advertising](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/truth-advertising), and the FTC pays special attention to [health and fitness claims](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/truth-advertising/health-claims), for example the makers of 5 Hour Energy drinklets [had to pay $4\\.3M](https://www.law360.com/articles/890536/5-hour-energy-ordered-to-pay-4-3m-for-deceptive-ads) for deceptive advertising (in Washington state). The problem (not necessarily insurmountable) with going after somebody for making false advertising claims is that the most false claim (about NASA suits) is made by somebody that doesn't sell or manufacture the product, the claims made by the presumed manufacturer (\"programmed with the frequencies of nature to help the body energize itself\") are sufficiently vacuous as to have no truth value at all. If someone sold a product that did make a sufficiently specific claim that it could conceivably be refuted, then there could be a deceptive advertising claim. The reason why the energy crystal market still exists is they don't make any claims capable of disproof.",

It says \"you can't vote unless...\" three things. It has to be locally legal to vote for something other than a federal office, the election has to include something other than voting for federal office, and it cannot be possible to vote for a federal office at the same time. Given that, it is impossible for any alien (even documented) to vote for president. Extant alien\\-voting laws are no higher than municipality, most being in Maryland. Violation of the law is a crime.\n\nBecause non\\-citizens are not allowed to vote in state\\-wide elections, the theory is that they literally cannot vote, so they will not receive a ballot, which comes from the state. [Here](https://elections.maryland.gov/laws_and_regs/documents/Election%20Law%202011.pdf) are the election laws for Maryland. There isn't a provision for \"disqualifying\" a vote, instead a person is prevented from voting in the first place if they are successfully challenged, because they can't prove who they are or the person they claim to be is not registered to vote (a non\\-citizen will never be registered with the state to vote, assuming no fraudulent documentation).

For those who don't know, cryptocurrency mining can be a CPU\\-intensive process and can cause it to heat up, but the process can also generate cryptocurrency that can be exchanged for other currencies (CAD, USD).\n\nWould it be illegal to use this method to heat up the phone if the user is not told how the phone is heated up as it generates an income that they would not receive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The most important thing to realize is that such an App will probably never be accepted into the Apple App and/or iTunes store if you submit it without the mining disclosure in the end user's TOS.\n\nApple reserves the right to accept or decline any App in the App store; they will evaluate your App after you submit it, and when they find the crypto mining aspects and see that they are not clearly stipulated in the user's TOS, they will probably not accept your App. Apple will find that you attempted to conceal an App \"feature\" that involves user security, i.e. the mining software will communicate in secret from the iPhone to a mining hub or account under your control without the user's knowledge.\n\nEven if your App did make it into the store, chances are good someone will see their iPhone connect with the mining software and investigate. Even if you do disclose the miner in the TOS, Apple can decide to remove your App from the store.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An app developer wants to create an iPhone app that heats up the device in cold weather by running a cryptocurrency miner. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality and feasibility of this app?\n\nA) The app would be legal and accepted by Apple as long as the developer doesn't disclose the cryptocurrency mining feature to users.\n\nB) The app would be legal and accepted by Apple if the developer clearly discloses the cryptocurrency mining feature in the app's terms of service.\n\nC) The app would likely be rejected by Apple regardless of disclosure, due to concerns about user security and unauthorized background processes.\n\nD) The app would be legal and accepted by Apple as long as the generated cryptocurrency is shared with the users.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, Apple is likely to reject such an app regardless of whether the cryptocurrency mining feature is disclosed or not. This is because:\n\n1. Apple has strict policies regarding app security and background processes.\n2. The app involves secret communication between the iPhone and a mining hub without user knowledge, which raises security concerns.\n3. Even if the feature is disclosed in the terms of service, Apple reserves the right to remove apps that mine cryptocurrency.\n4. There are precedents of Apple removing similar apps that attempted to mine cryptocurrency, with or without user consent.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because non-disclosure of the mining feature would likely lead to immediate rejection by Apple.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because even with clear disclosure, Apple would still likely reject the app due to security concerns and their policies against cryptocurrency mining apps.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because sharing the generated cryptocurrency with users doesn't address Apple's primary concerns about security and unauthorized background processes."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Are there legislative limitations on web pages mirroring?\n\nLet me explain the task. If to publish some article with HTTP links in any web site, the source of information that has been used could be checked immediately by clicking on the links, (Wikipedia do such as to provide the changeability of objectivity of the information). However, in time the source web page that has been used as reference could be deleted, as result it becomes impossible to check the source of information. The way out is to create the mirror of source web page and include this mirror in own web site. So even if source web page will be deleted, it\u2019s still possible to refer on the mirror.\n\nLet me give an example of the conflict situation. Mr. A in a fit of temper published on his home page the unfavorable information in respect to himself, then later comes around and delete this information. However Mr. B, who has the interest to Mr. A, already quoted the deleted information with http\\-link and also just in case created the mirror of the home page of Mr. A. Although Mr. A already delated the information, Mr. B still can use the mirror to refer on source of information. All that left for Mr. A to resque his requtation is to hire the high\\-payed lawyer and prove the false fact that mirrored information has been edited. \n\nOK, it was the private example, however to exhaust this theme, it\u2019s required to consider also the conflict situations with organizations. Here is another instance. Do you remember the Snowden's exposure about global surveillance system? E. g. Mr. C going to publish the essay about these systems based on Snowden\u2019s information on his home page. He will be refer on newspaper articles that has been published also in the internet, e. g. \u201cThe Guardian\u201d or \u201cThe New York Times\u201d. But if CIA threats \u201cThe New Yourk times\u201d and demand to delete the publications about surveillance systems, of course the newspaper administration will do it. However Mr. C created the mirror of \u201cThe New York times\u201d news page and it will be available to check if from web page of Mr. C. What will be then, I can just suppose, but let us come back to original question and discuss the law related with web page mirroring.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you can look at how archive.org does the capture and mirror of the internet. They have a fairly long and detailed [FAQ](https://archive.org/about/faqs.php) discussing lots of theses issues.\n\nCrawling websites is generally not a problem, and it is the basis for how the internet works \\-\\- you would never be able to use google if it was not for the fact that they had crawled all the information already.\n\nHowever material is still subject to copyright \\-\\- so the usage of the information is key. Just like with google, nobody will object if you pull the site content assuming that you are not just trying to republish the content in breach of their copyright. They will however object if you are trying to pull a copy every minute as that would considered an attack on their servers.\n\nThere is however information which website owners explicitly state they don't want automated crawlers to access. This is by convention declared in a file on the website called [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/). You will see in the archive.org FAQ that they do not crawl those pages.\n\nLikewise, archive.org is removing content from website owners who give legal notice of not hosting their content \\- They will have to in order to comply with the DMCA.",

It's not the most efficient first step.\n\nB) A cease and desist letter can be effective, but it doesn't have the same legal weight as a DMCA takedown notice.\n\nC) Submitting a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) takedown notice to the hosting provider of the mirroring website is the most effective initial action. As mentioned in the passage, websites like archive.org comply with DMCA notices to remove content when copyright owners object. This is a standardized process that hosting providers are required to respond to under US law.\n\nD) While adding a robots.txt file to the original website can help prevent future automated crawling and mirroring, it doesn't address the existing mirrored content. Additionally, not all websites respect robots.txt files, so this isn't a guaranteed solution.\n\nThe DMCA takedown notice (option C) provides a formal, legal mechanism for copyright owners to request the removal of infringing content, making it the most effective initial approach in this situation."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We just moved into an apartment in a great (but somewhat expensive) building. Upon move\\-in we found several dead centipedes on the floor. Following that, we saw several live ones, and a cockroach in the stove.\n\nExterminators came and sprayed, and it seems that while that roach was errant (there were no signs of others having been there, and neighbors haven't seen any), the centipedes remain. I haven't seen a lot of them, but we'll see one crawling on a wall at night occasionally.\n\nThis isn't a big deal to me, but my wife has a phobia\\-level aversion to the critters. She can't even kill them with her shoe; she just runs. We talked to the apartment manager about this issue, and she escalated it to the management company. Turns out they'll waive the 6\\-month apartment transfer requirement, but still make us pay the $500 fee.\n\nThe only thing in the contract about bugs relates to bedbugs. There is something about transferring to a different apartment in the contract, but it just says \"a fee\" \\- no amount is stated.\n\nIs my only feasible solution here to pay?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am a licenced and bonded landlord and will answer from that perspective.\n\nYou do not say where you are, however, within the U.S. States that I operate in, there is little in the law about bugs with some obvious exceptions.\n\nOne exception is infestation. While there are varying degrees of concerns with infestations, the landlord has one obligation and that is to remedy the situation within a reasonable time using reasonable means. This often means hiring a licensed exterminator within a reasonable period of time and solving the problem within a reasonable time. This does not always work. For example, ants and termites may require additional expertise in solving the problem.\n\nCentipedes are often a result of moisture. While spraying is a start, the management may have other issues such as cracks in the foundation. Even small ones are enough. This is a prime example of requiring additional expertise. It may be that additional work is required. Centipede are common and largely harmless and often do not constitute an infestation. They are creepy for sure.\n\nRegardless of what the lease says, the law prevails here. Only a few rights can be waived by contract.\n\nThe landlord is required to use all reasonable means to solve the problem. Until it can be proven that the landlord has failed to solve the problem using reasonable means, you have no legal recourse.\n\nYou can certainly ask to have the fee waived. However, the landlord is under no obligation at this point and may choose not to. It is your choice. However, I would make sure you are not on the ground floor if you do switch apartments.\n\nOne other thing. There is no such thing as just one roach. The landlord should be spraying adjacent apartments including above and below. As well, assuming there is a basement, the landlord should be paying attention to cracks and gaps there too. Roaches require water and food. If another tenant is not clean then that is a problem that the landlord must solve also. This may not be too alarming of a problem since most roaches come from tenants moving. Higher turnover often means more problems including bed bugs. Proper periodic maintenance is required for larger apartment complexes.\n\nUse this answer as a standard by which to gauge the landlords response.",

The landlord has offered to allow the tenants to transfer to another apartment for a $500 fee. Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the landlord's legal obligations and the tenants' options?\n\nA) The landlord is legally required to waive the $500 transfer fee due to the persistent insect problem.\n\nB) The tenants have grounds for immediate lease termination without penalty due to the presence of insects.\n\nC) The landlord has fulfilled their legal obligations by sending exterminators and offering a transfer option, even with a fee.\n\nD) The landlord is required to continue extermination efforts until all insects are completely eliminated before considering a transfer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The landlord has taken reasonable steps to address the insect issue by sending exterminators to spray. While the centipedes persist, they are not typically considered an infestation and are often difficult to eliminate completely. The landlord has also offered a transfer option, which goes beyond their strict legal obligations. The $500 fee, while inconvenient for the tenants, is not illegal if it's part of the lease agreement or standard policy. The landlord is not required to waive fees or allow free transfers, nor are they obligated to continue treatments indefinitely. The tenants do not have grounds for immediate lease termination based on the described situation.

The answer is clearly yes, your translation process certainly includes at least the minimal creative input required to create a new work.\n\nSecond, is this new work a derivative work of the original? And I think the answer would almost certainly be yes. The test here is whether the new work contains sufficient protectable expression from the original work. However, the answer would be no if you do not take enough copyrightable material from the original work.

Based on the information provided, translating a work from one form to another (in this case, from one programming language to another) is likely to create a derivative work.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An employee creates a bookmarklet that modifies and enhances the functionality of their company's web application locally on users' computers. The company claims this violates their Terms of Service, which prohibit modifying or creating derivative works from their site. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The employee is definitely not violating the Terms of Service because the modifications are done locally and do not affect the company's servers.\n\nB) The company has no legal grounds to object since the bookmarklet only does what can be replicated in a browser's developer console.\n\nC) The employee may be in violation of the Terms of Service for modifying the site's content, even if done locally, and could potentially be held liable for users' infringements.\n\nD) The Terms of Service only apply to actions that directly impact the company's servers, so local modifications are always permitted.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most accurate statement is C. While the employee's modifications are local, the Terms of Service prohibit modifying or creating derivative works from the site's content, regardless of where this occurs. The employee likely violated the ToS while creating and testing the bookmarklet. Additionally, by distributing a tool that allows others to modify the company's intellectual property, the employee could potentially be held vicariously liable for users' infringements, especially if the bookmarklet's sole purpose is to modify the company's protected content. The fact that the modifications don't affect the company's servers or can be replicated in a developer console doesn't necessarily make them permissible under the ToS. This situation is complex and would likely require consultation with a technology-savvy attorney to fully assess the legal implications."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to know about the assessment of sales tax for online transactions in the USA (for states which collect such tax).\n\nAs I understand, sales taxes are assessed at multiple levels of government: district\\[s], city, county, and state. These 4 independent rates combine to establish the sales tax rate, which applies to the final sale price of an item delivered to an address within that jurisdiction, to be collected by the seller (or the seller's platform provider), and remitted to each applicable tax authority at some later date.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions, exclusions, exemptions, etc \\-\\- let's call these situations \"exempt\" and any other sale \"non\\-exempt\".\n\nSome questions:\n\n1. First, please correct errors in the above\n2. What authority oversees this process?\n3. How might one determine the exact tax rate applicable to their address?\n4. How can it be explained when non\\-exempt sales from different online sellers being shipped to a single address are all assessed different tax rates? *i.e., you purchase a $10\\.00 item (non\\-exempt) with $10\\.00 shipping from each of 5 online retailers, and the total with tax for each of the 5 sales is different*\n5. What are the legal consequences of charging the wrong tax rate (collecting the wrong tax)?\n6. What entity enforces compliance and hears consumer complaints?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> 2. What authority oversees this process?\n\n> 6. What entity enforces compliance and hears consumer complaints?\n\nThe state tax agency. They go by different names, such as the California Franchise Tax Board, Texas Comptroller, New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, and Florida Department of Revenue.\n\n> 5. What are the legal consequences of charging the wrong tax rate (collecting the wrong tax)?\n\nThis would depend on State law. If you merely fail to file or under\\-remit, you would likely have to pay a percentage penalty, which may go up depending on time, plus interest.\n\nIf you intentionally misrepresent taxes due, that would be tax evasion or tax fraud, which could result in a higher percentage penalty, seizure of assets, a misdemeanor or felony conviction, depending on the magnitude, and potential jail.\n\n> 4. How can it be explained when non\\-exempt sales from different online sellers being shipped to a single address are all assessed different tax rates?\n\nSome states use an origin\\-based sales tax system. For in\\-state remote sales, the seller collects tax based on the rate in the seller's location. This would be similar as if you had collected the purchase yourself at their premises.\n\nThe opposite would be a destination\\-based sales tax system where the tax rate collected is based on the address the goods were shipped to. Out\\-of\\-state sales tax collection is almost always destination\\-based.\n\nStates with generally origin\\-based tax rates are Arizona, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia. California is origin\\-based for city, county, and state taxes, but destination\\-based for district.\n\nThis is all broadly speaking, there are complicated state\\-dependent rules. For example New Mexico is origin\\-based on some types of services.\n\n> i.e., you purchase a $10\\.00 item (non\\-exempt) with $10\\.00 shipping from each of 5 online retailers\n\nAnother factor is the [taxability of shipping fees is complicated](https://www.avalara.com/blog/en/north-america/2022/02/how-to-handle-sales-tax-on-shipping-a-state-by-state-guide.html). In some states, \"shipping and handling\" becomes taxable when the fee charged is different from the fee charged by the carrier, e.g. the store is charging for boxes and labor. In other states, it may depend on the taxability of the items being shipped.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small online retailer based in Texas sells products to customers across the United States. Which of the following statements is correct regarding their sales tax collection responsibilities?\n\nA) They must collect sales tax based on the destination address for all sales, regardless of whether the customer is in Texas or another state.\n\nB) They should collect sales tax based on their store's location in Texas for in-state sales, and based on the destination address for out-of-state sales.\n\nC) They are only required to collect sales tax for sales within Texas, and can ignore tax collection for out-of-state sales.\n\nD) They must use a destination-based system for all sales, both in-state and out-of-state, to ensure compliance with all state laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of origin-based vs destination-based sales tax systems and how they apply to in-state and out-of-state sales. Texas uses an origin-based system for in-state sales, meaning the retailer would collect tax based on their store's location for Texas customers. However, for out-of-state sales, they would need to use a destination-based system, collecting tax based on the customer's address. Option A is incorrect because it doesn't account for Texas' origin-based system. Option C is wrong because it ignores the requirement to collect taxes for out-of-state sales in many cases. Option D is incorrect because it doesn't reflect Texas' origin-based system for in-state sales."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I work for a contractor to the federal government in West Virginia. During a government shutdown, my company is making us use eight hours of vacation, per day, which is legal in the state of WV. However, my company is also telling us that we need to check our government email during the shutdown, for any updates they may send and go into the HR system to input the eight hours of vacation, on a daily basis. When I inquired about what charge code we should bill for that work, I was told that, since this would amount to less than 15 minutes per day, that it is not billable. I am an exempt employee, but I am basically treated as hourly, as my hours worked and vacation must add up to the pay period minimum. \n\n1\\) We are not supposed to do work of any kind, during a shutdown. Wouldn't checking government email and filling out a time card on a daily basis violate this?\n\n2\\) We bill in half hour increments. Would checking email and doing time card activity be 0\\.5 hours of work, leaving a total of 7\\.5 hours VAC and 0\\.5 hours of work, per day? I know that this isn't a huge amount of time, but the principle of making us burn vacation while working for free seems to be wrong.\n\nI have checked with both the West Virginia Division of Labor, who told me that I needed to address this with the US Department of Labor, and the US Department of Labor, who told me that I need to address this with the West Virginia Division of Labor. \n\nI was trying to get my question answered without getting an attorney involved, or at least an answer as to whether talking to an attorney may be worthwhile, but have had no luck, so far.\n\nThanks. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a private employee who is classified exempt, your benefits and compensation are largely a matter of the contract between you and your employer.\n\nGovernment workers (those employed directly by the government, not contractors) are strictly prohibited in doing any work while furloughed by the Antideficiency Act. This includes checking official government email. However, you are not a government worker.\n\nNon\\-exempt (hourly) workers must be paid for all regular and expected duties that they are required or expected to fulfill, and being told to check email qualifies as work. [An employer is sometimes able to not record and pay for certain work done that is considered *de minimis*](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-exactly-is-de-minimis-how-to-73992/), but the legal standard here is that the work cannot be directed by the employer or be a regular part of the job, and the work must truly be short\\-term (seconds to a few minutes). Checking email off\\-the\\-clock counts as compensable work for non\\-exempt employees, and this establishes that checking email is considered work. However, as an exempt employee the pay provisions here do not apply.\n\nIn general, employers may or may not offer vacation time. If they do offer vacation time, they are not required to offer any specific kind of vacation time and may place reasonable restrictions on how and when vacation time can be used. There are some FLSA regulations on how and when vacation time may be counted, but these only apply to non\\-exempt employees.\n\nAs a result, because you are exempt, the main controlling factor here is your employment contract and what it says about vacation time. In West Virginia your employer is free to change their vacation time policy unilaterally, but they must honor any vacation time accrued under a previous policy without changes. If your employment contract says that you are required to check your email or otherwise stay in contact during vacation, then there's not a lot you can do here.\n\nThere are several more laws that apply specifically to some federal contractors under certain conditions, and [you can find a summary here](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/govtcontracts). Several of these require that federal contractors be paid at least minimum wage for work they perform, so if your vacation time is being used to avoid paying you for a day of work then your employer may be running afoul of the law here by requiring you to check your email.\n\nNote that the question of which account to bill hours to is an internal question and not regulated by law. Your employer has you assign billable hours so they can keep track of which government contract to charge your time to. This is done for their benefit, not for yours. They must still comply with your employment contract, including full pay and benefits, regardless of where you allocate your hours (unless the contract states otherwise).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An exempt employee working for a federal government contractor in West Virginia is required to use vacation time during a government shutdown. The employee is also asked to check their government email and input vacation hours into an HR system daily, without being compensated for this time. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The employee must be compensated for checking email and inputting hours, as this constitutes work and cannot be considered de minimis.\n\nB) The employer is violating the Antideficiency Act by requiring the employee to check government email during a shutdown.\n\nC) The employer's actions are likely legal, as exempt employees' benefits and compensation are primarily governed by their employment contract and West Virginia law allows for unilateral changes to vacation policies.\n\nD) The employee should file a complaint with the West Virginia Division of Labor, as they have jurisdiction over this matter.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As an exempt employee working for a federal contractor (not directly for the government), the employee's benefits and compensation are primarily governed by their employment contract and state law. West Virginia allows employers to change vacation policies unilaterally, as long as previously accrued vacation time is honored. The Antideficiency Act applies to government workers, not contractors, so B is incorrect. The de minimis rule typically applies to non-exempt employees, making A incorrect. Finally, the West Virginia Division of Labor directed the employee to the US Department of Labor, indicating they don't have jurisdiction, so D is incorrect."

Or are there *any* examples of a citizen having won legal damages for this practice?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Defamation is a false statement. If the police have arrested you or charged you with a crime, then a press release stating that you have been arrested or charged is a true statement, and not defamation. If the agency falsely stated that you were guilty of the crime then you'd have a case for defamation.\n\nIf the police did not actually have probable cause for arresting or charging you, then you might have a case, perhaps for false arrest or malicious prosecution.\n\nIn 1996 [Richard Jewell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jewell) was investigated by the FBI in the Atlanta Olympics bombing. He was never officially charged. However, multiple newspapers and TV networks named him as a suspect in the bombing. Eventually the US Attorney in the case issued a press release explicitly stating that Jewell was **not** a suspect. Jewell filed at least 5 lawsuits for libel, and received settlements in at least four. Since no government agency had officially named Jewell as a suspect, the suits were against media outlets and Jewell's employer. One might guess that the basis of the reporting was someone in law enforcement speaking off the record, but the press generally doesn't name their confidential sources, so we don't know.",

A week later, John is cleared of all charges. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's legal options?\n\nA) John can sue the police department for defamation because the press release damaged his reputation.\n\nB) John can sue the newspaper for libel because they published information that turned out to be false.\n\nC) John has no legal recourse against either the police or the newspaper if the arrest was made with probable cause.\n\nD) John can sue both the police and the newspaper for malicious prosecution, regardless of probable cause.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because if the police had probable cause for the arrest, and the press release only stated factual information about the arrest (not claiming guilt), then neither the police nor the newspaper has committed defamation or libel. The statement was true at the time it was made, even if John was later cleared. Options A and B are incorrect because reporting a factual arrest is not defamation or libel. Option D is incorrect because malicious prosecution typically requires proving that the prosecution was initiated without probable cause and with malicious intent, which is not suggested in this scenario."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a prospective law student currently conducting research on the legality of loot boxes in the United States, and I find Magic the Gathering very relevant. (Reference for Loot Boxes and Booster Packs below). The main debate is whether or not these type of products are illegal lotteries.\n\nThe law at question is California Penal Code 319, and specifically the definition of a lottery:\n\n> 319. A lottery is any scheme for the disposal or distribution of property by chance, among persons who have paid or promised to pay any\n>  valuable consideration for the chance of obtaining such property or a\n>  portion of it, or for any share or any interest in such property, upon\n>  any agreement, understanding, or expectation that it is to be\n>  distributed or disposed of by lot or chance, whether called a lottery,\n>  raffle, or gift enterprise, or by whatever name the same may be known.\n\n**Does this constitute MTG Booster sales (physical sales) as a lottery?**\n\n**Please note:**\n\n* The definition makes no mention of receiving/losing \"value\" from any such property, only that you received it by chance. IMO, by purchasing a booster, you have purchased a chance at receiving individual cards on a statistical spectrum (rarity). The chance bit is all that matters, not even the value of the cards. Because there is no mention of inheriting some value, or the ability to obtain a greater monetary value after the lottery, then the argument around not acknowledging the secondary market is negated.\n* The definition makes no mention of receiving anything vs receiving nothing, thus the argument of \"everyone receives something\" is negated\n* The definition makes no distinguishment of such property having sole monetary value vs some other intrinsic value such as being able to play a competitive game.\n* However, I believe that the nuance in this law is the definition of such property. Does a range of cards on a statistical spectrum of rarity each constitute an individual property vs the booster itself as the individual property? But, couldn't this argument be made about a lottery ticket? Would wizards need to make every card the same rarity and distribute each evenly if this were true? How can we navigate around a booster pack being purchased to receive a chance at some cards?\n* One area I find difficult to research is Magic Repacks on eBay. Not sure if anyone has any thoughts on this?\n\n**For Magic Arena (electronic version of the game):**\n\n* The argument might stand that WOTC does not give up actual \"ownership\" of the cards, however, in the context of 319, there is no explicit mention of ownership. Only \"distribution\" of such property. The game aspect may not conceal the fact there exists a purchase of chance within the game.\n\nReference:\n\n[Booster Pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_pack)\n\n[Loot Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box)\n\n[California 319](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?chapter=9.&part=1.&lawCode=PEN&title=9.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So the way I understand the thinking, is that TCG Booster cards have a set number (lets say 11\\) per each pack and each pack costs a set value X. The producer of the card thus values all cards in the pack at a price x/11 \\= $cost to make \\+ $profits for work per card. That is the materials and packaging per card in pack is all valued at the same regardless of rarity. After the company sells the card, secondhand sales of the card are not factored into their valuation of the card. A rare card could potentially be valued much lower than a common card based on the games current meta and popular strategy and use, though usually, the rare cards tend to be more important to the game.\n\nThey also have a gareente that out of these 11 cards a subset of them will always be common, another subset will always be uncommon, and the remainder will be rare or super\\-rare. Usually it will be something like 7:3:1\\. There might be an additional \"Secret Rare\" card that will occur once per box of booster packs. Again, while the value of the cards on the secondary market is going to be wildly disparent based on the pack of cards, the manufactured value will always be x/11 per pack.\n\nAs far as the law is concerned, the fact that everyone gets the same amount of cards from the rarity and that all cards are valued the same is enough. The secondary market doesn't matter. They don't care if the rarist card you get isn't a good card in a meta\\-game or a popular character in the fandom (i.e. Charizard), so long as it's cost to the manufacturer is the same as the secret rare card that occurs once per shipped box.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under California Penal Code 319, which of the following best explains why trading card game (TCG) booster packs are generally not considered illegal lotteries?\n\nA) TCG companies guarantee that players always receive some cards, unlike lotteries where participants may receive nothing.\n\nB) The secondary market value of individual cards is not factored into the manufacturer's valuation of the cards.\n\nC) TCG booster packs do not involve monetary prizes, which are a key component of illegal lotteries.\n\nD) Players have full ownership of the physical cards they receive, unlike digital loot boxes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The key reason TCG booster packs are generally not considered illegal lotteries under California Penal Code 319 is that the manufacturer values all cards in a pack equally, regardless of rarity or secondary market value. This approach treats each card as having the same value at the point of sale, which helps differentiate it from a lottery where the value of the prize is a central element.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the law doesn't specifically require that participants receive something for it to be considered a lottery.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the law doesn't specify that monetary prizes are necessary for something to be considered a lottery.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because ownership is not a determining factor in the definition of a lottery under this law, and physical ownership doesn't inherently differentiate TCG booster packs from lotteries."

During the year the contract was in effect, their relationship was governed by an arbitration agreement.\n\nAfter the employee is terminated (and after the contract governing their relationship expired) the employee wishes to bring suit against the employer regarding a work injury (or some other suit) that occurred during his employment.\n\nIs the suit subject to the arbitration agreement? Or can it be argued that since the contract was terminated already, the arbitration agreement \"expired\" and can no longer bind them to arbitrate even though the suit is based on something that occurred while the arbitration agreement was still in effect?\n\nWhile my gut feeling is that something like this *is subject to arbitration*, I'm wondering if there are any case precedents to support this assumption, especially in NJ?\n\nIn short, the question is whether a suit brought after the expiration of a contract, where the merits of the claim is based on pr\\-expiration time frame, is subject to arbitration or not?\n\n**CLARIFICATION**:\n\nWhile this question is similar to [this one](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86606/is-a-firm-required-to-arbitrate-disputes-arising-after-the-expiration-of-employm) it is not the same.\n\nIn [that question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86606/is-a-firm-required-to-arbitrate-disputes-arising-after-the-expiration-of-employm) the employee disputes the validity of termination so there are reasons to argue that the contract *is still in effect*. In this question, there is no disagreement between the employer and employee that the employee was properly terminated and the contract is no longer active. However, since the dispute relates to an incident that occurred while the arbitration agreement was active, the question is whether one of the parties can compel arbitration.\n\nMoreover, the [top answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/86624/36096) in that question primarily focuses on the fact that it is unlikely that the contract truly *expired* in that case. It merely transitioned from one phase to another. In this case, I am painting a scenario where there is no doubt at all that the contract expired.\n\nWhile there is some similarities between the two cases, my point in this question is to focus only on one specific component: Does it depend on what gave rise to dispute or when the dispute is being brought to court?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Yes**\n\nI would reach the same [conclusion as DaleM](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/87140/9517), i.e. that the arbitration clause still applies to the dispute in the question, but for a different reason.\\<1\\>\n\nWhile the severability principle is indeed a concept in arbitration law, I don't believe that is the relevant doctrine here.\\<2\\>\n\n**Termination Of Employment v. Termination Of An Employment Contract**\n\nWhat terminates when a period of employment ends is **the employment itself, not the contract of employment**. The contract remains effective as to rights and obligations arising during the course of the employment covered by the contract.\n\n(This concept would also sometimes be described in terms along the lines of \"the right to a remedy for the workplace injury and the right to have disputes related to that resolved in arbitration are vested rights\" that are not modified when the contract term of employment ends.)\n\nThis concept isn't particular to the arbitration obligation.\n\nFor example, if contract of employment that did not contain an arbitration clause provided that the employee was paid $200 an hour for the first six months and $220 an hour for the second six months of a one year fixed term employment agreement, but the employer failed to adjust paychecks according after the first six months and continued paying the employee at $200 an hour instead (assume to avoid the issue of waiver that this wasn't readily apparent on the face of the paystubs provided to the employee), the employee could bring suit thirteen months after the employee's employment terminated for the $20 an hour not paid as agreed during the last six months of the contract even though the employment period had ended.\n\nThe contract still remains in force to govern the rights and obligations of the parties arising during the period of employment.\n\n**Examples Of Termination Of The Contract Itself**\n\nIn contrast, sometimes one contract is replaced, even retroactively, with another contract, in what is called a \"[novation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/novation.asp)\" of the original contract. This truly does terminate the old contract, so that only the replacement contract remains.\n\nSo, if, for example, the original employment contract contained an arbitration clause, but this was replaced by a new employment contract without an arbitration clause three months later (in the sample case, before the worker was injured\\<3\\>), then the arbitration clause would not apply because the contract, and not just the employment was terminated.\n\nSimilarly, support that the workplace injury was the second dispute between the employer and employee that had come up. The first was a dispute over the rate of pay received which was resolved by a settlement agreement negotiated by lawyers for the parties before either arbitration or litigation in court was commenced, which expressly terminated all rights, known and unknown, of the parties arising under the contract, and the second was the workplace injury for which the relationship of the injury to work was only discovered later on. In this case, the contract and not just the employment had been expressly terminated, and so the arbitration clause would not apply to the workplace injury dispute (which would be barred by the settlement agreement and which may or may not have had an arbitration clause of its own).\n\n**End Notes**\n\n\\<1\\> At least assuming that the dispute would have been subject to arbitration if a dispute were litigated while the employee was still employed. There can be circumstances when a workplace injury is not subject to arbitration even if the employer and employee undoubtedly agreed to an arbitration clause that applies to the dispute in question. For example, workplace injuries arising from sexual assault are not subject to arbitration in the United States. *See* 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401\\-402\\.\n\n\\<2\\> The severability principle usually concerns a determination of the enforceability of an arbitration clause in the face of certain kinds of arguments that the entire contract as a whole is voidable. It also does not apply in cases where there is a dispute over whether any contract of any kind was formed in the first place. For example, if someone presented the court with a contract containing an arbitration clause and sought to compel arbitration, and the defense to a motion to compel arbitration was that the defendant had never met or had any connection with or communication with the defendant or anyone related to the alleged contract.\n\n\\<3\\> The hard case, where the novation takes place after the injury, is complicated by legal doctrines regarding the conditions under which a vested legal right can be waived, which may or may not be met depending upon the circumstances under which the novation was entered into by the parties and presents conceptually distinct legal questions in addition to the legal questions already present in the simple case where the injury takes place after the novation.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the arbitration agreement?\n\nA) The arbitration agreement no longer applies because the employment contract has expired.\nB) The arbitration agreement still applies because the dispute arose from an incident during the contract period.\nC) The arbitration agreement's applicability depends on whether the employee agreed to it after the termination.\nD) The arbitration agreement is automatically void for all workplace injury claims.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. As explained in the documentation, when a period of employment ends, it's the employment itself that terminates, not the contract of employment. The contract remains effective for rights and obligations that arose during the course of employment. Therefore, even though the lawsuit is filed after the contract period and termination, the arbitration agreement would still apply because the dispute is based on an incident (the workplace injury) that occurred while the contract was in effect. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the expiration of the employment period doesn't automatically nullify contractual obligations related to disputes arising from the employment period. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the applicability of the arbitration agreement doesn't depend on post-termination agreement, but on whether the dispute arose from the period covered by the original contract. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while there are some exceptions (like sexual assault claims), arbitration agreements are generally enforceable for workplace injury claims."

However, I'm close to a situation that is after the fact, so to speak. Please bear with me for a minute and I'll explain, then ask my question. \n\nMy father\\-in\\-law passed away this past summer. He and his wife had several large properties, and most of the family (except my wife and I) live on one of those properties. My mother\\-in\\-law decided that the property is far too much for her to handle so she's signed over the trust deeds to three properties to her children, without specifying how the land is to be divided up. \n\nThere is a working ranch (I call it a hobby ranch because it's for their pleasure, not a real business) on the property where the family lives. The mother\\-in\\-law is leaving it up to the children to decided how the land will be divided up. She doesn't want to be the \"bad guy\". \n\nMy question is this. Given the circumstances described above, would the kind of thing fall under the category of \"estate planning\"? And if it does, will any attorney with estate planning experience be able to handle this kind of situation? Or do we need to look for specific expertise?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, this falls under the heading of **negotiation**. You will need a lawyer and probably an accountant because if this is done badly you will owe waaay more tax than you should. However, most general lawyers will have sufficient experience with property transfer to be able to help you.\n\nWhat will matter in this is how the properties were owned by your mother\\-in\\-law and how the transfer is structured to the children. The three children *can* just hold equal share in each of the properties but I gather that is not what you want.\n\nYou need to agree among yourselves who gets what property and in what proportion. This doesn't have to involve valuations and equal shares *unless you want it to*. So long as everyone is satisfied with the division, equality is irrelevant. A lawyer may help with negotiation but then, so could a good friend who is a cod fisherman.\n\nWhat you really, really want to avoid is having the property pass to the siblings and *then* redistributing it \\- this will trigger property taxes twice.

While it's not strictly estate planning (as the mother-in-law has already transferred the properties), it requires careful negotiation among family members to decide property division.

Their privacy policy states the following:\n\n* \\[site] does not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties.\n* \\[site] does not share your contact information with other users or third parties without your consent.\n* Any personally identifiable information that you provide to \\[site] will be secured with industry standard protocols and technology.\n\nIn speaking with their staff, I have been informed that their terms of service contains language that makes users \"solely responsible for information posted on our Website\" and that users \"hereby assign to \\[site] your rights in any Non\\-Multimedia Content.\" They believe that those statements in the terms of service override the quoted privacy statements.\n\nIt seems to me that an uploaded resume is \"personally identifiable information\" and that it should be \"secured with industry standard protocols and technology.\" If the resume is publicly downloadable on the Internet, that's the definition of unsecured. Would their position stand up to the California CCPA, or Europe's GDPR rules? The resumes appear to belong to users from around the globe.\n\n\\[EDIT]\nFor clarity, this website is treating users' uploaded resumes as miscellaneous image files and allowing them to be indexed in Google. Resumes contain names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, social media handles and a lot of other private information that most privacy conscious people would not want published openly on the Internet. Since Guru.com is a jobs/employment oriented website it's completely reasonable that people upload their resumes there for the purpose of sharing with employers/clients who are logged\\-in to their own accounts for hiring purposes, and there is no reason to think that these resumes would not be treated as PII or contact information as defined in the privacy policy.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> \\[site] does not rent or sell your personally identifiable information\n> to third parties.\n> \n> \n> \\[site] does not share your contact information with\n> other users or third parties without your consent.\n\nLook, they do not *rent or sell* your PII, but what is it that they do not *share*? Not PII but *contact information*.\n\nIs contact information PII? Sure. Is PII contact information? Not necessarily.\n\nConclusion: they will not share your PII that is contact information, but will share (though not rent or sell) all other PII, such as resume without contact information.\n\n> it should be \"secured with industry standard protocols and\n> technology.\" If the resume is publicly downloadable on the Internet,\n> that's the definition of unsecured.\n\n\"Secured\" in this context means \"protected from *unauthorised* access\". Your resume is \"secure\" in the sense that noone can access it *if* the company does not want anyone to (but it turns out they actually want, haha).",

Their privacy policy states they do not rent or sell personally identifiable information (PII) to third parties and do not share contact information without consent. However, they claim their terms of service override these privacy statements. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The website is in clear violation of their privacy policy and likely breaking data protection laws.\n\nB) The website's actions are fully justified by their terms of service, regardless of their privacy policy.\n\nC) The website may be compliant with their privacy policy if they're only sharing PII that isn't contact information.\n\nD) The website is definitely compliant with data protection laws as long as they secure the data with industry-standard protocols.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The privacy policy specifically states that the website doesn't share \"contact information\" without consent, not all PII. This creates a loophole where they can share other types of PII (like resumes without contact info) while still technically adhering to their policy. The terms of service giving them rights to user content further supports this interpretation. While this practice may be ethically questionable and potentially violate some data protection laws (especially international ones like GDPR), it's not necessarily a clear-cut violation of their stated privacy policy. Options A and B are too extreme, while D is incorrect because compliance with data protection laws involves more than just securing data."

United States*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/320/81) case, the court had to determine whether imposing a curfew on those of Japanese descent was valid. The main constitutional issue ended up being the effectiveness of the [Fifth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) in providing for due process of law in times of war. In the end, the court decided that a curfew was indeed justified.\n\nFollowing this, the majority of the court found in [*Korematsu v. United States*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/214), that the exclusion of those with Japanese ancestry from certain military zones (in this case, the West coast) was also constitutional. In their decision, they heavily relied upon the *Hirabayashi* case.\n\nThe question of internment of people with Japanese ancestry was not actually decided constitutionally. Another case, a habeas corpus case, [*Ex parte Endo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_parte_Endo) might have resolved it, but the Court concluded this case in favor of Endo without going to the constitutional level. A day before this decision was announced, the government suspended Executive Order 9066, leaving the question unresolved.\n\nIn these cases, Justice Frank Murphy's opinions stand out. In *Hirabayashi*, he sternly warned of the racism involved, but felt that the curfew was indeed justified. However, in *Korematsu*, he evidently felt that the exclusion was without basis and dissented, calling the majority opinion \"legalization of racism.\"\n\nCurrent Law\n===========\n\nIn theory, these cases still stand. This is because they haven't been explicitly overruled, and the changes to the constitution since *Hirabayashi* aren't relevant: Amendments XXII and XXV have to do with procedural issues with the office of the President, amendments XXIII, XIV, and XXVI are related to voting rights, and XXVII addresses Congressional salaries. The constitution for the purpose of a similar order is thus unchanged, and so should theoretically be covered under *Korematsu* \\& *Hirabayashi*.\n\nHowever, its effective status as precedent is shaky. For one, it has been widely condemned, and courts would likely avoid using *Korematsu* \\& *Hirabayashi* if possible, or attempt to make a distinction from them given a slightly different order. Second, the convictions against Korematsu and Hirabayashi were overturned in the 1980s based on evidence being possibly concealed by the government. This was [confirmed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/blog/confession-error-solicitor-generals-mistakes-during-japanese-american-internment-cases) by the Department of Justice in 2011\\. However, this is an error of *fact*, and as such the *ratio decidendi* (legal reasoning) used would still technically stand as precedent.\n\n**Lengthy Update:** The Supreme Court has since declared *Korematsu* incorrect in *[Trump v. Hawaii](https://casetext.com/case/trump-v-hawaii-4)*. However in doing so, the court explicitly distinguished the two cases. Thus, many consider the declaration to be *obiter dictum*, i.e. an aside that is non\\-precedential. I'll quote the relevant portion so that readers may decide for themselves:\n\n> Finally, the dissent invokes *Korematsu v. United States*, 323 U.S. 214, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944\\). Whatever rhetorical advantage the dissent may see in doing so, *Korematsu* has nothing to do with this case. The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority. But it is wholly inapt to liken that morally repugnant order to a facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> The dissent's reference to *Korematsu*, however, affords this Court the opportunity to make express what is already obvious: *Korematsu* was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and\u2014to be clear\u2014\"has no place in law under the Constitution.\"\n\nAdditionally further muddying the issue is that the judgment directly moves from referencing *Korematsu* to referencing concentration camps. But as noted above, *Korematsu* dealt with exclusion, not internment in concentration camps as is often popularly believed (though Murphy's \\& Roberts's dissents dispute the distinction so the *Trump v. Hawaii* judgment may implicitly be validating this). *Korematsu* paragraph 20:\n\n> It is said that we are dealing here with the case of imprisonment of a citizen in a concentration camp solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition towards the United States. Our task would be simple, our duty clear, were this a case involving the imprisonment of a loyal citizen in a concentration camp because of racial prejudice. Regardless of the true nature of the assembly and relocation centers\u2014and we deem it unjustifiable to call them concentration camps with all the ugly connotations that term implies\u2014we are dealing specifically with nothing but an exclusion order.\n\nFuture Challenges\n=================\n\nIf another such order occurred, it would almost certainly reach the Supreme Court. The Court would then have to adhere to, reconcile with, or overrule *Korematsu* \\& *Hirabayashi*. In *Hirabayashi*, the following key piece of reasoning was given (and quoted in *Korematsu*):\n\n> Whatever views we may entertain regarding the loyalty to this country of the citizens of Japanese ancestry, we cannot reject as unfounded the judgment of the military authorities and of Congress that there were disloyal members of that population, whose number and strength could not be precisely and quickly ascertained. We cannot say that the war\\-making branches of the Government did not have ground for believing that in a critical hour such persons could not readily be isolated and separately dealt with, and constituted a menace to the national defense and safety, which demanded that prompt and adequate measures be taken to guard against it.\n\nRegardless of personal beliefs, it is hard to argue the logic behind this particular statement (mainly because it is so broad, in my opinion). However, these \"prompt and adequate measures\" would still have to be weighed against the Fifth Amendment. Additionally, we now have a historical example of what may happen if race\\-based exclusion were allowed, and this could inform the justices' decision.\n\nA completely different way that such an order could be ruled unconstitutional could be through separation of powers violations. It could be ruled that Congress [cannot constitutionally delegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondelegation_doctrine#United_States) the powers expressed in Executive Order 9066, but this is rare. It was mentioned in *Hirabayashi*, but the court did not consider this issue, saying that since Congress agreed with the order, this point was moot.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nThough the letter of the law suggests that another order like Executive Order 9066 is possible, in practice it would face significant hurdles. Such an order would likely face challenges based on the Fifth Amendment and almost certainly make its way to SCOTUS. Then, it would be up to them to decide.\n\nI'll end with this [quote](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/scalia_korematsu_was_wrong_but_you_are_kidding_yourself_if_you_think_it_won) from the late Justice Antonin Scalia:\n\n> Well, of course, *Korematsu* was wrong \\[...] But you are kidding yourself if you think the same thing will not happen again.",

United States decision?\n\nA) The Supreme Court explicitly overruled Korematsu v. United States in Trump v. Hawaii, making it impossible for a similar executive order to be issued today.\n\nB) Korematsu v. United States remains valid precedent, as it has not been directly overturned by a subsequent Supreme Court decision or constitutional amendment.\n\nC) While Korematsu v. United States has not been explicitly overruled, its precedential value is questionable due to subsequent developments, including the overturn of convictions and recent Supreme Court commentary.\n\nD) The Constitution has been amended since World War II to prevent similar executive orders from being issued, rendering Korematsu v. United States obsolete.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate reflection of the current legal status. While Korematsu v. United States has not been explicitly overruled by a binding Supreme Court decision, its precedential value has been significantly weakened. The convictions of Korematsu and Hirabayashi were overturned in the 1980s due to evidence of government misconduct. Additionally, in Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court stated that Korematsu was \"gravely wrong the day it was decided,\" though this statement is considered by many to be obiter dictum (non-binding commentary). These factors, combined with widespread condemnation of the decision, make its precedential value questionable, even though it has not been formally overturned.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Supreme Court criticized Korematsu in Trump v. Hawaii, it did not explicitly overrule it in a way that would make similar executive orders impossible.\n\nOption B is technically true in a narrow sense, but it fails to account for the significant challenges to Korematsu's validity and its questionable status as precedent.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there have been no constitutional amendments specifically addressing the issues raised in Korematsu or preventing similar executive orders."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a very bad neighbor. What legal recourse do I have? I feel like I'm stumbling in the dark.\n\nI find myself at a loss for an appropriate Stack Exchange site. Perhaps \"workplace\" or \"parenting\" are in the same vein, but I'm trying to figure out what to do (legally) about a terrible neighbor, so it isn't either of those... And Stack Exchange doesn't have a \"interpersonal problems\" site. Since legality is a concern, Stack Law seemed the logical choice to ask a question. Any better suggestions on QA forum and tags is appreciated.\n\nI say my neighbor is bad because he:\n\n1. frequently calls false noise complaints on neighbors resulting in police action.\n2. stands in front of the building in a menacing way as people enter/exit.\n3. hates black people.\n4. hates Middle Eastern people and Muslims.\n5. constantly pounds on the floor/walls/ceilings.\n6. screams curses at children.\n7. Continues to park in handicap parking despite not being handicap, and receiving very expensive parking tickets.\n8. And to add to the list, I suspect he's been putting nails in my car tire, always on the same tire, on the inside wall of the tire; I just replaced my 5th tire in 3 months.\n\nDespite several complaints to apartment management from 4 different residents, he has not been evicted, and most of my neighbors, whom I was friends with, have moved \\-\\- breaking their leasing contract to get away.\n\nI want to place hidden cameras on my vehicle to catch him putting a nail in my tire. \n\nI've approached my management several times to voice my concerns only to be stonewalled, which makes me wonder if there is something else going on, like witness protection (or they are just as terrified of him as everyone else). It may also be that each time the apartments contact him to voice their concern, he physically goes over there and basically has a tantrum, but without making direct threats. Most of the apartment staff are tiny women (shorter than 5ft).\n\nWhen I asked if I could install a hidden camera to watch my car, I was told by management they wouldn't give permission, but also weren't *not* giving permission, and wished me luck trying to catch him on film.\n\nIf I install a hidden camera, is it legal, and could I contact the police/evict him/file a restraining order? Would that even be considered legal evidence, or would I be liable for unlawful surveillance?\n\nIs there some sort of legal incentive I've not clearly communicated to management to evict him?\n\nIf he actually is insane, what sort of liability for his actions does he have?\n\nI'm really just stumped and would like some advice from someone not emotionally close to the situation which could help guide my actions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am sympathetic to your problem but there is probably not a legal solution: at least not an easy or cheap one. To help you clarify a whole mish\\-mash of issues I will address each of your points.\n\n> 1. frequently calls false noise complaints on neighbors resulting in police action.\n\nIf the person genuinely believes that these complaints are valid, even if they do not end up being substantiated, he is within his rights to make such complaints. If you can document an ongoing pattern of unproven complaints this *might* amount to harassment and you could then seek a court order that he stop the harassing behaviour. However, if even a few of these complaints are proven this would become much harder.\n\n> 2. stands in front of the building in a menacing way as people enter/exit.\n\nHe is entitled to stand wherever he likes in whatever \"way\" he likes. This is only an issue if the person entering/exiting has a reasonable fear that he will he will visit actual harm upon them, o, of course, if he actually does visit physical harm upon them. If so, then this is assault and can be reported to the police or be the basis of a civil action.\n\n> 3. hates black people.\n\nSo, he's a bigot \\- this is not actually illegal. Discriminating against someone on the basis that they are black is illegal, hating them on that basis isn't.\n\n> 4. hates Middle Eastern people and Muslims.\n\nDitto.\n\n> 5. constantly pounds on the floor/walls/ceilings.\n\nIt can't be \"constantly\" \\- it might be often or even frequently, if you intent to take legal action hyperbolic language is not going to aid your case. To make a real complaint about this you would need to diarise each occurrence.\n\nNotwithstanding, unless he is damaging someone else's property or is violating a noise ordinance this is not illegal.\n\n> 6. screams curses at children.\n\nClearly reprehensible behaviour: not clearly illegal. Unless this is assault (see above) or qualifies as offensive behavior under the criminal code wherever you are (unlikely) then he can scream whatever he wants at whoever he likes. Again, a pattern of such behavior may constitute harassment.\n\n> 7. Continues to park in handicap parking despite not being handicap, and receiving very expensive parking tickets.\n\nThis is illegal and he is being punished for it. Unfortunately the expression [Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time.](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Don%27t%20do%20the%20crime%2C%20if%20you%20can%27t%20do%20the%20time.) has a corollary: if you are willing and able to take the punishment then you do as much crime as you want. \n\n> And to add to the list, I suspect he's been putting nails in my car tire, always on the same tire, on the inside wall of the tire; I just replaced my 5th tire in 3 months.\n\nThis is a crime. If you can get evidence to prove it then you can report him to the police and/or sue him for the damage.\n\nYou have stated in your comments that you will be asking another question specifically about filming him, so I won't address this here.\n\n> Is there some sort of legal incentive I've not clearly communicated to management to evict him?\n\nThat depends on if any of his actions are actually grounds for terminating his lease and, if they are, the landlord wants to do so. A remote landlord who is getting his rent on time and not having their property damaged has no incentive to evict a tenant: no matter how annoying they are to others.\n\nIt is possible, that you have a case for breaking your lease and/or suing your landlord for damages as you are not getting \"quiet enjoyment\" of the property. A suit along those lines may resolve the matter because either you or he will be evicted. Consult a lawyer.\n\n> If he actually is insane, what sort of liability for his actions does he have?\n\nThe same as anybody else. Liability for civil wrongs is an objective test of what a reasonable person would be liable for: it is not based on the specific characteristics of the person.",

If the landlord is failing to address ongoing issues that significantly disrupt this right, the tenant may have grounds for legal action.\n\nD) is incorrect because making noise complaints, even if they turn out to be unfounded, is not an animal control issue and is generally within a person's rights unless it becomes a clear pattern of harassment.\n\nThe correct answer focuses on the legal concept of \"quiet enjoyment\" and the landlord's responsibility, which is one of the few aspects mentioned that could potentially have a valid legal basis for action in this situation."

Is it illegal for an employer or recruiter to ask an employee, contractor or potential hire if they have been vaccinated for Hepatitis C or have been diagnosed with ADHD?\n\nAccording to the [Canadian Human Rights Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/fulltext.html)\n\n> 3 (1\\) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of\n> discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion,\n> age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital\n> status, family status, genetic characteristics, disability and\n> conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in\n> respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n\nIt seems to me that medical information is not a protected class (well it's not a class at all really). So asking about vaccines should be allowed, unless there's another law I'm unaware of. Presumably the employer must comply with PIPA with any information they obtain relating to an employees medical record. ADHD could count as a disability so I guess an employer can't ask about that. Is my understanding correct?\n\nHas legislation been passed to make an exception for COVID vaccination status?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\")\n\nAn employer has the **responsiblity** to safeguard the health of all their employees (**F\u00fcrsorgepflichten des Arbeitgebers**, *Employer Duty of Care*).\n\n> [\u00a7618(1\\) Duty to undertake protective measures \\- German Civil Code (BGB)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p2589)  \n> \n> (1\\) The person entitled to services must furnish and maintain premises, devices and equipment that he must provide for performance of the services in such a way and must arrange services that must be undertaken on his order or under his supervision in such a way that **the person obliged to perform services is protected against danger to life and limb** to the extent that the nature of the services permits.\n\nHow the **duty of care** is to be implemented in concrete terms is described in more detail in numerous other laws.\n\nThe employer must always weigh the employee's personal rights against the employer's operational interests. When asking questions, the employer may only have **the specific position in which the employee is to be employed in mind** and check its requirements. Where there is no **need to know**, the employer cannot ask.\n\nAn employee has certain **personal rights** ([Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsrecht](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pers%C3%B6nlichkeitsrecht_(Deutschland))), but only in so far as it **doesn't violate the rights of others**.\n\n> [Article 2 Personal freedoms \\- Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0023)  \n> \n> (1\\) Every person shall have the right to **free development of his personality** *insofar as he does not violate the rights of others* or offend against the constitutional order or the moral law.  \n> \n> (2\\) Every person shall have the **right to life and physical integrity**.
