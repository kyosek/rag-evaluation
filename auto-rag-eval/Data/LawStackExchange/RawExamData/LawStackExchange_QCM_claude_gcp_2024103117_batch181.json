(Many states do, however, allow a criminal defendant to unilaterally opt for a bench trial.)\n\nLikewise: Under [FRCP 43](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_43), a criminal defendant *cannot* opt out of being present for his entire trial.\n\nThese rules seem opposed to the basic civic principles that surround the presumption of innocence before conviction, and the right of a person to pursue an effective defense. I can think of plenty of reasons why a person may not want to show his face in a public court, much less sit through the entire process. Including reasons that may prejudice the triers of fact: e.g., disfigurement, handicaps that produce irritating tics, etc.\n\nThe notes on these federal rules cite a great deal of jurisprudence and history.

However, once the trial has begun, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCP) Rule 43 allows for the absence of the defendant under certain conditions. One of these conditions is voluntary absence. Therefore, John must be present for the start of his trial, but could then choose to voluntarily absent himself for the remainder if he wishes. Option A is incorrect because there is no absolute constitutional right to opt out entirely. Option C is too strict, as it doesn't account for the exceptions in FRCP Rule 43. Option D is incorrect because it confuses the rules for waiving a jury trial with those for defendant presence."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19361/adopted-sisters-trying-to-get-married", "docs_id": 19361, "title": "Adopted &quot;Sisters&quot; trying to get married", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My partner and I, now 22, were adopted together when we were 12\\.

It does, however, not grant the same right to aunts and nephews etc. (including those by adoption), which could engender competing claims about legislative intent. It would then be relevant to look at the Washington analog of this statute, [RCW 26\\.04\\.020](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.04.020), which prohibits marriage:\n\n> (1\\)(b) When the spouses are nearer of kin to each other than second\n>  cousins, whether of the whole or half blood computing by the rules of\n>  the civil law.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) It is unlawful for any person to marry his or her sibling, child,\n>  grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew.\n\nHere, the blood\\-relation rule applies to (second) cousins and is absolute for aunts and sibling. It would seem that various legislatures had different intents, in forming these statutes.\n\nIn Oregon, [ORS 106\\.020](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/106.020) prohibits marriage\n\n> When the parties thereto are first cousins or any nearer of kin to\n>  each other, whether of the whole or half blood, whether by blood or\n>  adoption, computing by the rules of the civil law, except that when\n>  the parties are first cousins by adoption only, the marriage is not\n>  prohibited or void\n\nIn this case, the Oregon law explicitly equates blood and adoption, and then could cast doubt on the concept of \"whole or half blood\" as actually referring to blood relationship (although, Oregon is not Idaho, or Washington). \n\nGiven the literal reading of the Idaho statutes (and without there being any clarifying case pertaining to relationship by adoption), it may take a court order to compel the county clerk to obey the law, especially if the clerk is dispensing life choice recommendations. That is especially so if the law is not clearly established.\n\nMontana likewise restricts [(40\\-1\\-401\\)](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/40/1/40-1-401.htm)\n\n> a marriage between an ancestor and a descendant or between a brother\n>  and a sister, whether the relationship is by the half or the whole\n>  blood, or between first cousins\n\nThat statute also says\n\n> Parties to a marriage prohibited under this section who cohabit after\n>  removal of the impediment are lawfully married as of the date of the\n>  removal of the impediment.\n\nHowever, there is no obvious way to get legally unadopted, especially when the parties are adults.\n\nAn additional wrinkle is that in Idaho under [32\\-209](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title32/T32CH2/SECT32-209/), valid marriages entered into elsewhere are valid in that state\n\n> unless they violate the public policy of this state.

Idaho's laws on sibling marriage focus on \"brothers and sisters of the half (1/2) as well as the whole blood,\" which doesn't explicitly include adopted siblings who are not blood-related. However, the law is not entirely clear on the status of adopted siblings, and there's no mention of a process to annul adoptive relationships. Given the ambiguity and potential competing claims about legislative intent, the adopted siblings might be able to marry but could face legal challenges.

Gross earnings:\n> \n> \n> * is calculated from the start of employment, and\n> * include any other\n>  payments made in the employee\u2019s final pay.\n> \n> \n> If the employee has taken\n>  annual holidays in advance or has been paid for annual holidays on a\n>  pay\\-as\\-you\\-go basis, the amount paid is deducted from gross earnings.\n\nThis means there are two ways to formulate this calculation:\n\n1. (gross pay \\- advance leave) \\* 0\\.08\n2. (gross pay \\* 0\\.08\\) \\- advance leave\n\nThese two approaches differ wildly in the outcome \\- the first is in the employee's favour, the second in the employer's favour. On gross earnings of $100k, the difference can be several thousand dollars.\n\nWhen the advice given is a government website specifically intended to give advice in this area, how are differences in interpretation generally handled?\n\nThe second website does contain a disclaimer about not being legal advice, but that seems pretty weak when the entire website is intended to guide employers and employees in their requirements and obligations.\n\nThe examples are from NZ, so an NZ specific answer would be nice, but I'd also like to hear what other countries and jurisdictions do as well.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In interpreting a statute, New Zealand courts must conform to the [Legislation Act 2019](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2019/0058/latest/DLM7298193.html), which says that\n\n> The meaning of legislation must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose and its context.\n\nThis carries forward a provision from the [Interpretation Act 1924](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2019/0058/latest/DLM7298193.html) at 5(j) that interpretation must \"best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act \\[...] according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\" In discovering what this purpose is, the entire text of the Act is available, including in this case the Holidays Act s. 15(c),\n\n> The purpose of this subpart is to \\[...] require employers to pay employees at the end of their employment for annual holidays not taken or paid out\n\nWhen they do this, the courts must be cautious not to make up their own laws; in the *Northern Milk* case, this was summarized as\n\n> The Courts must try to make the Act work while taking care not themselves to usurp the policy\\-making function, which rightly belongs to Parliament. The Courts can in a sense fill gaps in an Act\n> but only in order to make the Act work as Parliament must have intended.\n\n(This case, *Northland Milk Vendors Association Inc v Northern Milk Ltd \\[1988]* 1 NZLR 537 (CA), is a major authority for how far the courts can go. There, they were dealing with a gap in time between one statutory regime ending and the next one beginning, where Parliament had neglected to say what would happen in between. The Court of Appeal had to decide on the purpose of the Milk Act 1988 by looking at such textual matters as its long title, which said that it was meant \"to provide for the continuing home delivery of milk\", and so the status quo had to be maintained in the interim.)\n\nBut this exercise is focused on the statute itself. It excludes, for example, even such tempting targets as an *amendment* to that statute which was made subsequent to the case at hand, and which might clarify what was intended. (See [Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Databank Systems Ltd Co (New Zealand) \\[1990] UKPC 37](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1990/1990_37.html).) In some cases, reference might be made to the Parliamentary circumstances when the statute was passed. New Zealand, compared to other similar jurisdictions, is reluctant to bring in other kinds of non\\-statutory material to explain a statute. They also do not generally defer to government agency interpretations unless the matter is very technical, or the primary statute tells them they must.\n\nFor the Holidays Act, recent cases concerning some *different* ambiguities have been resolved without having to look beyond the text itself, and its broad purpose. (For example, *Postal Workers Union v NZ Post* \\[2012] NZCA 481, on whether unrostered overtime is part of \"relevant daily pay\", or *Tourism Holdings Ltd v Labour Inspector* \\[2021] NZSC 157, on holiday pay for somebody with a very irregular work pattern.) I would expect that in your example, government websites would *not* be used by the courts to determine what the law means. They would do their best to \"make the Act work\", starting from its actual text, and informed by its own statement of purpose. But they would not use a guidance note from a government website as evidence for what *Parliament* intended.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: When interpreting ambiguous legislation in New Zealand, which of the following approaches would courts be LEAST likely to rely on?\n\nA) Examining the text of the statute itself\nB) Considering the purpose stated within the Act\nC) Referencing government website interpretations of the law\nD) Looking at the context of the legislation\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \n\nThis question tests understanding of how New Zealand courts approach statutory interpretation when faced with ambiguity. \n\nOption A is incorrect because examining the text of the statute itself is a primary method courts use, as stated in the Legislation Act 2019: \"The meaning of legislation must be ascertained from its text.\"\n\nOption B is incorrect because considering the purpose stated within the Act is also a key approach. The passage mentions that courts must interpret legislation \"in the light of its purpose,\" and cites an example from the Holidays Act where the stated purpose was considered.\n\nOption C is the correct answer because the passage explicitly states that \"government websites would not be used by the courts to determine what the law means.\" Courts focus on the statutory text and purpose rather than external interpretations.\n\nOption D is incorrect because considering the context of the legislation is part of the interpretive approach outlined in the Legislation Act 2019, which requires meaning to be ascertained \"in the light of its purpose and its context.\"\n\nThe key point is that New Zealand courts prioritize the text and purpose of the legislation itself, rather than relying on external interpretations like government websites."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4211/performing-music-in-public", "docs_id": 4211, "title": "Performing music in public", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am a musician. I want to perform music. How do I do this without being sued into oblivion? \n\nI am particularly interested in UK law.\n\nAs I understand it, a specific sound recording (of anything) is protected by copyright, but the specific pattern of musical notes that make up a song is *also* protected (and the rights might belong to somebody different). So even if I don't use any copyrighted sound recordings, if I were to play a song that's recognisable, I would still be sued.\n\nWhen looking at a song, I believe there are three possibilities:\n\n1. The song was written so many centuries ago that nobody holds the rights to it any more and the music is in the public domain, e.g. Bach is presumably out of copyright now.\n2. You wrote the song yourself, so *you* own the rights to it.\n3. Somebody else owns the rights to it.\n\nObviously, it's the third case that presents a problem. In theory, you find out who owns the rights, and ask them whether you can use the song. Maybe they say yes, maybe they say no. In reality, it's not like you can just call Sony BMG (or whoever) and chat to them about it. And even if you could, they'll want tens of millions of dollars to license the song, which I obviously don't have.\n\nThis appears to mean that it is actually impossible to ever play any song that people will recognise.\n\nAm I correct in my interpretation of the law? Is there some way around this problem?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most countries have [**compulsory** or **statutory licences**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_license) for exactly these situations. You enter a licence agreement with a collecting society, pay them licencing fees, and give them a record of the music you perform. They in turn then distribute royalties to the rights holders.\n\nThe exact details of which licence you'll need depends on your country, the types of events you will perform at, the frequency of the events, the size of the audience etc. It may be the venue's responsibility to obtain the licence instead of the performer, or both the venue and the performer may need to. I don't have any experience of this, and if I did my experience would be useless to yours in the UK ;).\n\nBut luckily the UK has an [easy to find website](https://www.gov.uk/live-music-licence) which tells you just where you need to go.

In the UK, musicians who want to perform copyrighted songs can obtain a compulsory or statutory license through PRS for Music. This organization acts as a collecting society, allowing performers to pay licensing fees and report their performances. PRS for Music then distributes royalties to the appropriate rights holders. This system makes it possible for musicians to legally perform popular songs without having to negotiate individual licenses or pay exorbitant fees.\n\nOption A is incorrect because contacting each rights holder individually is not necessary and would be impractical.

Is it cause for them to be disqualified, or even for the whole panel to be disqualified?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I finally found the actual transcript of the *voir dire* part of the case mentioned in the question.\n\n[http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story\\=2012090614295190](http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=2012090614295190)\n\nAs can be evidenced from the transcript, the judge has specifically instructed the two jurors working as engineers at the local tech companies that they'd have to \"forget\" what they know about both the software engineering and the patent law itself, too, starting their work on the whole case with a completely clean sheet, using a very simple criteria for making decisions:\n\n> One side or the other is going to have the burden of proof on \\-\\- one side has the burden of proof on some issues, the other side has the burden of proof on other issues. When you go into the jury room to deliberate after you've tried your hardest to understand the evidence, if they haven't educated you on it or if they haven't persuaded you, the party with the burden of proof loses. It's that simple. You don't have to \\-\\- you have to make a good faith effort to understand it, but if the party with the burden of proof has failed to do that, the party with the burden of proof loses. That's the standard. You have to \\-\\- you, the jury, decide.\n> \n> \n> Now, what you cannot do is bring to bear something that you've learned in some other case, some other patent case, about how some piece of equipment works or something like that. You can't do that. It has to be based on the record here.\n\nThen, after a short break and a consultation with the lawyers, where Oracle seems to have expressed some concern to having the computer experts be on the panel, which subsequently prompted the judge to declare the following to the two potential jurors who worked at Cisco and HP:\n\n> So this is really going to be directed at both of you, but, you know, you come to the party, so to speak, with some prior training that bears upon the subject matter we're going to be hearing a lot about here. That's okay. That's not disqualifying, but you \\-\\- it's okay to use your common sense when you render a verdict, but you cannot add to the record in court something that you know about the way software programming works that the witnesses didn't actually testify to. You see what I'm saying?\n> \n> \n> You've got to decide the record \\-\\- the case based on the record made here as opposed to adding into it what else you may have known about the way programming and software works.\n\nSince both jurors had so much software and patent experience that they couldn't disregard it easily, they were thus both excused (page 95 of 224\\).\n\n> All right. I think it would be too hard\n> for you to sit in this case and sort out what you knew already\n> against what is proven or not proven here, and itwould not be\n> fair to the parties to have that extra burden even though you\n> two actually know something about the subject. It's in a way\n> too bad, but it's for the best. So you two are excused to go\n> back to the jury assembly room. Thank you.\n\nThe other instructions that the judge gives to the potential jurors is also worth reading (starts on page 36 of 224\\)\n\nThe full transcript is at [http://www.groklaw.net/pdf3/OraGoogle\\-942\\.pdf](http://www.groklaw.net/pdf3/OraGoogle-942.pdf).\n\nIn summary \\-\\- **jurors are only allowed to talk to one another when the deliberation process starts, and, no, they are not allowed to bring any \"baggage\" to the case at stake**.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the Oracle v. Google case, how did the judge handle potential jurors with prior knowledge of software engineering and patent law?\n\nA) The judge allowed them to serve on the jury and share their expertise with other jurors during deliberations.\nB) The judge instructed them to use their prior knowledge to help interpret technical evidence presented in court.\nC) The judge excused them from the jury after determining it would be too difficult for them to separate their prior knowledge from the evidence presented in court.\nD) The judge allowed them to serve but required them to sign a non-disclosure agreement about their prior knowledge.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The judge initially instructed the potential jurors with relevant expertise that they would need to \"forget\" what they knew about software engineering and patent law, and base their decisions solely on the evidence presented in court. After further consideration and consultation with the lawyers, the judge determined that it would be too difficult for these jurors to separate their prior knowledge from the evidence presented in court. As a result, the judge excused them from serving on the jury, stating it \"would not be fair to the parties to have that extra burden even though you two actually know something about the subject.\"\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the judge explicitly instructed jurors not to use or share their prior knowledge. Option D is incorrect because while the judge considered allowing them to serve initially, he ultimately decided to excuse them rather than have them sign any agreement."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77751/do-lawyers-send-demand-letters-to-a-client-who-owes-them-money-or-do-they-just-s", "docs_id": 77751, "title": "Do lawyers send demand letters to a client who owes them money or do they just sue?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a lawyer has a deadbeat client, do they just immediately file a complaint against them and seek judgement, or do they send a demand letter first threatening to sue them?\n\nI am not asking about when they are do debt recovery for someone else professionally. I am asking what lawyers do when one of their own clients owes them money and shows no signs of paying voluntarily.\n\nThe reason why I ask is that I trying to determine to what extent demand letters are just efforts to generate billable hours, or whether they have a legitimate purpose. If lawyers never bother to send demand letters when they collect their own debts, then obviously the letters are just a revenue\\-generation method.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Demand letters are often used to collect debts from one's own clients, most prominently, because filing a lawsuit against a client often triggers a counterclaim for malpractice or an ethical grievance, even if it is not justified on the merits. Demanding payment without suing rarely has these consequences and often isn't even enough to trigger an urge to post an unjustified (or justified) bad review of the lawyer online.\n\nDemand letters are not just efforts to generate billable hours. Lawyers want to generate billable hours for clients who pay them reliably, rather than devoting time to work collecting from a client who has a significant likelihood of not paying.\n\nOne reason to send demand letters is that sometimes, the reason that clients don't pay is not that they are unwilling to pay, or dispute the bill, but that they are currently unable to pay. A demand letter keeps the debt fresh in the client's mind when an ability to pay is restored. Quite a bit of hourly charge legal work is *de facto* contingent fee work because the client almost by definition won't have the ability to pay for it promptly if the outcome is a bad one (often for reasons beyond the lawyer's control).\n\nDemand letters are cheap, can often be drafted by administrative staff for attorney review, and because they are cheap, don't have to have a high success rate to be worth the effort. Even a 5%\\-10% payment rate for unpaid fees that are sought in demand letters makes them worth it.\n\nA second reason to send a demand letter can also trigger a written response acknowledging that the debt is owed and apologizing for not paying, and/or paying a token amount like $25, each of which extends the statute of limitations to collect the entire amount of the debt for unpaid fees.\n\nA third reason to send a demand letter is that it helps the lawyer to keep current on the client's address, if the client moves, while a mail forwarding order is still in place.\n\nA fourth reason to send a demand letter is that it discourages the client from trying to get the lawyer to do additional work on existing or new matters that the client can't afford to pay for (especially in non\\-litigation representations) because it reminds them that they already owe money to the firm.\n\nTypically, a lawyer sues when (1\\) the client is known to be collectible now, (2\\) there is not credible basis for a malpractice lawsuit and there was not a bad outcome, and (3\\) the statute of limitations is approaching or the client has a serious chance of not being collectible later.\n\n**The Business Model Context**\n\nIn a typical small and medium sized practice with a mix of litigation work done on an hourly basis and transactional work involving negotiations that are not flat fee, maybe 10% of unpaid bills are ever the subject of a collection lawsuit brought by the law firm that wasn't paid.\n\nA firm like that often ultimately writes off as much as 20%\\-30% or more of all the fees it bills to its clients on an hourly basis (with substantial variation from year to year), and typically receives maybe a third of all the fees that it is ultimately paid more than 90 days after the due date for the invoiced fees. A pattern of a client not paying for several months and then making a big lump sum payment for reasons that may or may not be related to the representation is fairly common. For reasons like this (and the timing of contingency fee payouts) solo practice and small firm lawyers with non\\-criminal practices typically have incomes that vary wildly from year to year, even though the amount of work actually done each year as measured by billable hours is quite consistent.\n\nLarge law firms are actually quite similar to this business model as well, although they charge higher rates and bill more hours on cases, and the law of averages keeps their monthly fee collections a little more consistent. Many large firms pay all of their expenses from a line of credit so that they don't have to worry about the timing of their collections to pay their monthly expenses, and then settle up with their bank at the end of the year.\n\nCertain kinds of firms (e.g. criminal defense) require all anticipated fees to be in a retainer before work is started. Other kinds of work (e.g. probate administration and flat fee transactional work and contingent fee work) usually is paid promptly and reliably when due.\n\nIn the insurance defense counsel business model, invoices are almost always paid so demand letters aren't needed, but are usually paid very slowly (90\\-180 days from invoice), the hourly rates are below average, and the insurance company routinely nitpicks bills to reduce hourly charges in any given month by 5%\\-10% or so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A small law firm is considering its approach to collecting unpaid fees from clients. Which of the following statements best describes the typical collection process and its rationale for law firms?\n\nA) Law firms immediately file lawsuits against clients who haven't paid, as demand letters are solely used to generate billable hours.\n\nB) Demand letters are rarely used, and firms typically write off all unpaid fees to maintain good client relationships.\n\nC) Demand letters are commonly used as a first step, serving multiple purposes including debt acknowledgment and address verification, with lawsuits filed only under specific circumstances.\n\nD) Large law firms always require full payment upfront, eliminating the need for any collection process.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage indicates that demand letters are commonly used by law firms as an initial step in collecting unpaid fees from clients. These letters serve multiple purposes beyond just requesting payment:\n\n1. They keep the debt fresh in the client's mind.\n2. They can trigger written responses acknowledging the debt, which can extend the statute of limitations.\n3. They help verify the client's current address.\n4. They discourage clients from requesting additional work when they haven't paid for previous services.\n\nLawsuits are typically filed only under specific circumstances, such as when the client is known to be collectible, there's no credible basis for a malpractice claim, and the statute of limitations is approaching.\n\nOption A is incorrect because demand letters are not solely for generating billable hours and firms don't immediately file lawsuits.\nOption B is incorrect because while firms do write off some unpaid fees, they don't typically write off all of them and do use demand letters.\nOption D is incorrect because it overgeneralizes the practices of large law firms, which often face similar collection issues as smaller firms."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41952/can-a-registered-user-of-a-word-mark-which-was-registered-as-whole-break-the-wo", "docs_id": 41952, "title": "Can a registered user of a word mark which was registered as whole, break the word into parts and use it in the products sold?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As the question says if a user of a particular wordmark breaks his word into 2 and uses it on goods sold(tm is engraved on goods) then can he seek protection in case of potential infringement.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The person could seek protection, but could well be unsuccessful.

As per the documentation, when a trademark owner wants to use only part of their registered mark, they should seek separate registration for that partial mark. However, the success of this registration isn't guaranteed. It depends on various factors, particularly the existence of similar marks in the market that could cause confusion. The company can indeed seek protection for \"Gadget\", but they would need to go through the registration process, and the outcome would depend on the trademark landscape in their industry. \n\nOption A is incorrect because owning \"SuperGadget\" doesn't automatically grant protection to \"Gadget\". \nOption B is too extreme; while there isn't automatic protection, the company does have legal options. \nOption D is dangerously incorrect, as using \"Gadget\" without proper registration could lead to trademark infringement issues or loss of protection."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43503/do-you-have-to-pay-capital-gains-tax-on-money-earned-before-you-incorporate", "docs_id": 43503, "title": "Do you have to pay capital gains tax on money earned before you incorporate?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This scenario is in the UK.\n\nA person X makes 1\\.2 million in sales of an asset, before the end of the tax year the invests all the sales into a newly created corporation and they become owners equity.\n\nShould the X's corporation then pay corporation tax on the amount, or is X liable to pay capital gains tax on the 1\\.2 million as soon as they make the profit?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: X owes the tax\n--------------\n\nWhen X realised the gain, the triggered the tax liability.

Note this wasn't simply a matter of Bergsala's rights being violated, but rather a scheme to reduce parallel imports/exports which the Commission found to be anti\\-competitive. For most parties, this was brought to an end in December 1997 (see section 2\\.2\\.11 on pgs. 54\\-55\\).\n\nSo no, there was no change in the law, but the anti\\-competitive scheme stopped in late 1997\\. Weirdly this should have resulted in the possibility for more imports, but since those imports would no longer have artificially higher prices, perhaps the advertisements and/or imports were no longer worth economically worth it. Or perhaps Bergsala pivoted to greater enforcement the exclusive rights it did have, even if this didn't include the ability to block parallel imports according to EU competition law. In any case, trade of Nintendo products in Europe was greatly altered in late 1997\\.\n\n*Please take my summary with a grain of salt, I'm not very well versed in the field of commerce and I've already misunderstood the decision at least once; check the cited decision for proper details.*", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In late 1997, a change occurred regarding the sale of imported Nintendo 64 games in Sweden.

The change was not due to a new Swedish law (ruling out A) or a Nintendo global policy (ruling out B). It was the result of a European Commission decision against an anti-competitive scheme between Nintendo and its distributors, including Bergsala AB in Sweden. This decision, finalized in late 1997, altered how Nintendo products were traded in Europe. While Bergsala AB did have exclusive distribution rights (partially addressed in D), the Commission's ruling was actually against practices that reduced parallel imports/exports. The apparent ban on imported Nintendo 64 game sales in Sweden was likely a consequence of this ruling, possibly due to economic factors or a shift in enforcement strategies by Bergsala AB, rather than a direct prohibition."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55222/why-is-this-contract-worded-like-a-client-is-talking-to-himself", "docs_id": 55222, "title": "Why is this contract worded like a client is talking to himself?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm looking at a sample contract for a graphic designer who is planning on doing freelance work.

Or maybe there is something requiring allegiance or respect out of each citizen for the Office of the President.\n\nIf not, I'd like to know if any such bill has ever been introduced to the House of Representatives, and whether there is any online reference where I can find out more about past issues or ongoing discussions regarding this matter.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US developed from an earlier kingdom, and the First Amendment enshrines the main issue that led to our departure from that kingdom. The underlying political premise has been that disagreement is to be dealt with rationally and not through force, such as where opinions contrary to those articulated by the government are squashed (in order to eliminate divisions).\n\nThere have been numerous laws passed in the US to outlaw \"contrary\" speech including \"disrespectful\" speech, and they are constantly being overturned by the Supreme Court. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 and U.S. v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 are two recent reaffirmations that such laws are unconstitutional. The only way such a law can work is if the Constitution is amended to in some way re\\-write the First Amendment, like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Desecration_Amendment).\n\nOutlawing indirect insults towards political figures (\"not *my* Speaker of the House\", \"not *my* FBI director\") would require an even more extensive suspension of the First Amendment. It is possible that at some time, a bill was introduced to outlaw saying disparaging things about POTUS, but I would be surprised if it got out of committee, because it would fail challenge in court.\n\nThe most\\-likely retrenchment on our freedom of expression is likely to be a flag\\-burning law, which has relatively wide support in the US. There are a number of interpretive problems associated with the key concept \"physical desecration\". Even more interpretive problems would arise if Congress were given the power (via an anti\\-disparagement amendment) to outlaw \"disparagement of public officials\". Can one simultaneously \"respect the Office of the President\" and \"disrespect the holder of the office\"?\n\nAs for specifically restricting the military, that's a challenging issue. It *is* a court\\-martial offense for a commissioned military officer to use contemptuous words against the President and Congress ([10 USC 888](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/888)), and by directive from the Department of Defense this also applies to enlisted personnel. SCOTUS in Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 articulated the Military Necessity doctrine, that \"The fundamental necessity for obedience, and the consequent necessity for imposition of discipline, may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it\". So \"not my President\" probably *is* illegal for soldiers.

In addition the name of the fictional restaurant in the game may well be protected as a trademark, and I would be astounded if \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" was not protected as a trademark. Other names and phrases may well be trademarked also.\n\nIf the suggested actual restaurant was at all closely based on the images and descriptions from the games or the novels, it would be a derivative work. Unless one had permission from the copyright owner, creating such a restaurant would be an act of wilful copyright infringement. The owner could sue, and quite likely win. In the US the owner could get up to $150,000 in statutory damages for *each work* that was infringed, which in this case might well mean several of the games and novels, depending on just what images and descriptions were imitated or used. Or the owner could elect to receive damages and profits, meaning all damage provably done to the owner, plus all profits made by the infringer. In addition to either, the owner might well obtain an injunction against further operations of the restaurant.\n\nBeyond that, if the imitation used any of the trademarked names, slogans, or other protected trademarks, there could be a suit for trademark infringement. There could be no question that the marks were being used in commerce, and were not instances of nominative use. A restaurant is a very different thing from a video game, a novel, or a film, of course. No doubt it falls into a different trademark category. Normally trademark protection extends only to the category for which the mark is protected. But in the case of a \"well\\-known\" or \"famous\" mark, protection under US law is wider. Also, when the infringement might lead reasonable people to falsely belie that the infringing product or service has been endorsed, approved, or sponsored by the trademark owner, it may be a violation even in a significantly different category. This a successful suit for trademark infringement might well be possible also.\n\nOf course, if the new restaurant only vaguely resembled the one in the games and novels, and did not use the phrase \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" or the name \"Freddy Fazbear\u2019s\" or any other distinctive names from the media franchise, That might not be copyright or trademark infringement. But that would not seem to achieve the effect suggested by the question.\n\nIf the creator of the restaurant obtained **permission** from the copyright and trademark owner(s) then there would be no legal issue. But the owners might well not grant such permission, or might charge a high fee for it.\n\nI doubt that the idea is workable.\n\nAs a side note, many years ago I regularly patronized a restaurant named [\"Bilbo's Pizza\"](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/life/2017/01/27/archives-pizza-joints-we-miss/97081968/) It was decorated with murals obviously based on descriptions for *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. The intended reference was clear. They may have gotten permission from the Tolkien estate; I understand that Tolkien was rather free about granting such permissions.

The restaurant would likely be considered a derivative work of the FNAF franchise, potentially infringing on copyrights for the games, novels, and other media. Even with a slight name change, it could still be seen as trademark infringement, especially if it leads consumers to believe the restaurant is officially associated with the franchise. The owners of FNAF could pursue legal action for both copyright and trademark infringement, potentially seeking damages and an injunction against the restaurant's operation.

However, there appears to be no actual law that supports this. For instance, the [Animals Act 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/22) makes no mention of cats at all. As far as I can tell, the law is incredibly vague on this issue.\n\nWhy, then, is there apparently widespread belief that cats have a right to roam? Is there legal precedent establishing this? If a cat owner were found liable in a county court for their cat having committed damages during their roaming, would there be any legal basis to challenge this decision?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statement that cats cannot commit trespass is technically true, but is also a misreading of ss.4 and 4A of the Animals Act. Those sections replace a common\\-law doctrine called \"cattle trespass\", which was a specific tort (a civil wrong) concerning what happens when my cattle stray onto your land. Both old and new rules apply only to livestock, so not just cows but other kinds of farm animals as well \\- but *not* to dogs or cats. Horses are a special case (s.4A). Since cats are not livestock, they cannot be the subject of cattle trespass and are not covered by section 4\\.\n\nFurther, since they are animals, they cannot commit the tort of trespass at all. Animals themselves are not liable at law. As the *keeper* of cows, it would be *me* who was liable in a case of cattle trespass, not the cow. The point of s.4, and its predecessor in common law, is to make me liable for damage done to your property by my cows, regardless of whether I was negligent in the way I looked after them (it is a \"strict liability\"). The mere fact that they've strayed onto your land and done damage is enough.\n\nBecause cats are not cows, this particular rule does not apply. That does not mean that cats can't be the subject of other torts. In particular, cats could be involved in the tort of nuisance, which covers all sorts of potential scenarios \\- noise, smells, etc. This has typically happened when there are lots and lots of cats. And under the Animals Act, the keeper of *any* animal may be liable for damage that it does, including physical injury or damage to property.\n\nSection 2 of the Act establishes a statutory distinction between whether I am *liable* for the damage, or *strictly liable*. In a scenario where I am strictly liable, you do not have to prove that I was negligent in my management of the animal. Broadly, that applies if the animal belongs to a dangerous species, or is unusually dangerous in itself. (There has been very complex litigation on this point which I am not discussing here.) If my cat is not a real vicious bastard of a cat, but just a regular cat, then I can still be liable for damage that he does: it's just not automatic.\n\nFollowing Rachael Mulheron's *Principles of Tort Law* (CUP, 2nd ed., 2016\\), for an action in negligence there are several key points \\-\n\n> Proving that D, the owner/keeper of an animal, owed C a duty of care, where C was injured by that animal, has been a straightforward task.\n> \n> \n> The court must be satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of D, the keeper of the animal, would foresee a real risk of injury to C arising from D's particular acts or omissions in dealing with the animal. Otherwise, in the absence of that foreseeability, a reasonable D would have done nothing different in response to the risk posed by his animal.\n> \n> \n> To fall below the standard of reasonable care as a keeper of an animal, D must have failed to do that which a reasonable keeper would have done (to supervise/fence/control, etc, the animal), or have done something which a reasonable keeper would not have done.\n> \n> \n> In damage\\-by\\-animals cases, C must prove that, as in the usual negligence action, D's failure to supervise/handle/care for the animals caused C's injury on the balance of probabilities.\n\nAs in other negligence cases, there are various defences; if you hassled my cat and it scratched you, then that's your fault and not mine.\n\nFrom the material quoted above, we can see that for a normal cat in the UK, where the owner is not doing anything unusual by letting it roam freely outdoors (as is typical for UK cats), it is going to be hard to meet the tests. Things may be different if D knows that C is allergic to cats, or that the cat has been eyeing up C's delicious prize goldfish, or has a bone to pick with D's own cat and is likely to attack her, or something. Most of the big cases under the Animals Act have involved animals who are more likely to cause damage, such as dogs, horses and cows; a cat is only legally different because (1\\) unlike for dogs, horses and cows, there are no special rules applying to cats, and (2\\) factually, most cats don't do much harm.\n\nTo that point, even if D is liable in the way described, C may not get very much out of them by way of damages. Defecation in C's garden is not pleasant, but is probably not worth a lot of money either.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A neighbor's cat regularly enters your garden, damages plants, and defecates in your vegetable patch.

While cats do not have an absolute \"right to roam\" protected by law, they are also not subject to strict liability under the Animals Act 1971. The concept of \"cattle trespass\" does not apply to cats, as they are not considered livestock. However, cat owners can potentially be held liable for damage caused by their cats under the tort of negligence. To succeed in such a case, you would need to prove that the owner owed a duty of care, that they failed to meet the standard of reasonable care in managing their cat, and that this failure caused the damage to your property. This could be challenging, as letting cats roam outdoors is typical behavior for UK cat owners, but it may be possible if you can demonstrate that the owner was aware of specific risks or repeated issues and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5097/what-makes-a-legal-question-hard", "docs_id": 5097, "title": "What makes a legal question &quot;hard&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When someone says another person has a brilliant legal mind, I assume that means the person is well suited for hard legal questions.

According to the documentation, it is possible for a foreign national to create an Arizona LLC without living in the United States. The key points are:\n\n1. LegalZoom's limitation to American citizens is not a legal requirement for creating an LLC in Arizona.\n2. There is a simple two-page form (Articles of Organization) that can be filled out to create an LLC.\n3. The LLC is required to have a statutory agent in Arizona, but this is independent of where the owner lives.\n4. There are no restrictions mentioned regarding the nationality or residency of the LLC owner.\n\nOption A is incorrect because LegalZoom's policy doesn't reflect state law.

Under Washington state law (RCW 9A.32.060), first-degree manslaughter applies when a person \"recklessly causes the death of another person.\" In this case, X's actions would likely be considered reckless because, despite his beliefs, a reasonable person would know that stabbing someone would likely result in death.\n\nB) Second-degree manslaughter (criminal negligence) is incorrect because X was aware of the risk, even if he believed he could overcome it. This goes beyond mere failure to be aware of a risk.\n\nC) Negligent homicide is not the correct terminology used in Washington state law for this situation. The state uses \"manslaughter\" classifications instead.\n\nD) While \"reckless homicide\" accurately describes the nature of the crime, it's not the specific legal term used in Washington state law. The state uses \"manslaughter\" classifications, with first-degree manslaughter covering reckless acts causing death.\n\nThe key point is that X's bizarre beliefs do not exempt him from the standard of a \"reasonable person\" in understanding the risks of his actions.

This answer is just a broad picture. It's a simple explanation of Microsoft's own words, as they were at the time of originally writing this (just after the final release of Windows 10\\).\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* **Microsoft does *not* recognize users' privacy rights.** The [Microsoft Privacy document](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/) does not say *anything* positive about privacy in this document that isn't contradicted by their own words elsewhere in the same document.\n* **Microsoft *does* explicitly reserve rights to share users' private data** with just about anyone and everyone.\n* **Microsoft explicitly disallows legal recourse regarding privacy.** The [Windows 10 EULA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm) comprehensively denies legal recourse related to privacy (and indeed anything other than IP disputes).\n\n---\n\nIt's Microsoft's offerings as a whole, not (just) Windows 10\n============================================================\n\nThe key document to focus on is [Microsoft's Privacy policy document](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/).\n\nThis policy applies to many Microsoft products and services, including, but definitely not limited to, Windows 10\\.\n\nMicrosoft reserve the right to share your private data\n======================================================\n\nQuoting the \"Privacy\" document, Microsoft reserves the right to share users' private data:\n\n> among Microsoft\\-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries\n> \n> \n> with vendors or agents working on our behalf\n> \n> \n> as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets\n> \n> \n> \\[to] comply with applicable law\n> \n> \n> \\[to] respond to valid legal process\n> \n> \n> \\[to] protect our customers, for example to prevent spam\n> \n> \n> \\[to] operate and maintain the security of our services\n> \n> \n> \\[to] protect the rights or property of Microsoft\n> \n> \n> as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized\n\nDo users have any privacy rights?\n=================================\n\nOne can presumably fight for one's (perceived) rights even if Microsoft attempts to deny them.\n\nHowever, from the [English Windows 10 EULA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm):\n\n> you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve \\[a dispute] informally.

That happens fairly late in the game and sometimes only after the offer has been signed, so any salary negotiation would happen before that.\n\nAnother example: if it's a Work Remotely gig: Is it the candidate's resident state or the nearest company location, where you need to show up once a month?\n\nRelated: [Will New York City's new law prohibiting questions about salary history protect residents who are applying for jobs outside the city?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18797/will-new-york-citys-new-law-prohibiting-questions-about-salary-history-protect) gives a partial answer but is less comprehensive.\n\nAlso related: [Statutory Rape: Which State's Laws Apply?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19559/statutory-rape-which-states-laws-apply).

Which court has jurisdiction? When a case is brought the first thing a court does is look at the facts and the relevant law (both the law relating to the facts and the law that empowers the court itself) and make a decision if it has jurisdiction to hear the case. In most cases, this is not an issue so the decision is tacit. A court may not have jurisdiction for all sorts of reasons: there is a money value limit, there is a geographical limit, the parties do not have standing etc. Note that multiple courts can have jurisdiction at the same time allowing the plaintiff to 'forum shop' their case: for example, it is much better to bring a defamation case almost anywhere in the world over the USA.\n2. Which law applies? A court, having decided it does have jurisdiction, needs to decide which law applies. Again, multiple laws may be applicable at the same time depending on the wording of the laws and precedent. So, New York courts can have jurisdiction to decide a case under Texas law.\n\nAny of your suggestions may or may not engage jurisdiction or legal system of none, any or all of the relevant states \\- it depends on the circumstances of the particular case and the wording of the particular statute. For example, assume NY has a law applying only to businesses and TX has a law applying only to residents \\- a NY business interviewing a TX resident would be captured by both while a TX business interviewing a NY resident would be captured by neither.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company headquartered in California is interviewing a candidate who lives in New York for a remote position.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the applicability of laws prohibiting salary history questions?\n\nA) Only California's laws apply since that's where the company is headquartered.\nB) Only New York's laws apply since that's where the candidate resides.\nC) Only Texas's laws apply since that's where the interviewer is physically located during the interview.\nD) Laws from multiple states could potentially apply, and the specific applicability would depend on the wording of each state's statutes and the particular circumstances of the case.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because, as explained in the documentation, multiple jurisdictions could potentially have relevance in such a complex scenario. The applicability of laws would depend on how each state's statutes are worded and interpreted. For example, some laws might apply based on the candidate's residence, others on the interviewer's location, and yet others on the company's headquarters or where the work would be performed. Additionally, courts in different states might have jurisdiction to hear a case related to this interview. Without knowing the exact wording of each state's laws and how courts have interpreted them, it's most accurate to say that laws from multiple states could potentially apply, and the specific applicability would need to be determined based on the particular circumstances and relevant statutes."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60191/how-is-it-legal-for-the-us-presidents-name-to-appear-on-aid-checks", "docs_id": 60191, "title": "How is it legal for the US President&#39;s name to appear on aid checks?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Apparently, (soon\\-former) US President Donald Trump's name [appeared](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/politics/stimulus-check-trump-signature.html) on the stimulus checks sent out last year.\n\nI guess this is a late question to ask, but \\- how can this be legal?

The practice of including a President's name on government checks is not forbidden by any specific law or election regulation. However, it does go against the political norm and etiquette that typically sees such checks signed by senior Treasury officials. Importantly, while this practice may be viewed as politically inappropriate, it cannot be legally challenged in court. This is because recipients of such checks have not suffered any actual injury that would give them legal standing to bring a case.

Assume that the citizen has not committed any criminal act nor is she acting suspicious or setting of any flags. Does the 4th amendment requiring searches / seizures to be reasonable no longer apply at border checkpoints?\n\nWhat are the contours of expecting privacy in this scenario?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a long\\-standing border search exception to the usual 4th Amendment no\\-search protections, but there still are limits. As you know, warrantless searches are allowed when an arrest occurs in public and is based on probable cause, and searches and seizures of limited duration and intrusiveness may be allowed given reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The [border search exception](https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep473/usrep473531/usrep473531.pdf#page=8) (US v. de Hernandez) means that limited searches are allowed at border crossing without any suspicion at all. This happens to also hold of the \"extended border\" that reaches in to the US by 100 miles, but only in connection with immigration issues. In the case of [Riley v. California](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-132_8l9c.pdf), SCOTUS held that searching digital information on a cell phone requires a warrant, with certain exceptions pertaining to officer safety or destruction of evidence. No risk is posed by data on a cell phone, so no compelling government interest is posed by requiring a warrant to search a cell phone. The *seizure* of a cell phone, in aid of obtaining a warrant or in connection to officer\\-safety issues on the other hand could be reasonable.\n\nThe question of just how intrusive a search is allowed in the border crossing context is not clearly resolved: a cursory search is reasonable, an intrusive search is not. Full\\-scale forensic searches are unreasonable. In [Alasaad v. Nielsen](https://casetext.com/case/alasaad-v-nielsen-1) (Nov 12, 2019\\), the district court in Massachussetts ruled against a warrantless search which was \"non\\-cursory\", which gives you a state of the art view of what is allowed. In this case,\n\n> an advanced search is defined as \"any search in which an officer\n>  connects external equipment, through a wired or wireless connection,\n>  to an electronic device, not merely to gain access to the device, but\n>  to review, copy and/or analyze its contents\"\n\nThe alternative, under CBP policy is\n\n> a basic search, which is merely defined as \"any border search that is\n>  not an advanced search.\"\n\nPolicy requires reasonable suspicion for an advanced search. In this case, a number of individuals (US citizens and one LPR) were subjected to an advanced search of their cell phones. In connection with these searches, data was copied and retained for an extended period of time.\n\nThe court points out that the border search exception applies to \"routine inspections and searches of individuals or conveyances seeking to cross our borders\", where \"routine search\" is defined in terms of cursoriness \u2013 the court concludes that forensic searches are by nature non\\-routine (get a warrant). This seems to kick the can down the road (what is a forensic search) \u2013 the court has some suggestions:\n\n> Basic searches, defined only as any search of an electronic device\n>  that is not an advanced search, can access content from space\n>  physically resident on a device using the devices' native operating\n>  system.\n\nSo,\n\n> Using a device's native operating system, a basic search can access\n>  content from the allocated space physically present on the device, it\n>  can extend to any allocated file or information on the devices and,\n>  for devices that contain metadata, it can reveal \"the date/time\n>  associated with the content, usage history, sender and receiver\n>  information or location data.\"\n>  Even in a basic search, agents can peruse and search the contents of\n>  the device, using the native search functions on the device,\n>  including, if available, a keyword search.

Is a person's dying will not the final say unless extenuating circumstances are proven?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A child is not property, therefore a (deceased) parent cannot transfer ownership. In case the sole custodial parent dies, the court will appoint a guardian for a minor child, and will take into consideration the wishes of the deceased parent, however their primary duty is to protect the interest of the child. It follows from this that objections to nomination of Smith as guardian are more easily sustained, since the requirements for being a guardian (e.g. [in Washington](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=11.130&full=true)) are stricter than the requirements for receiving $100,000\\. RCW 11\\.130\\.090 excludes any guardian who has been \"convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, neglect, or use of physical force or other crime relevant to the functions the individual would assume as guardian\", but such a person is not barred from inheriting property.\n\nThere are limited formal grounds for contesting a will: testator mentally incompetence, formal failure of the document, (the laws surrounding signatures and witnesses), no clear indication that the document is intended to be a will, forgery or fraud, undue influence (such as a gun to the head), or mistake (for example, mistakenly believing that their child was dead therefore leaving it all to a neighbor).

While a deceased parent's wishes regarding guardianship, as expressed in a will, are taken into consideration, they are not the final say. The court's primary duty is to protect the interests of the child. The court will consider various factors, including the parent's wishes, but will ultimately make a decision based on what they determine to be in the child's best interests.

In particular, they might decide to hear the case based on the \"Rule of Necessity\", which says roughly that a biased judge is better than none at all: a judge can hear a case, even in the presence of a conflict of interest, if there is no other way for it to be heard. See [*United States v. Will*, 449 U.S. 200 (1980\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/449/200/), in which the Supreme Court ruled 8\\-0 that federal courts could try a case related to the salaries of federal judges.\n\nAnother possibility is that the case could be brought in a lower federal court, say District Court.

However, if a lower court did have jurisdiction, it could rule on the constitutionality of the question, since a District Court judge would not have a significant conflict of interest.

As explained in the passage, the Supreme Court could still hear a case about rotating justices, even if there appears to be a conflict of interest, by invoking the \"Rule of Necessity.\" This rule allows judges to hear a case, despite potential bias, if there is no other way for it to be adjudicated. The passage cites the case of United States v. Will as a precedent where the Supreme Court ruled on a matter affecting judges' salaries.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Supreme Court is not automatically disqualified due to conflicts of interest.

Under copyright law, only the copyright holder has the exclusive right to create or authorize derivative works. Using Google Translate and then editing the result does not avoid this issue.

(USA)", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: To briefly summarize the situation, a video game was made fifteen years ago. Two development companies and one publisher were involved. All three companies have now been sold to other companies, some of them several times, and some copyrights they held were sold independently of the companies themselves. There doesn't seem to be a record of this particular game's copyright in any of these deals (the game did not sell particularly well).\n\nSpeaking with members of the original development team, it is believed the publisher had the original copyrights, but none of them are sure. The copyright does not appear on <http://cocatalog.loc.gov/> using any conceivable search. The company most likely to have picked up copyrights from the original publisher is not responding to communication attempts.\n\n**In the US, is it possible to find out who owns a copyright? If so, how is this done?**\n\n**UPDATE** The game was first published in Europe, then the [PAL region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL_region), finally being published in the US. I'm only concerned with the US copyright, but it appears the dates and locations of original release may be important to consider. At least some development occurred in England.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright law is a country\\-by\\-country matter. Most countries are signatories to the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention), which provides a common framework, but there are still variations, generally in the duration of copyright or the definition of copyrightable material.\n\nAccording to the [Hirtle chart](http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm), a *video game* that was first published *in Europe* in the year *2000* and subsequently published in the United States is still copyrighted in both the United States and whichever European countries it was published in. It is likely to be a work of corporate authorship, so the US copyright will expire on January 1, 2096 (unless a law extending the duration is passed).\n\nIn the United States, the requirement to register a copyright was eliminated in 1989 as part of the [Berne Convention Implementation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_Implementation_Act_of_1988); registration still provides benefits when filing a copyright\\-infringement lawsuit. Most European countries eliminated their registration requirements much earlier, if they had them at all: the Berne Convention dates from 1887\\.\n\nCopyright does not simply cease to exist when the owner does, or if the owner cannot be determined. The difficulty of tracking down copyright holders for old or little\\-known works is the driving force behind [orphaned works legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_works). There are no orphaned works laws in the United States, and since copyright is country\\-by\\-country, European laws won't help you if you're interested in publishing in the US.\n\nIn order to track down the copyright holder, you'll need to figure out who originally held the copyright (probably the publisher, but it could be either development company, or both, or the game might be a collective work of the individuals who worked on it). If it was a work of corporate authorship, and none of the game\\-copyright sales mention it, copyright will have been transfered when the company owning the copyright was sold (as part of a general \"and all intellectual property\" clause).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A video game was developed 15 years ago by two development companies and published by a third company.

Based on this scenario and U.S. copyright law, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The game is now in the public domain due to the dissolution of the original companies.\nB) The copyright has likely expired since it's not recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office's catalog.\nC) The copyright still exists and is likely owned by the company that acquired the original publisher, even if they are unresponsive to inquiries.\nD) The copyright now belongs to the individual developers who worked on the game.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to U.S. copyright law, copyright protection for works created after 1978 lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years, or for works of corporate authorship, 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. A 15-year-old game would still be under copyright protection. The lack of registration in the U.S. Copyright Office catalog does not affect the existence of copyright, as registration has not been required since 1989. When companies are sold, their intellectual property typically transfers to the new owner as part of the sale, unless specifically excluded. Therefore, the copyright likely belongs to the company that acquired the original publisher, even if they are not responding to inquiries. The game being an \"orphan work\" (where the copyright owner cannot be located) does not place it in the public domain in the U.S."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80046/is-each-version-of-a-software-considered-a-derivative-work", "docs_id": 80046, "title": "Is each version of a software considered a &quot;derivative work&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> Originally asked in [Software Engineering](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/438503/edit) but a user raised it is more a legal question than an engineering one.\n\nLet's suppose there is a software at version `a1` in code repository `A` on an online code hosting website.

Even though N terminated the tenancy, N continued to accept rent from T for two months *after* the termination date on the Notice to Quit.\n\nT wants to dispute both the underlying grounds for termination as well as the validity of the Notice to Quit.\n\nT's original lease from the previous owner, O contains an arbitration agreement. Can T legally force N to arbitrate both the underlying grounds for termination and the validity of the Notice via arbitration, not in court?\n\nAccording to @ [David Siegel](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/86498/36096), the arbitration agreement is binding on N just as it is on the original owner.\n\nCan the new owner, N, argue that s/he isn't bound by the arbitration agreement since T is in a month to month tenancy and s/he moved to terminate the tenancy as soon as s/he purchased the home?\n\nWhether or not N is bound by the arbitration agreement depends on two factors:\n\n1. analysis of the underlying contract \\- whether it is binding only during the first year or also during the month to month\n\nParagraph Term states that:\n\n> the term of this lease is for 1 year\n\nand that:\n\n> the parties are bound to this lease for the entire initial term, and\n> any additional term as per Section \"Renewal\"\n\nSection Renewal states that:\n\n> After expiration of the term, this lease shall continue as a month to\n> month tenancy until terminated by either party\n\nIs the month to month tenancy considered an \"additional term\"?\n\n2. whether he is bound by the terms of the lease by law once he accepts rent\n\nCan T legally force N to arbitrate the validity of the Notice to Quit \\& the underlying cause for eviction during the month to month tenancy?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The arbitration agreement is probably binding to arbitrate the validity of the notice to quit. Once the leases and ended and the original tenants are gone, those leases are probably spent, however, and at that point the arbitration agreement lapses.\n\nCourts tend to err very generously on the side of enforcing arbitration agreements which there is a plausible connection of contactual ties to the original agreement signed by both sides.\n\nThe Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) is probably the governing law, so the analysis is fairly uniform nationally.\n\nThe \"Renewal\" language states that the lease survives into the month to month period after the initial term. Consider, for example, that the terms related to the security deposit, maximum occupancy, pets, and who pays for which utilities would remain in force. If the lease still has effect so does the arbitration clause.\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court surveys the circumstances under which someone other than an actual signatory of an arbitration agreement can be bound by it in *In re N.A. Rugby Union v. U.S. Rugby Football Union*, [2019 CO 56](https://law.justia.com/cases/colorado/supreme-court/2019/19sa22.html), starting its general overview of the law at \u00b6 19 (on page 8\\), after reviewing the facts of the particular case and its procedural posture. While it is less than obvious, it is piecing together FAA cases rather than merely applying Colorado law, so its analysis has potentially broad applicability as a persuasive precedent in other jurisdictions. The core holding, at \u00b6 21 (citations omitted), is that:\n\n> \\[C]ourts have observed that ordinary principles of contract and agency\n> law may apply to bind a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement.\n> Specifically, these courts have recognized the following theories for\n> binding a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement: (1\\) incorporation\n> of an arbitration provision by reference in another agreement;\n> (2\\) assumption of the arbitration obligation by the nonsignatory; (3\\)\n> agency; (4\\) veil\\-piercing/alter ego; (5\\) estoppel; (6\\)\n> successor\\-in\\-interest; and (7\\) third\\-party beneficiary.\n\nIn this case, theories (2\\) and (6\\) are particularly relevant to reaching the same result in the month\\-to\\-month period with a new owner that it would have reached with the same landlord and same tenant who signed the original lease.\n\nThese theories are spelled out in more detail in a review article [here](https://www.clearygottlieb.com/-/media/files/nyaw-2020/practical-law-joining-nonsignatories-to-an-arbitration-in-the-us-w0113186-pdf.pdf).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario where a new owner N purchases a property with an existing tenant T who had a 1-year lease that converted to month-to-month, and the original lease contained an arbitration agreement, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding N's obligation to arbitrate disputes with T?\n\nA) N is not bound by the arbitration agreement because the initial 1-year lease term has expired.\n\nB) N is only bound by the arbitration agreement if they explicitly agreed to it when purchasing the property.\n\nC) N is likely bound by the arbitration agreement due to principles of assumption and successor-in-interest, especially if they accepted rent after purchase.\n\nD) N can unilaterally decide whether to honor the arbitration agreement since they are a new party to the tenancy.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, N is likely bound by the arbitration agreement due to legal principles that can bind non-signatories to arbitration agreements. Specifically, the theories of assumption of the arbitration obligation and successor-in-interest are applicable here. \n\nThe lease terms indicate that the agreement continues into the month-to-month period, which suggests the arbitration clause would also remain in effect. Additionally, by accepting rent after purchasing the property, N may have implicitly assumed the obligations of the existing lease, including the arbitration agreement.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the expiration of the initial 1-year term doesn't automatically invalidate all terms of the lease, especially when it converts to a month-to-month tenancy.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because explicit agreement is not always necessary; successors-in-interest can be bound by existing agreements.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because arbitration agreements are generally enforceable and not subject to unilateral decisions by new parties to ignore them."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64594/is-marital-status-from-another-country-valid-in-the-us", "docs_id": 64594, "title": "Is marital status from another country valid in the US?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If someone with F\\-2 visa status comes to the US with his/her spouse then wants to get married a US citizen, or green card holder in the US, should he/she get divorced from his/her spouse?

You cannot ask a person a question about their sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation (gender identity and employment are established law in Washington, and possibly the law at the federal level), but at least under present legal standards, a question about preferred pronouns is not necessarily in violation of that restriction. However, it is implausible that such a question would be asked in a interview for the purpose of not offending the candidate, since pronouns are sex\\-uniform for first and second person, so you would simply address the candidate as \"you\". Asking for preferred pronouns in an interview is tantamount to asking for prohibited information on sex and sexual orientation.\n\nVery many questions that can lead to bias, and are perfectly legal, for example \"Have you ever operated a fork lift?\" creates a bias against a person who gives a negative answer, when the job is operating a fork lift. There are protected categories such as sex and religion, and asking questions about those categories can lead to legal action against the company. [This](https://www.hum.wa.gov/employment) is the state's list of prohibited categories, which includes\n\n> Opposition to a discriminatory practice; Presence of any sensory,\n>  mental, or physical disability; Use of a trained dog guide or service\n>  animal; HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C Status; Race/Color; Creed; National\n>  Origin;Sex (including pregnancy); Marital Status; Age (40\\+); Sexual\n>  Orientation, including Gender Identity; Honorably discharged Veteran\n>  or Military Status; State Employee or Health Care Whistleblower Status\n\nSince you refer to the hiring entity as a \"company\", I assume the entity is a private business. A private business may mandate that an employee express a particular viewpoint in the course of employment, or prohibit them from doing so. So if the boss tells you to use or not use a particular word, that is legal.\n\nAn exception would be if there is a religious basis for your resistance to complying with the employer's rule. An employer cannot mandate that you act contrary to the principles of your religion, and they must make reasonable accommodations in case there is some conflict. Thus if your religion prohibits you from eating lettuce or working on Saturday, they cannot force you to do these things. I am not aware of any religion that actually dictates that it is forbidden to address a biological female who identifies as male as \"he\", but that doesn't matter, since the law also does not make determinations as to what are \"legitimate religious beliefs\". If a person purports that they must, according to their religion, use the pronouns \"she\" (etc.) when speaking of a biological female, then that is the end of the matter: the employer must make a reasonable accommodation. In other words, it depends on why the interviewer doesn't want to.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Washington State, a company is conducting job interviews.

Forcing an interviewer to use pronouns that conflict with their religious convictions could be considered religious discrimination.\n\nOption C is legal and appropriate. Asking about job-relevant skills and experience, even if it creates a bias against those without such experience, is permissible and common in hiring processes.\n\nOption D is illegal as sexual orientation is a protected category in Washington State, and employers cannot ask about it during the hiring process.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most legally permissible scenario in this context."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55971/what-exactly-did-harvey-weinstein-do-to-be-convicted-of-rape-in-the-third-degree", "docs_id": 55971, "title": "What exactly did Harvey Weinstein do to be convicted of rape in the third degree?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a man puts gun to a woman's head to force her to engage in sex, that's rape in first degree.\n\nSo what is rape in the third degree?\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey\\_Weinstein\\_sexual\\_abuse\\_cases\\#Sexual\\_harassment\\_or\\_assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein_sexual_abuse_cases#Sexual_harassment_or_assault)\n\nWhy exactly was Harvey Weinstein convicted of third\\-degree rape?\n\nI do not see any detail anywhere. He is convicted of third degree rape and that's it. What exactly that he did that the jury think truly happen that cause his conviction? We'd never know.\n\nFor example, some argue that all penetrative acts, or all prostitution, as non consensual, for example. In US, for example, you can't hire a girl to be both personal assistant and sugar baby. So saying that third degree rape happens if the sex is not consensual don't really add much.\n\nIt'll be pretty helpful if anyone can have a sample, like in Harvey's case, of what exactly he did that results in his conviction? Did he offer money? Fame? Promotion? Does that count as non consensual?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: He was indicted on many charges including 1st degree rape. So your question is why the jury returned the specific verdict, and did not convict on all charges. There is no record of the jury deliberations, so the best we can conjecture is that they didn't find the other charges to have been proven, and in lieu of a tell\\-tale juror, we can't know what evidence persuaded the jury. He was convicted on counts of criminal sexual assault in the first degree and rape in the third degree, but acquitted of two counts of predatory sexual assault, and it is suggested by media who make suggestions that this is because the jury did not believe the testimony of Annabella Sciorra.\n\nThe crime of third degree rape (the charge involving Jessica Mann) is when a person engages in nonconsensual sex with another person. The crime of first degree rape, a charge that he was acquitted on, is when a person\nsubjects a victim to nonconsensual intercourse through forcible compulsion, or when they are incapable of consent by reason of being physically helpless.\nA person is guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree if they engage in oral or anal sex with someone who is incapable of consent, or if they use forcible compulsion. The statutes are [here](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/#!tid=N6C75EA0684BD4F3095752D31F1DB391F), \u00a7130\\.00 ff.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the Harvey Weinstein case, he was convicted of third-degree rape but acquitted of first-degree rape charges.

First-degree rape, on the other hand, requires additional elements beyond just lack of consent. It involves either forcible compulsion or the victim being incapable of consent due to being physically helpless. This distinction explains why Weinstein could be convicted of third-degree rape while being acquitted of first-degree rape charges. The jury likely found evidence of non-consensual sex but may not have been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of forcible compulsion or physical helplessness of the victim in the first-degree rape charges."}}
