As Wikipedia explains (in the forum selection clause link above):\n\n> In *Future Industries of America v. Advanced UV Light GmbH*, 10\\-3928,\n> the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York\n> City affirmed the dismissal of a case that sent the parties to Germany\n> because the forum selection clause made German courts the exclusive\n> forum.

Later, the U.S. company believes the supplier breached the contract and wants to sue in a U.S. court. Which of the following outcomes is most likely, based on established legal principles?\n\nA) The U.S. court will hear the case, as forum selection clauses cannot oust U.S. courts of jurisdiction.\nB) The U.S. court will dismiss the case, unless the U.S. company can prove the clause is unfair or unreasonable.\nC) The U.S. court will hear the case, but apply German law as per the choice of law clause.\nD) The U.S. court will split jurisdiction, hearing contract issues but referring tort claims to German courts.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the application of legal principles regarding forum selection clauses in international contracts. The correct answer is B, based on several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. Forum selection clauses are generally honored and enforceable, as stated in the answer: \"These agreements called choice of law or forum selection clauses are routinely honored.\"\n\n2. The Restatement (Second) of the Conflict of Laws \u00a7 80 (1971) is cited, indicating that such agreements will be given effect \"unless it is unfair or unreasonable.\"\n\n3. The documentation states that if you bring a case in a U.S. court contrary to a valid forum selection clause, \"your case will be promptly dismissed, possibly with an award of attorney fees and costs against you for trying to evade a valid contractual provision.\"\n\n4. The case example of Future Industries of America v. Advanced UV Light GmbH supports this, where the U.S. court affirmed dismissal of a case in favor of German courts due to an exclusive forum selection clause.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while U.S. courts retain theoretical jurisdiction, they will typically enforce valid forum selection clauses by dismissing the case.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it confuses choice of law with choice of forum. While a separate choice of law clause might specify German law, the forum selection clause determines where the case is heard, not which law applies.\n\nOption D is incorrect as it presents a scenario not supported by the documentation and goes against the principle of enforcing exclusive forum selection clauses.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of legal concepts, integration of multiple ideas from the documentation, and consideration of a real-world scenario, thus meeting the criteria for a challenging, high-level question."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51730/one-sided-i-e-unilateral-termination-clause-in-a-contract-does-this-render-con", "docs_id": 51730, "title": "One sided i.e. unilateral termination clause in a contract; Does this render contract void / unenforceable?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am a non\\-lawyer reading a relatively simple contract draft where everything else seems fine and dandy but the termination clause just says the following:\n\n*You agree that Company (A)\u00a0retains the right to terminate this agreement at anytime.*\n\nDon't such unilateral termination clauses (sans notice) make a contract void and unenforceable?

I'll create a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation about contract termination clauses. Here's the question:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner is reviewing a service agreement with a large software company. The agreement contains the following termination clause: \"Company A retains the right to terminate this agreement at any time.\" The business owner is concerned about the implications of this clause. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal status and implications of this termination clause?\n\nA) The clause renders the entire contract void and unenforceable due to its unilateral nature.\nB) The clause is legally valid but implies that only Company A has the right to terminate the agreement.\nC) The clause is enforceable, but Company A must provide reasonable notice before termination.\nD) The clause is legally valid and enforceable, but does not provide significant additional rights beyond what's implicit in most contracts.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The termination clause described is an example of a \"termination for convenience\" clause, which is legal and common in contracts. While it may appear one-sided, it doesn't necessarily give Company A any significant advantage over the other party. The clause is enforceable, but it doesn't negate the implicit right of either party to terminate the agreement.\n\nThe clause doesn't make the contract void or unenforceable (ruling out option A). It also doesn't imply that only Company A has the right to terminate (eliminating option B), as the other party retains their implicit right to terminate as well. Option C is incorrect because the clause doesn't specify a notice requirement, although in practice, some form of communication would be necessary to effect termination.\n\nOption D is correct because the clause, while valid and enforceable, doesn't add much beyond what's already implicit in most contracts. Both parties generally have the right to terminate an agreement, with or without such a clause. The main utility of including this clause is to make the right explicit and potentially avoid misunderstandings, but it doesn't fundamentally alter the balance of rights between the parties.\n\nThis question requires analysis of contract law principles, integration of concepts like implicit rights and enforceability, and application to a real-world scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11282/how-do-organizations-with-byod-policy-handle-code-theft", "docs_id": 11282, "title": "How do organizations with BYOD policy handle code theft?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Some corporations have a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy, and some may allow their employees to take their laptops home for usage.

Software patents are unenforceable in most parts of the world anyway.\n\nWhat matters here is copyright. Every work contract has a clause that everything an employee creates as part of their employment is copyrighted by the company.

These agreements are legal documents that can address potential future divorce settlements, but they come with several important considerations:\n\n1. Enforceability: While post-nuptial agreements can be legally binding, they are subject to scrutiny by courts. Unlike prenuptial agreements, which are generally viewed more favorably, post-nuptial agreements may face more challenges in court.\n\n2. Fairness: Courts typically examine these agreements for fairness. An agreement that heavily favors one spouse (like the \"big bite out of my assets\" mentioned in the question) may be deemed unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.\n\n3. Coercion: Given that these agreements are made during marriage, there's a higher risk of one spouse being coerced into signing. Courts will look for evidence of free and voluntary consent.\n\n4. Scope: These agreements can indeed cover asset division and other financial matters in case of divorce, including scenarios where one party is deemed to have \"caused\" the divorce.\n\nOption A is incorrect because post-nuptial agreements don't have to stipulate a 50/50 split; they can propose various asset divisions.\n\nOption C is misleading.

While the property value is significantly reduced (90%), it's not rendered entirely worthless, which is a key factor in takings cases. The Court has consistently held that regulations significantly reducing property value are not necessarily takings if they serve a public purpose and leave some economic value.\n\nMugler v. Kansas provides the strongest precedent here, as it ruled that prohibition of alcohol (rendering related property worthless) was not a taking when done for public benefit. The environmental concerns in this case parallel the public health concerns in Mugler.\n\nPennsylvania Coal v. Mahon might seem applicable, but that case involved rendering the property entirely worthless, which isn't the case here. Nectow v.

Rewriting a lease only affects future obligations, and doesn't extinguish past obligations. However, you appear to have released X from all obligations via paragraph 2\\. If you plan to sue for past rent, the court will have to interpret the statement that \"The landlord, Y, and Z agree to *relinquish X from any obligation* regarding the lease as mentioned above\", which is non\\-standard English. It is extremely likely that the court will interpret this to mean \"release\".\n\nYou might argue, using earlier emails, that all parties had a clear understanding that this means \"from all future obligations, but not past obligations\", but that is not what the written agreement says, and the parol evidence rule, which is codified as [explicit law in California](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3474830.pdf), says\n\n> execution of a contract in writing... supersedes all the negotiations\n> or stipulations concerning its matter which preceded or accompanied\n> the execution of the instrument\n\nThat clause lets X off the hook, in exchange for his claim on the security deposit and for relinquishing his tenant rights to the unit.

However, this option is incorrect due to the parol evidence rule, which is codified in California law.

Meaning they can create their own laws to govern their own people. Federal government makes laws that control the interaction between states, and insures that constitution is upheld. \n\nTo enforce compliance with federal programs, congress uses the the spending clause to limit the amount of federally available funds to a given state.\n\nBesides cutting the funding, can the federal government do anything to a state, when the state creates internal rules(not conflicting with the constitution) that are contrary to federal government's ideas? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The state can decriminalize all drugs under state law, no problem. They merely have to repeal their version of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act and all related legislation. However, the federal drug statutes, contained in [21 U.S.C. 13](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/), still apply because of the principle of dual sovereignty (if a state tried to explicitly overrule them, the [Supremacy Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause) would come into play). Let's take a look at some of the statutes under Title 21, Chapter 13, of the U.S. Code.\n\nSection 801 of that chapter described Congress's findings in enacting the Controlled Substances Act. \u00a7801(3\\) through (6\\) provide the basis for federal authority to regulate intrastate affairs with respect to drug trafficking and possession. The section claims that intrastate drugs \"contribute to swelling the interstate traffic,\" and concludes that \"federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the interstate incidents of such traffic.\" Thus, the federal government will continue to enforce the federal controlled substances laws regardless of state legalization. A notable exception is the [Rohrabacher\\-Farr amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohrabacher%E2%80%93Farr_amendment), which bans DOJ from using federal funds to prosecute medical marijuana programs legal under state law.\n\nHowever, the federal government isn't always successful in (and doesn't always attempt) regulating intrastate behaviors using its [interstate commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause) authority. For example, the original Gun\\-Free School Zones Act of 1990 (since amended and complemented by a 1994 law using the condition\\-of\\-funding approach), was struck down by the Supreme Court in [*United States v. Lopez*, 514 U.S. 549 (1995\\)](https://origin-www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/United_States_v_Lopez_514_US_549_115_S_Ct_1624_131_L_Ed_2d_626_19?1538428198). The law, banning possession of handguns near schools, was found to be an overreach of the Commerce Clause authority. But it was amended by adding the additional interstate nexus of the gun having been moved interstate, which was a very minor limitation in practice. Since it only exempts individuals with a license issued by the state where the school is, it has significantly limited the ability of states to pass \"constitutional carry\" laws and allow for CCP reciprocity, because many highways and homes fall within its reach.\n\nSo, if a state is willing to lose all of its federal funding, then Congress can't ever force it to create, maintain, or enforce a state law.

The correct answer is B because the federal government can use the Commerce Clause to regulate intrastate drug activities, as outlined in the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Supremacy Clause ensures federal laws take precedence over conflicting state laws, the state's decriminalization doesn't directly conflict with federal law; it simply removes state-level penalties.\n\nOption C is a distractor based on the Gun-Free School Zones Act example, but this approach was initially struck down and required modification to include an interstate nexus. It's not directly applicable to drug enforcement without significant changes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, as demonstrated by the Lopez case, federal laws regulating purely intrastate activities without an interstate nexus can be struck down as overreach of federal authority.\n\nThe correct approach (B) is supported by the documentation, which states that \"\u00a7801(3) through (6) provide the basis for federal authority to regulate intrastate affairs with respect to drug trafficking and possession.\" This approach allows the federal government to continue enforcing federal drug laws even if a state decriminalizes drugs, based on the argument that intrastate drug activities affect interstate commerce.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring students to integrate knowledge of federal vs. state authority, the Commerce Clause, and specific legal precedents to determine the most viable strategy for federal enforcement in the face of state-level policy changes."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27782/is-a-governing-law-clause-always-enforceable", "docs_id": 27782, "title": "Is a governing law clause always enforceable?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I'm elsewhere and a contract has a clause stating that it is to be governed by the laws of the state of New York, is this always enforcable?

It avoids potential issues with specific contract requirements, such as the example given for land sales in England and Wales.\n3. It provides flexibility for the retailer, allowing them to avoid legal complications if they are out of stock or unable to fulfill the order for any reason.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a uniform system may not comply with varying legal requirements across jurisdictions. Option C, while potentially secure, may be overly burdensome for routine transactions and doesn't address the timing of contract formation. Option D is impractical for e-commerce and doesn't align with modern business practices.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and think critically about the implications of different approaches to contract formation in a global context."}, "19": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5331/brother-and-sister-both-own-house-sister-moved-out-should-brother-buy-her-half", "docs_id": 5331, "title": "Brother and Sister both own house.

B could be held to be a successor company to A and held liable, for example, on an alter ego theory.\n3. B's continued participation in the contract after the A to B transition could be held to be conclusive evidence of an assumption of the contract by B making it liable by its own agreement as a consequence of its actions continuing to participate in the contract.\n\nUltimately, however, the facts in the question are not clear enough to determine the outcome.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: Company A, an incorporated entity, transformed into Company B, an LLC, in 2014.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The transformation from Company A (Inc.) to Company B (LLC) likely represents a conversion rather than a complete dissolution. Many jurisdictions have statutes (like Colorado's \"Junction Box Statute\") that allow entities to change form without interrupting their legal existence.\n\n2. Under such statutes, the resulting entity (Company B) is typically considered the same entity as the converting entity (Company A). This means that Company B would inherit Company A's contractual obligations and rights.\n\n3. The fact that the contract was signed 18 months after the conversion doesn't necessarily invalidate it. If Company B is legally considered a continuation of Company A, it may have the authority to use and enforce contracts originating from Company A.\n\n4. The court would likely look at the substance of the transaction rather than just the form. If Company B has been operating as a continuation of Company A, including fulfilling contracts, this strengthens the argument for the contract's validity.\n\n5.

The Olio watches were rather expensive, with a price range from $595 to $1,395\\. Furthermore, to work, the Olio needs to be able to talk to a specific API server; without this API server, the companion smartphone app will not function, and without the smartphone app the watch itself will not function.\n\nOlio Devices was acquired by Flex, Ltd. in early 2017, after which they never sold anymore Olio watches; apparently Flex acquired Olio Devices just to use Olio's technology in their own products. In addition to ceasing the sale of Olio watches, Flex also shut down the API server I mentioned above later in 2017, resulting in most Olio watches losing almost all of their functionality. Neither the former employees of Olio Devices nor Flex gave any solution to this; customers were expected to live with their $595\\-$1395 paperweights.\n\nUnder United States consumer protection law (Olio Devices was founded and headquartered in California and Flex has offices throughout the US), can Flex be sued for this, either for payouts or for a solution to make the Olio watch work again? If so, is there a time frame in which such lawsuits would need to be filed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are multiple thorny legal questions and factual questions that would need to be resolved to get an answer. An effective remedy for the consumers against Olio Devices would be challenging, but not impossible to prevail in, and an effective remedy against Flex would be considerably harder to prevail in.\n\nThe first thing you would need to know is how the sale of Olio Devices to Flex was structured. If Flex truly merged as a corporate entity with Olio Devices, or if Olio Devices purchased the Flex entity and then changed its name to Flex, there would be liability from the consumer to Flex is a cause of action could be established.\n\nBut, if Flex merely purchased selected assets from Olio Devices for cash, any liability would run from the consumer to Olio Devices, and would be limited to the cash received by Olio Devices in the deal.\n\nIf that cash was insufficient to pay liabilities owed by Olio Devices to its consumers, in order to prevail against Flex, the consumers would have to establish that the sale to Flex of its assets was a \"fraudulent transfer\" which doesn't necessarily require proof that there was an actual intent to defraud, but does require a showing that (1\\) the total liabilities of Olio Devices (including contingent future liabilities) exceeded the value of its assets at the time of the sale, (2\\) that Olio Devices did not receive \"substantially equivalent value\" for the assets it sold to Flex, (3\\) that the sale was not ratified by a bankruptcy court if Olio Devices was in bankruptcy, and (4\\) that the sale of assets from Olio Devices to Flex took place more than four years before the lawsuit seeking to set aside the fraudulent transfer. Alternately, the statute of limitations could be longer, the threshold of proof could be lower, and punitive damages up to 50% of the recovery otherwise available, if there was an actual intent to defraud the consumers of Olio Devices in the sale of assets transaction that could be established.\n\nIt is also possible that Olio Devices was kept intact as an entity, whose shareholders were now a parent company, and the parent company didn't take any assets out of the subsidiary, which would make it hard to sue the parent company.\n\nOf course, all of this hinges on whether there is an underlying case against Olio Devices.\n\nAssuming that the watches were sold in 2015 and 2016 without an intent to defraud at that time, one would have to determine what the nature of the contractual arrangement for post\\-sale service by Olio Devices was with respect to those watches. This would not be an elementary matter and would take review of relevant documents (e.g. warranties and license agreements) and consideration of case law in other circumstances that might be relevant regarding implied contractual terms. The outcome of that would be a close question. If the contract didn't have such a term, or expressly disavowed such liability, then the next question would be whether the absence of such term would render the contract unconscionable causing a term like that to be implied in law.\n\nAssuming that the consumers established that there was an implied contractual term that the watches would be supported by Olio Devices indefinitely, the next question would be when the statute of limitations started to accrue. Generally speaking, this happens when there is a breach of the contract and that breach is known to the consumer, which would probably happen in late 2017\\. The [statute of limitations in California](https://statelaws.findlaw.com/california-law/california-civil-statute-of-limitations-laws.html) for a breach of a written contract is four years, and for an oral contract is two years, but I don't know what the relevant statute of limitations would be in the case of a contractual term implied in law or in fact.\n\nThere might be a consumer protection law specific provision, intertwined with the implied contractual term, but my guess is that this is unlikely.\n\nAll of the relevant questions would arise primarily under state law. The law that would apply would again be fact specific. Normally a contract to enter into a sale of goods is governed by the state where the sale takes place and runs between the seller and the buyer, who would often not be the underlying manufacturer, so the warranty or license or service contract from the underlying manufacturer might be the controlling document and would usually have a choice of law provision which would probably choose California law as the governing law.\n\nIt is also conceivable that this issue could be framed as a product liability issue with the product being defective because it relied upon a service that could be discontinued. This liability would run directly from the consumer to Olio Devices. The statute of limitations in California for a products liability lawsuit involving personal property is generally three years.\n\nRealistically, the only economic way to bring any economic lawsuit would be via a class action lawsuit, but if any contract or license running from Olio Devices directly to the consumer contained an arbitration clause (which it is quite likely that it would) then a class action lawsuit would probably be barred and an arbitration proceeding would have to be commenced instead.\n\nSo, there are facts not present in the question that are necessary to provide an accurate answer, but the clock is definitely ticking and many theories of relief are likely to be barred some time in 2020 or 2021 depending upon the theory, and some causes of action may already be time barred.\n\nOf course, if this happened in 2017, it is very likely that someone already did bring a lawsuit, which may have been settled, resolved in arbitration proceedings, or resolved in a class action proceedings that was concluded or is still pending. If there was a class settlement of such a lawsuit, it may still be possible to apply to receive a payment under that settlement. It would be surprising for someone to wait until now to sue, if there were many thousands of units sold that were rendered useless and there was a viable litigation option. Somebody would almost surely have investigated the matter before then and there are multiple law firms in California that specialize in these kinds of lawsuits and usually figure out opportunities for lawsuits first and recruit clients second.\n\nOther Factual Background\n========================\n\nFactual background [here](https://www.soft32.com/blog/platforms/another-one-bites-dust-long-olio/) and [here](https://www.soft32.com/blog/platforms/update-another-one-bites-dust-long-olio/).\n\nData on the sale of the company/assets [here](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/97958-44).\n\nThe most valuable asset of Olio Devices was probably [its patent license revenues from Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/2016/01/25/microsoft-and-olio-devices-announce-patent-licensing-agreement/).\n\nIt appears that the purchase price was [$14 million.](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/olio-devices#section-overview)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tech startup, TechWear Inc., launches a smartwatch in 2023 that relies on a proprietary cloud service for full functionality.

Why else would the case still exist 14 years later? Same with forging a car registration or anything similar?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statute of limitations is quite relevant.\n\nA couple points to help explain why:\n\n* First, there are a lot of different legal actions that could arise from someone stealing property. You could have criminal charges for theft, you could have a civil claim for conversion (to pay the value of the stolen property), you could have a civil claim for replevin (to return the stolen goods), and you could have a civil action to determine the true owner of the property.\n\nAll those cases arise under different laws, and all of them could have different SOLs. The fact that time has run out for one doesn't necessarily mean that time has run out for all of them.\n* Second, improperly obtaining title *does not* mean that you are not and never will be the true title holder. Take a look at the doctrine of \"adverse possession,\" which basically allows you to become the true owner of real or personal property by simply acting like the owner for a long enough period of time \\-\\- ranging from 5 to 21 years, depending on the jurisdiction.\n* Third, SOL is a restriction on when you can *start* a lawsuit. Sometimes, as Dale M said, it starts when you actually learn about the transfer, but it could also start when you *would have* learned about the transfer if you had exercised reasonable diligence. So the fact that a lawsuit is happening now regarding something that happened a long time ago doesn't necessarily mean the SOL was inoperative; it may just mean that the SOL didn't start until long after the transfer, or it majy just mean the litigation is dragging out.\n* Fourth, the Facebook example is not a good one. [That lawsuit](http://i.zdnet.com/blogs/cegliavszuck.pdf) is primarily focused not on the transfer of property, but on breaches of contract, for which [the relevant statute of limitations is six years](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/civil-practice-law-and-rules/cvp-sect-213.html).

This directly aligns with Florida Statute 776.012(2), which states that a person is justified in using deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary \"to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony.\"\n\nThe scenario describes a carjacking in progress, which is explicitly listed as a forcible felony under Florida Statute 776.08. The struggle you witness indicates an imminent threat, satisfying the immediacy requirement.\n\nOption A, while potentially relevant to one's ability to respond effectively, is not a legal requirement for using deadly force in defense of others. Option B is irrelevant to the legal justification for using force.

What are the legal obligations of a government employer, when it comes to handling allegations against a prospective employee?\n\nI would like to use a different example. Instead of a Supreme Court nomination, suppose that a person is applying to a teaching position in a public school, and someone claims that she had inappropriate contact with a minor. \n\nWhat kind of due process is the school required to abide by in approving or rejecting the candidate? Is a mere allegation enough to warrant refusal to hire, or is there legal precedent against that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, there is legal precedent against this that would only apply to a government employee. First, let's discuss the private sector.\n\nIn this case, you are a private employee that comes to your place of work and accuses you of \"stealing the cookies from the cookie jar\" which is a serious criminal offense. They wish to talk and your boss is in the room. You plead the 5th, but your boss says you're fired if you don't talk to the cops. This is legal because you still have the right to refuse to talk, you just lose your job. A private employer has the right to free association, and wants nothing to do with cookie thieves, alleged or actual.\n\nHowever, in the government employ, your boss is an agent of the government. This same situation is different because the government pays the boss and the agent... so in essence the government is saying talk or be fired. This is unconstitutional as the government cannot retalitate against you for your refusal to talk.\n\nGenerally, in order to talk to you, the investigator would need either a signed Garrity Statement or a Signed Kalkines Statement. The former is a statement saying that they are investigating a wrong doing but you cannot lose your job if you refuse to speak to the investigators, where as Kalkines says you must talk but you are granted immunity for your part in the wrong doing, so long as you make truthful statements.\n\nFor more on this, check this [legal blog](https://www.spigglelaw.com/employment-blog/surviving-workplace-investigations/).\n\nThere is also the matter that a false accusation (and let me be clear... this is academic, I'm not saying the accusation in the real life topic is false, nor am I saying that the defense is false... we're merely discussing a possibility) is made to your employer and they do not offer the job on the basis of the accusation alone, this is grounds for defamation actions... and in certain jurisdictions, it's criminal defamation, so there could be jail time.\n\nIt's interesting you mentioned teachers, because this happens alot. Kids do know that there are certain things that get a teacher fired quickly, so teachers do get the occasional false accusation of sexual assault (I know one teacher who has had multiple accusations over the course of her career). One of the few good things I can say about the Teachers Union is they cover the legal defense of accused teachers.

The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. It respects due process rights, which are crucial for government employers (including public schools).\n2. It acknowledges the need for a thorough investigation rather than acting on mere allegations, which could lead to defamation issues if the accusation is false.\n3.

Briney case to a modern, tech-oriented scenario. The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. The key difference lies in the nature of the deterrent. Unlike the flashbang in New Orleans or the shotgun in Katko v. Briney, the smoke and sound system is designed to be non-injurious. This shows a lower intent to cause harm, which courts would likely view more favorably.\n\n2. The principle established in Katko v. Briney suggests that using deadly force (like explosives or firearms) against property crimes is disproportionate. The tech entrepreneur's system, while disorienting, is not inherently capable of causing direct physical harm.\n\n3. However, some liability might still exist because the system could indirectly lead to injury (as in the hypothetical crash), which is why complete absence of liability (option D) is incorrect.\n\n4. Options B and C are incorrect because they overstate the likely liability. The court would likely view this less harshly than the explosive device due to its non-lethal nature and intent to disorient rather than injure.\n\n5.

Bankruptcy appeal panel decisions are binding on U.S. District Courts and U.S. Bankruptcy Courts in the appellate circuit, but are inferior to U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decisions.\n\nState supreme court decisions are binding on all state courts. Intermediate state court of appeals decisions are binding on the state trial courts whose decisions may ultimately be appealed to intermediate state courts of appeal (all of them if there is one intermediate state court of appeal, but only some of them if there are multiple intermediate appellate court districts in that state) and all courts to which appeals are taken to state courts if appeals from those state courts in non\\-appellate cases may be appealed to intermediate state courts of appeal.\n\nA U.S. District Court, in one of the rare cases in which there is a direct appeal of right to the U.S. Supreme Court (e.g. election law cases) is still bound by the binding precedents of its circuit on any issue decided in the case upon which the circuit has binding precedents.\n\nSimilarly, for example, in Colorado courts of limited jurisdiction called county courts have their decisions appealed to courts of general jurisdiction called district courts, but further appellate review of a county court decision is made to the Colorado Supreme Court rather than to the Colorado Court of Appeals, an intermediate appellate court. But, despite that, Colorado Court of Appeals precedents are still binding in county courts in Colorado, because the District Courts to which it appeals are themselves required to treat Colorado Court of Appeals decisions as binding precedents.\n\nBut, federal court decisions on matters of state law (usually in diversity jurisdiction cases) are only persuasive precedents on these state law matters. Thus, if the (federal) U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado in a diversity case has to rule on a question of state law, a Colorado Supreme Court decision is more authoritative than a U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit decision on the same subject, even though either would be a binding precedent on the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado.\n\nConversely, a decision of a state's intermediate court of appeals is not binding upon federal courts on matters of state law, although they are highly persuasive. *See, e.g., Clark v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co.*, 319 F.3d 1234, 1240\\-1241 (10th Cir. 2003\\). A federal court may ignore an otherwise binding precedent of an intermediate state appellate court if the federal court concludes that the decision of that court was decided contrary to the likely holding of the state's highest court. *See, e.g., DigitalGlobe, Inc. v. Paladino*, 269 F. Supp. 3d 1112, 1122 (D. Colo. 2017\\). If a federal court is unsure how an issue of state law would be resolved in a state court, such as in a state law case of first impression upon which the state has no binding precedents, it can certify that legal issue to the state's highest court for a definitive resolution of the state law issue presented.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions are binding on all courts in the United States as to matters of federal law including interpretations of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDecisions of a court that does not have appellate authority over the court making the decision, unpublished decisions of a court, decisions of a court on issues not necessary for it to decide in the case before it which are called *dicta*, and authorities other than case decisions, statutes, and regulations, are merely persuasive authority. Some courts don't allow citations to unpublished decisions at all.\n\nThere are a few federal forums where this is particularly tricky. The National Labor Relations Board, the U.S. Tax Court, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (none of which are Article III federal courts), each serve as unified trial courts with a national territorial scope in their subject matter areas. But appeals from their decisions are to whichever of the twelve U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the case arises (D.C. and Circuits 1\\-11\\). In those forums, the question of which circuit's decisions are binding and which are merely persuasive authority for the NLRB, Tax Court or BIA depends upon where the particular case before it arose.\n\n> And to what extent are Federal Court decisions binding on state\n> officials and courts?\n\n*Precedents and Federalism*\n\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions on questions of federal law including federal constitutional law and treaties, are binding on all courts. Federal court decisions on matters of state law are not binding on anyone but the parties to the lawsuit.\n\nFederal court decisions on question of state law are not binding precedents on state courts.\n\nThe corollary of these rules, which is subtle, is that a decision of a U.S. District Court in a state, or of a U.S. Court of Appeals in a Circuit that includes a state, on a question of federal law, is not a binding precedent on state courts in that state or circuit on that question of federal law.\n\nFor example, suppose that the Colorado Supreme Court determines, without resorting to a separate state constitutional right, that the 4th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution's exclusionary rule for unlawful searches and seizures require physical evidence obtained in reliance on a lie from a law enforcement officers to be excluded from evidence at trial as an unlawful search, but the 10th Circuit in which Colorado is located reaches the opposite conclusion, and the U.S. Supreme Court has not ever made a ruling definitively resolving that issue. In that situation, the meaning of the 4th Amendment in state court criminal trials would be different from the meaning of the 4th Amendment in federal court criminal trials in the same state, even though this is a question of federal law.\n\nThis isn't to say that a binding 10th Circuit precedent on a question of federal law wouldn't be extremely persuasive authority to a state court on that issue of federal law in the State of Colorado (which is located in the 10th Circuit). But it still wouldn't be a truly binding precedent.\n\n*The Effect of Court Rulings On Parties To Federal Cases And Federalism*\n\nFederal court decisions on questions of federal or state law are binding on the state officials affiliated with the governmental official or entity that is a party to the federal court case.\n\nFor example, a decision of the federal U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado in a case to which a Denver policeman is a party (with respect to something done by him in his official capacity as opposed to his private life), is binding upon all officials in the City and County of Denver, and on the City and County of Denver as an entity, even if only the policeman is a party to the lawsuit in federal court. But that ruling wouldn't be binding on the State of Colorado or the City of Aurora, which are different governmental entities.\n\nDetermining whether a particular government official from an agency, or a particular agency, is part of a state government, or of a particular local government, or is an independent governmental entity in its own right (e.g. in the case of the C.U. Regents of the University of Colorado), is not always a self\\-evident question and often would require fact specific legal analysis to determine.\n\nIf someone is ordered to do irreconcilable things by both a federal court in an order binding that person, and a state court in an order binding that person, the federal court order prevails over the state court order.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A state supreme court and a federal circuit court of appeals have issued conflicting rulings on the interpretation of a specific provision in the Fourth Amendment.

The correct answer is B because the documentation explicitly states that if a business does not sell personal information, it is not required to provide a \"Do Not Sell My Info\" link. The official FAQ clearly indicates that \"If a business does not sell personal information, and if the business affirmatively states that it does not sell personal information in its privacy notice, it is not required to provide a notice of [the] right to opt-out or post the 'Do Not Sell' link.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests implementing unnecessary features that could confuse users and potentially imply that data selling occurs. Option C is a common misconception that businesses should always include the link for transparency, but this goes beyond the legal requirements and could be misleading.

And I usually get one of two answers:\n\n1. We're too busy to do something like that on contingency right now.\n2. We don't think the odds of prevailing and collecting merit the cost of pursuing that on contingency.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but I follow the industry well enough to know that there are a lot of lawyers lacking for work. If you're an unemployed lawyer, or a solo practitioner without a full caseload, then isn't *any* non\\-frivolous case with a positive potential payout worth pursuing? And if you're a firm with the sunk cost of offices, staff, subscriptions, etc., wouldn't you always want those assets working at 100% capacity?\n\nTherefore, why doesn't every practice *want* a queue of potentially profitable contingency cases that they can chip away at when they don't have a 100% paid workload? I can understand that if one took a contingency case into litigation, and then paid work came along, one wouldn't want the contingency case distracting from the paid work. But can't one accept a case on contingency *and* \"as time permits,\" so that in such an event one would simply drop the contingency case (or, if it looked promising, hand it off to some other lawyer in a slump)?\n\nAre there practical or professional reasons this is not standard practice?\n\nFrom an economic perspective this seems odd: As a client if I don't have the means to pursue a legitimate claim, then (on principle) I might be willing to give up to 100% of any winnings to a lawyer who does pursue it. As a lawyer, if I have a positive expected return to a contingency case, I'd like to have the option of picking that up when I can't find other work (to within some error term \u2013 perhaps the alternative of running a coffee shop out of my office, or taking a minimum\\-wage writing job.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two basic problems with your theory:\n\n1. You say:\n\n> can't one accept a case on contingency and \"as time permits,\" so that in such an event one would simply drop the contingency case (or, if it looked promising, hand it off to some other lawyer in a slump)?\n\nNo. you can't. If you take a case, then drop it because a more profitable case comes along, you might well be disbarred, not to mention sued by the client you just threw over. You might even spend a night in jail for contempt\\-\\-in many cases, you are not allowed to simply drop a case without the court's permission.\n\nSo if you accept a contingency case, you accept it until (1\\) the case is over, (2\\) the client fires you, (3\\) you, the client, and the judge all agree you can quit, or (4\\) you can convince the judge you should be allowed to quit regardless of the client's wishes. Until then, you are stuck with the time and expense involved with handling the case.\n\n2. \"Expense\" is the second problem. You seem to be under the impression that once you've paid for the office and the coffee maker, there's no downside in pursuing a contingency case.\n\nBut filing and pursuing a lawsuit cost money, not just time. Copying and coding documents costs money. Stenographers for depositions cost money. Just filing a lawsuit often costs a few hundred dollars. Hell, in a major lawsuit, you will probably spend a few hundred dollars just on postage. And a lot of commercial litigation now involves expert witnesses, whose fees start at a few hundred dollars an hour. Normally that all gets billed back to the client, but on a contingency case the lawyer often absorbs most or all of it.\n\nSo from a lawyer's perspective, even if he or she is not working right now, \"any positive payout\" isn't enough. It has to be enough of a payout, and enough of a chance of winning, that the expected reward is worth paying, potentially, the cost of a trial, and forgoing other work if things get busy again while you're trying to prep your contingency case for trial.\n\nThe fact is, for a lot of this sort of case\\-\\-even if it looks \"potentially profitable\" to a non\\-lawyer\\-\\-is going to be less profitable, in the long run, than spending the same amount of time playing golf with people who might actually pay you by the hour to do something.\n\nAlso, two quick notes:\n\n1. Your suggestion of raising the contingency up to 100%, or close to it, won't help\\-\\-it's illegal in many jurisdictions, and unethical in all of them.\n2. As a side note, even if a lawyer did take one of these cases, it wouldn't do you any good, since lawyers are prohibited in most cases from splitting their fees with non\\-lawyers.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A solo practitioner is approached by a potential client who has a seemingly valid civil claim but lacks the financial means to pursue litigation. The lawyer is currently experiencing a lull in paid work. Which of the following strategies would be most ethically and professionally appropriate for the lawyer to consider?\n\nA) Accept the case on a full contingency basis, with the agreement to drop it if higher-paying work comes along\nB) Propose a sliding scale contingency fee that approaches 100% of any potential winnings\nC) Accept the case on contingency, but clearly communicate that work will progress as time permits between paid cases\nD) Decline the case, but refer the client to a legal aid organization or pro bono service\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple ethical and practical considerations in legal practice. While option A might seem tempting to an underemployed lawyer, it's highly unethical and potentially grounds for disbarment to simply drop a case when more profitable work appears. Lawyers have a professional obligation to see cases through once accepted, barring specific circumstances like client consent or court permission.\n\nOption B is incorrect because contingency fees approaching 100% are typically considered unethical or illegal in most jurisdictions. This would exploit the client's lack of resources.\n\nOption C, while seemingly a compromise, is problematic. It doesn't address the financial costs associated with litigation (filing fees, expert witnesses, etc.) that the lawyer would have to front. Additionally, it could lead to substandard representation if the lawyer consistently prioritizes paid work.\n\nThe correct answer, D, is the most ethically sound approach. By referring the client to legal aid or pro bono services, the lawyer acknowledges the potential merit of the case while recognizing their own limitations in handling it effectively. This ensures the client might still get representation without compromising professional ethics or taking on unsustainable financial risk.\n\nThis question tests the application of legal ethics, understanding of the practical constraints of contingency cases, and the ability to balance professional responsibilities with business realities in legal practice."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64625/licence-for-windows-api", "docs_id": 64625, "title": "Licence for Windows API", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is a licence required for calling operating system functions provided by Windows or calling its kernel?

California), and the \"totality of the circumstances\" test. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Fourth Amendment requires probable cause supported by oath for issuing warrants. An anonymous tip alone does not satisfy this requirement.\n\n2. However, Navarette v. California (2014) clarified that anonymous tips can contribute to establishing reasonable suspicion or probable cause under certain circumstances.\n\n3. The \"totality of the circumstances\" test is used to evaluate the reasonableness of a seizure or search based on an anonymous tip. This requires considering all available information, not just the tip itself.\n\n4. While the tip in this scenario is detailed, which may indicate some reliability, it still lacks the \"indicia of reliability\" mentioned in Navarette v.

This balances the need to investigate potential criminal activity with the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches.\n\nOption A is incorrect because issuing a warrant solely based on an anonymous tip, even if detailed, could violate Fourth Amendment protections. Option B is too extreme, as recent case law allows for consideration of anonymous tips.

It's a very broad law and covers everything from a flagpole or barbeque to airports and railways and has a hierarchy of controls from State Environmental Plans (SEP) down to Local Environmental Plans (LEP) and finally the Building Code of Australia (BCA) and Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA). Electricity and gas installations are covered by different laws.\n\nHowever, for housing, there is a SEP that allows them to be constructed without Development Consent providing they comply with all relevant LEPs and the BCA \\& PCA. These so\\-called Complying Developments (CD) must be notified to the council but do not need the Council's approval. If you want to break the rules, you can't use this process and must go for a full Development Approval (DA). For completeness, there are also Exepnt Developments and State Significant Developments but neither are relevant here.\n\nOnce you have your DA or CD, you need to engage a Principal Certifying Authority (PCA) \\- a private certifier who ensures that the work is in compliance with the DA/CD and the BCA. They will issue a Construction Certificate (CC) which details the work that needs to be done. When its all finished to their satisfaction, they will issue an Occupation Certificate (OC) and the building can now be used.\n\nYou state that you have a DA (or maybe a CD) for a house and shed but only the shed was built and then fitted out as a house. Prima facie, this isn't compliant because it isn't what was approved. I am willing to bet that there is no OC and possibly no CC. This happens a lot.\n\nWhen you brought the property, your conveyancer should have checked that all building work was compliant. Maybe they did and told you about it but you didn't understand and went ahead anyway; maybe they didn't and just stuffed up.\n\nNow, if the building complies with the LEP and the BCA, all that may be necessary is to lodge a CD, hire a PCA to inspect the property and issue an OC and all the paperwork will be in order and everyone's happy.\n\nIf there are non\\-compliances, the council can, and probably will issue you a notice to fix them within a specified time frame. Providing you do that, you can then get the retroactive approvals and all will be good.\n\nHowever, if it's something that can't be readily fixed \\- like the building is too near the boundary, for example, that's when things get interesting.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A couple has been living in a converted shed on a property for 12 years, which was originally approved by the local council as a 1A standard shed for the previous owner. The council has recently become aware of this situation and is sending inspectors. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications and potential outcomes of this scenario?\n\nA) The council cannot take action due to the 12-year occupancy, as this establishes adverse possession rights for the current residents.\n\nB) The council can immediately evict the residents, as living in a shed violates basic zoning laws regardless of its fitted-out status.\n\nC) The council will likely issue a notice to rectify non-compliances, allowing the residents to retroactively obtain proper approvals if the structure meets building codes.\n\nD) The previous owner's development application for both a shed and house legally permits the current use of the shed as a residence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the situation and application of the provided legal information. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that the amount of time lived in the property doesn't make a difference legally.\n\n2.

I recently received an email stating that they would no longer be providing any assistance.\n\nThe terms of the promise were:\n\n> \"Start a paid apprenticeship: You'll start working right after you graduate from the bootcamp, in a paid apprenticeship with one of our hiring partners...which includes companies like Amazon, iFixit and PG\\&E!\"\n\nDo I have a reasonable claim for lost wages based on the promise of employment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Yes.** \n\nTechnically, it would probably not be a claim for lost wages (which are usually awarded when someone injures you in a way that leaves you unable to work) but rather a claim for breach of contract.

Option C is the strongest factor in strengthening the student's case for damages because:\n\n1. It demonstrates reliance on the promise: By turning down other job offers, the student shows they made decisions based on the school's promise, which strengthens the argument for promissory estoppel.\n\n2. It helps quantify damages: The declined job offers provide a concrete basis for calculating potential lost wages, which is crucial in determining the amount of damages.\n\n3. It shows the student's commitment and good faith: This action indicates the student was serious about the program and had alternative opportunities, countering potential arguments that the student might not have found employment anyway.\n\n4.

At this point the merits of the case do not matter \\- all the plaintiff is doing is making an allegation that the defendant has caused them harm. For this the evidence need only demonstrate that the defendant has a case to answer.\n\nIf the defendant intends to defend the case then the plaintiff will set out their version of the facts and the law and provide evidence to support that version. The defendant will set out their version of the facts and the law and provide evidence that supports their version. Both parties will also attempt to demonstrate that their opponent's case is a crock of s\\*%t: that the evidence is inadmissible, that the admitted evidence doesn't support the facts alleged, that the law isn't as the other party says etc.\n\nThere are specific judicial procedures in each jurisdiction that dictate how this all happens.\n\nIf it is clear on the face of it that the plaintiff's case *is* a crock of s\\*%t the defendant will file a motion to dismiss and, if the court agrees, that's the end of it.\n\nIf the trial proceeds to completion then the trier of fact (jury or judge as applicable) will decide what weight to give the evidence presented and decide on the [Preponderance of the Evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)#Preponderance_of_the_evidence) (Balance of Probabilities) if the plaintiff has proved their case. If so, the plaintiff will get (some of) what they asked for.\n\nMoving to specifics ...\n-----------------------\n\nFirst, while copyright violation is a crime and *can* be *prosecuted* by the state, that would be extremely unlikely on the facts stated. Criminal copyright violation involves copying and distribution on a commercial scale.\n\nWhat we are talking about is the plaintiff *suing* (not prosecuting) for violation.\n\nFrom the facts stated, they have standing and the defendant has a *[prima facie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie)* case to answer \\- that's enough to start legal proceedings.\n\nIn such proceedings the defendant is free to attack the admissibility or veracity of the plaintiff's evidence. If it is inadmissible the case will likely collapse. If it is admitted then the trier of fact will decide if it is \"good\" evidence and if the overall weight of evidence meets the burden of proof.\n\nFar A) \\- the defendant would prevail if they could demonstrate that they only ever used the free version within their terms of the licence.\n\nFor B) \\- destroying evidence needed for an active case is a serious crime. Along with the summons it is likely that the defendant would be served with a subpoena to deliver up the relevant evidence to the court. As there is no criminal investigation/prosecution police/search warrants are irrelevant.\n\nA lawyer is an officer of the court and is *not allowed* to start a legal action that they do not believe has a reasonable prospect of success \\- they can expose themselves to professional sanctions if they do.

The correct approach balances legal rights, evidence gathering, and practical considerations:\n\n1. The \"phone home\" data provides a basis for the software company to have standing and make an allegation, but it's not necessarily sufficient on its own to win a lawsuit. As the documentation states, \"At this point the merits of the case do not matter - all the plaintiff is doing is making an allegation that the defendant has caused them harm.\"\n\n2. Immediately filing a lawsuit (option A) would be premature and potentially risky. The company should first attempt to resolve the issue without court intervention, as implied by the documentation's discussion of settlement offers.\n\n3. Criminal prosecution (option C) is inappropriate for this scenario. The documentation clearly states that \"Criminal copyright violation involves copying and distribution on a commercial scale,\" which doesn't apply to a single small business user.\n\n4. Hacking (option D) would be illegal and could expose the software company to legal liability.\n\n5. Sending a cease and desist letter with a settlement offer (option B) is the most appropriate initial step. It allows the company to assert its rights, present its evidence, and offer a resolution without immediate legal action. This approach aligns with the documentation's description of how copyright holders often proceed: \"The copyright holder has little to no chance of winning, but proposes a settlement of a few hundred or few thousand $, and threatens a lengthy legal process for maybe millions if not complied.\"\n\nThis approach also gives the small business an opportunity to respond, potentially leading to a resolution without the need for costly legal proceedings.

This makes me wonder what exactly keeps common law alive. I imagine many judges follow precedent because they have a personal respect for tradition or the merits of the common law system. But I also imagine many judges would want to ignore precedent to enact their own opinions.\n\nSo what prevents such judges from doing so? Are there local or state laws that require them to follow precedent? Can ignoring precedent get them fired? Or do they just fear backlash from the public or their peers if they break tradition?\n\nOr is the premise of my question flawed and judges break precedent all the time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Decisions that break with precedent do happen with some regularity, but far \"from all the time\" in the US. When they do happen, they are generally only at the top level of a state or federal court system, that is a State supreme Court (or equivalent, some states use a different term) or the US Supreme Court.\n\nThere are several factors which discourage judges from simply ignoring precedent.\n\nFirst of all, all the training a lawyer receives teaches him or her to respect precedent, and to find rules by examining past cases. precedent is literally the stuff with which a lawyer works, rather more than the wording of statutes (although those are also important).\n\nSecondly, as a lawyer works as a litigator, judges will usually ground their decisions on precedents, particularly in appellate cases, explaining their decisions largely in terms of how they conform to or extend precedents.\n\nThirdly, if a lower court judge fails to follow precedent, that judge will often be criticized by an appellate judge or justice, often in the course of an opinion overturning the lower\\-court judge's ruling. This does not feel pleasant to such a judge.\n\nFourthly, decision that fail to follow precedent are often (although not always) criticized by legal scholars, particularly in law review articles and treatises.\n\nFifthly, lower\\-court judges who often fail to follow precedents, are less likely to be recommended by senior judges for promotion to appellate positions. However, the actual appointments are controlled by politicians (in most cases) not other judges, so this factor may not be as strong it it would first seem.\n\nOnly once a judge gets to the level of the Supreme Court of a state, or the Federal Supreme Court, is that judge (now a Justice) expected to alter precedents as needed, and most justices have said that they make such changes only reluctantly.\n\nI am not aware of any US state or federal statute or regulation that specifically;y requires judges to follow precedent.\n\nThe most common way to alter precedent is not to overrule or ignore it, but to **distinguish** a prior case. This happens when a judge says something like:\n\n> In the previous case of *A v B* when had situation X which lead to outcome Q. But in this current case we have the very different situation X1\\. In the case of X1, the outcome should be S instead of Q.\n\nIf the new case becomes persuasive the old case *A v B* may apply to only one specific set of facts that almost never comes up, and the new rule apply to almost all other possible situations. The old case may cease to be cited or applied without ever being formally overruled.\n\nAnd, of course, where the rule is statutory, it may be changed if the legislature alters the law. If the rule is constitutional, it may be changed by a constitutional amendment. For example the 1830s case *Barron v Baltimore* held that the US bill of rights did not apply to the states, only to the Federal Government. But after the 1868 14th amendment, courts started to **incorporate** much of the bill of rights into the Due process clause of the 14th, and apply it against the states. This took place gradually, mostly during the period starting with 1898, up until about 1970, but with some incorporation coming as late as 2010 (*Heller*)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the common law system in the United States, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A newly appointed federal district court judge is presiding over a case involving a novel issue of contract law. The judge believes the existing precedent is outdated and wishes to rule differently. Which of the following approaches is most aligned with the principles of the U.S. legal system and the role of precedent?\n\nA) The judge should ignore the existing precedent and rule based solely on their interpretation of the contract, as there are no federal statutes mandating adherence to common law.\n\nB) The judge should follow the existing precedent exactly, as deviating from it would likely result in immediate dismissal from their position.\n\nC) The judge should carefully distinguish the current case from the precedent, explaining how the specific facts warrant a different outcome without directly overruling the previous decision.\n\nD) The judge should openly criticize the existing precedent in their ruling and establish a new contradictory precedent, as this is the primary way lower courts contribute to legal evolution.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of how precedent operates in the U.S. legal system, particularly for lower court judges. The correct answer, C, reflects the most appropriate approach described in the documentation. Lower court judges are not expected to directly overrule precedent, but they can \"distinguish\" cases by explaining how the current situation differs from previous cases, warranting a different outcome. This approach respects the tradition of precedent while allowing for legal evolution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there may not be explicit statutes requiring adherence to common law, the entire legal training and culture strongly emphasizes respect for precedent. Completely ignoring it would be highly unusual and likely subject to criticism and reversal on appeal.\n\nOption B is overly strict. While judges are discouraged from ignoring precedent, it's not typically grounds for immediate dismissal, especially given that judges often have significant job security.\n\nOption D is incorrect because lower court judges are generally not expected to openly criticize and contradict established precedents. This role is typically reserved for higher courts, particularly supreme courts at the state or federal level.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the role of precedent, how judges typically approach it, and the methods by which legal evolution occurs in a common law system.

Was that up to the lawmakers to decide, or is that just something that evolved out of the ways the courts and prosecutors responded to sexual harassment claims? And who decides such things in general?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is there something in the language of the act that makes sexual\n>  harassment a civil rather than a criminal offence?\n\nYes. \n\nLaws that create criminal offenses have to have language to the effect of \"violation of this law is punishable by up to X years of imprisonment or a fine of up to $Y\", or \"violation of this law is a Class Z felony.\"\n\nSometimes it is not entirely clear if violation of a law can form a basis of a private civil lawsuit, or if it can only be enforced by government officials, from the language of the statute alone. When it is unclear the courts have to resolve that ambiguity.\n\nIn rare instances, it may be clear that some parts of a statute have criminal penalties, but due to unclear wording and punctuation in the statute, it is hard to tell precisely which parts of the statute these criminal penalties apply to, and in those cases, courts also have to resolve that ambiguity.\n\nThere is also some conduct that it is constitutional to punish with a civil penalty, but not as a crime that can result in incarceration. For example, it is unconstitutional in most states to incarcerate someone for failing to pay a debt, but there can be a civil penalty for failing to pay a debt. Courts decide if these constitutional limitations are violated.\n\nSimilarly, while Congress can enact both crimes and civil penalties, there are some governmental bodies, like school districts or water boards, that have the power to enact certain civil penalties, but do not have the authority to create new crimes.\n\n> Was that up to the lawmakers to decide, or is that just something that\n>  evolved out of the ways the courts and prosecutors responded to sexual\n>  harassment claims? And who decides such things in general?\n\nGenerally, this is decided by lawmakers. Obviously, however, anyone can lobby legislators to take one position or another.\n\nAlso, the fact that something has a civil penalty does not necessarily mean that prosecutors aren't the people who enforce the law. Sometimes violations of the law prosecuted by prosecutors have civil rather than criminal penalties. For example, many tax law violations are prosecuted by government lawyers with civil penalties, but only a small minority of tax law violations are prosecuted criminally.\n\nFurther, it isn't uncommon for a type of offense, like securities fraud, to have both civil penalties and criminal charges available as remedies that can be enforced by prosecutors. And, when that happens, prosecutors get to decide which tool to use.\n\nFor example, even if exactly the same conduct could be prosecuted with either a civil penalty or a criminal charge, prosecutors might prefer a civil penalty because the burden of proof is much lower, the 5th Amendment protection against self\\-incrimination does not apply (you can refuse to testify but that fact can be used against you in a civil penalty case), and a defendant in a civil penalty case doesn't have a right to a lawyer at government expense. Also, enforcing a civil penalty generates net revenue for the government most of the time, while criminal punishments normally cost the government more money to carry out than any revenue the government may receive from the person found guilty for fines and court costs.\n\nOn the other hand, trying to enforce a significant enough civil penalty to discourage misconduct against someone who has no money or property may be a futile effort, while criminal sanctions could discourage misconduct from other similarly situated people in the future.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A tech company is facing multiple sexual harassment complaints from employees.

To the best of my knowledge, the modern concept of statutory rape was unknown in the Roman world. The lack of hard age based cutoffs was, in part, because vital statistics record keeping was nowhere near universal, so many people did not even know their exact age in a legally provable manner.

What are the points of view on this currently dominant among US judges, prosecutors and attorneys?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Like most common law jurisdictions there are 3 sources of US law: legislative, judicial and administrative (except Louisiana, it has a Civil Law system).\n\nI *think* you are focusing on legislative or statute law but I will briefly cover the others first.\n\nJudicial Law\n------------\n\nJudicial or judge made law occurs when a court makes a judgement on a case about what the law means. In a common law jurisdiction such decisions are [binding](http://definitions.uslegal.com/b/binding-precedent/) on lower courts in the same jurisdictional hierarchy and [persuasive](http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/persuasive-precedent/) on the same level and higher courts and foreign courts. In the US foreign courts normally means courts in other US states that lack a binding precedent on the matter but courts can look to decisions in other common law countries like Canada, Australia, the UK etc.\n\nBecause courts interpret the \"common law\" their judgments usually reflect (in some way) community expectations. However, judicial systems are, by their nature, slow to change and while they track community expectations they do so with a time lag, say 20\\-30 years: the lag in time between when the judges making decisions now had their views on society fixed during their college years.\n\nJudicial law, in theory, stretches back to Anglo\\-Norman law with decisions building on (and occasionally knocking over) what has come before. In practice, this chain has usually been severed at some point (usually more than once) by the intervention of the legislature to correct what they saw as a \"failure\" in the common law. Subsequent common law builds on that statute like barnacles on a ship's hull (but without the negative connotation ... maybe).\n\nBy your terminology, such laws are almost always descriptive.\n\nAdministrative Law\n------------------\n\nIs the law created by the administrative arm of government using the powers explicitly granted by the relevant constitution, delegated by the legislature or derived from common law powers. For example, if a statute authorizes the levying of taxes on the value of real estate, it is usually left to the administrative branch to determine how to collect and use the data needed to arrive at a given property's value.\n\nBy your terminology, such laws can go either way. Establishing the land tax system example would be prescriptive, modifying it to match changing social circumstances would be descriptive.\n\nLegislative Law\n---------------\n\nLegislative or statute law is the laws passed by the legislature by whatever name that is known. They can only make laws within the bounds permitted by their constitutions but within those limits they are free to do whatever they choose.\n\nMany of the laws they pass are simply to enable the other parts of government to get on with their jobs \\- like giving them the money to pay the army or the judges or whatever. I guess these would be descriptive \\- of course, passing a law to say you can't pay the army would be very, very prescriptive.\n\nAside from that, while legislatures *can* pass a law about anything they generally only intervene when there is some \"mischief\" in society that the current laws are not addressing or are addressing in an unjust way. This happens all the time because society does not stand still: we didn't need laws about cell phone use in cars until there were cell phones being implicated in accidents.

While it's not mandatory for all incorporations, it can provide significant tax benefits, which is likely why the law student recommended it.\n\nThe key considerations are:\n\n1. Tax deferral: By using a section 85 rollover, the founder can transfer assets (in this case, cash) to the corporation without triggering immediate tax consequences. This allows for the deferral of capital gains tax that might otherwise be payable on the transfer.\n\n2.

What is the public interest when it comes to political masters?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"public interest\" from a charging perspective is *not* the same as public popularity. From the [charging guide](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/charging-directors-guidance-sixth-edition-december-2020), prosecutors:\n\n> should consider each of the questions set out in paragraphs 4\\.14 (a) to (g) of the Code to determine the relevant public interest factors for and against prosecution. These factors, together with any public interest factors set out in any further relevant guidance or policy issued by the DPP, should enable prosecutors and police decision makers to form an overall assessment of the public interest.\n\nThose public\\-interest factors are listed [here](https://www.cps.gov.uk/publication/code-crown-prosecutors) (and each is further elaborated):\n\n* How serious is the offence committed?\n* What is the level of culpability of the suspect?\n* What are the circumstances of and the harm caused to the victim?\n* What was the suspect\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the offence?\n* What is the impact on the community?\n* Is prosecution a proportionate response?\n* Do sources of information require protecting?", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A controversial political figure is arrested for allegedly breaching the Public Order Act during a heated protest against the monarchy. The case has garnered significant media attention, with strong opinions on both sides. As a prosecutor, which of the following considerations would be LEAST relevant in determining whether prosecution is in the public interest?\n\nA) The potential impact of the case on community relations and social cohesion\nB) The level of harm caused to any victims and the overall seriousness of the offense\nC) The prosecutor's personal views on the monarchy and the political ideology of the accused\nD) The proportionality of prosecution as a response to the alleged offense\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the concept of \"public interest\" in prosecution decisions, integrating multiple aspects from the documentation. The correct answer is C because a prosecutor's personal political views should not influence the decision to prosecute.\n\nThe documentation clearly states that the \"public interest\" is not the same as public popularity or political preference. Instead, it outlines specific factors that prosecutors should consider, none of which involve the prosecutor's personal political views.\n\nOption A is relevant because it relates to the \"impact on the community,\" which is one of the listed public interest factors. Option B combines two of the listed factors: the seriousness of the offense and the harm caused to victims. Option D directly corresponds to the factor \"Is prosecution a proportionate response?\"\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the candidate to distinguish between proper considerations of public interest and improper personal biases. It also presents a real-world scenario that highlights the potential for political influence in prosecution decisions, challenging the candidate to apply the guidelines in a contentious situation.\n\nThe distractors (A, B, and D) are carefully crafted to represent legitimate considerations in the prosecution decision-making process, making the question more challenging and requiring a thorough understanding of the concept of public interest in this context."}, "67": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/88265/creative-commons-license-on-sheet-music-of-classical-pieces-and-performing-in-pu", "docs_id": 88265, "title": "Creative commons license on sheet music of classical pieces and performing in public", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that there is a piece of classical music (let's say written by Bach in 1726\\) and there is a recent arrangement (sheet music) of that piece which was made available through Creative Commons Attribution\\-Share Alike 4\\.0 license.

The correct answer is D because it completely fails to give attribution to the arranger, which is a core requirement of the license.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it's not ideal to omit attribution in one context, at least some attribution is given.

However, the license states that attribution must be given \"in any reasonable manner,\" so omitting the link might not necessarily violate the terms if the attribution is otherwise clear and complete.\n\nOption D is the most egregious violation because it completely fails to acknowledge the modern arranger, focusing only on the original composer whose work is already in the public domain.

The correct answer is B because the documentation states that the easiest way to handle this situation is to wait for the unemployment agency's determination of eligibility. The key factor is whether the 1099 income was earned before or after the date of unemployment eligibility. If the income was earned before the eligibility date, it does not need to be reported. However, if it was earned after, it must be reported. Since the eligibility date is not known until the agency makes its determination, waiting for this decision is the most appropriate course of action. This answer demonstrates the need to integrate multiple concepts (severance, 1099 work, unemployment eligibility) and apply them to a real-world scenario, testing critical thinking rather than mere memorization.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the reporting requirement, not accounting for the timing of the income relative to unemployment eligibility.

Option B is a common misconception but ignores the company's rights and the illegality of violating terms of service. Option D is incorrect because the documentation suggests that proving knowledge of terms of service would establish mens rea, but lack of knowledge doesn't necessarily provide immunity.\n\nThis question tests the application of legal principles to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts such as contract law, unjust enrichment, and third-party liability.

According to the documentation, Form AT-108 allows for the transfer of the license to the personal representative (executor) upon the death of the licensee, at no charge during the license year. Once the license is transferred, the entire stock can be liquidated to any other license-holding establishment, as stated in Tax 8.81(2): \"A licensed retailer may sell his or her entire sealed liquor stock in a liquidating transaction to any other licensed retailer.\"\n\nThis approach combines legal compliance with efficiency:\n1.

Now that the burglars are in his house, what should he have done?\n\nI still do not understand the verdict. I mean, do you lose your right to defend yourself if you make it look like your house is uninhabited? Are you obligated to signal to would\\-be burglars that you will shoot them?\n\nIn the case of Bryan Smith case, has the prosecutor established that the removal of his truck is done solely for baiting burglars?\n\nOne controversy in the case is that after he shot a burglar, he finish the job.\n\nI do not know how much of this got into a jury. However, I would have done the same if I were him. Soldiers in wars double tap because enemies they think are death (not just injured in legs), may actually still be alive and kill. There are cases of people stop beating up robbers thinking he won, only to have the robbers' friend stab him in the back.\n\nFor all Bryan Smith knows, those teenagers could be assassins sent by gangs to kill him. The boy and the girl may bring life grenade they can activate for suicide bombing. It may not be. But how does he knows?\n\nThe probability is small. May be 1%, or 2%. Still, why should a home owner risk his life for life of two worthless burglars? The safest thing to do is to just kill the burglars.\n\nWhy take unnecessary risks when your life is in danger by some people that's obviously up to no good?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If I remember the case correctly, he didn't make his home look uninhabited (that is nobody is living there) but as if the inhabitants had left (gone shopping etc.) to make it look attractive to burglars. \n\nHe then waited inside, armed with a gun, with the intent of shooting any burglars that might arrive. He shot the first burglar in the legs, and then proceeded to kill the unarmed and now defenseless burglar, who was lying injured on the ground and was in no position anymore to hurt him. He then did the same with a second burglar, shooting her in the legs, then shooting her multiple times, and when he found she was still alive, he shot her point blank in the face while she was lying on the ground. \n\nYou are asking the wrong questions. You are asking \"is it illegal to remove a truck\". It's not. What is illegal is to intentionally create a situation where you shoot people and try to claim \"self defence\". It can very well be argued that by luring burglars into your home with the intent to kill them, they are not actually illegal in that home, because you *wanted* them to be there. You can do many things that are each completely innocent but add up to a crime. \n\nActually, for everyone interested, I posted a question maybe last week or the week before whether you can be convicted for both first degree murder and second degree murder for killing a person, and it was exactly this case that inspired the question. \n\nWhat should he have done? If he hadn't lured the burglars in, I believe the case would have still been a double murder, since he killed both unarmed teenagers when they were absolutely no threat. It might not have been first degree murder since it would not have been premeditated. But he intentionally lured them in, making it premeditated (first degree) murder. \n\nIf he had only injured them, the fact that he lured them in could very likely have made this an assault. \n\nYou asked: \"Now that the burglars are in his house, what should he have done? \" Well, he got himself into a dangerous situation. Remember, he was convicted for premeditated murder. So just before he shot the girl in the head, he should have instead put the gun away and called police and an ambulance. It would have been one murder instead of two. Just before he shot the boy, he should have put the gun away and called police and an ambulance. It would have been just attempted murder. When he heard the first person entering, he should have called the police and waited. When the burglar came in sight, he should not have shot and injured him. \n\nIt's a similar question to \"if I try a bank robbery and there is an armed guard, what should I do\". The only legal thing to do is to drop your weapon and wait to be arrested. \n\nIf an armed burglar had appeared instead of two unarmed teens, well, he would have put himself into a dangerous situation. Just as the burglar would have no right to shoot even if a home owner points a weapon at him, he had no right to shoot, no right to self defense, since he had intentionally created the situation. Tough shit. That's what you may get if you plan a murder. \n\nResponding to some comments: @J.Chang Are you being serious? You are not allowed to make your house inviting to burglars, while waiting inside with the intent of killing them. Self defense only applies when a reasonable person would believe they are in danger. Reasonable persons don't think that a burglar comes in with the intent of blowing themselves up and taking the home owner with them. And no, you don't get to \"assume the worst\". Not when the worst is something no *reasonable* person would expect. \n\nThanks to Dale for pointing out that even for soldiers in a war situation, where different rules apply, deliberately killing a helpless enemy combatant is murder.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the Bryan Smith case, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: In the Bryan Smith case, where he shot two burglars in his home, which of the following factors most significantly contributed to his conviction for premeditated murder, rather than a successful self-defense claim?\n\nA) The removal of trucks from his property to make it appear unoccupied\nB) The fact that he shot the burglars multiple times, including after they were incapacitated\nC) His failure to call the police immediately after the shootings\nD) The burglars being unarmed teenagers rather than professional criminals\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While all the factors mentioned played a role in the case, the most significant factor contributing to Bryan Smith's conviction for premeditated murder was his actions after initially shooting the burglars (option B). The key issues were:\n\n1. Intent and premeditation: By setting up a situation to lure burglars and lying in wait with a firearm, Smith showed premeditation.\n\n2. Disproportionate force: The critical factor was that Smith shot the burglars multiple times, including after they were already incapacitated and no longer posed a threat. This goes beyond self-defense and into the realm of intentional killing.\n\n3. Continuation of threat: Once the burglars were injured and incapacitated, they no longer presented an immediate threat to Smith's life, negating the self-defense argument for the subsequent shots.\n\n4. Legal limits of self-defense: Self-defense laws typically only justify the use of force necessary to neutralize an immediate threat. Continuing to shoot after the threat is neutralized exceeds these limits.\n\nOption A, while relevant to showing premeditation, didn't directly contribute to the murder charge as much as the actual shootings. Option C, while problematic, is less significant than the act of killing itself. Option D, while it may have influenced the jury, is not as legally significant as the manner of the killings.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts (self-defense, premeditation, proportional force) and application to a real-world scenario, testing critical thinking about the limits of self-defense and the factors that distinguish it from murder."}, "78": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16557/if-collateral-secured-in-a-promissory-note-no-longer-belongs-to-the-borrower-wh", "docs_id": 16557, "title": "If collateral secured in a promissory note no longer belongs to the borrower, what happens on default?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I ask because a somewhat usurious former coworker (the lender) has a notarized agreement with a family member (the borrower) for a significant debt, where the house is used as collateral.

For example, Title 17 is Copyrights, Title 35 is Patents, Title 18 is Crimes and Criminal Procedure.\n\nWithin each chapter, the main unit of organization is the Section (\u00a7). For example, 35 USC \u00a7101 is the section that outlines subject\\-matter\\-eligibility for patents.\n\nBetween the Title level and Section level, the U.S. Code uses chapters, subchapters, parts, and subparts, not necessarily in that order, and not consistently from title to title.

In either case, it seems you would have to return the computer.\n\nIn the first case, you received the computer only on the understanding that you would return it when you were done with the work. Because you are retaining it while your colleague owns it, your colleague could puruse a replevin action to force you to return the computer, or a conversaion action to force you to pay the value of replacing it.

If the freelancer becomes unable to complete the agreed-upon tasks, what is the most likely legal outcome regarding the ownership of the computer?\n\nA) The freelancer can keep the computer but must reimburse the entity $3600\nB) The freelancer must return the computer but can claim compensation for their $600 investment\nC) The freelancer has full ownership rights to the computer as it was purchased through their personal accounts\nD) The entity can pursue legal action to reclaim the computer, regardless of the freelancer's additional investment\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the legal principles surrounding property rights and contract fulfillment. The correct answer is D because, regardless of how the transaction was structured, the entity that provided the majority of the funds for the computer has a strong legal claim to it. \n\nIf the computer was provided as a loan for task completion (scenario A in the documentation), the entity could pursue a replevin action to force its return.

Quoted translations provided by Google Translate.*\n\nTurns out the question \"Do I need an *Impressum*?\" is complicated. I'll start with examining the case for companies, then work down to the average private citizen.\n\nImpressum requirement\n=====================\n\nThe requirement for an online *Impressum* comes from the [Telemediengesetz (TMG) \u00a7\u00a05](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__5.html):\n\n> 1\\) Service providers are obliged to keep the following information readily available, readily accessible and constantly available for commercial, usually paid telemedia:\n> \n> \n> 1. the name and address under which they are established \\[...]\n\nApplicability based on country of origin\n========================================\n\nThe applicability of the TMG is described in \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0[2a](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__2a.html), [3](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__3.html). Thankfully, there is a [2013 court case](http://www.stroemer.de/index.php/entscheidungen/wettbewerbsrecht/1455-olg-hamm-urt-v-17-12-13-i-4-u-100-13-kreuzfahrtangebote) focused on these sections, involving an Egyptian company marketing cruises and not having a proper *Impressum* on their website. Also thankful is that law firm [mth Tieben \\& Partner summarized](http://www.mth-partner.de/wettbewerbsrecht-anwalt/internetrecht-zur-frage-ob-auslaendische-diensteanbieter-ein-webseitenimpressum-nach-deutschen-vorschriften-vorweisen-muessen/) this decision, because as it turns out, I cannot read judicial German.\n\nSummarizing their summary, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02a, 3 sets the standard that the required information is based on a country of origin principle (*Herkunftslandprinzip*), where if that country of origin is Germany, \u00a7 5 applies. However, this principle is rooted in EU directives, and as such is not applicable to non\\-EU countries. For these, the law falls back on the older principle of market location (*Marktortprinzip*). If the non\\-EU company advertises in Germany and thus participates in the German market, then it must have a valid *Impressum*.\n\nI'll note that, the TMG considers Germany to be the \"country of origin\" if the company is either registered in or has significant operations in Germany (see the given sections for specifics). This is not the same \"country of origin\" as is found in copyright law.\n\nApplicability to private website hosts\n======================================\n\nAs it turns out, an *Impressum* is not required for private non\\-commercial websites. However, as pointed out by this [Anwalt article](https://www.anwalt.de/rechtstipps/impressumspflicht-auch-fuer-private-webseiten-und-blogs_105215.html), the wording of the TMG makes it such that omitting an *Impressum* may often be illegal. In particular, [the definitions section](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__2.html) of the TMG provides very broad definitions of \"Service provider\" (*Diensteanbieter*): \n\n> Service provider shall mean any natural or legal person who provides his own or third\\-party telemedia for use or provides access to use; in the case of audiovisual media services on demand, service providers shall mean any natural or legal person who effectively controls the selection and design of the content offered,\n\nand \"commercial communication\" (*kommerzielle Kommunikation*):\n\n> Commercial communication means any form of communication which serves the direct or indirect promotion of the sale of goods, services or the appearance of an undertaking, other organization or a natural person engaged in trade, trades or crafts or a liberal professions; \\[...]\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nIn terms of variables like the one you suggest, the proper \"variable\" for companies is the country of origin. For private web hosts, I would argue that residency is the closest analogue to country of origin as defined in TMG \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02a, 3\\.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The blogger's German citizenship is not a determining factor for Impressumspflicht. The documentation states that residency is more relevant for private web hosts.\n\n2. The location of the server (in Germany) is explicitly mentioned as not being a determining factor.\n\n3. The key consideration is whether the blog is considered a commercial activity. The documentation mentions that the Telemediengesetz (TMG) \u00a7 5 requires an Impressum for \"commercial, usually paid telemedia.\"\n\n4. The blog generates income through affiliate links, which likely qualifies it as a commercial activity under the broad definition of \"commercial communication\" provided in the TMG.\n\n5.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation states that there is generally no right to limit someone's existing trees merely because they cast shadows on newly installed solar panels. This eliminates option A, as a nuisance lawsuit is unlikely to succeed given that the trees predated the solar installation.\n\n2. While California does have laws regarding nuisances that block views, these typically protect existing structures rather than new installations like solar panels, further weakening the case for option A.\n\n3.

Therefore, the basic requirements for extradition are not satisfied, and Jamie will not be extradited. (In addition, under Article V, a US citizen can be extradited from the US only at the discretion of the executive branch if \u201cit considers that it is proper to do so\u201d.)\n\nIt is not clear whether the act is a federal crime in Australia. It is a crime to film sexual acts without consent in some states of Australia, e.g. [\u00a7 91K of the Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s91k.html), NSW.

The US-Australian extradition treaty doesn't specifically cover this type of offense. Extradition typically requires the act to be a felony in both countries, which it isn't in the US (where one-party consent for recording is often sufficient).\n\n3.

He did so both on the federally managed grounds and on the ME easement.\n\nMy questions regard the legal limitations and boundaries *of a LEO's* jurisdiction and how *criminal conduct* color the rules for jurisdiction. When the LEO violently assaulted the citizen *on the easement* is he out of his jurisdiction? Suppose for the sake of argument, the LEO has jurisdiction limited to the property with the easement in question. Under the general question of where or not jurisdiction ends in an easement a few specific questions come to mind:\n\n1. If a LEO acts entirely on the easement, due to events that happened entirely on the easement, does that have *any* impact on the legal authority of the LEO?\n2. Is there any immediate or long term legal consequence for an officer committing crimes or doing so egregiously (with or without qualified immunity) *while out of his jurisdiction* as opposed to doing so in his jurisdiction?\n\n* For instance, could a civilian defend himself against violent assaults from an officer while *out of the LEO's jurisdiction* that he could not legally defend himself from while the LEO were fully in his jurisdiction?\n* Are other officers bound by law to arrest or stop other officers committing crimes outside of the jurisdiction when they are normally allowed discretion to allow fellow officers to flout the law?\n* Does an officer loose the qualified immunity defense or other legal defense when doing illegal things out of his jurisdiction?\n\nAre there any important nuances to jurisdiction and law enforcement by LEOs that a first amendment auditor should be aware of?\n\n\\*\\*\\* VIDEO CONTEXT\nThe video show a first amendment auditor and legal activist taking video of a federal facility, U.S. customs and border patrol. Before he can enter the facility or say a word to anyone he is threatened by his soon\\-to\\-be asailaint, a federal LEO. I know this is illegal for the LEO to do, and so does the first amendment auditor. This is a matter of clearly established law. At this point it is likely only a civil matter because the officer has given prior restraint to limit the auditor's *clearly established* legal rights.\n\nThe auditor says \"Don't touch me!\", then the belligerent LEO repeatedly shoves, slaps, and threatens with frightening words. While the assaults/batteries happen the auditor is trying to explain the law and give notice of the DHS memo that verifies the auditor's right to record and then he threatens legal action with phrases like 'You're going to get fired/loose qualified immunity/etc for this!'\n\nI'm taking it for granted that the cop knowingly broke the law even before the easement. Certainly, he *should* have known. It seems like a civil matter at this point, *before the easement*, because cops are given special privileges while on duty that allow them to commit certain crimes without obstruction from civilians. \\*I'm not merely saying cops are legally allowed to do things that civilians cannot legally do. \\* I'm also suggesting that cops effectively can break the laws even they are under, as there are often laws against resisting an *unlawful* arrest even if this is a privilege to temporarily break the law it is nonetheless permission to break the law in often egregious ways at least while acting under the color of law. As other officers witnessing the crimes of fellow LEOs often have discretion, this is effectively a license to commit crime at least for a while. I'm not debating the merits of this, but merely stating what I believe to be relevant facts leading up the question of whether or not civilians can ever restrain criminally acting violent LEOs in any lawful way in the context of easement law.\n\nThe LEO went beyond what is his *normal* lawful jurisdiction for protecting against criminals not just by committing crimes himself, but by going into the easement of the property and into the public street. He pushed the auditor into the public street or highway \\- I can't tell which. He then threw the auditors equipment into the street. The auditor claimed this easement was not his lawful jurisdiction. So now I'm interested to know if any LEO is ever restricted in jurisdiction by an easement *in any way* and if federal LEOs like this one, who are normally restricted to enforcing laws on a property, are restricted *in any way* by easement laws. As a concrete example related to the video content, could this LEO observe a person peacefully walking along the easement and then shove him into traffic while having the full protection of laws that prohibit obstruction of *unlawful* officer action or could the auditor or civilian observers *legally* have defended the auditor in this simplified example by responding in kind by for instance restraining the belligerent LEO? For the sake of understanding the law, let's consider just the example of an auditor that was on the easement of the property the LEO has jurisdiction on but not ever beyond that.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\n\n* I'm *not* asking about the violent assault *while within his jurisdiction* except to contrast to the assault within his jurisdiction.\n* I'm *not* asking what is *prudent* for either an average citizen or a seasoned first amendment auditor and legal activist to do in this situation. These are rather questions of de jure law.\n* I'm *not* asking about the jurisdiction for a citizen to effect a legal citizens arrest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> When the LEO violently assaulted the citizen on the easement is he out of his jurisdiction?\n\nNo. Federal law enforcement officers' jurisdiction generally\\* includes the entire US. Federal and state jurisdiction are said to be [concurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_jurisdiction) with one another. If the federal law enforcement officer has a lawful basis to effect an arrest, the arrest can be effected on a state\u2020 highway easement.\n\n> Is there any immediate or long term consequence for an officer committing crimes or doing so egregiously (with or without qualified immunity) out of his jurisdiction as opposed to doing so in his jurisdiction?\n\nIf the officer were outside his jurisdiction (which isn't the case here) then the officer is generally treated as any other private individual. In this case, \"outside his jurisdiction\" means \"in another country,\" which brings up all sorts of additional complications that aren't really in scope here, largely because the laws and legal systems of other countries are different from those in the US.\n\n> Are there any nuances to jurisdiction and law enforcement by LEOs that a first amendment auditor should be aware of?\n\nThere are plenty, but perhaps the most prominent one, if the internet is any guide, is that an officer is not required to articulate the basis for reasonable suspicion or probable cause at the time of a Terry stop or an arrest. The time for this is much later, after a judge is involved. Arguing with an officer on this score is just going to make things worse. Instead, one should *cooperate* while stating one's objections clearly and calmly, especially making it clear that cooperation does not imply consent.\n\n---\n\n\\* Some categories of officers do have more limited jurisdiction: thanks to cpast for the example of park rangers, whose jurisdiction is essentially restricted to national parks. The officers in this case are CBP field officers. There is a wide misconception that CBP officers' jurisdiction is limited to within 100 miles of the border, but that 100\\-mile limit only applies to their power to board and search vessels and vehicles without a warrant in order to prevent illegal entry into the US. Their power to make warrantless arrests \"for any offence against the United States\" committed in their presence is not geographically restricted.\n\n\u2020 The [original video](https://youtu.be/JqTBFfcTEBs) was filmed in South Portland, Maine, and the roadway is a municipal street, [Gannett Drive](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y5Kb46im7T1i17Fi8), to be precise.

There's no indication that qualified immunity or other legal protections automatically cease when an officer moves onto an easement or public street.\n4. The question about other officers being required to intervene is a misconception, as the documentation suggests officers often have discretion in such situations.\n5.

This means that the tenant of a rental unit finds someone else to rent their unit from them for a period of time. Therefore, in a sublet the original tenant becomes a master tenant and the new tenant becomes a subtenant. ...\n> \n> \n> Subletting your unit is very risky. In a way, it is the worst of both worlds, because you have both the obligations of a landlord and of a tenant.\n> ...\n> \n> \n> In a sublet the landlord still has obligations to you, and the landlord can also claim against you as well as the person you have sublet to. If there is a dispute between a subtenant and master tenant it has to be re\\- solved through Residential Tenancies. Similarly, if you are a subtenant, you can file a Residential Tenancies claim against either the landlord or the master tenant.\n\nAlso, note that Section 2(d) of the Residential Tenancies Act specifically applies to situations where only part of a unit is rented (bolding mine):\n\n> \u201cresidential premises\u201d includes any house, dwelling, apartment, flat, tenement, manufactured home, land\\-lease community, manufactured home space or other place that is occupied or may be occupied by an individual as a residence **or that part of any such place that is or may be occupied by an individual as a residence**...\n\n(I have omitted the list of exceptions which follow, but they do not seem to apply to a \"rented room\" situation.)\n\nTaken together, it appears that a full landlord\\-tenant relationship would exist in the situation you describe.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal situation under the Nova Scotia Residential Tenancies Act?\n\nA) Bob has no tenancy rights as he's not on the original lease and must resolve disputes directly with Alice without legal protections.\nB) Alice becomes Bob's landlord, while remaining a tenant to the original landlord, creating two separate tenancy relationships governed by the Act.\nC) Bob automatically becomes a co-tenant on Alice's original lease, sharing equal rights and responsibilities with Alice.\nD) The arrangement is not covered by the Residential Tenancies Act as it involves shared common areas within the apartment.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario tests the application of multiple concepts from the Nova Scotia Residential Tenancies Act. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. According to Section 3(2) of the Act, a landlord-tenant relationship is deemed to exist when an individual occupies premises and pays rent to another person. This applies to Bob paying rent to Alice.\n\n2. The definition of \"residential premises\" in Section 2(d) explicitly includes \"that part of any such place that is or may be occupied by an individual as a residence,\" which covers the situation of renting a single room.\n\n3. The Dalhousie University Legal Aid Service information confirms that in a sublet situation, the original tenant (Alice) becomes a \"master tenant\" and the new occupant (Bob) becomes a subtenant. This creates two separate tenancy relationships: one between the original landlord and Alice, and another between Alice and Bob.\n\n4. The Act does not provide exceptions for shared common areas in Nova Scotia, unlike some other provinces.\n\n5.

The bank (or whoever owned the loan) had already sent notices and tried other options. They had to do quite a bit of detective work to find the owner. The owner had also gotten plenty of notices in the mail and probably a visit from someone trying to collect, so they were already on the lookout. Simply by the law of averages, a couple of mistakes have to happen.\n\nMy question is\n\n1. What happens when a car that is legally owned by someone is \"repossessed\"? Is the repo man charged with theft?\n2. What happens to personal items in the car? For example, a laptop in a book\\-bag.\n3. How does the rightful owner go about getting the car back? Do they file a police report?\n4. Are there special statutes that protect repo men from honest mistakes?\n\nThere were several popular \"repo shows\" in the early 2000s. Most of them were staged, but I believe some showed real repos, at least at first. I believe most of the shows filmed in Florida or California. I don't doubt sometimes repo men played a bit fast and loose with the rules. Repo was generally the final option after notices and visits from collectors had failed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is it a crime for a repo man to accidentally repo the wrong car?\n\nNot unless the car was retained after the accidental repossession was discovered, and then, only by the person retaining it (as the repo man may have turned over the car to the creditor whose loan on a similar car is in default).\n\nGenerally speaking, taking property of another with an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property of it is a crime only if one knows that the property is the property of another.\n\nFor example, if two people leave black umbrellas in an entry room and someone accidentally leaves with the wrong one, the taking of the wrong umbrella is not a crime.\n\nWhether the repo man's assertion that he accidentally took the wrong car is credible is a question of fact to be determined at trial, if the prosecution doubts him. If he was supposed to repossess a 1936 Ford and he repossessed a 2021 Tesla, the repo man is probably going to lose and be convicted of theft. If he was supposed to repossess a white 2021 Tesla and he repossessed a different white 2021 Tesla in the same neighborhood with a license plate from the same state as the one he was supposed to repossess, he has a very good chance of prevailing.\n\nHowever, once someone learns that they have taken the wrong property, they have a duty to return the property promptly to the owner upon request, and probably, to notify the owner (if the owner can be determined) and the authorities who were informed that a different vehicle was taken, promptly. Otherwise, the originally good faith mistake becomes theft.\n\nIf the repo man's explanation is convincing, he is not likely to be charged with theft, even though no special law applies. What makes the repo man special is that he did have permission from the secured car loan creditor to repossess it due to the secured car loan debtor's default by the Uniform Commercial Code. If he had taken the right car without a breach of the peace, the Uniform Commercial Code would have absolved him of liability and given him legal permission to do so.\n\nIf the repo had been of the right car, the creditor would have had a duty to promptly return the personal possession in the car in which it did not have a lien to the rightful owner. This conclusion doesn't change when the repo man accidentally takes the wrong car.\n\nWhile the repo man's mistake was not knowing or intentional, it was probably negligent to repossess the car without carefully confirming the VIN number and license plate to make sure that he was repossessing the correct car. As a result, the car own probably has a claim against both the repo man (whose negligence caused the wrongful repossession) and the creditor (for whom he was acting as an agent to repossess the car) for any damages caused to the owner of the wrongfully repossessed car, including damages to the vehicle and damages from loss of use of the car and possibly damages for emotional distress caused by thinking that his car had been stolen or by missing a non\\-economic opportunity that he could have had if the car had not been wrongfully taken (e.g. if this caused the car owner to miss the funeral of the car owner's father).\n\nThe creditor and the repo man probably have insurance policies in place that cover legal defense of such claims and also economic settlements or money judgments entered on that kind of claim.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about repossession law, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A repo man accidentally repossesses the wrong vehicle - a white 2021 Tesla instead of a similar model in the same neighborhood.

Which of the following scenarios is most likely to result in criminal charges against the repo man?\n\nA) The repo man immediately returns the car but keeps the laptop for 48 hours to \"verify ownership\"\nB) The repo man informs the creditor of the mistake but waits for their approval before returning the vehicle\nC) The repo man returns the car promptly but claims no knowledge of the laptop's whereabouts\nD) The repo man acknowledges the mistake and returns both the car and laptop within 2 hours of being notified\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question tests the application of multiple concepts from the documentation, requiring analysis of the legal implications of accidental repossession. The correct answer is A because it represents a scenario where the repo man's initially honest mistake could turn into a criminal act. \n\nThe documentation states that \"once someone learns that they have taken the wrong property, they have a duty to return the property promptly to the owner upon request.\" By keeping the laptop for an additional 48 hours after being made aware of the mistake, the repo man is now knowingly retaining property that doesn't belong to him or the creditor, which could be considered theft.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while it's not ideal, informing the creditor and waiting for approval might be seen as part of the repo process, especially if done promptly. It's less likely to result in criminal charges, though it could lead to civil liability.\n\nOption C is problematic but less likely to result in criminal charges than A. The prompt return of the car shows good faith, and while claiming no knowledge of the laptop is suspicious, it's harder to prove criminal intent.\n\nOption D is the most appropriate response according to the documentation and is least likely to result in criminal charges, as it demonstrates immediate action to correct the mistake.\n\nThis question requires integration of concepts about accidental repossession, the duty to return property, and the point at which an honest mistake can become a criminal act.
