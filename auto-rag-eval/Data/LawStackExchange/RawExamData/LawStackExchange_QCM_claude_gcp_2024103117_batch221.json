Most usually the mortgage is offered as security for a loan taken out by the mortgagors (landowner), however, mortgages can be given for all sorts of other reasons. For example, I might give a mortgage to guarantee a loan by someone else. Or as surety for bail.\n\nThe Registrar General [says](https://rg-guidelines.nswlrs.com.au/deposited_plans/conversion_os/possessory_title):\n\n> The effect of adverse possession is to destroy the title of the person who is dispossessed, however, it does not destroy the rights of other persons who have an enforceable interest in the land such as easements or restrictive covenants.\n\nSince a mortgage is a type of restrictive covenant the mortgagee would retain the right to seize and sell the property if whatever trigger for that to happen, happened.\n\nSo, to keep it simple, if we assume that the original owner offered the mortgage as security for a loan, then, if they stopped paying the loan *one of* the lender's options would be to seize and sell the land irrespective of who owns it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a case of adverse possession where the original property had a mortgage:\n\nA) The mortgage is automatically transferred to the new owner through adverse possession.\nB) The mortgage is voided and the bank loses its claim on the property.\nC) The original owner remains responsible for the mortgage payments, but loses ownership of the property.\nD) The mortgage remains tied to the property and can be enforced regardless of the change in ownership.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because adverse possession does not automatically transfer mortgage obligations.\nB is incorrect as the mortgage, being a type of restrictive covenant, is not destroyed by adverse possession.\nC is partially correct about the original owner losing ownership, but wrong about mortgage responsibility.\nD is correct because the mortgage is part of the title and remains enforceable even after adverse possession.

(Or, would they be if they do it in Europe?)\n\nOne thing to note is that the apps usually associate the data with a unique ID assigned to the device rather than your name or phone number, for example. However, it's well\\-known (and shown in the article) how it is usually trivial to tie back \"anonymised\" data to individuals.  \n\nHow does this use of a unique ID affect the GDPR situation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, this violates the GDPR if the user is in Europe.\n\nData which is tied to a personal device can be tied to the person who owns it. From \"*[What Is Personal Data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/)*\" by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) (emphasis added):\n\n> * Personal data is information that relates to an identified or **identifiable** individual.\n> * What identifies an individual could be as simple as a name or a number or could include other identifiers **such as an IP address or a cookie identifier**, or other factors.\n> * If it is possible to identify an individual directly from the information you are processing, then that information may be personal data.\n> * If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, then you need to consider whether the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account the information you are processing together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify that individual.\n\nThe bit about \"all means reasonably likely\" in the last bullet includes the kind of de\\-anonymisation tactics described in the NYT article.\n\nThere are [6 lawful bases for data processing](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/) in the GDPR, and all processing must fall under at least one of them.\n\n> (a) Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose.\n> \n> \n> (b) Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.\n> \n> \n> (c) Legal obligation: the processing is necessary for you to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations).\n> \n> \n> (d) Vital interests: the processing is necessary to protect someone\u2019s life.\n> \n> \n> (e) Public task: the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.\n> \n> \n> (f) Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, unless there is a good reason to protect the individual\u2019s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests. (This cannot apply if you are a public authority processing data to perform your official tasks.)\n\nSelling data isn't covered by any of the others, so consent must be obtained. Permission must be clear and positive, and you cannot predicate delivery of a service on the processing of data that isn't necessary for that service. So for instance you cannot say \"You can use this service as long as we are allowed to collect and sell your data\" because selling the data isn't necessary to the provision of the service. From \"*[Consent](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/consent/)*\" by the ICO:\n\n> * Consent requires a positive opt\\-in. Don\u2019t use pre\\-ticked boxes or any other method of default consent.\n> * Explicit consent requires a very clear and specific statement of consent.\n> * Keep your consent requests separate from other terms and conditions.\n> * Be specific and \u2018granular\u2019 so that you get separate consent for separate things.\n> * Vague or blanket consent is not enough.\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> * Avoid making consent to processing a precondition of a service.\n\nThis applies to any processing of data about [individuals within the EU](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/), so just being an American company doesn't get you a free pass to ignore the GDPR if your app gets used by Europeans.\n\nThe \"Legitimate interests\" basis is more problematic, in that the company collecting the data has to conduct a vague \"balancing test\" to determine if this basis applies. For direct marketing the [ICO has written this](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/legitimate-interests/when-can-we-rely-on-legitimate-interests/), which says that direct marketing *may* be a legitimate interest, especially if you can show that the user has expressed interest in such adverts. For instance a location service which promises to tell you about nearby special offers would fall into this category. Against this, the impact on the user's privacy has to be considered, and location data is \"[special category data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/)\" because it can reveal medical information (e.g. hospital attendance) or religious affiliation (e.g. which church you go to). So unless the relationship between the recorded location data and the service is very direct its not going to pass the balancing test. The company would also need to distinguish between knowing the current location and keeping a record of historical locations; the two need separate justification.\n\nAnd of course nothing about this covers the sale of the data; this is considering a company which sells advertising space in it's app, not one that sells the data itself.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A mobile app company collects location data from users in the EU for providing personalized weather forecasts.

Is the act of downloading those movies and TV episodes for free, editing them, and publishing them legal **in America**?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Evaluating a potential copyright violation is very fact\\-intensive, so we don't have enough information to answer the question.\n\nMaking a copy is generally going to be a copyright violation, but there's still going to be a lot of breathing room under the fair use doctrine. Again, we'd need more details to provide a useful answer, but you may be able to analyze the question yourself using the following information.\n\nAnalysis of fair\\-use defenses looks at four questions, and the answers to the questions can tip the scales in favor of or against a finding of fair use:\n\n1. **Does your kind of copying affect the market for the original?** To what extent can your copy fulfill the demand for the original? What if there were widespread copying of the kind you're considering? The more potential there is for the copies to replace the original, the less likely it is to be fair use. *This is the most important factor in the analysis.*\n2. **Why did you make the copy?** If you made the copy for purposes of news reporting, criticism, or commentary, it's more likely to be fair use. If you made a copy just so you could watch again later whenever you feel like it, that's may still be fair use, but it is somewhat less likely. If you made a copy so you could sell it for profit, that's almost certainly not fair use.\n3. **How much did you copy?** Did you copy the whole thing, or did you copy only as much as you needed to achieve your purpose under Question 2? If you copy \"too much\" \\-\\- both in the raw amount and as a fraction of the whole work \\-\\- it's less likely to be fair use.\n4. **What did you copy?** Such works can be copyrighted but are not part of the Highly creative works, such as poems, music, and movies, are at the \"core\" of copyright principles. A fair use analysis will be more stringent in these cases than when copying a purely factual work, such as a phone book, biography, or list of statistics. *This is the least important factor in the analysis.*\n\nSo take all of those and imagine the answer to each on a spectrum. If you see things generally tipping in the direction of fair use, that's a good indication that you're going to be safe. If you see things tipping in the other direction, you may want to reconsider.\n\nAgain, these can be notoriously tricky questions.

The fact that the channel is monetized doesn't automatically disqualify fair use, but it's a factor to consider. The nature of the copyrighted work (TV shows being highly creative) weighs against fair use, but this is the least important factor. The amount used seems relatively small, which favors fair use.

Both the US \\& Canada safeguard these rights in their constitutions (Amendments I, V, XIV \\& *Charter* ss. 2(b), 11(d) respectively) so any differences would be in their approaches to balancing these rights.\n\nUnited States\n=============\n\nI've found *[Some Aspects of the Law of Contempt of Court in Canada, England, and the United States](https://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/wp-content/uploads/pdf/3251710-ziegel.pdf)* (Jacob S. Ziegel, 1960\\) to be highly informative on the historical development of contempt of court and provided a good baseline understanding. In reference to *[Bridges v. California](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/314/252/)* 314 U.S. 252 (1941\\), it states\n\n> Although the Court recognized that \"free speech and fair trials are two of the most cherished policies of our civilization\" and that \"it would be a trying task to choose between them\", it held nevertheless that an abridgment on the freedom of the press was only permitted by the Constitution when there was \"a clear and present danger\" that the offending publication would actually interfere with a fair and impartial trial. The majority opinion rejected the \"reasonable tendency\" test which had been applied by the lower courts, and still is the yardstick by which such publications are measured in England and Canada.\n\nI'd also like to quote the following paragraph from *Bridges* as it raises two points I'd like to comment on:\n\n> What finally emerges from the \"clear and present danger\" cases is a working principle that the substantive evil must be extremely serious, and the degree of imminence extremely high, before utterances can be punished. Those cases do not purport to mark the furthermost constitutional boundaries of protected expression, nor do we here. They do no more than recognize a minimum compulsion of the Bill of Rights. For the First Amendment does not speak equivocally. It prohibits any law \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" It must be taken as a command of the broadest scope that explicit language, read in the context of a liberty\\-loving society, will allow.\n\nThe first point is that due to its broad language, the court gives a certain priority to the First Amendment.\n\nThe second point involves the age of my citations: the \"clear and present danger\" test is from *[Schenck v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States)*, largely considered to be overruled by the more stringent *[Brandenburg v. Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio)* 395 U.S. 444 (1969\\) \"immediate lawless action\" test.\n\nThis does raise the question of whether *Bridges* can then be considered good law. I unfortunately can't find any good references discussing *Bridges* in a post\\-*Brandenburg* context, however, I would argue it is still valid. While the *Schenck* test has been overruled, the *Bridges* citation I gave in fact foreshadows the *Brandenburg* test by using the language of \"imminence\" and stating the *Schenck* test was not necessarily the limit of the First Amendment, but just a minimum bar. I would then argue that *Bridges* can quite easily be considered good law by simply substituting the *Schenck* test with the *Brandenburg* one without really affecting the court's *ratio decidendi*.\n\nCanada\n======\n\nZiegel's article is even more out\\-of\\-date when it comes to Canada as it is pre\\-*Charter*. For a modern Canadian overview of out\\-of\\-court contempt of court I've found *[A Comment on \"No Comment\": The Sub Judice Rule and the Accountability of Public Officials in the 21st Century](https://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=scholarly_works)* (Lorne Sossin \\& Valerie Crystal, 2013\\). The article cites *[Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1204/index.do)* \\[1994] 3 SCR 835 as directly tackling the balance of these rights. In it the court acknowledged the pre\\-*Charter* common law of giving deference to the accused's right to a fair trial, but noting that the *Charter* now requires a balancing of these rights\n\n> The traditional common law rule governing publication bans \\-\\- that there be a real and substantial risk of interference with the right to a fair trial \\-\\- emphasized the right to a fair trial over the free expression interests of those affected by the ban and, in the context of post\\-*Charter* Canadian society, does not provide sufficient protection for freedom of expression. When two protected rights come into conflict, *Charter* principles require a balance to be achieved that fully respects the importance of both rights. A hierarchical approach to rights must be avoided, both when interpreting the *Charter* and when developing the common law. The common law rule governing publication bans must thus be reformulated in a manner that reflects the principles of the *Charter* and, in particular, the equal status given by the *Charter* to ss. 2(b) and 11(d).\n\nUltimately, the court concluded that a balance of these rights was the following test:\n\n> A publication ban should only be ordered when:\n> \n> \n> (a) Such a ban is necessary in order to prevent a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial, because reasonably available alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and\n> \n> \n> (b) The salutary effects of the publication ban outweigh the deleterious effects to the free expression of those affected by the ban.\n\nWhile *Dagenais* more clearly explains the balancing of these two rights, the article also cites *[R. v. Vermette](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/332/index.do)* \\[1988] 1 SCR 985 which is a much more similar situation to Maxine Waters commenting on an ongoing trial. The article summarizes as follows:\n\n> While the trial was ongoing, the premier of Quebec, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, denounced one of the defence witnesses in the National Assembly, despite warnings by the Speaker that such comments would be prejudicial to the accused.\n\nThe [trial decision](https://www.canlii.org/en/qc/qccs/doc/1982/1982canlii3672/1982canlii3672.html) even contains the following comment from the judge:\n\n> When speaking in the National Assembly, however, the Premier enjoyed the privilege of Parliamentary immunity. Had it not been for this immunity, he could\n> have been cited for contempt of court.\n\nComparison\n==========\n\nAt a constitutional level, it can be seen that the balancing of these two rights are not the same in the US and Canada. The US gives much greater weight to freedom of speech, while Canada allows restriction of speech if doing so more greatly benefits another *Charter* right and there is no reasonable alternative.\n\nOn a practical level, there are also differences in how jury trials are run, maybe even as a direct result of the constitutional differences. In *Dagenais*, the court quotes the following:\n\n> Generally speaking, however, the approach taken in the United States seems to be to allow for the widest possible latitude in media reporting of events transpiring prior to and during the course of the trial of an accused person. This is counterbalanced, in the interests of ensuring an impartial and unbiased jury, in a number of ways including, during the jury selection process, by an often searching examination into the attitudes, biases and even the personal and financial affairs of potential jurors and, after the jury selection process has been completed, by the sequestration of the members of the jury while the trial is in progress to reduce the risk of their exposure to the media and other publicity generated by it.\n> \n> \n> In Canada, by contrast, the process of jury selection is neither as prolonged nor as exhaustive as a general rule; indeed the kind of questioning and probing into the affairs of potential jurors that is sometimes seen in the United States would be unlikely to be permitted under our system. Moreover, in Canada the sequestration of jurors throughout a trial occurs only exceptionally. The strong bias of our system is to prevent the dissemination before the conclusion of the trial of media publicity that might be prejudicial to the accused's fair trial.\n\nThe US \\& Canada simply follow different constitutional approaches here and have slightly different priorities when it comes to balancing rights.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In comparing the approaches of the United States and Canada to balancing freedom of speech with the right to a fair trial, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The United States gives equal weight to freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial, while Canada prioritizes freedom of speech.\n\nB) Both countries use the same \"clear and present danger\" test to determine when speech can be restricted in relation to ongoing trials.\n\nC) Canada allows for more restrictions on speech related to ongoing trials, while the United States gives greater protection to freedom of speech.\n\nD) The United States has stricter jury selection processes and more frequent jury sequestration, while Canada relies more on restricting prejudicial media coverage.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided indicates that the United States gives greater weight to freedom of speech, requiring a very high standard (the \"immediate lawless action\" test from Brandenburg v. Ohio) before speech can be restricted. In contrast, Canada allows for a more balanced approach between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial, as established in cases like Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. This allows for more restrictions on speech if it poses a real and substantial risk to trial fairness and if the benefits outweigh the negative effects on free expression.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it reverses the priorities of the two countries. Answer B is incorrect because while the \"clear and present danger\" test was once used in the US, it has been superseded by a stricter test, and Canada uses a different balancing approach.

The President can\u2019t because he is the government.**\n\nFrom the article:\n\n> PragerU's claim that YouTube censored PragerU's speech faces a formidable threshold hurdle: YouTube is a private entity. The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government\u2014not a private party\u2014from abridging speech\n\nIn the case of Trump it was he that was limiting access, not YouTube and he can\u2019t do that.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains the difference between the rulings on Donald Trump's Twitter account and PragerU's lawsuit against YouTube regarding First Amendment protections?\n\nA) YouTube is considered a public forum, while Twitter is not.\n\nB) PragerU has more legal rights than individual users on social media platforms.\n\nC) The First Amendment applies differently to various social media platforms based on their size and influence.\n\nD) Trump's Twitter account was subject to First Amendment constraints due to his government position, while YouTube as a private entity is not bound by the same restrictions.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The key distinction lies in the actors involved and their relationship to the government. Trump, as the President, was considered a government actor when using his Twitter account for official communications, making it subject to First Amendment constraints. In contrast, YouTube is a private company not directly affiliated with the government. The First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting free speech, but it does not apply to private entities in the same way. This is why YouTube can set its own content policies without violating the First Amendment, while Trump's account was treated as a public forum due to his government role."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83250/is-it-legal-to-fix-an-iphone-with-a-non-original-battery-in-california", "docs_id": 83250, "title": "Is it legal to fix an iPhone with a non original battery in California?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I got my iPhone XR battery replaced 6 months ago.

In a [2016 Supreme Court case](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/impression-products-inc-v-lexmark-international-inc/) regarding another consumer electronics product (in that case, printers), the Court found that once a company has sold a product they cannot dictate how it is used.

If it is not, Apple is generally free to decline to service it for any reason.

This means the consumer acted legally by choosing a non-original battery. The technician also acted legally by performing the battery replacement, as there are no laws prohibiting such repairs in California. However, if the phone is out of warranty, Apple has the right to refuse service for any reason, including the presence of third-party hardware.

You do not have to make a statement to be dishonest; not saying something can be deceitful.\n\nHowever, dishonesty is not in and of itself a crime or a tort; it only becomes so when the law imposes a duty to be honest. When that happens, the statute (if applicable) and the case law is usually pretty clear about what honesty requires. This will differ between jurisdictions and within jurisdictions with context.\n\nFor example, many jurisdictions impose an obligations on business not to engage in \"false or misleading\" conduct. However, you can tell lies and still comply with the law because obviously outrageous advertising claims (e.g. \"Sale of the Century\", \"The greatest thing since sliced bread\") while (probably) false are not misleading.\n\nAlternatively, you can be scrupulous about not telling lies and still be dishonest. A case in NSW (name escapes me) where a potential buyer of a restaurant asked \"How many does it seat?\" and receiving a reply of \"X\", a perfectly accurate answer based on the number of place settings, was able to successfully sue when he discovered after the purchase that it was *licenced* to seat \"Y\"; substantially less than \"X\".

It usually declares the source from which the law claims to derive its authority. In many countries, an enacting formula is not considered necessary and is simply omitted.\n> \n> \n> The simplest enacting clauses merely cite the legislature by which the law has been adopted; for example the enacting clause used in Australia since 1990 is \"The Parliament of Australia enacts\". Alternatively an enacting clause may invoke the ultimate sovereign. For example, California, based on the principle of popular sovereignty, has the following enacting clause: \"The People of the State of California do enact as follows.\"\n\nFor example, Acts of the US Congress begin with words not unlike those of Acts of Parliament:\n\n> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\n> United States of America in Congress assembled\n\nUK statutory instruments go further, stating not only who made the order, but also which legislation provided the power to make this order. To take a [recent example](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/654/made) at random:\n\n> The Secretary of State for Education makes the following Order in exercise of the powers conferred by section 129(1\\) of the Education Reform Act 1988\n\nFrom these, one might surmise that the purpose of these sentences is to convince the reader that the person or body issuing the legislation has the power to do so.\n\nFor most statutory instruments, the power to make them comes from Acts of Parliament, and so the specific section(s) of the those Acts are stated. For Acts of Parliament themselves, it is taken as read that the Queen, Lords and Commons acting together (or more formally, the [Queen\\-in\\-Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen-in-Parliament)) have the power to legislate, so it is sufficient to merely state that is they who have done so \\- and similarly for the US Congress and other legislatures.\n\n---\n\nIn response to edits in the question:\n\n> Can't the hackneyed sentence ... be shortened?\n\nYes it could, as evidenced by the fact that not all countries use an enacting clause at all, and some of those that do have shorter, simpler ones.\n\n> Why not something less pompous?\n\nWhy should they?\n\nOne shouldn't underestimate the role of tradition in the UK constitution \\- indeed it's held together in part by unwritten conventions whose long use has solidified them into something like law.\n\nAs mentioned in the question, bills don't become acts until they've been assented to by a hereditary monarch, which is indicated by a clerk uttering a statement in Norman French. Compared to that, what's wrong with acts starting with a grandiose statement?\n\n---\n\nIncidentally, if you thank that's pompous, then you'll enjoy the enacting clause which appears at the top of UK [Finance Acts](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/3/introduction/enacted):\n\n> Most Gracious Sovereign\n> \n> \n> WE, Your Majesty\u2019s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom in Parliament assembled, towards raising the necessary supplies to defray Your Majesty\u2019s public expenses, and making an addition to the public revenue, have freely and voluntarily resolved to give and to grant unto Your Majesty the several duties hereinafter mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the Queen\u2019s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:\u2014\n\nFinally, context is everything.

All charges have been dropped.\n\nTo prevail on a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim and defeat the qualified immunity defense in this context, a plaintiff must show that the law enforcement officer intentionally violated a well\\-established constitutional right.\n\nTo use force lawfully to prevent an escape of a suspected criminal, under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (as incorporated against U.S. states under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution), a police officer may use deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect (whose status as a suspect is supported by probable cause) only if the officer has a good\\-faith belief that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others. *Tennessee v. Garner*, [471 U.S. 1](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/471/1/) (1985\\).\n\nIn this case, the officer may have had a reasonable suspicion (the car looked similar to one he had been on the lookout for in connection with a car theft case although it was not actually the same one), although not probable cause (since there are many cars of the same color, make, and model of almost any type on the road at any one time), to believe that the car in question was stolen by a person who was not armed other than having the car. This probably doesn't meat the *Garner* test for constitutionality.\n\nAlternatively, the use of force could be justified for self\\-defense or in the defense of others, if the car's hypothetical use as a weapon gave the officer probable cause to believe a suspect posed an imminent threat of serious bodily harm to the officer or others which the use of deadly force could prevent (as discussed in dicta in *Garner*).\n\nIn this case, the question of whether the officer was actually in imminent risk of serious harm, when the officer, in fact, never even came into contact with the car and was off to the side of it, would also be weak.\n\nShooting someone without either justification ought to overcome the qualified immunity defense.\n\nA full qualified immunity legal analysis would cited also to binding precedents from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit restating these U.S. Supreme Court enunciated constitutional right in circumstances as factually similar to this case as possible, to underline the fact that these constitutional rights are \"well\\-established\".

Garner standard, as there was no probable cause that the teenager posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury.\n\nD) Qualified immunity always protects officers from liability in cases involving suspected car theft.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the correct answer because it directly addresses the key elements needed to overcome qualified immunity in this case. The Tennessee v. Garner standard established that police can only use deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect if there's probable cause to believe the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury. In this case, the officer lacked probable cause (only having reasonable suspicion at best), and the teenager did not pose a significant threat. This violation of a well-established constitutional right is crucial for overcoming qualified immunity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because reasonable suspicion alone is not sufficient to justify deadly force under the Garner standard.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the video evidence suggests the teenager was not posing a significant threat by merely driving away, especially since the officer was not in the car's path.\n\nOption D is incorrect as qualified immunity is not an absolute protection and can be overcome when there's a clear violation of established constitutional rights."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/34368/is-it-legal-to-trade-receipts", "docs_id": 34368, "title": "Is it legal to trade receipts", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Companies can claim an expense as long as they have the mean to justify it, usually in the form of invoice or receipt.

The marketplace would likely be legal to operate, as long as it doesn't actively promote or engage in illicit practices. While some users might attempt to use the platform for tax fraud or other illegitimate purposes, the mere possibility of such misuse doesn't make the trading of receipts inherently unlawful.

The lawyer in question has been doing some questionable things and I am not sure which ones would be considered 'over the line.'\n\nExample:\nThe lawyer set up a call with me to negotiate a pay settlement on some pending deals I had with old employer. I was told (by employer), verbally and in text/email messages that I \"would be paid when the deals closed.\" The lawyer and I had a phone discussion where he said the same thing and he also tried to negotiate my % of the payment down from 30% to 15%. A month later, in writing, he claims I am \"owed nothing\" on the deals in progress.\n\nSo, I have been told I would get paid, by the employer and then the lawyer as well. The lawyer then tried to negotiate with me on the payment amount...and now has changed his tune to \"you are owed nothing.\" Is this kosher? If there is evidence of him doing this, is there some kind of ethical violation here? Would that evidence, in support of my case, be a serious issue for the lawyer should we go to court?\n\nThere was a separate occasion where I asked the lawyer if he had discussed these matters with anyone else. I know that he has, as I am still friendly with an employee that the lawyer spoke to about these matters. He flat out told me that he \"had not discussed it with anyone else\" nor would he.\n\nWhat would be the sensible way to use this information to my advantage while trying to resolve these matters with having to bring suit and go to court? Is there anything that this lawyer should fear, if his unethical behavior was brought to light, either in court or to a bar association? Thanks for any help.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are basically two kinds of conduct that you identify.\n\nOne is backing away from what you believe were oral promises made by the employer and lawyer regarding payment. Whatever the status of the promises made by the employer, the oral statements made by the lawyer would probably be viewed by a court or ethics board as settlement offers or proposals rather than actual binding agreements, and this is unlikely to be considered an ethical lapse.\n\nFor purposes of ethics questions and fraud lawsuits, lies about what kind of deal you are willing to make with an adversary don't count as lies. This isn't a terribly logical rule, but is is a well established one.\n\nGiven that:\n\n> I was told (by employer), verbally and in text/email messages that I\n>  \"would be paid when the deals closed.\"\n\nIt is going to be very hard for the employer to take back those written statements and text and email messages are usually given the effect of signed writings in a court of law. This is going to be taken as a confession of the employer regarding the probably unwritten agreement of the parties regarding your right to be paid on these deals, so you would be well advised to stick to your guns on this issue. The percentages will be another point that is hard for the employer to fight if there is a course of dealings between the parties in which you receive a consistent percentage or there was a written agreement concerning your commission percentage.\n\nAlso, even if the lawyer did make a promise and breached it, this would still only be a breach by the employer of a contract made on the employer's behalf by his lawyer. It is not an ethical lapse to breach a contract about future conduct, and a lawyer is not personally responsible for contracts he makes as a disclosed agent of your former employer.\n\nThe second is making a false statement of fact about whom the lawyer has discussed the matter with. Lawyers do have an ethical duty to be truthful and failing to do so is an ethical lapse. But, this duty is generally interpreted to apply only to statements of fact which are material. If a lawyer lies to you about how old he is, or whether he's ever had an affair, in the context of a pre\\-litigation negotiation like this one, the ethical officials won't care. If a lawyer lies to you about something material to the transaction (e.g. claiming that the employer has money in the bank to pay a settlement when in fact it is overdrawn on all of its accounts and has no money coming in and the lawyer knows those facts), this is a serious ethical breach. \n\nIt is hard to see how this information would be material, even though it casts doubt on his credibility. Ethically, he owes any duty of confidentiality to his client and not to you, so it isn't your complaint to make from a confidentiality point of view. \n\nAlso, unless he discusses confidential advice that he provided *to his client* when no one else was present to you, he has not waived the attorney\\-client privilege, contrary to the answer by @I\u00f1akiViggers on that issue.\n\nOf course, proving that the lawyer said anything in an oral conversation at which no one else was present comes down to a credibility fight between your sworn statement and his if the lawyer testifies inaccurately about the discussion. A sworn statement from you is proof and would meet the \"burden of production\" to provide proof in support of your case at a trial, but wouldn't necessarily prevail easily at trial since the judge might not be convinced regarding who is accurate in their account of the discussion (I have avoided the word \"lying\" because there are a variety of reasons that people inaccurately recall discussions).\n\n> What would be the sensible way to use this information to my advantage\n>  while trying to resolve these matters with having to bring suit and go\n>  to court? Is there anything that this lawyer should fear, if his\n>  unethical behavior was brought to light, either in court or to a bar\n>  association?\n\n**The conduct you describe on the part of the lawyer will provide you with little or no leverage in your negotiations and is likely to not even be considered admissible evidence in court since it may be considered a form of settlement negotiations.** \n\nYour strongest leverage will be the written statements from the employer.\n\nBut, depending upon the amount in dispute, it may still make sense to compromise given the time and expense and uncertainty of going to court. Even in the clearest case, you probably only have a 90% chance of winning a contested case, and you wouldn't cross the street if you knew you had a 10% chance of being hit by a car as you crossed, even if you knew that the collision wouldn't be fatal.\n\nUnless your state has a wage claims act that covers you, you may have little or not prospect of an attorneys' fee award if you prevail, and representing yourself when the employer has a lawyer will always put you at a disadvantage in a court setting.\n\nIf the amount in dispute is great (e.g. $50,000\\+), hiring a lawyer is probably worth it. If the amount in dispute is small (e.g. $5,000\\) you may want to file a suit in small claims court and only hire a lawyer for a couple hours of pre\\-hearing coaching.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An employee is in a dispute with their former employer over unpaid commissions.

As long as there is no direct conflict of interest between the clients (which doesn't appear to be the case here), the lawyer is ethically bound to present the best possible argument for each client, regardless of positions taken in other cases. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest the lawyer should compromise their duty to one or both clients. Option B is incorrect because this situation does not inherently create a conflict of interest that would prevent the lawyer from representing both clients effectively."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28943/copyright-and-encrypted-backups", "docs_id": 28943, "title": "Copyright and Encrypted Backups", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A person's computer stores a variety of copyrighted files which they have a license to use and store (such as video games, operating system files, and purchased or freely available media).

The phrase \"upon conversion\" in the context of startup investing typically refers to a convertible debt arrangement. In this scenario, the investor initially provides the funds as a loan (debt) to the company. The conversion to equity is triggered by a predetermined event or milestone, such as obtaining a key regulatory approval, closing a significant funding round, or reaching a specific valuation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes an immediate equity investment, not a convertible arrangement. \n\nOption C is incorrect as it describes a default scenario, which is not the typical intent of a convertible note. \n\nOption D is incorrect because while profitability could be a conversion trigger, the use of an escrow account is not typical in these arrangements, and the specific profitability condition is too narrow to be the most likely interpretation.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the explanation in the original text, which describes how convertible debt can be tied to specific events or milestones, such as obtaining a liquor license in the given example."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90561/the-flashing-red-light-is-treated-like-a-stop-sign", "docs_id": 90561, "title": "The flashing red light is treated like a stop sign", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Does the flashing red light eventually turn into a steady red light before it changes to green?

The World Health Organization (WHO) is probably a different legal entity from the United Nations (UN) itself and merely affiliated with the UN from a legal perspective, rather than being legally considered to be an agency of the UN. So, the WHO rather than the UN would be the proper defendant.\n\n**Subject Matter Jurisdiction**\n\nFederal courts have limited \"subject matter\" jurisdiction and this must always be analyzed before other jurisdictional considerations are considered. \n\nBut, U.S. District Courts are allowed to adjudicate civil lawsuits where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the defendants are not citizens of the same U.S. state. This is a civil lawsuit, the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, the plaintiffs are citizens of New York State, and the Defendant is not a New York State entity. So, the federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case.\n\n**Venue**\n\nVenue is proper in a federal district court if the district court can assert personal jurisdiction over the defendant. \n\nA district court, in turn, has personal jurisdiction over any defendant over whom a state court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located would have personal jurisdiction.\n\nNote, as an aside, that where none of the events giving rise to the suit took place in the state, and the defendant does not reside in the state, any of the U.S. District Courts in the state is a proper venue, whether or not the Plaintiffs reside there, if the general jurisdiction state courts of the state would have personal jurisdiction over the Defendant.\n\n**Personal Jurisdiction**\n\n*General Jurisdiction*\n\nIt appears that the WHO does not have a permanent office for the conduct of business in the United States (it's headquarters is in Switzerland and none of its regional offices are in the U.S.), although it might have a full time representative at the UN offices in New York City. \n\nTherefore, a federal district court in New York State (or a state court in New York State) would probably not have the authority to assert \"general personal jurisdiction\" (i.e. jurisdiction over any case against the defendant without regard to how it arose) over the WHO because this is not a \"headquarters\" or equivalent permanent office in New York State.\n\n*Specific Jurisdiction*\n\nTo have \"specific personal jurisdiction\" over over the WHO (i.e. arising from the facts of the particular case and limited to that case), the WHO would have to have taken actions directed as someone within the state in which the District Court in question is located which would suffice to personally avail itself of the laws of that state and the United States. \n\nFailure to adequately take actions in China for the general benefit of the world, would not suffice to meet that standard. While the injury may have occurred in New York State, the actions alleged did not occur in New York State and were not directed in any particular way to New York State as opposed to anywhere else, and no one is alleging that the WHO intentionally or negligently itself sent coronavirus germs to New York State, even if it may have failed to take certain steps that it had a duty to take, and that failure made the arrival of those germs in New York State possible.\n\n*Tag Jurisdiction*\n\nA third way to acquire personal jurisdiction in some cases is called \"tag jurisdiction.\" \"Tag jurisdiction\" provides a court with personal jurisdiction over an individual in a particular case in the state where personal service of process upon that individual took place, without regard to other considerations. But, \"tag jurisdiction\" does not apply to entities such as the WHO.\n\n**Governmental Immunity**\n\nMoreover, even if a U.S. District Court did have personal jurisdiction over the WHO, this action would be a \"tort\" action and the WHO would also almost certainly have some form of sovereign immunity under U.S. law from a tort action of this type.\n\nThe relevant U.S. statute is the [International Organizations Immunities Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organizations_Immunities_Act) (full text [here](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title22/chapter7/subchapter18&edition=prelim)). The key provision for purposes of this question is 22 U.S.C. \u00a7288a(b) which states:\n\n> International organizations, their property and their assets, wherever\n>  located, and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy the same immunity from\n>  suit and every form of judicial process as is enjoyed by foreign\n>  governments, except to the extent that such organizations may\n>  expressly waive their immunity for the purpose of any proceedings or\n>  by the terms of any contract.\n\nThe definition of an International Organization for the purposes of the act is [22 U.S.C. \u00a7 288](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/288) which provides a general rule protecting international organizations in the absence of an executive order to the contrary. The President may revoke an international organization's immunity prospectively by executive order (except in the case of 13 organizations who are covered by a specific statutory provision; the WHO is not one of them), but neither a private organization nor a U.S. state or local government, may do so. And, an executive order purporting to revoke an organization's immunity retroactively would be void as an *ex post facto* determination.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, then, this lawsuit will very likely be dismissed either for lack of personal jurisdiction, or on account of an immunity from tort liability doctrine, in response to a motion to dismiss, without ever getting any further. It might also be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted on other grounds (e.g. the lack of a legal duty or the lack of plausible allegations sufficient to support the claim that the WHO's actions or inactions were a legal cause of the harm suffered).\n\n**Footnote Re Legal Basis For The Claim On The Merits**\n\n> It is unclear which statute is violated.\n\nIt would be unusual for a claim for personal injury to arise under a statute. Most claims for personal injury are brought on the basis of a common law claim of negligence which would arise from the case law of New York State's state courts in this case (pursuant to the *Erie* doctrine).\n\nA negligence claim has four canonical elements: \n\n1. The existence of a legal duty (normally the legal duty to use reasonable care to refrain from causing injury to others) of the defendant that runs to the plaintiffs.\n2. Breach of the legal duty by the defendant.\n3. The causation of the damages alleged by the breach of the legal duty by the defendant in a foreseeable manner.\n4.

The WHO likely lacks sufficient contacts with New York to establish either general or specific personal jurisdiction. The WHO's headquarters is in Switzerland, and its alleged actions or inactions regarding the coronavirus were not specifically directed at New York.\n\nD) While this could potentially be a reason for dismissal, it's not the most likely primary reason. The lack of personal jurisdiction is a threshold issue that would be addressed before considering the merits of the claim.\n\nThe case is most likely to be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction over the WHO.

The Texas state government enjoys sovereign immunity, except as specified under the [Tort Claims Act](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/docs/cp/htm/cp.101.htm). Under that law, immunity is waived only in the case of damage caused by negligence of a state employee, and is limited primarily to vehicle accidents and physical injuries. So the state cannot be sued for passing a law found to be unconstitutional. An individual would not enjoy such immunity, but given the law, there is no identifiable defendant to seek relief from (*everybody* is a potential defendant). An former abortion provider who now declines to perform an abortion can't be sued, because doctors in general have no obligation to perform particular medical procedures (most doctors in Texas *won't* perform an abortion, even before SB8\\), and the course will not render a judgment against a doctor on the grounds that they obeyed an existing law but should have known that it would be found unconstitutional.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: If the Supreme Court finds Texas SB8 (the six-week abortion ban) unconstitutional, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal relief for impacted parties?\n\nA) Women denied abortions can sue the state of Texas for damages under the Tort Claims Act.\nB) Abortion providers can seek compensation from individual citizens who reported them under SB8.\nC) Impacted parties have no realistic prospect for equitable relief due to sovereign immunity and the law's structure.\nD) Doctors who refused to perform abortions while SB8 was in effect can be held liable for damages.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that there is \"no prospect for equitable relief\" in this scenario. This is due to several factors:\n\n1. The state of Texas has sovereign immunity, which is only waived in very limited circumstances under the Tort Claims Act (primarily for vehicle accidents and physical injuries caused by state employee negligence).\n2.

About two years ago, my bathroom sink overflowed, and flooded her bathroom below it and part of her kitchen.

I got estimates from contractors, but did not schedule the work, because, at the time, I didn't have the money to pay them. In an association meeting last year, I brought up the fact that water enters the basement when it rains, and that we should get estimates to have the foundation repaired. She fronted me off, and said to take care of her condo drywall first. Actually, she did not want to deal with the foundation issues because of the expense.

One time, she did let me respond, and I said, \"As soon as I receive a repair bill,\" to which she screamed, \"You don't get a repair bill!!! You're not paying for the whole project, you're only paying $500\\...\" \n\nFast forward to this week's association meeting, which was over a year from the last one, even though we're supposed to have at least four meetings a year. She distributed minutes that she typed up from the last association meeting, in which she wrote lies about me regarding the flooding, and that were not discussed in the association meeting last year. She also said that I caused damage to her bathroom in another flooding incident, but never mentioned anything to me about it until several years after she had tile replaced, and said it costed her $1800\\. There are only six condo units, so to have a quorum to vote on anything, at least four voting members would have to agree. Only three showed up to the meeting, the President, another condo owner, and I. So, we just talked about what was going on, and she suggested raising the association dues, because expenses were going up. Both the other condo owner and I were in agreement, but since we couldn't vote, she planned to type up something and have at least four sign off on it later. \n\nHer spreading lies about me is fine.

That being said, the relation between \"*sign\\[ing] for \\[your] vote*\" and signing off on the president's minutes is unclear. Thus, these are separate issues requiring separate analyses.\n\nFrom your description, I gather that your vote only has to do with the question of raising the association dues, and that it bears no relation to her false statements about you. Although deciding your *vote* on the basis of her unrelated falsehoods seems pointless \\-\\-and perhaps retaliatory or vexatious\\-\\-, from a legal standpoint there is nothing wrong with you adopting that criterion.\n\nBy contrast, it would be detrimental for you to sign off on *minutes* that contain falsehoods about you. That is because your endorsement of the minutes might be used by her as \"evidence\" of your *admission* of liability in the event that she brings court proceedings against you regarding the pre\\-existing dispute (the one which prompts her to publish the falsehoods).\n\nThe minutes might strictly purport that *she said* those things about you, rather than you *having done* those things. Even in that case, signing off on the minutes without your rebuttal/clarification being reflected therein memorializes \\& can carry a defamatory import (in addition to the aforementioned evidence of admission).\n\nAccordingly, you might want to ensure that the dispute \\-\\-which she should not mix in her capacity of president\\-\\- and the vote are not so intertwined in her minutes.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A condominium association president has published false statements about a unit owner in meeting minutes.

It allows the unit owner to fulfill their responsibilities to the association by voting on important matters based on their merits, while also protecting themselves by refusing to endorse false statements in the minutes.\n\nOption D is an extreme measure that may escalate the conflict unnecessarily.

From what I have studied, the legal system adheres to the philosophy that criminals commit crimes via compatibilist free will. This, however, is from what I have pieced together from legal literature that I have read over the past 10 years. It seems to be a tenet that comes from the neo\\-classical school of criminology.\n\nI have yet to read some kind of Federal or State source that argues that compatibilist free will is presumed to be had by anyone who commits a crime. For instance, I might construe the appeal of Grayson v. United States to not touch upon findings of guilt but instead punishment, sentencing, and incarceration (as if whether or not a defendant had free will influences those aspects of a criminal case rather than influences a finding of criminal guilt).\n\nWhere in U.S. law is it officially argued that the U.S. criminal justice system presumes defendants commit crimes with free will?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is an unquestioned pre\\-American axiom, expressed in Latin as *actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea* (\"the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty\") which has been part of the Anglo\\-American legal system since at least the 17th century. It is thus presupposed in all criminal proceedings. It's not that a person only commits a crime with free will, it's that it is not deemed to be a crime if there is no free will. A person can be held at gunpoint and required to commit a criminal act: the person does indeed have free will to choose to be killed rather than commit the act, but the act is legally excused since dying is never held to be the only acceptable alternative to committing an otherwise\\-criminal act.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the relationship between free will and criminal culpability in the U.S. legal system?\n\nA) Free will is only considered during sentencing and has no bearing on the determination of guilt.\n\nB) The absence of free will is a defense that must be proven by the defendant to avoid conviction.\n\nC) Criminal guilt is predicated on the assumption that the defendant acted with free will, unless proven otherwise.\n\nD) Free will is not relevant to criminal proceedings and is not considered by the courts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The concept of free will is fundamental to the U.S. criminal justice system, as expressed in the Latin maxim \"actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea\" (the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty). This principle, which has been part of Anglo-American law since at least the 17th century, presupposes that individuals have the capacity to choose between right and wrong. The criminal justice system operates on the assumption that defendants act with free will when committing crimes, unless there are specific circumstances that negate this presumption (such as being forced to act under duress). This makes option C the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because free will is considered in determining guilt, not just in sentencing. Option B is incorrect because the burden is not on the defendant to prove the absence of free will; rather, free will is presumed unless evidence suggests otherwise. Option D is incorrect because free will is indeed relevant and considered in criminal proceedings as a foundational principle."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36701/am-i-required-to-re-attach-neighbours-gate-to-my-fence-post", "docs_id": 36701, "title": "Am I required to re-attach neighbours gate to my fence post?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I\u2019ve had my my fence replaced including new posts, which I\u2019m 100% sure is my my fence, post, and boundary.\n\nPreviously the neighbour\u2019s gate was directly attached to my fence post, I\u2019ve allowed it to be re\\-attached to the new post but was I legally required to do so?\n\nCould I have simply removed the gate and left it on their side of the boundary?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on who is [responsible](https://www.inbrief.co.uk/neighbour-disputes/ownership-of-fences/) for the boundary.\n\nIf they are responsible then you have done them a kindness by building a fence for them.

The fifth consideration is \"transformativeness\". W.r.t. purpose of the use, your use would likely be found to be \"fair\", except for the Youtube monetization problem.

There are therefore several interested parties: \n\n* The party that paid for everything\n* The person who filmed and edited the performance (the same person in this example)\n* The actors\n* The venue\n\nTo which of these parties (or any others) do rights belong in the recording and DVD? Do these rights differ if the DVD is (a) publicily sold for profit, (b) privately sold for profit (e.g. just to those associated with the production), (c) privately distributed for free?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It would literally take nearly a treatise to answer this question and it would still be more theoretical rather than practical, as the answer to this question will inevitably be one largely born of a variety of licenses and contractual agreements and will differ with each production. What follows is only an overview of the typical course of how these converging rights get addressed and parsed out.\n\nIn a stage play or a film, the producer(s) are the ones who fund or raise all the money without which the production would never come to fruition. They are the ones responsible for the underpinnings of all the manner of IP that goes into a production. As you (likely) know, the production will begin with a writing (the script), to which copyright originates with the author (unless the work is commissioned from the beginning). However, it is not always that a producer's vision begins with a pre\\-ordained screen or stageplay. It may begin with a book, or an article, or a short story, etcetera, that may then be transitioned into a piece that can be performed. This transition may or may not be created by the originating author; in the case of not, the built upon work would result in its own, new copyright.\n\nSo, while the producer may not be the author, or even responsible for the vision behind of the original idea for the screenplay, without their imagination, planning, and money \\- a film or stage project is unlikely to ever be....well....produced. Throughout the entire process, it is typical that the producer (actually, the producers' lawyers) will negotiate multiple agreements that define how the IP rights will be dispersed from inception to a project's completion. A production includes creative material that would, if created independent of the whole, give rise to numerous copyrights vested in a variety of individuals. This would be very messy to say the least, and would be untenable when the goal is one cohesive work when the final version is complete. Practically speaking, if everyone retained an individual copyright in their creative contribution, it would be analogous to each thread claiming responsibility if not ownership for the shape of the garment. \n\nWhen a production agreement is drafted, it will typically result in the final rights vesting in one entity (although not always); this, usually being the producer/production company, and from that agreement varying rights of remuneration will flow to the various contributing entities.\n\nWhile the producer/production company will *typically* own all the combined copyrights to a given production as a whole when the production is finalized, there will likely be licenses or limited copyrights retained for the explicit use of the parts in separate endeavors (eg. soundtracks or the right to perform a score one composed). Since the input of the various creative contributors will be used in the production of the whole, each contributor is remunerated in a variety of ways. This can be anything from the commissioning of a work whereby a lump payment creates the ownership of the copyright, to payments for the work as it occurs, to royalties for each time a work is viewed or sold in reproduced form, to partial ownership rights in the completed work (much more rare) or any combination of these things. \n\nThese agreements are foundational to any production, as without them, courts throughout the world have recognized, and alike failed to recognize, various copyrights in all manner of contribution. They (the agreements) arise out of the combined tenets of copyright and contract law, and are typically known as or referred to as chain of title documentation. This conglomeration of titles, licenses, contracts, copyrights, trademarks and so\\-on, are how this equation is resolved. It is different with each production, although there are formulaic ways of compiling these chains of titles\n\n(See: *From Script to Screen; What Role for Intellectual Property* at [http://www.wipo.int/ip\\-outreach/en/ipday/2014/ip\\_and\\_film.html](http://www.wipo.int/ip-outreach/en/ipday/2014/ip_and_film.html) as well as \n[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/copyright/950/wipo\\_pub\\_950\\.pdf](http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/copyright/950/wipo_pub_950.pdf) *Securing Rights* for a comprehensive discussion of the varying types of agreements producers need to negotiate.)\n\nJust think, each production, at minimum, has: a script, a variety of actors (who may have copyrights in their performances, separate from the scripted words), directors whose vision lends to the flow of the work, cinematography, costume designer and creators, make\\-up artists (if unique enough, their designs can hold copyright\\-for example a certain henna tattoo design), stage/set designers and creators, musical scores that were composed and performed (rights flow to each), and myriad other creations that go into a production. \n\nThese chain of title compilations are some of the most lengthy and complex commercial transactions arising under IP law, with so many moving parts to draft, negotiate, revise, renegotiate and finalize.
