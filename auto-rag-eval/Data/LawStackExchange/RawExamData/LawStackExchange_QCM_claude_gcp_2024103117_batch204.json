That is, it is not illegal to lie.\n\nExceptions include when you are under penalty of perjury (e.g. on oath in court), when you are making certain declarations to government (e.g. your tax return), you are acting dishonestly to cause gain or harm others (e.g. fraud), etc.\n\nHowever, by signing the document, you may create a legal fact that is independent of the real\\-world facts. For example, if you sign a receipt for $1,000 then you create a legal presumption that you received $1,000 even if there was actually only $500 in the envelope. You would need some pretty spectacular evidence to overcome that presumption.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t know what you are signing that has factual errors in it but, if they are material errors, don\u2019t.

He notices that the document contains an error regarding his employment history, stating he worked at a company for 3 years when it was actually 2 years. The hiring company insists he sign anyway. What is the most accurate statement about this situation?\n\nA) John can safely sign the document as it's not illegal to lie on job applications.\nB) John should sign the document, but inform the company verbally about the error to protect himself.\nC) John should refuse to sign the document as it contains a material error and could create legal complications.\nD) John can sign the document without consequences as long as he doesn't benefit from the error.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nC is the correct answer because signing a document with known factual errors, especially when it pertains to material information like employment history, can create legal complications. By signing, John would be creating a legal presumption that the information is accurate, which could be difficult to disprove later if needed.\n\nA is incorrect because while lying itself may not always be illegal, creating false legal records can have serious consequences, especially in employment contexts.\n\nB is not advisable because verbal clarification doesn't override a signed document, and John would still be legally certifying false information.\n\nD is incorrect because the potential consequences of signing a false document don't depend on whether John benefits from the error.

If you get it, great. Then you could do it with the owner's blessing.\n\nIt's possible to do your write up without the owner's permission, but then you have to be *much* more careful. For instance, the names of games cannot be copyrighted. No one can prevent you from writing \"A Guide to Bridge,\" or \"A Guide to Chess,\" etc. On the other hand, some games are *trademarked,* in which case you will need to attach a TM (trademark) symbol when referring to them. In this case, see a lawyer.\n\nYou are also allowed to discuss the game itself \"in your own words,\" but you must be careful not to \"plagiarize\" anything from the rules, or the official game description. That is, while you can refer to specific aspects of a game, such as building houses and hotels, the leash on copying is fairly short, as little as five words. This does not refer to five words in a common sequence referring to a single thought like \"The United States of America,\" but it could refer to five words in an original or unusual sequence such as \"I think therefore I am,\" by Rene Descartes, or \"X houses and Y hotels,\" where the numbers X and Y define the number of houses and hotels in a certain board game trademarked (I believe) by Parker Brothers.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A game developer is creating a guide app for a popular mobile game without explicit permission from the game's owner.

I have recently been told that when you are in traffic court there are no references to federal law and to try to use federal law would be considered \"pseudo law\" , or a sovereignty issue.

I am guessing I will be kicked off the site but I don't understand, because I am being told I can't use federal law when I have very effectively. So I am confused on how I win in court. Is it always a fluke ? Please don't consider this a rant. It is a legitimate legal question that I assumed was answered when a judge took a fix\\-it ticket and turned it into a $1200 ticket (because I was fighting it) and then apparently just gave me the win even though I was using the Federal Law from the USC Title 18 to define what a motor vehicle was in a State court. But I am not ranting, or upset at all. I'm just wondering, could a judge made such a simple mistake and cost the courts all that money ? Not the $1200, but to pay all the overhead of appearing 4 times and the warrant. Granted, I do believe my answer was PERFECT, I also know I could be wrong. And with my answer being pulled so easily, I must be missing something. I'm looking at 10 votes for an \"answer\" to this question, and yet it doesn't answer the question whatsoever. So if my question falls against this site, I apologize. That is not my intention. Please help me understand. Was my judge just uneducated?\nThis question cannot be answer simply by claiming the question is frivolous. That would be absurd. I think I need to make this point , I have successfully used this in court, and it's a good thing that we all can because some judges (1 in particular) would stoop so low as to say neither \"the United States Constitution nor the Supreme Court rulings matter in court since California is not a state\". When in fact The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution Under the Supremacy Clause, found in Article VI, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, both the Constitution and federal law supersede state laws.\n\nThe Federal law being applied is the United States code definition of Motor Vehicle, what shows that the state laws are in direct conflict with the Constitution and the federal laws. And no State can take a right and turn it into a crime and issue a license and a fee for it. In a sense saying that you can have your right if you pay us for it. That would not be a right.\nA couple other important points that may clear up some \" answers \". When the case is called, I tell the judge I am here in propria persona speaking for the named defendant, all I say is for the record and I invoke art. 4 sec. 4 of the Constitution which guarantees me a Republican form of Government. Im not a US Citizen but an American National (non statutory citizen) and I set my court. When I asked him if it was civil or criminal, he said \"you tell me\". I said it can't be either since there is no injured party and no contract.\nI believe that locks the court up.\nThey cant throw statutory at me because there is no written rule for a criminal case thats statutory jurisdiction and so I couldnt have a fair trial.\nAlso by using the Constitution and Supreme Court cases that say I have the right of motion /travel then I would have a perfect case for willfulness. Immunity.\nFailure to show a cause of action in which relief could be granted.\nAs far as I can see, all the rules I am using are theirs.\n\nThe right of the citizen to travel upon the highway and to transport his property\nthereon, in the ordinary course of life and business, differs radically and\nobviously from that of one who makes the highway his place of business for\nprivate gain in the running of a stagecoach or omnibus.\" State vs. City of\nSpokane, 186 P. 864\\.\nWhat is this Right of the Citizen which differs so \"radically and obviously\" from one who\nuses the highway as a place of business? Who better to enlighten us than Justice Tolman of\nthe Supreme Court of Washington State? In State vs. City of Spokane, supra, the Court also\nnoted a very \"radical and obvious\" difference, but went on to explain just what the difference\nis:\n\"The former is the usual and ordinary right of the Citizen, a common right to all,\nwhile the latter is special, unusual, and extraordinary.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is true that in the US, valid Federal law supersedes state law or regulation when there is a conflict. Precisely because of this, state laws and regulations are normally carefully written to avoid such conflicts.\n\nIt is very unusual for a federal law issue to apply in traffic court. The question does not say what Federal law issue you think will apply to your case. Most issues where Federal law might plausibly affect a state court process, such as a fourth amendment violation on a search and seizure issue, would not apply in traffic court, although they might apply in a criminal court proceeding. Federal law does not generally deal with traffic issues, nor does it preempt state traffic laws, because there is normally no conflict.\n\nThere is a group of people, who often call themselves [\"sovereign citizens\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement) who have a habit of making wildly invalid legal claims, and trying to claim that much of the law does not apply to them. Such people often assert elaborate theories about why certain laws do not apply, not infrequently involving the Federal Supremacy Clause. Such claims are invalid, and will not be received well by a court. A claim that one travels by \"conveyance\" rather than by \"car\" and thus state laws do not apply is such an invalid claim.\n\nThe argument made in [this answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61251/no-blinker-in-a-left-turn-lane-is-it-illegal/61313#61313) is such an invalid claim. Chapter 18 of the US code does regulate commercial vehicles to some extent. Therefore **in that chapter** \"motor vehicle\" does mean \"commercial vehicle\" because those federal regulations do not apply to private vehicles. This does **not** mean that state regulations that apply to private vehicles are preempted or otherwise invalid.\n\nIf you think a Federal Issue will apply during a traffic court session, it would be wise to consult a lawyer in advance. Many lawyers offer free or low\\-cost initial consultations.\n\nIf you think a relevant legal issue is not being addressed, politely, briefly, and clearly explain the issue that you think applies.

State traffic laws are typically carefully crafted to avoid conflicts with federal law, making the defendant's argument likely invalid. While it's true that federal law can supersede state law when there's a direct conflict (due to the Supremacy Clause), this is very uncommon in traffic court cases. Most traffic regulations fall under state jurisdiction and do not conflict with federal statutes.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because federal law does not always supersede state traffic laws; it only does so in cases of direct conflict, which are rare in traffic matters.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because this is not a commonly accepted or valid legal strategy. In fact, such arguments are often associated with \"sovereign citizen\" theories, which are not recognized as legitimate by courts.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while traffic courts primarily deal with state laws, they are still bound by applicable federal laws and the U.S. Constitution.

The EULA grants the user the right to use the product so prior to entering into the agreement the user has no right to use it to begin with.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The user gains the use of the software, the EULA issuer gains the limitations on how the user of the freeware will use it, that for example, prevent the freeware user from exploiting the issuer's labor by reusing it for profit.

In this scenario, even though the software is free, the EULA can still be considered a legally binding contract because the company gains something of value - limitations on how the user can use the software. This serves as consideration, which is a key element in forming a contract. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the software is free, so there is no monetary compensation involved. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the EULA typically grants new rights to the user that they didn't have before, not rights they already possessed.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because not all EULAs are automatically considered contracts; they need to meet certain legal requirements, including consideration.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that even if consideration were absent, the doctrine of promissory estoppel could potentially make the agreement enforceable if the user reasonably relies on the terms of the EULA.

The LLC needs to hire a licensed lawyer to do that.\n\nThe general rule is that entities may not represent themselves \"pro se\" through non\\-lawyer officers and must have a licensed attorney represent them in any court matter (in practice, a court will usually allow an officer or manager to write a letter to the court asking for a brief extension of time to a deadline to obtain a proper lawyer, even though that is logically inconsistent). If an entity does not hire a lawyer, a default judgment will enter against it.\n\nIn other words, a CEO or manager or managing member of a company isn't allowed to speak for it in court. This rule is almost universal in the world of legal systems descended from English common law, although sometimes there are narrow statutory exceptions.\n\nThe manager of an LLC is a person to whom legal process may be directed to begin a lawsuit, but that isn't the same as representing the LLC in court.\n\nWyoming does have an exception to the general rule for small claims court cases at Wyoming Statutes \u00a7 1\\-21\\-202(b), which states: \n\n> Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 33 of the Wyoming\n>  Statutes, in small claims court, the state, governmental entities,\n>  natural persons, corporations, partnerships, associations or other\n>  organizations may litigate actions on behalf of themselves in person\n>  or through authorized employees, with or without an attorney, provided\n>  that if an attorney appears, the opposing party is entitled to a\n>  continuance for the purpose of obtaining an attorney of its own.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that small claims court only governs claims of $6,000 or less, and only in cases where the Plaintiff has elected to file a suit using small claims court procedures.\n\nI note that this question is tagged \"small claims court\" but it isn't clear from the circumstances set forth in the question whether this is merely a claim for a small amount of money or is truly a claim that was filed using the special small claims court procedures in which an attorney is not required.\n\nWyoming Statutes \u00a7 33\\-5\\-101 et seq. is the law regulating attorneys which prohibits the unauthorized practice of law that is the basis for the general rule at Wyoming Statutes \u00a7 33\\-5\\-117 which states:\n\n> It shall be unlawful, and punishable as contempt of court, for any\n>  person not a member of the Wyoming state bar to hold himself out or\n>  advertise by whatsoever means as an attorney or counselor\\-at\\-law.\n\nThis statute isn't perfectly clear on its face, but is understood to codify the universal common law rule so it isn't ambiguous in any way.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Wyoming, a small LLC is being sued in a regular civil court (not small claims) for $10,000.

Under their theory, natural laws require only that individuals do not harm others, do not damage the property of others, and do not use \"fraud or mischief\" in contracts. They say that all people have two parts to their existence \u2013 their body and their legal \"person\". The latter is represented by the individual's birth certificate; some freemen claim that it is entirely limited to the birth certificate. Under this theory, a \"strawman\" is created when a birth certificate is issued, and this \"strawman\" is the entity who is subject to statutory law. The physical self is referred to by a slightly different name \u2013 for example \"John of the family Smith\", as opposed to \"John Smith\".\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington tried and convicted Kenneth Wayne Leaming for retaliation by making false claims and wrote:\n\n> Defendant \\[Kenneth Wayne Leaming] is apparently a member of a group loosely styled \"sovereign citizens.\" The Court has deduced this from a number of Defendant\u2019s peculiar habits.\n> \n> \n> First, like Mr. Leaming, sovereign citizens are fascinated by capitalization. They appear to believe that capitalizing names has some sort of legal effect. For example, Defendant writes that \"the REGISTERED FACTS appearing in the above Paragraph evidence the uncontroverted and uncontrovertible FACTS that the SLAVERY SYSTEMS operated in the names UNITED STATES, United States, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and United States of America . . . are terminated nunc pro tunc by public policy, U.C.C. 1\\-103 . . . .\" (Def.\u2019s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 2\\.) He appears to believe that by capitalizing \"United States,\" he is referring to a different entity than the federal government. For better or for worse, it\u2019s the same country.\n> \n> \n> Second, sovereign citizens, like Mr. Leaming, love grandiose legalese. \"COMES NOW, Kenneth Wayne, born free to the family Leaming, \\[date of birth redacted], constituent to The People of the State of Washington constituted 1878 and admitted to the union 22 February 1889 by Act of Congress, a Man, \"State of Body\" competent to be a witness and having First Hand Knowledge of The FACTS . . . .\" (Def.\u2019s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 1\\.)\n> \n> \n> Third, Defendant evinces, like all sovereign citizens, a belief that the federal government is not real and that he does not have to follow the law.

The lawyer is presumably either an employee of the agency, or has the agency as a client. In any case, this is notice of the position that the agency would be likely to adopt if you took further legal action, such as a suit to compel disclosure.\n\nLawyers provide such position statements ion behalf of clients or employers all the time. Such statements indicate why certain action is taken, what basis the client or employer has for taking or not taking certain action, and often indicate the nature of the defenses or theories that will be used should a lawsuit follow, although the client or employer is free to change the theory at the pleading stage.\n\nNot only is it not unethical for the lawyer to respond in this way, the agency is, I am fairly sure, **required** by the law to provide a valid reason when a request is declined.

However, there are exceptions for items that have a legitimate purpose and for which the carrier has a \"reasonable excuse.\" \n\nIn this case, John, as a cricket player returning from practice, has a legitimate reason for carrying a cricket bat.

Still, if you poisoned an ecosystem your guilt should be provable and you would be condemned no matter the number of lawyers.\n* Intimidating your opponent with the number of your lawyers to make them concede to a extrajudicial solution.\n* It's just a code for bribing the judges.\n\nBut none of those would explain this phenomenon properly. Is it even a real thing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are times when having a large law firm work on a case can be an advantage.\n\nIt is rare for the number of lawyers working on a particular case to be more than three or four plus a few paralegals, even in a case where there are virtually unlimited resources at a party's disposal.\n\nIn those cases, the primary benefit of having a large law firm at your disposal is that by paying top dollar for those attorneys, you may (but certainly don't always) get particularly competent attorneys at firms that have good systems in place.\n\nIf you are willing to spend the money you can also have the attorney and paralegal team work exhaustively to leave no stone unturned in terms of legal research, style and proofreading, \"wild goose chase\" factual and legal research of matters like trial court arguments from other cases that the opposing counsel has participated in, and trial presentations with lavish presentation quality.\n\nFor example, in one case where my firm was litigating against a large law firm in state supreme court arguments, the firm had seven law firm partners who had served as clerks in that court earlier in their careers participate in mock oral arguments to help the appellate lawyer who would be presented the case in oral arguments to the Colorado Supreme Court prepare (with four members of your core team and seven mock justices plus some paralegals participating this was a $5000\\+ per hour activity).\n\nA typical run of the mill appellate brief prepared competently might take 100 hours, while a large firm might devote 800 hours to the same task (both of these are hypothetical round numbers suggested just to get the point across).\n\nThis incredibly intense working up of cases, moreover, often involves attorneys who aren't really starting from scratch as they has handled many similar cases before in their careers, while their smaller firm competition may have only encountered the issues presented for the first time.\n\nYou are also paying for connections and experience. For example, a large law firm may have an easier time retaining the most decorated expert witnesses to argue on their behalf. These attorneys may also have handled numerous cases in front of the judge or judges who will be deciding the case (and if they haven't someone else in the large firm probably has) and thus can better predict what approach will be received best by that particular judge.\n\nThe exception to the rule that the maximal economies of scale are reached with a quite small group of lawyers is that in addition to this core group of lawyers, some cases, such as class action lawsuits, or cases involving complex transactions (e.g. construction project disputes in a large project with hundreds of contractors) may require an immense amount of factual discovery in the trial court in the form of depositions of dozens or hundreds of people with relevant knowledge, and/or review of vast volumes of documents (e.g. I've had several cases with whole rooms stacked floor to ceiling with relevant documents in banker's boxes).\n\nIn cases like those, you need an army of senior paralegals and junior attorneys to interview witnesses, take depositions and review and summarize documents to get to the bottom of the factual matters needed to prove a case.\n\nThe down side of this approach, however, is that it is extremely expensive relative to the alternatives per task, and frequently impossible to recover your costs and attorney fees from the other party, perhaps because they aren't permitted to be awarded, perhaps because a judge would find some or all of your fees and costs to be unreasonable, or perhaps because the other side simply can't afford to pay them.\n\nSo, using a firm like this really only makes sense if the stakes involved are very high, or if there are long term strategic reasons to litigate. Spending $1,000,000 on attorneys' fees and costs is a very expensive way to litigate a $100,000 one off dispute. But spending $1,000,000 on attorneys' fees and costs is perfectly sensible if there is $100,000,000 in controversy in the case at hand, or if a favorable outcome will influence the outcome of a large number of future disputed of the same type.\n\nThe other dirty little secret is that lots of the work done by large law firms for which their clients pay an immense amount of money isn't done very well. One inherent down side of being large is that a large law firm is bureaucratic and prone to the kinds of mistakes that all large organizations have, for example, in diffusing responsibility for mistakes that can allow mistakes to fall through the cracks. Also, while the typical large law firm lawyer is typically more knowledgable than the typical small firm lawyer about the field at issue, this doesn't always happen. Sometimes junior attorneys get assigned too much responsibility on cases in areas where they have blind spots in their knowledge, and sometimes a large firm attorney ends up working a case due to personal connections with the client rather than because that attorney is the most qualified person in the firm to handle it.\n\nAlso, while some very brilliant lawyers do indeed work at large law firms, technical competence isn' the only consideration in hiring. Successful large firm lawyers need to be team players, need to conform and function well in a large bureaucracy, and need to have the social capital to be comfortable on a day to day basis with the firm's other lawyers and their affluent and big business clients. Many large firm lawyers have those soft skills while having only competent rather than excellent legal acumen.\n\nFurther, since most large law firm lawyers go straight from law school to a big firm (sometimes with a detour clerking for a judge for a couple of years), and large law firms handle mostly very big cases that are usually settled by lead attorneys before going to trial, most large law firm attorneys aren't particularly experienced at trial work. Some large law firms compensate for that by laterally hiring former prosecutors, former criminal defense lawyers and former high volume personal injury litigators to do that work, but often, large law firms have few lawyers in the courtroom with much trial experience relative to how many years they have practiced law.

One of those business people would like their name removed from the system. Okay we remove it. But what is to stop the community from creating it again? It seems there would have to be an endless cycle of adding/removing/adding/removing\\-request etc.\n\nThe reason is, say you actually delete all traces of the user's record \"Jane Doe, jane.doe@gmail.com, @janedoe\". Then someone goes to add a new person, \"Jane Doe, @janedoe\". We don't know that was a previously removed person, to prevent from being added again. So that's conundrum 1\\.\n\nThe next conundrum is, say we have a hidden internal database of previously deleted people, so we can match against when people try to add new people, and prevent them from adding existing people. First off, there is no real simple way of being able to tell that \"Jane Doe, @janedoe\" and \"Jane Doe, jane.doe@gmail.com, @janedoe\" are the same person. Perhaps they deleted their email address and someone else with the same name took it up. Or many other reasons it would be hard to tell. So we can't really prevent in that way.\n\nBut we also still have this hidden internal database of previously deleted users. We need sufficient data for each user to know which users have been deleted, so we can optimally remove new users with the same identifying pieces of info. So then now it's basically, we have a private and a public database of users, the private one used to maintain security but requires detailed user info, and a public database that has whatever info we choose to make public.\n\nAlso, having the \"deleted user database\" could be a security hole, whereby users try creating random addresses and usernames, until they get \"locked out\" of one of them, knowing they discovered a deleted account which must be a real account.\n\nSo I don't really see a clear way to actually delete people's data in such a community\\-driven site, do you?

Proof, in a scientific or mathematical sense, is something that is irrefutable and conclusively proves the point unless the assumptions it is based on are proven false. Evidence, on the other hand, is merely something that tends to make a fact at issue in the case more or less likely to be true. (Paraphrasing Federal Rule of Evidence 401, which determines relevant evidence)\n\nTrying to create proof that would be irrefutable such as proof of original authorship is very difficult. But amassing a bunch of evidence is usually pretty easy and often what wins court cases. If you offer a hand\\-written and dated ledger entry that you created a work on a certain date, and you testified to its veracity in order to get it properly admitted at court, you would likely have more proof than most people for many crucial facts in court cases. Unless there is a reason to suspect the entry is fraudulent, then often the other side won't be allowed to opine that it might be fraudulent. In civil trials, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, however the plaintiff only needs to persuade by a standard of \"more likely than not\" or to put it another way 51% of the evidence. If your evidence shows that you most likely created the work, simply saying the evidence might have been faked isn't usually enough to get the defendant into a winning \"less likely than not\" analysis of the situation.\n\nI have seen court cases won on the file system date in a computer, which are pretty easy to tamper with, but absent a reason to suspect tampering, was treated as strong evidence of the date of a document. You can certainly improve from that low threshold of proof, so I wouldn't go overboard trying to document your discovery in a way that is foolproof.\n\nRegistration is required in order to file suit, but you don't need to do until you are aware of an infringer.

The passage emphasizes that while it's difficult to create irrefutable proof of authorship, amassing various pieces of evidence can be effective in court. It mentions that even seemingly simple evidence like dated ledger entries or file system dates can be persuasive if there's no reason to suspect fraud. The text also notes that registration is required to file a suit, but it's not necessary for initial creation and can be done later when aware of infringement. This supports the idea that multiple pieces of evidence, even without official registration at the time of creation, can collectively support an authorship claim.

Are there any international laws on that, or does it depend mostly on the laws of the countries involved? I do know that there have been some polls about regions changing state in the past (e.g. the [1919 poll in Vorarlberg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksabstimmung_1919_in_Vorarlberg)), but I don't know of a recent one and I don't know of any successful ones.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So generally, when a region of a nation tries to break away and form a new nation or join a nation, it's acceptance as a nation is generally based on the **Diplomatic Recognition** of other Nations. This can either be *de facto* or *de jure*, with the former acting in a manner of having some acknowledgement of a government of a territory, while a *de jure* recognition typically is stronger with embassies, consulates, and treaties between the two nations. For example, the United States has *de jure* recognition of France and vice versa, while they merely have *de facto* recognition with Iran (They recognize there is a government of the territorial area known as Iran, but they feel that the current government is illegitimate and refuse to engage with it in diplomatic relationships. Iran similarly knows there is a United States, but refuses to recognize it for political reasons as well.). When two nations do not have *de jure* recognition they will often appoint another nation \"Protecting Power\" who will act as a representative of the appointing nation in the nation they do not recognize. Currently, the Swiss Embassy in Iran has an office dedicated to U.S. affairs as it is the Protecting Power of the United States in Iran. Iran has asked Pakistan to have the same duties. And before you ask, yes, it is the geopolitical equivalent of two people in the same room not speaking to one another, but telling a third person to give the other person a message (U.S.: Switzerland tell Iran that they will give us back our citizens who are being held in their jail cells or we will drop bombs on them. Switzerland: *rolls eyes* Iran, the U.S. says they want their guys back or they will bomb you. Iran: Oh yeah? Tell U.S. 'Death to America!' Switzerland: *eye roll* They said... U.S.: Already routing the bombers!)\n\nIf a region is claimed by more than one government, than it becomes disputed territory. Presently China has a lot of disputed territory with its neighbors and Maritime neighbors. Ongoing disputes include territories also claimed by India, Bhutan, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and The Philippines. Interestingly, the dispute with Taiwan is over who is the real government of China... Taiwan claims much of the other disputed territory China does... plus some territories which China has resolved disputes over.\n\nThe Russia\\-Ukraine situation will likely leave the territory in question (The Donbas and Crimea Regions) listed as disputed. Generally, disputed territory doesn't mean nations cannot be friendly, as the United States has a number of territorial disputes with Canada, despite being very strong diplomatic allies (with the single largest land boarder between two nations in the world, disputed territory was bound to happen). Perhaps the most interesting is the now resolved dispute of the San Juan Island in Washington State.

I am having a dispute with my landlord over the deposit, which is lodged with the DPS (I checked, it is).\n\nThe dispute is over a gas hob. The hob is controlled by plastic nobs, one of which I broke while cleaning.\n\nMy ex\\-landlord believes that this means the hob is now unsafe and unusable. She wants to replace the whole hob with a new one, and charge us for it.\n\nI think this is absurd, because:\n1\\) The hob was not new when I moved in two years ago, let alone now. Buying a new hob is not mitigating her losses.\n\n**edit: clarification regarding above \\-\\- I'm no lawyer. But it's my understanding that if the hob is indeed broken, I only have to pay what it was worth at the moment before it was broken. If it was only as good as a second hand hob going for e.g. \u00a340, then \u00a340 is what I have to pay. As I said I'm no lawyer, so please advise me if I am mistaken. I also believe, per number 2\\) below, that the hob can be economically repaired in any case**\n\n2\\) I do not accept that there is anything wrong with the hob apart from the absence of one plastic knob which could be easily replaced.\n\nThe landlord is also contending that one of the taps is 'jammed down' and can't be turned. I don't know what she means by that, except that I was able to turn them. One of them was stiffer than the others, but I do not think that is as a result of me removing and replacing the knobs to clean the hob.\n\nI asked the landlady who says the hob is unsafe, and she said 'the gas inspector'.

This is made clear in s 21 of the [Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0108/latest/whole.html#DLM294165), which says \"the occupier...**may** seize and impound any stock trespassing on the land.\" A quick search finds no sections of the Act *requiring* an occupier to impound trespassing cattle. So it seems *Bob is free to send the cattle on their way,* at least under the *Impounding Act.*\n\nHowever, liability for cattle and cars is also covered by the *\"Animals Law Reform Act of 1989\\.\"* The two subsections of *\"[Section 5](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0097/latest/whole.html#DLM191765)\"* of that Act appear to broaden the class of people who could be held liable for damage \u201ccaused by an animal straying onto a highway.\u201d *Neither subsection explicitly mentions the owner.* Instead, both talk about the \"person\" who is liable. The first, s 5(1\\) says the part of the common law that \u201cexcludes or restricts\u201d \u201cthe duty that **a person** might **owe to others to take reasonable care**\u201d to prevent damage no longer applies in New Zealand. The second, s 5(2\\), says a court must determine \"whether **a person** is *liable...for damage* caused by an *animal straying onto a particular highway...*\"\n\nGiven that *Impounding Act* explicitly says \"owner\" not \"person,\" common sense suggests the use of the word \"person\" rather than \"owner\" in the *Animals Law Act of 1989* means that Act allows others besides the owner to be held liable for damages. Whether New Zealand courts agree, and whether they have interpreted the \u201cAnimal Laws Act\u201d in a way that would include Bob is a matter of fact that can only be answered by someone who knows New Zealand law.\n\n**Added: Something fun to read**\n\nLaw professor Robert Ellickson studied how people actually resolve disputes over wandering cattle in Shasta county in northern California.

The Impounding Act of 1955 allows Bob to remove the trespassing bull from his property, which might suggest he's not liable. However, the Animals Law Reform Act of 1989 introduces broader liability.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Animals Law Reform Act of 1989 doesn't limit liability to just the owner.

The Animals Law Reform Act of 1989 uses the term \"person\" rather than \"owner\" when discussing liability for animals straying onto highways. This suggests that both the owner (Rob) and the person who pushed the animal onto the street (Bob) could potentially be held liable.

Such a judgment *might* only be vulnerable to appeal, but in no way to judicial discipline / misconduct investigation. If not successfully appealed, it becomes case law \u2014 binding on all inferior courts. Where rights of appeal do not exist (e.g. the court is the top court in its jurisdiction), the judgment becomes set\\-in\\-stone law \u2014 until cancelled either by the same court or via legislation.\n\nSo, let's consider the same example as in [that](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51084/can-it-be-judicial-misconduct-to-not-rebut-arguments-of-losing-party) question, but more specific one:\n\nBob contends:\n\n> I am right and Rob is wrong because blablabla... 2\u00d72\\=4 ...blablabla.\n\nRob defends:\n\n> No Bob is wrong, because blablabla... and 2\u00d72 actually equals 5\\.\n\nBob replies:\n\n> But look, lets see what 2\u00d72 equals to \\[math proof follows]. It is 4, you see.\n\nThe judge says:\n\n> I accept Rob's contention that Bob is wrong because 2\u00d72\\=5\\. Bob has no case.\n\nSo, the judge implicitly rejects the math proof that 2\u00d72\\=4 (as their Honour \"*does not have to address every argument raised in their judgement*\") and, effectively, makes it case law that 2\u00d72\\=5\\.\n\nIs this scenario technically/legally possible? Would the case law that 2\u00d72\\=5 stand for some time?

Appellate courts generally focus on matters of law, not fact. They would likely examine the legal reasoning and principles applied in the case, rather than the specific mathematical claim. The mathematical error might be grounds for appeal, but if not challenged, the legal principle behind the decision could potentially become precedent. However, future courts would not be bound to accept the mathematical error as fact. Options A and D are incorrect because they overstate the binding nature of the factual claim.

I'm never allowed into the store.\n\nSo it appears to me that this website is denying me access to their business services, my account, and the funds on my account for one reason: because they don't like the way I look.\n\nIs this legal for them to do to their customers?

The website is not discriminating based on the user's appearance or personal characteristics, but rather responding to the user's action of using Tor Browser. This is analogous to a business asking for ID and denying service if proper identification isn't provided. The use of Tor is detectable and businesses can choose to restrict access based on this, similar to how physical businesses can enforce dress codes or \"no shirt, no shoes, no service\" policies.

However, it uses Google Ads to attract visitors.

I assume that if tracking data is connected to an individual, the individual gave their consent to that by signing up to a Google. The only thing the snippet does is telling Google's servers when a conversion takes place and that somehow they do some cross\\-site tracking.\n\nIs running the Google Ads snippet something that visitors of my website should consent to, before I do this?\n\nMy assumption for now is that disclosing this in a privacy statement should suffice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are responsible for what data is being processed by your website. When you embed third party components on your website (e.g. iframes, scripts), you are at least jointly responsible with the third party providing these components. You are only responsible for what happens on the website (i.e. what processing is under your control), not for what the third party provider does with collected data on their services. However, note that information will be transferred to Google's servers regardless of whether the visitor has a Google account! The *Fashion ID* case is relevant case law establishing and explaining these points.\n\nSince you are (jointly) responsible, you need a legal basis for collecting personal data through the tracking snippet and sharing it with the third party (here Google). For example, the legal basis could be a *legitimate interest*, or could be *consent*. A legitimate interest requires that you balance this interests against the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject (the site visitor). If the data subject wouldn't reasonably expect this tracking, you cannot rely on a legitimate interest. Consent can always work, except that it is a freely given, informed opt\\-in \u2013 likely unsuitable for conversion tracking. Which legal basis to use is primarily your responsibility.\n\nYou argue that the tracking snippet does not collect personal data. However, this argument is not well supported. Under the GDPR, personal data does not only include directly identifying information such as an email address, but also any information \u201crelating\u201d to an identifiable person. Identification includes the ability to single out someone, e.g. by a browser fingerprint. For purposes of conversion tracking, Google will clearly try to collect data that allows the visitor to be singled out, thus collecting personal data. Furthermore, specific kinds of information are regulated by the ePrivacy directive. This includes \u201ctraffic data\u201d and \u201cinformation stored on a terminal device\u201d, regardless of whether this information is personal data under the GDPR. Under ePrivacy, such information can only be used as strictly necessary to provide the service requested by the user (and conversion tracking is not strictly necessary), or when the user gives their consent. Depending on what information is collected by the tracking snippet and on whether you are subject to ePrivacy, you would have to collect consent anyway.\n\nThere is also the issue that Google Ads is an US\\-based service, and transferring data to the US is largely illegal since the 2020 Schrems II ruling. The US do not provide an adequate level of data protection, so that transfers would require additional safeguards. Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for Controller to Controller transfers are not sufficient by itself. Of course those extra safeguards are effectively impossible to implement and no one is doing this correctly, but it's worth considering that there is additional legal risk. Explicit consent can provide a legal basis for transfers even to a country with inadequate protections, but that mechanism is intended for occasional transfers.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n* you have wrongly concluded that no personal data would be involved\n* you are jointly responsible with Google for whatever data is processed by the conversion tracking snippet\n* you need a legal basis for sharing this data with Google\n* legitimate interest may be sufficient, depending on what data is involved (consider ePrivacy) and depending on the result of your legitimate interest balancing test\n* alternatively, you may require every visitors consent to track their conversions \u2013 unlikely to result in good data\n* additionally, such use of Google Ads may run into issues around international transfers due to the Schrems II ruling\n* this kind of stuff is difficult, and no one is really doing this correctly :/", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner uses Google Ads conversion tracking on their site.

Is a press release a privileged and/or trademarked document with ownership rights?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the press release is copyrighted from its inception and may have been work for hire (a close call since you wrote them for an LLC and the LLC had a deal with them). There is a copyright in someone, although the absence of a copyright notice limits the remedies available for infringement.\n\nSecond, a link is not a copyright violation.\n\nThird, copyright protects an exact manifestation of an idea or description of a fact, not the idea or fact itself.\n\nFourth, there are two different doctrines that could protect an exact copy of a press release.\n\nOne of two doctrines, which applies if the press release has been released to the public, is an implied license. Press releases are meant for the general public and reprinting them when that is their intended purpose is an implied grant of permission. In the same way, if you have an unfenced front yard to a concrete path leading to your front door, anyone who wishes to meet with you has an implied license to walk up to your door and knock. Whether this implied license can be revoked or not is a harder question.\n\nThe other of the two doctrines, which is not limited to press releases that have been released, is \"fair use\". In this situation, when the work was short, has been released to others, has limited literary value, transmits unprotected facts relevant to you, relates facts that may also be a matter of public record (the sale anyway), and you aren't trying to profit from the text of the press releases themselves just from the facts that they convey, the case for fair use is pretty decent even though this is a business use.\n\nUltimately, however, to be squeaky clean and avoid litigation, you can link rather than regurgitate the press releases, and can write your own statements about the facts in them from scratch.\n\nThis information is not privileged or trademarked. \n\nIf you didn't sign a non\\-disclosure agreement (NDA) or if they were released to the public, they aren't subject to trade secret protection either.

It often has jurisdiction over America's largest financial institutions and prosecution of white\\-collar crime and other federal crimes. Because of its age and influence, it is sometimes colloquially called the \"Mother Court\" or the \"Sovereign District of New York.\" The district has had several prominent judges on its bench, including Learned Hand, Michael Mukasey, and Sonia Sotomayor, and many of the U.S. Attorneys for the district have been prominent American legal and political figures, such as Elihu Root, Henry L. Stimson, Robert Morgenthau, Rudy Giuliani, James Comey, Michael J. Garcia, and Preet Bharara.\n\nAs to the topic of extraterritorial jurisdiction, that is generally a feature of certain acts of congress.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The consumer owns the physical device and can typically use it in any way that doesn't violate copyright laws or circumvent copy protection schemes.\n2.

Keep in mind its a college leasing company so they do require a guarantor. I was planning on using the same guarantor as the previous years, but they did not support my move so they decided not to sign the lease this time around.

The developer (whom i will call D) has not asserted that the code successfully performs any particular function, and has not sold or delivered it to any particular customer or user.\n\nNone the less a reader R does download the code, compiles it, and runs the resulting binary, thereby arguably infringing D's copyright. R finds the code not to work as R had expected, and R sues D for damages on an implied warranty theory. Could R win such a suit?\n\nWell this may depend on the particular laws of the country or jurisdiction where R brings suit, and the question does not specify that.,\n\nIn the US one possibly relevant law would be the [Magnuson\\-Moss Warranty Act of 1975](https://www.findlaw.com/consumer/consumer-transactions/warranty-laws-and-the-magnuson-moss-warranty-act-.html) ut this act applies only to \"written warranties on consumer products costing more than $10\\.\" As D makes no charge for the code, and provides no warranty at all, the Act weill not apply to D.\n\nThe page [\"Be Wary of Warranties for Software Design \"](https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2018/08/be-wary-of-warranties-for-software-design) from Jones Day discusses the California Commercial Code and the Song\\-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Act imposes an implied waranty if there is any express waranty. The page reads:\n\n> **Implied Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Purpose**  \n> \n> This implied warranty comes into play when the software supplier knows of the buyer's particular purpose for purchasing the software and knows that the buyer is relying on the supplier's skill and judgment to provide suitable software.\n\nSince there is no purchase here, this does not seem to apply.\n\nThe Jones Day page also reads:\n\n> **Implied Warranty of Merchantability**  \n> \n> This implied warranty, as its name suggests, promises that the software meets the standards of performance expected by merchants in the trade.

The information states that while a California court could potentially rule against the employee based on the NDA's governing law clause, \"a Californian court has no power to enforce a legal judgment in India.\" To enforce any judgment, Company B would need to \"file suit in an Indian court to enforce the judgment against you.\" This extra step of having to file a separate lawsuit in India to enforce a California judgment represents a significant challenge for Company B in terms of time, cost, and legal complexity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the NDA was signed and is considered binding, regardless of where the employee resided. \n\nOption B is incorrect because California courts do not have direct jurisdiction over Indian residents - they would need to go through Indian courts to enforce any judgment.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the information indicates the employee did sign the NDA, even if they didn't fully understand or consider its implications at the time."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/88465/does-a-tenured-professor-whose-salary-was-set-to-0-have-a-case-for-constructive", "docs_id": 88465, "title": "Does a tenured professor whose salary was set to 0 have a case for constructive dismissal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: See [https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202302/rnoti\\-p196\\.pdf?adat\\=February%202023](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202302/rnoti-p196.pdf?adat=February%202023)\n\nThe head of the Purdue math department set a tenured professor\u2019s salary to 0\\. This seems very strange to me and I have two questions.\n\nFirst, does this violate minimum wage laws?\n\nSecond, is this constructive dismissal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Without commenting on the relatively strange situation itself, it is still useful to actually read what was actually said than what was described in a letter from a third person, even if the relayed information is technically true.\n\nThe supposed basis for the claim of a zero salary is from an email allegedly sent by the department head ([appendix 15](https://web.math.princeton.edu/%7Ecf/DonnellyAppendices.pdf)):\n\n> In short, you are not teaching in 2022/2023 and you have not submitted the required outline of\n> your research or other engagement. I am very sorry that we cannot establish that you will be\n> doing any work expected of a faculty member. Thus we cannot pay you. Starting with the Fall\n> semester, your pay will be reduced to zero and you will be placed on unpaid personal leave.\n\nEssentially, the professor is being put on an unpaid leave because allegedly he is not doing any work. Consequently, minimum wage laws are not engaged even if the professor is not exempt as teachers since he is not being required to do any work.\n\nIn the U.S., employers generally can do this (unless a work contract provides otherwise); in many circumstances, it is called being laid off (though the term has attracted a permanent connotation in parts of North America) or being suspended.\n\nAn indefinite unpaid leave can be considered constructive dismissal if the employer does not reasonably allow the employee to return to work. It may not be constructive dismissal if the unpaid leave is prescribed by binding employer policies or because the employee refuses to work (and the employer allows the employment relationship to continue). Even if it is constructive dismissal, it is not automatically wrongful.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Professor X, a tenured faculty member at a university, is informed by the department head that their salary will be reduced to zero and they will be placed on unpaid personal leave due to not performing expected duties. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) This action definitely violates minimum wage laws and constitutes illegal employment practices.\n\nB) The university's action is legally permissible only if Professor X is classified as an exempt employee under labor laws.\n\nC) This situation could potentially be considered constructive dismissal, but it depends on various factors including the university's policies and Professor X's response.\n\nD) The university's action is always considered wrongful termination, regardless of the circumstances or Professor X's performance.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the given information. The situation described could potentially be considered constructive dismissal, but it's not a straightforward case. Several factors need to be considered:\n\n1. The university's action of placing Professor X on unpaid leave doesn't necessarily violate minimum wage laws, as the professor is not being required to work during this period.\n\n2. The legality of the action doesn't solely depend on the professor's exempt status, as suggested in option B.\n\n3. Whether this constitutes constructive dismissal depends on factors such as:\n   - The university's policies regarding unpaid leave\n   - Whether Professor X is genuinely not performing required duties\n   - If and how the university allows Professor X to return to work\n\n4. Even if it is determined to be constructive dismissal, it's not automatically wrongful, contrary to what option D suggests.\n\n5. Option A is too definitive and doesn't account for the nuances of the situation.\n\nTherefore, C is the most accurate answer as it acknowledges the potential for constructive dismissal while recognizing that the determination depends on various factors specific to the case."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25145/literal-support-definition", "docs_id": 25145, "title": "Literal Support Definition", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the context of patent disclosure: What is the nuanced meaning of **Literal Support**?\n\n[Link to passage using the term Literal Support](http://www.fr.com/files/Uploads/attachments/muenchen/presentation4.pdf)\n\n> Written Description \u2260 Literal Support \u201cThe test ... is whether the\n>  disclosure of the application as originally filed reasonably conveys\n>  to the artisan that the inventor had possession at that time of the\n>  later claimed subject matter, rather than the presence or absence of\n>  literal support in the specification for the claim language. ... The\n>  content of the drawings may also be considered ...\u201d\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Literal support means that the words of the claim are identical to words in the description. It does not have any particular nuanced meaning.\n\nThe purpose of that presentation is to demonstrate that the requirements for written description in the US go far beyond literal support. That is, even if the claims are replicated in the description, that is not enough to satisfy the written description requirement (or indeed, the enablement or best mode requirements).\n\nIn fact, the presentation you link to includes a nice quote from *In re Kaslow*, 707 F.2d 1366, 217 US PQ 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1983\\):\n\n> The test ... is whether the disclosure of the application as originally filed \n>  reasonably conveys to the artisan that the inventor had possession at that time of the later claimed subject matter, rather than the presence or absence of literal support in the specification for the claim language.\n\nLiteral support therefore does not have much place in US law.\n\nHowever, historically, countries inheriting their patent system from the UK had a requirement for fair basis, where the claims had to be fairly based on the description. For example, the now superseded [Patents Act 1949 (UK) s 4(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/87/section/4) provided:\n\n> The claim or claims of a complete specification must relate to a single invention, must be clear and succinct, and **must be fairly based on the matter disclosed in the specification**.\n\nThis was a low bar, and literal support (where the wording of the claims are identical to words in the description) would be sufficient (though not required). This gave rise to the practice of having consistory clauses, where the claims were literally copied into the summary of invention section. However, most (or possibly even all) countries have moved on to a support requirement now. Yet the practice of consistory clauses lives on.\n\nLiteral support also appears in some guise in European law. [Art 123(2\\) EPC](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2016/e/ar123.html) provides:\n\n> The European patent application or European patent may not be amended in such a way that it contains subject\\-matter which extends beyond the content of the application as filed.\n\nThis is often imprecisely glossed as a requirement that the wording of an amendment must appear verbatim in the description as originally filed. That is, an amendment is generally allowable if it has literal support in the application (and does not otherwise impermissibly combine embodiments and the like). In practice though, literal support is only one factor for compliance with Art 123(2\\) EPC, and is neither necessary nor sufficient on its own.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the concept of \"Literal Support\" in patent law across different jurisdictions?\n\nA) In US patent law, literal support is the primary requirement for satisfying written description, enablement, and best mode requirements.\n\nB) Literal support means that the words of the claim are identical to words in the description, but its significance varies across jurisdictions.\n\nC) The European Patent Convention (EPC) strictly requires literal support for all amendments, making it both necessary and sufficient for compliance with Article 123(2).\n\nD) Historically, the UK's fair basis requirement under the Patents Act 1949 mandated literal support between claims and description.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because US patent law emphasizes that written description requirements go beyond mere literal support, as evidenced by the quote from In re Kaslow.\n\nOption B is correct. It accurately defines literal support and acknowledges its varying significance across jurisdictions. In the US, literal support is not sufficient for written description, while in European practice, it's a factor but neither necessary nor sufficient on its own for Article 123(2) EPC compliance.\n\nOption C is incorrect. While the EPC Article 123(2) does address amendments, it doesn't strictly require literal support. The passage states that literal support is \"often imprecisely glossed\" as a requirement and is actually only one factor for compliance.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The UK's fair basis requirement under the Patents Act 1949 did not mandate literal support. The passage states that literal support would be sufficient but was not required under this provision."}}
