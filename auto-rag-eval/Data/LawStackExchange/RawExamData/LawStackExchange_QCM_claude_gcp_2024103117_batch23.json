According to the information provided, the homeowner cannot legally demand compensation for voluntarily mowing the lawn of the adjacent property. The decision to maintain the neighboring lot was made by the homeowner without any agreement or request from the city or the property owner. In legal terms, this is considered a voluntary act, and generally, one cannot claim compensation for services that were not requested or agreed upon. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the city did not request this service and is not obligated to pay for voluntary actions of citizens. \n\nOption B is unlikely to succeed because unjust enrichment typically requires that the defendant (property owner) knowingly accepted the benefit, which may not be the case for an abandoned property.\n\nOption D is incorrect because liens are typically used for contracted services or legal judgments, not for voluntary maintenance of another's property.\n\nThis question tests understanding of property law, voluntary acts, and the limits of seeking compensation for unsolicited services."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43676/freedom-of-speech-in-court-defendant", "docs_id": 43676, "title": "Freedom of speech in court (defendant)", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Based on the example of [Ed Rosenthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Rosenthal) there's something about freedom of speech that's puzzling me:\n\nAccording to the article and to what I've read about the case, a **defendant** in court has been **denied** the right to even **say** that what he did was legal under state law. \n\nIn my personal opinion this looks like an outright violation of freedom of speech, because I can't think of any reason why a **defendant** should be in any way restricted as to what he is allowed to **say**. Being allowed to **say** anything doesn't force anyone (judge/juror) to believe that it's **true** and obviously there're good reasons for example to force witnesses to only say the truth, because their freedom of speech quickly conflicts with the defendant's right for a fair trial should they be allowed to lie.\n\nI'd like to know the explanation for this as I'm sure there is one, though it's not obvious for an \"outsider\" like me.

For a person charged under the laws of, say, India, it cannot be in any way relevant what the laws of, say, China have to say about the issue.

In a federal criminal trial, state laws are irrelevant to the charges being tried. The courtroom is not a forum for unrestricted speech, but rather a place to resolve specific legal disputes. Testimony is limited by rules of evidence, primarily relevance. Information about state laws would not be relevant to federal charges and could confuse the issues at hand. Therefore, the judge is correct in preventing such testimony.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because freedom of speech is not unlimited in a courtroom setting. The rules of evidence and procedure take precedence over general free speech rights in this context.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the judge is not showing bias, but rather applying standard rules of evidence and relevance.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because preventing irrelevant testimony is not related to protecting against self-incrimination.

As established in cases like Saenz v. Roe, restrictions on this right are subject to strict scrutiny. While public health during a pandemic could potentially qualify as a compelling state interest, the state would still need to prove that the border closure is narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means to achieve that interest. A complete border closure would likely fail this test, as there are less restrictive alternatives (such as quarantine requirements or health screenings).

The heir will be required to pay, and the creditor can use the usual channels (reminders, collection agencies, court judgements) to make them pay.\n\nHowever, if the inheritance is \"under water\" (has more debts than assets), there are ways to avoid having to pay the debts:\n\n* In Civil law jurisdictions, acceptance of an inheritance usually means being liable for all the debts, too. Details vary between jurisdictions \\- in Germany, for example, acceptance of an inheritance is automatic, and a heir must file a document to refuse it (this is called **disclaiming the inheritance**). In France, in contrast, the default is to disclaim the heritage, but certain interested parties (such as creditors) can require a heir to formally make a choice, then the default is acceptance ([https://www.service\\-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1199](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1199)).\n* In contrast, in the United States (which generally uses [Common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law)), creditors are paid first, and the heirs only inherit what is left, in a process called [probate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probate). In that case, a heir need not explicitly disclaim an inheritance that is \"under water\" \\- they will simply not inherit anything. Note that the heir may choose to inherit certain debts in exchange for keeping certain assets \\- for example, if a home with a mortage is part of the inheritance, the heir may either choose to sell the home and pay the mortage, or keep the home and accept the mortage as debt.\n\nNotes:\n\nEven if inheritance is not automatic, the system usually allows a heir to disclaim it. There are other reasons for disclaiming an inheritance apart from debts, for example tax advantages, or the desire to grant the inheritance to a different relative.\n\nIf a heir disclaims the inheritance, no matter the reason, the inheritance automatically passes to the next heir in line. If all potential heirs disclaim in turn (as would typically happen if the inheritance has more debt than assets), the inheritance will usually fall to the state. Then, the assets will be divided up among the creditors (similar to insolvency proceedings). As an exception to the rule above, the state does not have to pay outstanding debts \\- so that money would be lost for the creditors.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Civil law jurisdiction, a person passes away leaving behind an estate with more debts than assets.

However, when an estate has more debts than assets (is \"under water\"), heirs have the option to disclaim the inheritance to avoid liability for the debts. In many Civil law countries, such as Germany, acceptance of inheritance is automatic, and heirs must formally file a document to refuse it (disclaimer). This is in contrast to Common law jurisdictions like the United States, where option D would be correct due to the probate process.

The folks over at Music Theatre International seem to have a much better handle on the situation. [Their website describes](https://www.mtishows.com/about-licensing) the difference between the licensing model for a theatrical production and that for a single song:\n\n> Grand Rights vs. Small Rights:\n> \n> \n> The rights that MTI is able to grant under our contracts with the authors are limited to \"Grand Rights.\" Grand Rights cover the right to present the show, in its entirety, on stage. These rights do not include performance of a single song or medleys (\"Small Rights\"), videotaping, use of a logo or merchandising. In some instances, MTI has separately negotiated representation of additional rights, but those are administered on a show\\-by\\-show basis.\n> \n> \n> \"Small Rights\" is a term used to cover performances of individual songs in a concert or cabaret\\-type setting. There are three major agencies that control these rights in the U.S.: SESAC (Society of European Stage Authors and Composers), ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Author and Publishers) and BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc.) Depending upon the songs that are being performed, licenses may be required from one, two or all three of these organizations for a single presentation. Most schools, churches, restaurants and clubs pay an annual fee to obtain a \"blanket license\" from these licensing agencies that covers the \"small rights\" use of all music in their respective catalogues for the year. Note that these blanket licenses DO NOT permit dramatic performances of songs. The songs can be performed only in cabaret style. While it is sometimes difficult to draw a distinction between dramatic and non\\-dramatic performances, a dramatic performance usually involves using a song to tell a story or as part of a story or plot. A blanket license permits neither the use of dialogue from the show nor sets, costumes and/or choreography that invoke the original show.\n\nIn general, you need permission to make an arrangement and you need permission to perform it. Whether you're making money or not may affect the likelihood of being given permission, and it may affect the amount of the license fee, or it may not. Copyright does not exist to prevent you from making money with other people's compositions; it exists to ensure that the composers get to make money \\-\\- or decide for themselves not to \\-\\- when you perform their music.\n\nYour school may already have a blanket license with for example ASCAP that would cover a public performance of the song.

That is, TV channels that you get into your TV through having a once\\-ordinary (not sure people still have such things at all) antenna, either inside on the TV or outside on top of your house, which picks up \"normal radio signals\".\n\nBasically, these TV channels seem to be much more regulated and a much bigger \"deal\" in most places compared to \"satellite TV\" and \"cable TV\".\n\nWhy?\n\nAs I understand it, \"satellite TV\" is just like an antenna except the signal comes from a satellite in space rather than a tower standing on the ground. So *maybe* I can understand that, but still, you need a decoder to decode the signal, and that decoder has to be sold and owned by the person viewing satellite TV, so why not include that in the law?\n\nWhy specifically \"over the air\" TV? Is it because it's always unencrypted/unscrambled? (I'm not even sure that's always the case...)\n\nIn the case of cable TV, I assume that this means that you physically have a cable going under the ground all the way from the broadcasting station to your TV. Why is *this* less \"regulated\" than over\\-the\\-air TV? Seems to me as if cable TV is even *worse* than over\\-the\\-air TV in terms of requiring the local authorities' blessing, since you need to dig down cables and still use a decoder (maybe). Whereas over\\-the\\-air TV is literally invisible radio signals requiring no digging of any cables whatsoever.\n\nThis has always confused me both on a legislative and philosophical level. Please explain.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Over\\-The\\-Air\" or \"Broadcast\" television refers to Television that is propogated from a broadcast television over Radio Waves between 52 and 600 MHZ which puts this in the very high frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) spectrums and are line of sight propagation (typically placing the signal at 40\\-60 miles from the broadcast tower.\n\nLegally speaking, radio frequencies are \"public commons\" and are thus owned buy the government, similar to territorial waters vs. international waters (because no one lives Under The Sea but the law of the government encompasses them, it's a common trust managed by the government). Since there are only so many radio frequencies at any one time, and it's line of site the government will licenses corporations to use specific channels (granting them a \"right of way\"). However, because it's the government's radio station and you're just using it, in order to get those licenses, you had to meet some rules requirements and regulations.\n\nTypically, this is what is permissible to broadcast (You must have so much time devoted to news, so much time to educational programming, and cannot say certain things before a certain point in time called \"Watershed\" in the U.K. From 2100 to 0530 and \"Safe Harbor\" in the U.S. from 2200 to 0600\\. All times are military time.). Other restrictions (at least in the U.S.) include rules that limit some channels so they don't accidentally overpower each other. Typically this is achieved by alternating broadcast areas over even number channels and neighbor regions will be given odd number. In addition to changing which of the 10s you use and blocking out the 30s completely (in North America, the 30\\-40 range signals are reserved for radio telescopes).\n\nFor example, when I was growing up I was in the Baltimore Broadcast area, and because of station location, was able to get signals from Baltimore affilates and some D.C. affiliates as both were within the 40\\-60 mile range (it's 40 miles as the crow flies) as a kid, ABC was 02 for Baltimore and 07 for DC, so neither signal covered each other. (other double affiliates were Fox (05 in DC and 45 in Baltimroe) and PBS (26 DC and 67 Baltimore (and because of placement, 22 in Annapolis.) This lead to the weird thing where if you wanted something different on PBS and it was a clear night, 22 and 67 would have the same show, but 26 might give you an option. Unfortunately Pledge week was pledge week.).\n\nThis problem does not exist in cable or satellite (Dish) because the way the signals are sent are over infrastructure that is not publicly owned or in the \"commons\". The cable company may contract with a city or municipal government to lay down their lines, but the city doesn't own the line, the cable company does. Satellite will own the satellites that beam the signals down to the receiving dish.\n\nNow the question becomes why Cable or Dish programing aren't more naughty or risque and, well, back when it was new, it was a major selling point for the consumers. You could put all the swearing and nudity on that as well as movies where you might have to cut the naughtier scenes. But when you're making a television show, up until relatively recently, your goal was to get onto a Broadcast network that wasn't PBS (traditionally, the big three are ABC, CBS, and NBC. Fox (not Fox News) was the \"fourth\" with WB (now CW) being the 5th. A sixth in the form of UPN did exist, but it was folded into WB to make the CW and no longer exists and even in its heyday, was really a dumping ground for syndication shows that wasn't cable.\n\nGetting your pilot picked up by the \"Big 3\" networks (Or Fox, once X\\-Files was a hit and later WB/CW) was the goal for all TV productions so while you could make seedier content for cable, until very recently (the late 00s or early 10s) cable wasn't where you wanted to be. That said Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad could not exist on Broadcast.\n\nNow again, there was \"Safe Harbor\" but there were two problems... You had one hour before each network went to the Nightly News (2300\\) so you had 7 hours a week to get it in (and nobody wants their show on Friday or Saturday). From 2330 until about 0130 it was late night talk shows (With a \"late show\" followed by a \"late late show\") and after that was normally the sign off for a few hours until the morning, usually 5, which is when the farmers got up and they needed some market and weather info, so it was the AM news... though these days, there's more profit in infomercials selling the wee hour viewers miracle knives and exercise equipment they won't us.\n\nSuffice to say, you had a very narrow window... what's more, unlike the UK, which has earlier \"Watershed\" and uses it, the U.S. also has 6 time zones to the U.K.'s one, and Safe Harbor is based on local time (otherwise it would be 2200 in New York, 1900 in L.A. and 1700 in Hawaii, 1800 and (if you want to get technical about it) 1400 tomorrow afternoon in Alaska (Technically the part of Alaska west of the dateline are still Russian and nobody lives there, but Alaska time is so wibbly\\-wobbley that even Dr. Who won't go near it.). So the rule is broadcast is according to local time so. NYPD Blue famously got it's network into trouble for showing naughty content in Safe Harbor on the East Coast... but U.S. TV normally gives the time at 10/9 Central (and Pacific) which means it wasn't Safe Harbor the next time zone over and thus net some hefty fines. Cable/Dish only recently broke through this by writing shows that were sold only to channels that would air the naughtiness on cable and just happened to net that network a lot of attention, but it's too little too late as most viewers are \"cutting the cord\" and ditching cable/dish for streaming services which they pick up ala carte for specific shows and ditch if there is nothing on until the next season of favorite shows can come on.\n\nAll this stacks that even on cable and dish, and even on Cable, the big shows that get talked about are still keeping in relatively tame taboos because most writers are still just now branching out of comfort zones to put some more adult material in their shows... And some shows (especially legacy shows that survive a jump from safe TV standards to no rules) will still have the expectation of lacking some obscenities from fans (Don't expect Patrick Stewart to swear like a sailor in Star Trek: Picard, one of the few naval traditions that didn't make it to Starfleet).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why over-the-air television is more heavily regulated than cable or satellite TV?\n\nA) Over-the-air TV signals are always unencrypted and unscrambled, making them more accessible to the public.\n\nB) Over-the-air TV uses radio frequencies that are considered public commons and managed by the government.\n\nC) Cable and satellite TV companies have more advanced technology that doesn't require government oversight.\n\nD) Over-the-air TV reaches a wider audience and therefore needs stricter content controls.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Over-the-air television is more heavily regulated because it uses radio frequencies that are considered part of the public commons and are managed by the government.

The police officer chose not to ticket or arrest the child, likely considering factors such as the child's age and potential public backlash.

For example the fifteenth amendment \"prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's 'race, color, or previous condition of servitude'.\" [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\n\nHowever I can't find any positive statements of who gets the right to vote, or any mention of who decides that. I assume that because the tenth amendment gives the powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people, that this is up to the states to decide.\n\nTechnically, Duncan's bill doesn't actually prohibit San Francisco from making this law, it just imposes very coercive penalties for doing so. The case of [South Dakota v. Dole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_v._Dole) lays out five criteria for considering if withdrawal of federal funds is unconstitutionally coercive. The last criteria is \"The condition must not be coercive.\" The debate around this fifth criteria seems to center on how much money is being withdrawn. This question might hinge on whether San Francisco gets enough money to count as \"irresistable pressure.\"\n\nI have a somewhat tenuous chain of logic laid out here. Any one of the links could be flat out wrong, or I could be just completely missing the point.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [National Federation Of Independent Business v. Sebelius](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf), the court addressed the matter of withholding funding, with respect to obligatory expansion of Medicaid, where ACA required states to expand Medicaid coverage, or lose all federal Medicaid funds. The effect, as described in the ruling was \"\\[t]he threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State\u2019s overall budget\", which constitutes \"economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion\", and \"The Medicaid expansion thus violates the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their existing Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion\". A law which withholds *more* than Medicaid funding would therefore clearly be at least as coercive as ACA.\n\nIt is some interest that the ACA ruling put specific comparative numbers on the effect of the highway funding law underlying SD v. Dole, which they decided was \"less than a half a percent\" of the state budget. In contrast, in the case of Medicaid funding, their estimate was that Medicaid costs are about 20% of a state's budget, and the federal government pays 50%\\-80% of that. That means, picking low numbers, the effect of withholding Medicaid funding would be about 10% of a state's budget. The line between persuasion and coercion then seems to lie between .5% and 10%.\n\nThe presumably introduced bill is [here](https://jeffduncan.house.gov/sites/jeffduncan.house.gov/files/documents/Eliminating%20Foreign%20Intervention%20in%20Elections%20Act.pdf), for reference. The core paragraph is \n\n> (a) None of the funds made available in any Act may be used to \n>  make payments to any unit of local government that permits \n>  individuals who are not citizens of the United States to \n>  vote in elections for State or local office.\n\nHowever, the introductory clause identifies the purpose as being \n\n> To prohibit Federal payments to a unit of local government  \n> \n>  that allows individuals who are not citizens of the United  \n> \n>  States to vote in elections for State or local office, and  \n> \n>  for other purposes.\n\nThe substantial difference is that propositions are not offices: the bill introduces ambiguity in legislative intent (the words of the statute say one thing, the potentially enforceable sections introduced into US Code say something else). The bill does not define \"unit of local government\", so we could search for existing definitions of that term. [31 USC 6701](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/6701): primarily \"a county, township, city, or political subdivision of a county, township, or city, that is a unit of general local government as determined by the Secretary of Commerce for general statistical purposes\" (I don't think school, fire, hospital and water districts count).

Sebelius provides guidance on when withholding federal funds becomes unconstitutionally coercive. The Court found that withholding over 10% of a state's budget (in the case of Medicaid funding) was coercive and unconstitutional. They contrasted this with the earlier South Dakota v. Dole case, where withholding less than 0.5% of the state's budget was not considered coercive. While the Court didn't set a precise threshold, they indicated that the line between persuasion and coercion lies somewhere between 0.5% and 10% of a state's budget.

Further, there is no right of either spouse to be cashed out in circumstances where the property is not sold.\n\nPartition Actions\n=================\n\nEither spouse could bring a \"[partition action](http://www.lonestarlandlaw.com/Partitions-of-Texas.html)\", however. The right of either spouse to do this is essentially absolute in the absence of an express (probably written) agreement to the contrary. An waiver of a right to partition would occasionally be contained in a mortgage, although most mortgages don't contain a waiver of partition rights.\n\nFor some kinds of real property, a partition action is accomplished by the in kind division of real property between joint owners. But, that option is not generally available for a single family home.\n\nInstead, if either party demanded a partition of the residence, the house would be sold pursuant to court order and the net proceeds would be distributed to the parties according to their interests in the property, which would ordinarily be 50\\-50, but might entail an unequal distribution if, for example, one spouse used separate property to make significant improvements or renovations to the property.\n\nA court ordered partition sale, when it happens, is a transfer that would constitute a default under the mortgage, making it immediately due and payable out of the proceeds from the sale.\n\nIn practice, this almost never happens and instead, couples with disagreements so great that it would push them to bring a partition action would instead get divorced and have the residence handled as one asset among many in a divorce.\n\nBut, in principle, it could happen, for example, in the case of an estranged couple that has a shared moral objection to getting divorce (e.g. they are devout Catholics) who also don't want to get a full blown legal separation that is not a divorce. Or, it might happen if a guardian and conservator of an incapacitated and institutionalized spouse needed funds for medical treatment and had no other options and didn't want to seek an actual divorce or legal separation.\n\nAlternatives To Partition Actions\n=================================\n\nIn lieu of a partition action there could be a legal separation or divorce, but this seems to be precluded by the intent of the OP.\n\nThis said, nothing prevents spouses from voluntarily partitioning property or cashing out a spouse's interest in property by a mutual agreement which is suitably documented.\n\nOne spouse could also probably sell their undivided one\\-half interest in the property to a third\\-party, if they could find one (in reality an unrelated third\\-party would almost never agree to such a sale). But, this would also violate the terms of the mortgage making it immediately due and payable in full. How the mortgage payment would be satisfied would be tricky \\- the selling party might have to satisfy the entire mortgage out of the proceeds of the sale of their one\\-half interest at closing, subject to some sort of obligation upon subsequent partition or sale of the property for the other spouse to take a charge against the proceeds of a later sale.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a community property state like Texas, a married couple owns a house together.

According to the documentation, while there's generally no obligation for one spouse to cash out the other from community property real estate, either spouse can bring a partition action.

For a single-family home, this would likely result in a court-ordered sale of the property and division of the proceeds.\n\nOption A is incorrect because one spouse cannot unilaterally force the sale without legal action.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the spouse does have a legal recourse through a partition action, even if the other spouse doesn't agree.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while technically possible, selling half the property to a third party would violate the mortgage terms, making it immediately due and payable in full."}, "18": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9136/what-does-it-mean-to-enter-property-in-the-massachusetts-trespass-statute", "docs_id": 9136, "title": "What does it mean to &#39;enter&#39; property in the Massachusetts trespass statute?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The Massachusetts trespass statute reads (emphasis mine)\n\n> part IV, Title I, Chapter 266, Section 120\n> \n> \n> Section 120\\.

Whether or not this would violate the criminal statute you state is going to be a fact specific inquiry.\n\nIn the case I cited above, the court held that a crane moving something over someone\u2019s land was not *criminal* trespass.

So if a rocket lands in your back garden \\& crushes your schnauzer, it would be up to the Foreign Office to take it up with the PRC.\n\nIf Wikipedia is to be believed, the only time such a claim has been filed under this treaty is when the Soviet satellite [Kosmos 954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954) crashed in the Canadian Arctic in 1978\\. In that instance, the location was remote and the satellite was nuclear\\-powered, resulting in substantial cleanup costs.\n\nYour options to bring suit on your own, without the assistance of Dominic Raab, are limited. As a general rule, governments have [state immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_immunity) from suit in the courts of other countries (i.e., if you tried to sue the goverment of China in a UK court), and [sovereign immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity) in their own courts (i.e., if you tried to sue the government of China in a Chinese court.)

The Space Liability Treaty of 1972 establishes a procedure for states to bring claims against each other for damages caused by space objects, but this is done at the governmental level. In this scenario, it would be up to the UK government (specifically the Foreign Office) to take up the claim with China on behalf of its citizens. The individual has no direct legal recourse and must rely on their government to pursue compensation through diplomatic channels established by international space law treaties."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70463/the-refusal-of-a-public-body-to-allocate-a-male-due-to-not-having-a-male-worker", "docs_id": 70463, "title": "The refusal of a public body to allocate a male due to not having a male worker, would this be discrimination or...?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Bob requested, from the public service company dealing with child issues, the presence of a male employee as he felt discriminated and intimidated with the way the female employees were leading meetings and there was never a male with them.\n\nWhen requesting this, the female employees started to laugh at Bob and an employee said there are no male employees available in the whole region and Bob can meet only with women.\n\nBob asked why there are no male employees.

I don't really see the point of all the trouble if I'm not actively engaging in illegal activities on my machine, but for now I'm more interested in rather or not such a hidden partition is as foolproof as these individuals claim; specifically would it really render any law enforcement powerless to do anything.\n\nWithout going too deep into the technical factors involved the idea is to have another partition (ie part of the computer reserved to install and run software on) where the partition is both encrypted and not listed in the boot sector, where partitions are usually stored. The net result is a hidden partition, no one can see or access it without using some special boot technique, such as using a CD or thumb drive to change how the computer boots up, to connect to it. if you don't plug in your magic thumb drive before you start your computer then in theory it would be impossible to tell you have another hidden partition or connect to it.\n\nI know enough about computers to know this hidden partition isn't quite as foolproof as claimed, as inferring the existence of a hidden partition shouldn't be impossible on a technical level. The fact that a large part of the computer isn't allocated, effectively preventing use of part of your computer's storage, should be enough to make an analyst at least suspect a hidden partition may exist, doubly so if someone mostly used their hidden partition so that their visible partition was rarely used or too small to be useful. Once a hidden partition is suspected some analysis of 'randomness' of the 1 and 0 on the unallocated space could be used to provide extremely strong evidence that there was encrypted data saved there, with a very large area of encrypted data in turn being very suggestive, but not definitively prove, that a hidden partition is being used.\n\nSo say that a suspected criminal, who used one of these hidden partitions, had his computer confiscated. Let's further say the polices' technical folks are on the bar and noticed the evidence which strongly suggests, but could never definitively prove, that the suspect was using a hidden partition. The police would, of course, like to get access to this hidden partition to see if anything incriminating is saved on it, but their going to need the magic thumb drive to view anything saved on it.\n\nI suspect the police could not compel the criminal to hand this over directly, as the evidence, no matter how suggestive, would not be be absolute proof that the hidden partition existed. Though if the police were able to find some other proof of a hidden partition, such as conversations the suspect had with someone where the suspect refers to his use of such a partition, they may be able to meet a sufficient burden of proof to compel the suspect to make the content of the partition available to them?\n\nWould there be any other options that the police may have to deal with such a suspected hidden partition which may contain incriminating data? The two obvious ones I could think of are:\n\n1. getting a second search warrant to allow them to search for the thumb drive used to connect to the partition. I imagine that they only need reasonable suspicion of a hidden partition to get a more extensive search warrant? Though I doubt that would be too useful since a criminal would presumably destroy such a device immediately after their computer was confiscated to prevent police from getting hold of it?\n2. Could the mere (strongly suspected) presence of a hidden partition be used against the suspect? for instance in a criminal trial could the prosecutor argue the fact that the suspect was apparently going to great lengths to make it impossible to see what he was using his machine for as evidence that the suspect likely was doing something unlawful with the machine?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> ***Though if the police were able to find some other proof of a hidden partition, such as conversations the suspect had with someone where the suspect refers to his use of such a partition, they may be able to meet a sufficient burden of proof to compel the suspect to make the content of the partition available to them?***\n\nThe US courts have [ruled on this](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/appeals-court-upholds-constitutional-right-against-forced-decryption), and the answer is \"no\":\n\n> San Francisco \\- A federal appeals court has found a Florida man's constitutional rights were violated when he was imprisoned for refusing to decrypt data on several devices.

The [Communications Act 2003 section 127](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/127) likewise does not define \"grossly offensive\", meaning that it has it's ordinary meaning. Something is offensive if people are offended by it (the number or nature of the people so offended is not part of the meaning of offensive), and \"grossly\" is an intensifier suggesting that many people are offended, or people are highly offended.

The US taxes its citizens on worldwide income regardless of residency, which creates a baseline tax obligation.\n\n2. The UK has relatively high tax rates, especially for high earners.\n\n3. India has progressive tax rates that can be quite high for large incomes.\n\n4. Norway also has high tax rates, particularly on higher incomes.\n\nWhile all options include the US (due to citizenship-based taxation), the other countries in option A generally have higher tax rates compared to those in the other options. Singapore and Mauritius (in option B) are known for lower tax rates. Germany and Spain (in option C) have high taxes, but may offer more generous relief under double taxation treaties. Sweden (in option D) has high taxes, but the combination with other countries may not result in as high a total rate as option A.\n\nIt's important to note that the actual highest rate would depend on specific circumstances, income levels, and the intricate details of tax treaties between these countries.

If there are some countries that are known to or expected o not recognize Web Wed marriages, I would appreciate the clarification.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n* I am aware of the new laws (sometimes temporary) put in place because of Covid\\-19 restrictions, but I am not asking about that. Web Wed claims that they have been arranging weddings since 2015, so apparently their legal framework has nothing to do with the temporary Covid\\-19 provisions. My question is about if Web Wed as a specific company provides legally recognized services (with or without Covid\\-19 allowances).\n* Web Wed explicitly claims that their arrangements are NOT proxy marriages, so my question is about the legality of the alternative approach that they take.\n* I am hoping for answers more specific than generic \"this is not possible\" responses without knowing Web Wed's specific approach (such as the answers offered to [Quora's question on the same topic](https://www.quora.com/Is-webwed-site-that-marries-people-online-legit), not posted by me).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: According to an article in *Bride's* [\"Zoom Weddings Are Now Legal!\"](https://www.brides.com/virtual-weddings-legal-new-york-4842735) dated April 2021,several states including California, New York, Ohio, and Colorado have made **temporary** arrangements to make it legal for weddings to take place over video conference in response to the pandemic. Several also permit remote applications for marriage licenses.\n\nAccording to the June 2021 article [\"Is it legal to have a virtual wedding?\"](https://wedfuly.com/is-it-legal-to-have-a-virtual-wedding/) from *Wedfuly* states permitting such weddings include New York, California, and Illinois. However, in Florida, Hawaii, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas the article says that both parties to the wedding, and the officiant must all be physically present in the same place, although the wedding may be displayed on video for people at other locations.\n\nAccording to the *New York Times* article [\"Why Virtual Weddings Are No Longer Legal in New York\"](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/nyregion/legal-virtual-weddings-marriages.html) dated July 16, 2021, on June 25, 2021 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo **ended** the executive order he originally issued in April 2020 allowing couples to be married online.\n\nAccording to that NYT article new legislation would be required for such weddings to be legal in New York again.\n\nOther states might cancel or change their temporary rules allowing \"virtual\" weddings at any time. The New York decision apparently came as a surprise, causing a number of scheduled weddings to be canceled or changed to in\\-person events. One planning such a wedding would do well to check current rules in the state involved.\n\nCitizenship or permanent residence should not matter to the validity of such weddings, as it does not matter for in\\-person weddings. However, it seems that both parties and the officiant must all be physically present within the same US state or other jurisdiction for the marriage to be valid.\n\nNot all countries recognize the validity of such \"virtual\" marriages. It is specifically mentioned that the UK does not.\n\nAlso, it seems that while such weddings were lawful in New York, the temporary rules required that both members of the couple, and the officiant, be physically within the state of New York for the wedding to be legal. Other states seem to have similar rules.\n\nIf the members of the couple are not in the same state, it seems that the wedding becomes a [\"proxy wedding\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_marriage). This is a process where one person is not present at all, but is represented by a \"proxy\". Proxy weddings have been lawful far back in history, at least as far as the middle ages in Europe, and perhaps farther. They are currently lawful in only a few US states. According to the Wikipedia article linked above these are: Texas, Colorado, Kansas, and Montana. Such weddings are invalid in all other states. Some of those states limit proxy marriages to active members of the US Military on deployment.\n\nThe service *Web Wed* seems to claim that members of a couple may be located anywhere or the virtual wedding, but this appears incorrect. They also claim a patent on some forms of this process, and seem to say that they are the only legitimate provider of virtual weddings, but the articles linked above quote various officiants and services that have performed hundreds of such marriages.\n\nUnder the \"full faith and credit\" clause of the US Constitution, marriages that are legal under the laws of any US state must be recognized by all other US states. Other countries may or may not recognize such marriages, depending on their own laws.\n\nI do not find any court case in which such a wedding was challenged and a court ruled on its validity, one way or the other.\n\n**Additional info**\n\nAn answer by user Roberto says that Web Wed does this by having an officiant in Utah County, Utah. The Utah County Clerk's office [page on Web Ceremonies](https://www.utahcounty.gov/Dept/ClerkAud/WebCeremonyFAQ.html) does say that the counter permits weddings by video conference as long as the \"host location\" is in the state of Utah. However, it does not mention WebWed specifically, and some of the information does not match. WebWed's site says:\n\n> Once you have the license, there is no rush to perform the ceremony. Once issued thru the courts the marriage licenses never expire, so once you have it you can get legally married whenever you wish. However, please note that each state expiration is different. You must adhere to that specific state policy. In most states, you have 30 days to get married after the license is issued.\n\nUtah marriage licenses are valid for only 30 days and are not issued by a court, so that does not seem to be what WebWed is talking about. The public pages of their site do not seem to mention Utah specifically.\n\nThe WebWed site also says:\n\n> A state issued marriage license is required to use this service. Please note that it is the registers/users responsibility to verify and abide by state, county, and armed forces marriage laws prior to using this service.\n\nWebWed's site advises government officials to reject any online marriage not preformed through their service. If such marriages are lawful and valid, they will be available to anyone that follows the proper rules. US states do not grant exclusive rights to specific commercial services in such cases.\n\nUS Federal Law\n--------------\n\n[8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101) which is the Definitions section for CHAPTER 12\u2014 IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY, says that:\n\n> (a) As used in this chapter\u2014\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (a) (35\\) The term \u201cspouse\u201d, \u201cwife\u201d, or \u201chusband\u201d do not include a spouse, wife, or husband by reason of any marriage ceremony where the contracting parties thereto are not physically present in the presence of each other, unless the marriage shall have been consummated.\n\n\"consummated\" is not defined in this section, and so presumably has its normal meaning in regard to marriage, that is, that the parties have had sexual relations at least once after the marriage occurred.\n\nThis section would apply to proxy marriages as well as to \"virtual\" marriages, but applies only in the context of immigration law.\n\nNormally US Federal law leaves the issue of marriages to the states, except where there is a claim that Federal constitutional rights are being infringed, such as in the cases of [*Loving v. Virginia*, 388 U.S. 1 (1967\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia) which forbade states to prohibit interracial marriage, and [*Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644 (2015\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) which forbade states to prohibit same\\-sex marriage.\n\nUtah Law\n--------\n\n[Section 30\\-1\\-6 of the Utah Code](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title30/Chapter1/30-1-S7.html) provides that:\n\n> 30\\-1\\-7\\.

Nothing in this section, or any other section of chapter 30, specifically authorizes a marriage by video conference where one or both parties are not within the state when the marriage occurs. It is not clear on what basis the Utah County clerk's office considers such marriages valid.\n\n[Section 30\\-1\\-8 of the Utah Code](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title30/Chapter1/30-1-S9.html) provides that:\n\n> (b) Each applicant and if an applicant is a minor, the minor's consenting parent or legal guardian, shall appear in person before the clerk and provide legal documentation to establish the following information ...\n\nHowever that may be relevant only when one or both parties to the marriage is a minor.\n\nI can find no other provisions of the Utah code which control applications for a license by web, or specifies where a marriage may or may not be held, or who is or is not required to be physically present at a valid marriage ceremony.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the legality of online marriages in the United States as of 2021?\n\nA) All 50 states permanently allow online marriages where neither party is physically present in the state.\n\nB) New York state continues to allow virtual weddings indefinitely due to legislation passed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nC) Utah County, Utah permits web ceremonies as long as the \"host location\" is within the state of Utah, though this may conflict with state law.\n\nD) Federal immigration law recognizes all online marriages as valid for immigration purposes, regardless of state laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because no state permanently allows online marriages where neither party is present.

The most amazing/amusing thing here is that, unlike *real*, non\\-air guns (e.g. a regular rifle, an application to import which can be considered just by any \"member of the Police\" who \"must\" grant it if certain criteria is met as per section 18(2,3\\)), an application to import an air pistol (which is [\"restricted airgun\"](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/DLM72627.html#DLM5829905)) has to be considered by the Commissioner (the head of the NZ Police themselves) who only \"may\" grant it, and *only* if there is a \"special reason\" to it (section 18(4,5\\)).\n\nThe law does not elaborate on what \"special reasons\" are, but the Police still [has its idea](https://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/sights-imported-airguns-and-military-style-firearms-new-gun-laws). In a nut shell, if Bob simply wants to practice target shooting with an air pistol at his rural backyard, or control the population of rats threatening his duck flock, he is out of luck: import is effectively banned for him. But he still can just buy the same thing locally \u2014 if he is lucky enough to find it.\n\nNow, there is more to it. Say Bob, who routinely buys stuff from Amazon, sees there an air pistol he wants for only $50, *new*, whereas locally he can find it only for no less than $500, *used*. He orders it without hesitation, thinking that if he can freely trade and use it locally, surely there will be no troubles buying it from overseas. He has no idea that there is section 16 which, in its [previous version](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/43.0/DLM72903.html) could send him to jail for 1 year (in the [current version](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/DLM72903.html) they've added \"without reasonable excuse\" which now could possibly save Bob from becoming a prisoner). Bob's Amazon order arrives at the customs which, upon not finding a matching import permit, forfeits it by way of transfer of title to the Crown. Bob loses the money \u2014 getting punished for not being clairvoyant enough to expect that such a law could exist. Moreover, he should be thankful that no charges get laid against him.\n\nApparently, the legislative intent here was to limit the number of air pistols in the country: if they were as accessible as they are in the world, the number of crimes involving them would have gone up. However, managing the risk of unlawful use just by keeping the prices 10 times higher (as opposed to either completely banning trade/possession or applying the same \"special reason\" threshold as for import) does seem like a very odd, peculiar solution.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The import of slaves into the United States was [banned in 1808](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_Prohibiting_Importation_of_Slaves), although slavery itself and the buying and selling of slaves [remained legal on a Federal level until 1865](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).\n\nThere were, of course, many many violations of the law against importing new slaves.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of historical U.S. legislation, which of the following statements is correct regarding the importation and domestic trade of slaves?\n\nA) The importation of slaves was banned in 1865, coinciding with the abolition of slavery.\nB) The buying and selling of slaves within the U.S. was outlawed in 1808, while importation remained legal.\nC) Both the importation and domestic trade of slaves were banned simultaneously in 1808.\nD) The importation of slaves was banned in 1808, but domestic slave trade remained legal at the federal level until 1865.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

However, I wonder, how long before the actual killing does this decision need to be made for it to be considered \"murder\" as opposed to \"manslaughter\"?\n\n---\n\n*Note:* I am mostly interested in answers regarding laws in Europe, but answers regarding other jurisdictions are welcome as well.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on the jurisdiction, but in the U.S. first degree murder will always require premeditation. The time required can be quite short too... down to nearly instantly in some jurisdictions.\n\nSecond degree Murder will typically cover Murder that is \"a crime of passion\" (i.e. you come home to find you spouse in bed with another man/woman and fly into a violent rage and kill the intruder.). Generally in jurisdictions that don't have instantaneous premeditation, this is used. If they do, 2nd degree includes crimes where you intend to harm the victim and got to carried away and killed them (often called Felony Murder... this could bump it to Murder in the First Degree).\n\nManslaughter usually implies no intent at all, but either negligence or a death that occurred as an unintended result of a lesser crime (Misdemeanor crimes generally net Manslaughter if they caused a death).\n\nIn Common Law, the intend doesn't play much of a role in the charge as it does in the sentencing. Common Law trials will first establish that a crime occurred, so intent has little to do with verdict, but with jail time (And in the U.S., depending on the state, Death Penalty.

This setup provides a layer of protection for the person reporting the crime, as it helps alleviate concerns about potential intimidation or retaliation from the accused. The individual reporting the suspected theft would likely only need to sign an affidavit confirming ownership of the item and when it was lost, without having to directly confront the suspected thief (ruling out A).

In fact, there are [services](https://www.tunnelbear.com/why-vpn) that anonymize Internet use and represent the traffic as coming from some machine providing the service, which could be anywhere in the world.

Accessing any web page is subject to whatever the terms of use are for the page, and if those terms state that the page may only be accessed from within the US, then accessing the page from outside the US is a violation of the TOS (hence use is infringing): see 2\\.4(h) of the [Netflix EULA](https://help.netflix.com/legal/eula).\nThere are [EU rules](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20170207IPR61510/accessing-online-films-and-tv-while-abroad-deal-with-council) that override such terms, within the EU.\n\nThe usual way to circumvent technological location\\-restrictions (where the web page says \"I'm sorry, I can't let you do that\") is to use a VPN and pretend to be somewhere else. Use of a VPN is not per se illegal in most countries (there are exceptions), but using it to circumvent geo\\-blocking may be. Again returning to the point that the TOS may itself say \"No you may not\", the interesting question is what to conclude if there is no such statement, for example I did not see anything in the PBS TOS that restricts access to the US (I didn't look very deeply). Terms of service can't be secret: you can't be held to following rules that you cannot reasonably know of. If you attempt to access a page that uses un\\-announced geo\\-blocking technology and it informs you that you can't use the page because of your location, then you have effectively been put on notice that there is a rule.

Anyway, I have already said that \u2013 my point here was that regardless if the authorities do not perform such exploit, it is a very real possibility that should material claimed to be plaintext ever be considered evidence, that other parties such as the prosecution (who will most likely have had access to examine/read/copy the hard drive for their own independent examination) would be able to perform such attack. Such attack would not be necessarily complex, though I\u2019m not saying it would be in any means easy (or computationally cheap), I am just saying it is entirely possible, and again the overarching point being it is impossible to prove the key is ever said key.\n\nAnd yes, I realise that a good prosecution could provide such circumstantual evidence, though in my belief circumstantual, such as:\nData y was stored by/accessed by defendant, we can prove this (though not actually prove its the key), we believe this is the key (because of a,b,c,) and hence this is the plaintext of the defendants hard drive, which is therefore incriminating.\n\nMY PRIOR RESEARCH:\nOf course without the key it is impossible to actually \u2018decrypt\u2019 said data (provided no key reuse), I know that authorities/prosecution wouldn\u2019t be able to \u2018decrypt\u2019 the hard drive if they didn\u2019t have the key. The point is, again to reiterate, that the very mathematical nature of this predicament further creates/also is the predicament that it is impossible to prove the data produced is actually the \u2018original\u2019 plaintext. Hence, given that the authorities cannot actually \u2018decrypt\u2019 the data without the key that is used, I would like to know if it is legally valid for them to say that they have done so in any case? \n\nI am asking this as I have researched and have not found any cases that are public, neither in the scenario/principle described, nor have I even found any that actually involve unbreakable \u2018one\\-time\\-pad\u2019 encryption. I ask this as again, if it were to be legally valid then it would enable anybody to perform some clever calculations to effectively invent incriminating evidence.\n\n<https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/10/uk_police_can_n.html>\nThe comments section of this page provides interesting discussion on the topic, of which is scarce generally.

In contrast, if it is self\\-executing then it can be used as a defense. \n\nThe legal effect of the 1967 Refugee Protocol, \"Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees\", 19 U.S.T. 6223, 606 U.N.T.S. 267 (January 31, 1967\\), and in particular the question of whether it is self\\-executing is disputed, at least, academically. \n\nBut, a State Department legal opinion which has not clearly and explicitly been overruled by the courts, states that it is not self\\-executing, despite the fact that a lower Article I court in *In re Dunbar*, 141\\. \\& N. Dec. 310 (Board of Immigration Appeals 1973\\), had previously held that the Protocol was self\\-executing (despite ruling against the immigrant on the merits in interpreting the obligations created under the Protocol).\n\nThe issue was raised and not resolved in a case related to mass migration from Haiti during the George H.W. Bush administration, but that issue was not reached in the judgment in that case. This position was supported by a [1991 State Department legal memorandum](https://www.justice.gov/file/23326/download), which claimed that the 1967 protocol was not self\\-executing. A [law review article from 1993](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/997/) examined this issue rather comprehensively, questioning the conclusion of the State Department Memo. A [1997 law review article](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1154&context=bjil) argues that it does have binding effect but that the U.S. has erroneously failed to treat it that way in either the courts or in some of its administrative policies.\n\nThe thrust of the executive branch legal opinions and case law regarding the Protocol appears to be that it is not self\\-executing.\n\n**The Protocol As A Guide To Statutory Interpretation**\n\nOn the other hand, even though there is not an explicit U.S. law statute providing a defense to illegal entry, one could argue that since refugee status is recognized in the U.S. that the entry is not illegal. And, the Refugee Convention could definitely be used as evidence of legislative intent in interpreting the law to determine if U.S. law implicitly prohibits such a prosecution, in the face of the question of whether or not other legal authorization to give someone refugee status makes the entry not illegal. \n\nIn particular, \"it is absolutely clear that the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980 \\[Pub. L. No. 96\\-212, 94 Stat. 102] was intended to implement American obligations under the Protocol.\" (from a [2000 law review article](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=2482&context=articles)). For example, three of the leading cases interpreting the 1967 Protocol and the Refugee Act of 1980 (with a largely anti\\-immigrant outcome on the merits) are *[INS v.Aguirre\\-Aguirre](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/526/415/)*, 119 S. Ct. 1439 (1999\\) and *INS v. Cardoza\\-Fonseca*, 480 U. S. 421 (1987\\), and *INS v. Stevic*, 467 U.S. 407 (1984\\) (limiting refugee litigation rights), still purported to interpret the Refugee Act of 1980 in light of the fact that it was intended to implement the Protocol.\n\nIn addition to the Refugee Convention, the long standing practice (until the current administration) of neither immediately deporting nor prosecuting people who claim refugee status for illegal entry would also argue in favor of this interpretation. \n\nAn agency's historical and traditional custom and practice in applying a law is an important part of interpreting laws in which the agency, at the outset, has considerable discretion to resolve ambiguities regarding its meaning, although existing policies and positions of the agency are also entitled to deference.\n\nFurthermore, when Congress amends a law, it is presumed to know the way that the law is currently being interpreted by the Executive Branch and the Courts, and to ratify those positions if they are not changed.\n\n**Practical Issues**\n\nAny argument referencing the Refugee Protocol would also have to establish under the currently applied precedents that the purported refugee has, or at least is likely to have, a well founded fear of persecution in the country from which they are fleeing. Likewise, the refugee would have to prove that exceptions to the general rule (e.g. national defense and prohibitions on alien non\\-political criminals) do not apply.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An asylum seeker is prosecuted for illegal entry into the United States under 8 USC 1325(a)(1).

The self-executing status of the 1967 Refugee Protocol is disputed, with some government opinions suggesting it is not self-executing. However, even if it's not directly applicable as law, the Protocol can still be used as evidence of legislative intent when interpreting U.S. refugee laws, particularly the Refugee Act of 1980, which was intended to implement U.S. obligations under the Protocol. This approach allows the defendant to argue for an interpretation of U.S. law that aligns with the Protocol's principles, even if the Protocol itself cannot be directly enforced.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Protocol's self-executing status is disputed, not definitely established.

However, attempting to dismantle one of the three branches would be nothing short of a coup d'etat.\n\nThe president has some options here:\n\n> He \\[the President] may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses \\[of Congress], or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper. \\-\\- Article 2, Sec. 3\n\nBasically, this means that, in an extraordinary circumstance (total defiance of the entire Senate would easily qualify), the President can lock the Senate in their chamber until they straighten their heads out. And when I say \"lock them in\", I don't mean that figuratively. The Constitution requires that a majority of each house be present to constitute a quorum to do business. The President could order up to 51 Senators to convene, and if they refused, could order the FBI or whoever to physically arrest them and drag them to the capitol building. This was actually done in Wisconsin by Gov. Scott Walker in 2011 when 14 Democrat Senators fled the state to avoid the quorum needed to vote on a controversial bill that they couldn't block. It would be messy for sure, and as far as I know, has never been done with the U.S. Senate. But there is precedent for it.\n\nAdditionally, the President could use his vacancy power and just appoint a justice. Legally, he would have to wait for the Senate to be in recess, and the Senate would likely arrange things so that never happens. However, if there were no justices left, he could just appoint a Chief Justice (the Constitution provides that there be at least one justice). Even if he did this in the most \"in\\-your\\-face\" illegal way, with both middle fingers extended, the only judge that can tell him he did wrong is the guy he just seated. Of course, the Senate would move to impeach that judge, and probably the President too for having appointed him illegally, but you need a supermajority of both houses to remove them from office. If you had such a supermajority, then the game is over at this point; there's no way the President would step down in such a situation (who would force him?) and we're in a civil war because we don't have a functional government anymore.\n\nIn reality, this isn't an \"interesting twist in constitutional law that the Founding Fathers may not have considered.\" It's that if Congress ever went totally off the rails like that, the President, or the people would have to step up and hope they could end the standoff peacefully without resorting to violence, because this is the kind of thing that revolutions are fought over.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a scenario where the Senate refuses to confirm any Supreme Court nominees, potentially leaving the Court without justices, what extraordinary measure could the President legally take according to the Constitution?\n\nA) Unilaterally appoint justices without Senate confirmation\nB) Dissolve the Senate and call for new elections\nC) Convene and potentially confine Senators until they confirm nominees\nD) Bypass the Senate and ask the House of Representatives to confirm nominees\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Article 2, Section 3 of the Constitution, in extraordinary circumstances, the President has the power to convene both Houses of Congress.

Simply being wrong is not in and of itself enough to give rise to either civil or criminal legal liability. Someone must know that their accusation is false (or at a minimum recklessly make an accusation without knowing whether it is true or false); if they sincerely believe their accusation, there is no liability even if the accusation arose from their negligence in most cases.\n\nAlso, notwithstanding the tag on your post, there would not be a false arrest in this case unless the police did not believe the person accusing you of a crime and arrested you anyway. Police are entitled to take someone accusing someone else of a crime at their word unless there is an obvious reason that they shouldn't believe them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: John and Sarah get into a heated argument in a public park. Sarah, believing John stole her wallet, calls the police and accuses him of theft. When the police arrive, they quickly determine that Sarah's wallet was in her bag the whole time and John is innocent. John is furious about the false accusation and wants Sarah to face consequences. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's legal options?\n\nA) John can sue Sarah for defamation and is likely to win due to her false accusation.\nB) John can press criminal charges against Sarah for filing a false police report.\nC) John has no legal recourse against Sarah as long as she genuinely believed her accusation at the time.\nD) John can demand compensation from the police department for the time wasted on a false report.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, as long as Sarah genuinely believed her accusation at the time she made it, John likely has no legal recourse against her. There is a qualified privilege for reports made to public officials, and simply being wrong is not enough to overcome this privilege or to give rise to legal liability. For Sarah to face consequences, it would need to be proven that she knowingly made a false report or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. The police are entitled to take an accuser at their word unless there's an obvious reason not to believe them. Options A and B are incorrect because they assume liability without evidence of intentional falsity. Option D is incorrect because the police department is not responsible for compensating individuals for time spent investigating reports made in good faith, even if they turn out to be false."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/39295/is-a-copyright-notice-with-a-non-existent-name-invalid", "docs_id": 39295, "title": "Is a copyright notice with a non-existent name invalid?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a person changes their name, do any copyrights registered to them still apply?\n\nOr at least, as this is the subject in mind, does any software licensed to them still hold the same copyright?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since the effective date of the US 1976 Copyright act, a copyright notice is not required at all on works published in the US, nor is it required on works published in any other country that adheres to the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) (which is adhered to by almsot every country in the world at this time). A copyright notice, if present, may specify a pseudonym, a business name, or a form of the author's name other than his or her legal name. The validity of the copyright does not depend on the name in the notice. This is true in all Berne Convention countries.\n\nEven under the 1909 US copyright law, when a notice **was** required for protection, the exact form of the name used was not important, and pseudonyms and variant forms were permitted, as well as DBA names, which might not be easy to associate with the actual copyright holder. Nor do I know of any other country in which an error in the name in the notice would invalidate the copyright.\n\nAside from people changing names, a copyright can be sold or otherwise transferred. This does not require changing the copyright notice to reflect the changed ownership of the copyright, although it is often done with new versions or printings. The name on a copyright notice is at best suggestive or helpful; it does not define the owner.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer, Jane Doe, released a program under her name in 2010 with a standard copyright notice. In 2015, she legally changed her name to Jane Smith and continued updating the software. In 2020, she sold the rights to the software to a company called TechCorp. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright status of all versions of the software?\n\nA) Only versions released after 2015 are protected under Jane Smith's copyright, while earlier versions are under Jane Doe's copyright. TechCorp would need to re-register the copyright under their name to claim ownership.\n\nB) The copyright remains valid for all versions, regardless of Jane's name change or the sale to TechCorp. The original copyright notice does not need to be updated, though TechCorp may choose to do so for new versions.\n\nC) The copyright is only valid for versions released before the sale to TechCorp. New versions would need to be copyrighted under TechCorp's name to be protected.\n\nD) The copyright became invalid when Jane changed her name, and a new copyright needed to be filed under Jane Smith. The sale to TechCorp further complicates the issue, requiring a complete re-registration of copyright for all versions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because copyright protection does not depend on the exact name used in the copyright notice. Jane's name change does not affect the validity of the copyright for any version of the software. Furthermore, when a copyright is sold or transferred (as it was to TechCorp), the copyright remains valid without requiring any changes to the original notice or re-registration. While TechCorp may choose to update the copyright notice on new versions, it is not required for maintaining the copyright protection. This answer accurately reflects the principles outlined in the documentation, which emphasizes that the name in a copyright notice is \"at best suggestive or helpful\" and does not define ownership, especially in light of name changes or copyright transfers."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/57978/unprofessional-behaviour-during-interview", "docs_id": 57978, "title": "Unprofessional behaviour during interview", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A friend of mine was in a job interview during Covid\\-times, therefore it was all done remotely.

The incident, while unprofessional, appears to be accidental and not intentionally harmful. There was no contract between the candidate and the employer regarding the interview process, so the time and effort spent cannot be compensated.

Purchase the rights from the performers (e. g. some orchestra) to use one of their records in a commercial.\n2. Sign a \"work\\-for\\-hire\" contract with a musician.

Holst) can't sue me for copyright infringement (or do any other legal action).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright expires 70 years after the original writer breaths his/her last breath, after that it becomes public domain. And all works published before 1923 are in the public domain in the US.\n\nThis means that the inheritors of the rights cannot sue you for infringement because there is nothing to infringe.\n\nIf the music is not in public domain you will need to contact the rights holders and negotiate the rights to use the music. This can also be a company that has the right to sublicense the content to others.

They are considering using Gustav Holst's \"The Planets - Mars, the Bringer of War\" in the soundtrack. The filmmaker plans to distribute the documentary primarily through online streaming platforms in the United States. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the use of this music in the documentary?\n\nA) The filmmaker needs to obtain permission from Gustav Holst's estate to use the music, as it is still under copyright protection.\n\nB) The filmmaker can freely use any recording of the music without permission, as classical music is always in the public domain.\n\nC) The filmmaker needs to obtain a license for the specific recording they want to use, but not for the composition itself.\n\nD) The filmmaker cannot use this music at all in a commercial production, regardless of its copyright status.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Gustav Holst died in 1934, which means his works entered the public domain in 2005 (70 years after his death). Therefore, the composition itself is in the public domain and doesn't require permission from Holst's estate. However, the filmmaker still needs to consider the copyright of the specific recording they want to use. Most recordings of classical music, even if the composition is in the public domain, are protected by their own copyrights. The performer or record label typically holds these rights. Thus, the filmmaker would need to obtain a license for the specific recording they want to use, but not for the composition itself. Option A is incorrect because Holst's work is now in the public domain. Option B is incorrect because while the composition is in the public domain, recordings may still be under copyright. Option D is incorrect because the music can be used commercially if the proper licenses are obtained for the recording."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64635/is-it-legal-if-a-company-buys-you-a-stock-instead-of-paying-you-dividends", "docs_id": 64635, "title": "Is it legal if a company buys you a stock instead of paying you dividends?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have bought some stocks. However I just noticed that I now have one stock that I didn\u2019t buy. Someone suggested that one of the stock companies instead of paying me dividends bought me that stock. How can I find out if this is what happened and if so, if a stock company has the right to do that, without even asking for my permission?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not uncommon for a company to issue additional shares to shareholders instead of paying a cash dividend. This is known as a \"stock dividend\". Such payment may (less commonly) be in shares of another, often related, company. If that is the source of the stock in question there is nothing illegal about it.\n\nYour broker should have a record of your transactions and whether any stock came from a stock dividend or some other source.\n\nAccordion to the Investopedia article on [\"Stock Dividend\"](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockdividend.asp):\n\n> Also known as a \"scrip dividend,\" a stock dividend is a distribution of shares to existing shareholders in lieu of a cash dividend. This type of dividend may be made when a company wants to reward its investors but doesn't have the spare cash or wants to preserve its cash for other investments.\n> \n> \n> Stock dividends have a tax advantage for the investor. The share dividend, like any stock share, is not taxed until the investor sells it unless the company offers the option of taking the dividend as cash or in stock.\n> \n> \n> A stock dividend may require that the newly received shares are not to be sold for a certain period of time. This holding period on a stock dividend typically begins the day after it is purchased. Understanding the holding period is important for determining qualified dividend tax treatment.\n\nThe Wikip\\[edia article [\"Dividend\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend#Forms_of_payment) says:\n\n> Stock or scrip dividends are those paid out in the form of additional shares of the issuing corporation, **or another corporation** (such as its subsidiary corporation). They are usually issued in proportion to shares owned (for example, for every 100 shares of stock owned, a 5% stock dividend will yield 5 extra shares).

This practice, while less common than cash dividends or stock dividends of the same company, is a legitimate form of dividend distribution. The investor should check their transaction history and any notifications from the company or brokerage to confirm this.
