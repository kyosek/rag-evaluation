As with most fire drills, it took about half an hour for the fire drill to complete and for everyone to get back to work.\n\nWhen the employees got back to their desks, they were told to charge 30 minutes of time to an overhead charge number, but then management sent out a correction saying that they were not allowed to charge the time lost during the fire drill. Instead, they had to \"flex\" their time (that is, make up the 30 minutes at some other time during the pay period, or else take vacation time).\n\nIs this illegal, or just bad practice?

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this practice?\n\nA) This practice is entirely legal as long as the employer provides advance notice of the fire drill.\n\nB) The practice is illegal because employees must be paid for all time they are required to be on the premises, including during safety drills.\n\nC) The practice is legal only if the employees agree to it in writing as part of their employment contract.\n\nD) This practice is legal, but the employer must provide an alternative option for employees who cannot work extra hours or do not have vacation time available.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), employees must be paid for all time they are required to be on the employer's premises, including during mandatory safety drills like fire drills. The time spent participating in a fire drill is considered work time and should be compensated accordingly. Requiring employees to make up this time or use vacation time is generally not legal, as it effectively means the employees are not being paid for time spent under the employer's control and for the employer's benefit.

The answer is only valid until they change their terms: today is Dec. 27, 2021\\. The first part regards the [Facebook TOS](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php). In \u00a73, they state that\n\n> You may not use our Products to do or share anything \\[t]hat violates\n> these Terms, our Community Standards, and other terms and policies\n> that apply to your use of Facebook.\n\nThis explicitly includes infringing the IP rights of another \u2013 which is not applicable in this instance. \u00a75 includes a long list of supplemental policies related to community standards, commercial use, advertising, program development and so on, none of which appear to address how one can download content. It is probably unknowable whether there is/was/will be a version of the TOS in some jurisdiction or time that prohibits using a third party program to download content (distinct from the ban on data\\-mining which *is* stated), but from the stated perspective, the only restriction is that intellectual property right must be respected.

Ashcroft*, [537 U.S. 186](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/537/186/) (2003\\). The Official Syllabus of that decision summarizes its analysis:\n\n> The Copyright and Patent Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8,\n> provides as to copyrights: \"Congress shall have Power ... \\[t]o promote\n> the Progress of Science ... by securing \\[to Authors] for limited Times\n> ... the exclusive Right to their ... Writings.\" In the 1998 Copyright\n> Term Extension Act (CTEA), Congress enlarged the duration of\n> copyrights by 20 years: Under the 1976 Copyright Act (1976 Act),\n> copyright protection generally lasted from a work's creation until 50\n> years after the author's death; under the CTEA, most copyrights now\n> run from creation until 70 years after the author's death, 17 U. S. C.\n> \u00a7 302(a). As in the case of prior copyright extensions, principally in\n> 1831, 1909, and 1976, Congress provided for application of the\n> enlarged terms to existing and future copyrights alike.\n> \n> \n> Petitioners, whose products or services build on copyrighted works\n> that have gone into the public domain, brought this suit seeking a\n> determination that the CTEA fails constitutional review under both the\n> Copyright Clause's \"limited Times\" prescription and the First\n> Amendment's free speech guarantee. Petitioners do not challenge the\n> CTEA's \"life\\-plus\\-70\\-years\" timespan itself. They maintain that\n> Congress went awry not with respect to newly created works, but in\n> enlarging the term for published works with existing copyrights. The\n> \"limited Tim\\[e]\" in effect when a copyright is secured, petitioners\n> urge, becomes the constitutional boundary, a clear line beyond the\n> power of Congress to extend. As to the First Amendment, petitioners\n> contend that the CTEA is a content\\-neutral regulation of speech that\n> fails inspection under the heightened judicial scrutiny appropriate\n> for such regulations. The District Court entered judgment on the\n> pleadings for the Attorney General (respondent here), holding that the\n> CTEA does not violate the Copyright Clause's \"limited Times\"\n> restriction because the CTEA's terms, though longer than the 1976\n> Act's terms, are still limited, not perpetual, and therefore fit\n> within Congress' discretion. The court also held that there are no\n> First Amendment rights to use the copyrighted works of others. The\n> District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. In that court's unanimous view,\n> Harper \\& Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539,\n> foreclosed petitioners' First Amendment challenge to the CTEA. The\n> appeals court reasoned that copyright does not impermissibly restrict\n> free speech, for it grants the author an exclusive right only to the\n> specific form of expression; it does not shield any idea or fact\n> contained in the copyrighted work, and it allows for \"fair use\" even\n> of the expression itself.

It held that originality, for copyright purposes, is constitutionally mandated for all works. *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc.*, 499 U.S. 340 (1991\\).\n\nSee also:\n\n* Under the Copyright and Patent Clause, Congress' copyright authority is tied to the progress of science; its patent authority, to the progress of the useful arts. *Golan v. Holder*, 565 U.S. 302 (2012\\).\n* Under this clause, Congress, to encourage people to devote themselves to intellectual and artistic creation, may guarantee to authors and investors a reward in form of control over sale or commercial use of copies of their books. *Goldstein v. California*, 412 U.S. 546 (1973\\).\n* This clause is both grant of power and limitation; this clause is limited to promotion of advances in useful arts. *Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City*, 383 U.S. 1 (1966\\).\n* The economic philosophy behind this clause empowering Congress to grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is best way to advance public welfare through talents of authors and inventors in Science and useful Arts. *Mazer v. Stein* , 347 U.S. 201 (1954\\).\n* The Copyright Act of Congress, R.S. \u00a7\u20024952, as amended by the Act Mar. 3, 1891, c. 565, 26 Stat. 1106, giving to authors the exclusive right to dramatize any of their works, is valid as applied to pantomine dramatization by means of moving picture films. *Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros.*, 222 U.S. 55 (1911\\).\n* This section does not limit the useful to that which satisfies immediate bodily needs, and painting and engraving not intended for a mechanical end are among the useful arts, the progress of which Congress is empowered by this section to promote. *Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co.*, 188 U.S. 239 (1903\\).\n* No authority exists for obtaining a copyright beyond the extent to which Congress has authorized it; \u2009a copyright cannot be sustained as a right existing at common law, but depends wholly on the legislation of Congress. *Banks v. Manchester*, 128 U.S. 244 (1888\\).\n* Legislation concerning trademark protection is not authorized by this clause. *In re Trade\\-Mark Cases*, 100 U.S. 82 (1879\\).\n\nA [list of U.S. Supreme Court cases on the issue of copyright at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_copyright_case_law) includes many additional copyright cases that don't implicate the U.S. Constitutional language.\n\nIt is also worth noting that while the U.S. Supreme Court is the final and most authoritative interpreter of the U.S. Constitution, that any court presented with an issue of constitutional interpretation can, and indeed, is duty bound, to interpret the constitutional in a legally authoritative way, which in the case of appellate courts (state and federal) serves as a legal precedent for other cases that \"makes law\" on the issue.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the Copyright Clause in the Constitution, particularly regarding the concept of \"useful arts\" and \"progress of science\"?\n\nA) The Court has ruled that only technological inventions can be considered \"useful arts\" for copyright purposes.\n\nB) The Court has determined that \"useful arts\" include all forms of creative expression, without any limitations.\n\nC) The Court has held that originality is constitutionally mandated for all works to be eligible for copyright protection, and that some forms of expression (like factual compilations) may not meet this standard.\n\nD) The Court has interpreted \"progress of science\" to mean that only academic or educational works can be copyrighted.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc. (1991), the Supreme Court held that originality is constitutionally mandated for all works to be eligible for copyright protection. The Court ruled that a telephone book, being a mere compilation of facts, lacked the necessary originality to be copyrightable.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Court has not limited \"useful arts\" to only technological inventions. In fact, in Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co. (1903), the Court clarified that \"useful arts\" include paintings and engravings not intended for mechanical ends.\n\nAnswer B is too broad. While the Court has interpreted \"useful arts\" quite broadly, it has imposed limitations, such as the originality requirement mentioned in Feist.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect. The Court has not limited copyright protection to only academic or educational works. In fact, cases like Mazer v.

This is extra ironic because as far as I can tell by scanning the previous brief it looks like PA case law falls strongly on the side of not respecting donor contracts (though I haven't fully researched the fact, the presidents the brief cites definitely support the idea that parent's can't sign away their child's right), so it seems like the firm is misleading people about the law so they can offer to write contracts that likely won't be respected.\n\nI know the website is not technically lying in what they say, but it seems intentional misleading. I doubt a legal firm would break the law so blatantly, so I assume the claims on the website must be legal. However, that surprises me since what little I do know about common law situations it seems like 'technical truths' that are intentionally misleading usually are treated as falsehoods in other situations, for instance slander/libel laws or contract rulings trying to emphasis intent of contract instead of just the letter of the contract.\n\nSo, why is a claim like this allowed?

In other cases, the contract may or may not be enforcable indeed the court agrees with this specifically:\n\n> Although locating future cases on this spectrum may call upon courts to draw very fine lines, courts are no strangers to such tasks, and the instant case, which we must resolve, is not nearly so difficult.\n\nThis also directly supports the previous sentence.\n\n> Therefore, even if you go through a fertility clinic, a contract between the donor and the intended parents would need to be in place before the conception.\n\nTrue, this is exactly what Ferguson v McKiernan says. You assert that Ferguson v McKiernan says \"donation through a clinic does not make a sperm donor the legal father\", however, it doesn't say that at all. \n\nThe status of the doner as the father was never an issue \\- both parties agreed that he was the biological father and the court accepted that. What was at issue is if he had the rights and obligations of a father that had been removed by the contract. \n\nThe lower courts held that the contract was unenforcable as being contrary to public policy because it removed rights from the children who were not parties to the contract. However, the State Supreme Court held that the contract was enforcable. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWhat they say on their website is not misleading.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Pennsylvania, regarding sperm donation and parental rights, which of the following statements is most accurate according to the Ferguson v McKiernan case?\n\nA) Sperm donation through a clinic automatically removes all parental rights and responsibilities from the donor.\n\nB) Pennsylvania has clear statutory laws governing assisted reproductive technology that protect sperm donors from parental responsibilities.\n\nC) Contracts between sperm donors and intended parents are always unenforceable in Pennsylvania courts.\n\nD) The enforceability of sperm donor contracts depends on the specific circumstances of each case, but can be upheld by Pennsylvania courts.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The Ferguson v McKiernan case established that sperm donor contracts can be legally enforceable in Pennsylvania, contrary to lower court rulings. The Supreme Court emphasized that while such cases may require courts to draw fine lines, contracts between donors and intended parents can be valid and enforceable. The case did not establish a blanket rule that clinic donations automatically remove parental rights, nor did it invalidate all donor contracts. Instead, it affirmed that these contracts can be upheld depending on the specific circumstances of each case. Pennsylvania lacks statutory laws on this matter, relying on case law for guidance.

In contrast, if my name, Andrew Oh\\-Willeke, were on the contract, you wouldn't need any more information, because I am the only person with that name in the entire world and my contact information is widely available on the Internet from sources not subject to question such as the attorney registration lists in my state, as a matter of my licensure obligations and out of business necessity.\n\nOne of the more common ways to accomplish this end would be to have a formal address for notice to the parties in the contract and to have the parties to consent to service of process by mail at that address, or at the last known other address provided at a later date to the other party in writing. In that way, you narrow the list of defendants to the person with that name who is associated with that address. Another alternative would be to have the party designate an agent for service of process in the contract, although that would be more unusual.\n\nBut, because the need to give notice under the contract is usually necessary to carry out the terms of the contract, it doesn't feel as intrusive as asking for a birthday or other identifying information.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In an international contract signed electronically using Adobe or DocuSign, what is the minimum information required for the contract to be legally valid and enforceable?\n\nA) Full name, date of birth, and current residential address of all signers\nB) Full name and a designated address for notice and service of process\nC) Full name, country of birth, and government-issued ID number\nD) Full name and authentication of the record (e.g., electronic signature)\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, the minimum requirement for a contract to be legally valid is that the party authenticates the record they are affirming, which can be done through an electronic signature. The contract is valid even if no other identifying information is provided beyond this authentication.\n\nOption A is incorrect because date of birth and current residential address are not strictly necessary for the contract's validity.\n\nOption B, while potentially useful for practical enforcement purposes, is not the minimum requirement for legal validity.\n\nOption C is incorrect as country of birth and government-issued ID numbers are not required for a contract to be legally valid.\n\nIt's important to note that while D represents the minimum for legal validity, additional identifying information may be prudent for practical enforcement, especially in cases where the signer has a common name.

The law states that it's an offense to use a mobile electronic device for any purpose while driving. While there is an affirmative defense for drivers 18 years or older using a hands-free accessory, this doesn't apply to minors. Therefore, even though the 17-year-old driver didn't physically interact with the phone while driving, they were still \"using\" it for navigation, which is a violation of the law for minors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law doesn't require physical interaction for it to be considered \"use.\"\nOption C is incorrect because the hands-free defense only applies to those 18 and older.\nOption D is incorrect because the law doesn't require observed distraction for it to be a violation in this case."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60930/when-multiple-people-are-included-in-the-same-defamation-lawsuit-do-they-get-su", "docs_id": 60930, "title": "When multiple people are included in the same defamation lawsuit, do they get sued separately or all together?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say two employees for a toy company talk about a company's product being dangerously unsafe (regardless if was true or not) on a news channel.

FDA regulations govern the manufacture or distribution of devices and drugs, not the consumption. An overview of FDA regulation is [here](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/ucm2005300.htm). They say they they are \"responsible for regulating firms who manufacture, repackage, relabel, and/or import medical devices sold in the United States\". The entire pile of regulations (21 CFR) is [here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm). There has to be an underlying statute that authorizes the FDA to impose restrictions: that would be in [Title 21 of the US Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21). The specific law regulating medical devices is [21 USC 360](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/360). Congress can easily pass laws that restrict what businesses do (a consequence of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution), but they (theoretically) have a more limited ability to restrict what an individual does.

The FDA's authority primarily covers the regulation of manufacturers, distributors, and importers of medical devices, not individual consumers. There is no federal law that specifically prohibits individuals from possessing or using prescription medical devices. While the device requires a prescription for legal distribution, the act of using it is not criminalized for the end user.

Option B is incorrect because while there is an exemption mentioned, it's not broad enough to cover all employment-related emails. Option C is partially correct in that these emails are likely not considered commercial, but it's wrong about the Act applying to government entities.

California defines and criminalizes homicide in the penal code [here](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=187-199), and section 195 starts setting forth circumstances where homicide is excusable. 197\\.2, for example, includes when\n\n> committed in defense of habitation, property, or person, against one\n>  who manifestly intends or endeavors, by violence or surprise, to\n>  commit a felony, or against one who manifestly intends and endeavors,\n>  in a violent, riotous or tumultuous manner, to enter the habitation of\n>  another for the purpose of offering violence to any person therein\n\nThe jury then has to decide if the facts match the various conditions enumerated throughout the criminal code as justifications, so there are specific instructions that the judge reads, given [here](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/3400/3476.html). (This is a generic self\\-defense instruction, not just aimed at homicide). They are told that the accused \"may use reasonable force to protect that property from imminent harm\", and that reasonable force is \"the amount of force that a reasonable person in the same situation would believe is necessary to protect the property from imminent harm\". So if the prosecution cannot prove \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used more force than was reasonable to protect property from imminent harm\", they are supposed to acquit. Now, suppose that you're sitting at a sidewalk cafe and some passing perp reached for your cell phone on the table. Blowing off his head would be an unreasonable degree of force.\n\nThere are additional instructions aimed at specific situations, such as the [right to eject a trespasser](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/3400/3475.html) that allows you to use reasonable force to eject a trespasser who refuses to leave, and again that degree of force is whatever the reasonable man would do in the circumstances that the victim reasonably believed existed (regardless of whether there was an actual threat). Deadly force is specifically allowed in self\\-defense against a \"[forcible or atrocious crime](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/500/505.html)\", which includes robbery. This does not include deadly force to prevent vandalism. \n\nYou will have noticed that it comes down to the jury making a subjective judgment call as to whether the degree of force used was beyond what the hypothetical \"reasonable man\" would use. \n\nTo clarify in response to the comment, the thing that all of the justified force defenses have in common is that the force be reasonable *in order to stop the aggressor*. If you can (safely) stop the vandal by smacking him once, but it would be satisfying to turn him into paste, you have to remain unsatisfied. Individuals can use force in defense of self or property, but only the law can use force punitively (and as I assume you know, that never includes beating a person up).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John witnesses a stranger attempting to steal his motorcycle parked outside his house.

John's actions in this scenario - verbal warnings and brandishing the bat without making physical contact - are likely to be seen as an appropriate level of force to prevent the theft without causing unnecessary harm.\n\nOption A is excessive, as it involves immediate use of potentially deadly force without attempting less violent means first.

(e.g. \"willful infringement\" versus inadvertent infringement)\n\n*Jurisdiction is primarily the United States, as that's where most major English\\-language websites are based, but as this is an \"on the internet\" question, if there are jurisdictions where the answer is substantially different than that for the United States, that information would also be welcome.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The significant question is whether such a statement as \"no copyright infringement intended\" will be viewed by the courts as evidence to suggest innocent infringement or rather as evidence to support *willful* infringement. This consideration of willful versus innocent is relevant when a copyright holder seeks statutory damages.\n\n[17 USC \u00a7504(c)(2\\) says](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504) (emphasis mine):\n\n> In a case where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that infringement was committed willfully, the court in its discretion may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of not more than $150,000\\. In a case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that such infringer was not aware and **had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright**, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200\\.\n\n[Branch v. Ogilvy \\& Mather, Inc.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6743155512361007994) says of willfulness (emphasis mine):\n\n> Thus, in order to prove willfulness, a plaintiff must show that the defendant knew or should have known that its conduct constituted copyright infringement. Similarly, in order to establish innocent intent, the defendant must prove that it did not know and **should not have known** that its conduct constituted infringement. One defense to an allegation of willfulness is **the defendant's reasonable and good faith belief** that its actions do not constitute copyright infringement.\n\nThe central question, then, seems to be whether the notice \"no copyright infringement intended\" aids or harms an argument that the infringer \"did not know or should not have known\" that they were infringing copyright, or else that they had a \"reasonable and good faith belief\" of non\\-infringement.\n\nI am not aware of any case law that concerns such a notice, but my layman intuition suggests to me that\n\n1. such a notice lends evidential weight that the defendant did indeed know the work in question was under copyright;\n2. since the defendant was therefore aware the work was under copyright, it is unlikely that they could successfully claim a reasonable belief that publicly distributing the entirety of (or a substantial portion of) the work without permission was not infringement.\n\nUltimately, I don't think such a notice does anything to aid the defendant's argument that they \"should not have known\" their use was infringing. Nor do I think it furthers an argument of \"reasonable and good faith belief\" by the defendant: the reasonableness of such a belief will rest significantly on the facts of the infringement, not only on how loudly they shouted, \"I *swear* this isn't infringement!\" Conversely, such a notice may further the idea that the defendant did know that copyright applied to the work, strengthening the plaintiff's argument that the defendant should have known the use was infringing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a copyright infringement case, how might a disclaimer stating \"no copyright infringement intended\" impact the court's assessment of statutory damages?\n\nA) It would automatically reduce the damages to the minimum of $200\nB) It would guarantee that the infringement is considered innocent rather than willful\nC) It could potentially be viewed as evidence of willful infringement\nD) It would have no impact on the court's decision regarding damages\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The disclaimer \"no copyright infringement intended\" could potentially be viewed as evidence of willful infringement, rather than innocent infringement. This is because:\n\n1. It suggests the infringer was aware that copyright might apply to the work they were using.\n2. Despite this awareness, they proceeded to use the copyrighted material without permission.\n3. The courts consider whether the infringer \"knew or should have known\" that their actions constituted copyright infringement when determining willfulness.\n4. Such a disclaimer doesn't necessarily demonstrate a \"reasonable and good faith belief\" that the use was non-infringing, especially if the entire work or a substantial portion was used without permission.\n5. The notice might actually strengthen the argument that the infringer should have known their use was infringing, as it shows they were conscious of copyright issues.\n\nWhile the impact would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances of the case, the disclaimer could potentially work against the infringer by demonstrating their awareness of copyright, rather than supporting a claim of innocent infringement."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/63880/trademark-application-denied-due-to-company-name-which-describes-activity", "docs_id": 63880, "title": "Trademark-application denied due to company name which describes activity", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am co\\-founder of a company with which we want to apply for a trademark of our name in BeNeLux.

Copyrighting a standard means the wording of the standard can not be copied without the copyright holders permission. It does not protect the ideas expressed in the document, just the way those ideas are expressed.

The reason no doubt is that they do not want to be put in the position of saying \"that is not\", when a court may later decide \"yes it is\". You have to rely on the wording of the question, specifically the fact that it refers to being obviously about a particular individual. The two key terms here are \"particular\" and \"obviously\". The former means \"uniquely\", so a half\\-eaten sandwich is \"about\" some human, but there are billions of people that it could be about. \"Obviously\" is more a judgment call, but comes down to the question of whether there is a path between the datum and the specific person which a person of average intelligence can see, versus (non\\-obviously) a hypothetical scenario whereby one might be able to connect a datum to a specific person.\n\nThe fourth question relies on relating \"an individual\", which in context we have to interpret as meaning relating \"a specific individual\" to the datum, as opposed to relating some set of individuals. Their example of a single person in a post being a \"yes\" (actually they just say it is \"an example\", but not what it is an example of) indicates that if the datum could be true of a number of individuals, then it is not established as being personal data (yet).\n\nQ5 oddly implies that what you might do with data defines whether the data is \"personal data\", which is confusing, but amounts to saying \"even if this is in the ordinary sense 'personal data', it is not subject to the protection requirements\" \u2013 this is not uncommon in law, where rules are stated in terms of a label ('personal data\"), and the rules are very simple, but the definition of the label can be complicated.\n\nQ6 distinguishes \"incidental\" facts from \"significant\" facts. As they say, the fact that X attended a meeting is personal data; the fact that coffee was served is *not*, even though it is a fact connected to the meeting which is connected to the person. The fact that X (alone) had black coffee would be PD. Q7 is quite vague, but reduces to asking \"what is the purpose of gathering the data\": if the purpose is \"about\" individuals, it is PD, but if it is about processes / machines, move on to the next question. Finally, they ask whether the data \"can impact\" an individual (similar to Q5 but without the implication of specific intent to do so). Ordinarily, one would think the datum \"has red hair\" can't have an impact on an individual, but with a bit of creativity, one can construct a reasonable scenario where this could have an effect (such as tending to prejudice people against the individual).\n\nThe guidance that you are looking at is an interpretation of what the law requires, and it is helpful to look at multiple interpretations, such as [this one](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company collects the following data about its employees:\n1.

A deed from one owner of real estate to another co\\-owner doesn't violate a due on sales clause of a mortgage or deed of trust, and the fact that both of you are on the mortgage or deed of trust does not mean that both of you need to own it. Unless the decree says otherwise, the ex would usually have to transfer the property even if the mortgage is not yet refinanced. But, not all decrees and not all separation agreements have the same requirements and provisions. The exact language in the governing document would matter.\n\nIf the decree doesn't say who gets to occupy the house, you could and probably should go to the court to have that issue clarified. Since violating a clear court order can give rise to contempt of court sanctions of incarceration or fines, often someone will comply with it without having to have the police intervene to remove someone.\n\nConceivably, if the ex did not leave, you could seek to hold the ex in contempt of court for violating the divorce decree if it implies that the ex's right to occupy the house has ended. If the ex is found by the court to have willfully violated a court order following notice to the ex, an arraignment and a hearing if the violation was not conceded at the arraignment, the ex could face incarceration and/or fines (contempt proceedings are rather complicated and exactly how you do this is beyond the scope of a simple answer). \n\nYou could also seek to hold the ex in contempt of court for not promptly signing the quitclaim deed (assuming that the decree does not condition the duty to do this on the refinancing of the house), but this would not be the best solution to that problem. This is because you could also go to the court and have it appoint the clerk of the court as the husband's agent to sign the quitclaim deed on behalf of the ex (assuming again that the decree does not condition the duty to do this on the refinancing of the house), if the ex failed to do so as required by the divorce decree by the deadline set forth in the decree, or a new court order, or within a reasonable time if not deadline is set. Then, after you were in title, you could bring an eviction action if necessary. It is much easier and faster to get an order directing the clerk to sign something on behalf of a party to a lawsuit than it is to hold someone in contempt of court.\n\nYou could also ask the court to issue a protection order prohibiting him from occupying the house at any time prior to the title being put into your name pursuant to the decree. This could take effect as soon as the protection order signed/authorized by the judge is served upon the ex. A protection order (in most states) is directly enforceable by the police, unlike most court orders which are only enforceable by bringing contempt of court charges in the court that issued the order. But, a court would usually be reluctant to issue a protection order unless there was a clear and present risk of physical harm, or severe emotional harm to you from a violation of the decree.\n\nAlso, while the ex wouldn't be committing the crime of trespassing by occupying the house, it wouldn't be unprecedented for you to persuade a police officer to remove the ex from the house after explaining the situation to prevent a breach of the peace between you, or because the ex's conduct in overstaying his right under the decree to be in the house constitutes \"disorderly conduct\" or \"loitering\" or \"harassment\" or some other minor offense in the opinion of the police officer, even if that charge might not hold up if prosecuted in court. But, there is really no way to compel a police officer to do that and it is close to the boundary of what a police officer does and doesn't have the authority to do.\n\nMost of these remedies would take several weeks, at a minimum, to complete. A protection order could be done in a day or two, subject to a prompt follow up hearing within a week or two after the fact.

The key legal issue here is not the sale of the product itself, but the claims made in advertising it. Vague claims about \"energy\" and \"balance\" are difficult to disprove scientifically and therefore less likely to result in successful prosecution for deceptive advertising. However, if the company makes specific, testable claims about health benefits that can be scientifically refuted, they could face legal action for deceptive advertising under FTC regulations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because companies can face legal consequences for false advertising even if their product doesn't cause physical harm. Option B is too narrow; while false claims of government endorsement are problematic, they're not the only type of claim that could lead to legal issues.

It says \"you can't vote unless...\" three things. It has to be locally legal to vote for something other than a federal office, the election has to include something other than voting for federal office, and it cannot be possible to vote for a federal office at the same time. Given that, it is impossible for any alien (even documented) to vote for president. Extant alien\\-voting laws are no higher than municipality, most being in Maryland.

[Here](https://elections.maryland.gov/laws_and_regs/documents/Election%20Law%202011.pdf) are the election laws for Maryland.

While there are varying degrees of concerns with infestations, the landlord has one obligation and that is to remedy the situation within a reasonable time using reasonable means. This often means hiring a licensed exterminator within a reasonable period of time and solving the problem within a reasonable time. This does not always work. For example, ants and termites may require additional expertise in solving the problem.\n\nCentipedes are often a result of moisture. While spraying is a start, the management may have other issues such as cracks in the foundation. Even small ones are enough. This is a prime example of requiring additional expertise. It may be that additional work is required. Centipede are common and largely harmless and often do not constitute an infestation. They are creepy for sure.\n\nRegardless of what the lease says, the law prevails here. Only a few rights can be waived by contract.\n\nThe landlord is required to use all reasonable means to solve the problem. Until it can be proven that the landlord has failed to solve the problem using reasonable means, you have no legal recourse.\n\nYou can certainly ask to have the fee waived. However, the landlord is under no obligation at this point and may choose not to. It is your choice. However, I would make sure you are not on the ground floor if you do switch apartments.\n\nOne other thing. There is no such thing as just one roach. The landlord should be spraying adjacent apartments including above and below. As well, assuming there is a basement, the landlord should be paying attention to cracks and gaps there too. Roaches require water and food. If another tenant is not clean then that is a problem that the landlord must solve also. This may not be too alarming of a problem since most roaches come from tenants moving. Higher turnover often means more problems including bed bugs.

Something cannot be a derivative work if it's not a new work. The answer is clearly yes, your translation process certainly includes at least the minimal creative input required to create a new work.\n\nSecond, is this new work a derivative work of the original? And I think the answer would almost certainly be yes. The test here is whether the new work contains sufficient protectable expression from the original work. However, the answer would be no if you do not take enough copyrightable material from the original work. It doesn't take much.\n\nYour work is a derivative work because anyone who copies or distributes your work is copying or distributing the protectable expression from the original work that is also in your work.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates a new programming framework by translating the core functionalities of Ruby on Rails from Ruby to Java. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal status of this new framework?\n\nA) The new Java framework is an entirely original work and not subject to any copyright considerations from Ruby on Rails.\n\nB) The new Java framework is a derivative work only if it copies the exact code structure and variable names from Ruby on Rails.\n\nC) The new Java framework is likely a derivative work of Ruby on Rails, even if significant changes were made during the translation process.\n\nD) The new Java framework can only be considered a derivative work if more than 50% of the original Ruby on Rails code is recognizable in the Java version.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, translating a work from one programming language to another is analogous to translating a book between human languages, which is explicitly mentioned as creating a derivative work. The key factors are:\n\n1. The translation process involves creating a new work with at least minimal creative input.\n2. The new work likely contains sufficient protectable expression from the original work to be considered derivative.\n3. Even if significant changes are made during translation, as long as there is recognizable protectable expression from the original, it's still considered a derivative work.\n4. The threshold for containing enough copyrightable material is generally low.\n\nOption A is incorrect because translation typically results in a derivative work, not an entirely original one. Option B is too restrictive; exact copying is not required for a work to be derivative. Option D introduces an arbitrary percentage that is not supported by copyright law; even a small amount of protectable expression can make a work derivative."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80037/is-it-okay-to-keep-track-of-accounts-receivable-and-accounts-payable-with-cash-b", "docs_id": 80037, "title": "Is it okay to keep track of accounts receivable and accounts payable with cash basis accounting?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it okay to keep track of accounts receivable and accounts payable for my reference but still mark cash basis accounting on my tax return?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes\n---\n\nThe IRS doesn't care what management accounting system you use for your personal use, only that you use the system they prescribe when talking to them.\n\nIf you look at the accounts of any public corporation they will almost always show figures for future tax liabilities and/or assets.

How can it be explained when non\\-exempt sales from different online sellers being shipped to a single address are all assessed different tax rates?\n\nSome states use an origin\\-based sales tax system.

This includes checking official government email. However, you are not a government worker.\n\nNon\\-exempt (hourly) workers must be paid for all regular and expected duties that they are required or expected to fulfill, and being told to check email qualifies as work. [An employer is sometimes able to not record and pay for certain work done that is considered *de minimis*](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-exactly-is-de-minimis-how-to-73992/), but the legal standard here is that the work cannot be directed by the employer or be a regular part of the job, and the work must truly be short\\-term (seconds to a few minutes). Checking email off\\-the\\-clock counts as compensable work for non\\-exempt employees, and this establishes that checking email is considered work. However, as an exempt employee the pay provisions here do not apply.\n\nIn general, employers may or may not offer vacation time. If they do offer vacation time, they are not required to offer any specific kind of vacation time and may place reasonable restrictions on how and when vacation time can be used. There are some FLSA regulations on how and when vacation time may be counted, but these only apply to non\\-exempt employees.\n\nAs a result, because you are exempt, the main controlling factor here is your employment contract and what it says about vacation time. In West Virginia your employer is free to change their vacation time policy unilaterally, but they must honor any vacation time accrued under a previous policy without changes. If your employment contract says that you are required to check your email or otherwise stay in contact during vacation, then there's not a lot you can do here.\n\nThere are several more laws that apply specifically to some federal contractors under certain conditions, and [you can find a summary here](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/govtcontracts). Several of these require that federal contractors be paid at least minimum wage for work they perform, so if your vacation time is being used to avoid paying you for a day of work then your employer may be running afoul of the law here by requiring you to check your email.\n\nNote that the question of which account to bill hours to is an internal question and not regulated by law. Your employer has you assign billable hours so they can keep track of which government contract to charge your time to. This is done for their benefit, not for yours. They must still comply with your employment contract, including full pay and benefits, regardless of where you allocate your hours (unless the contract states otherwise).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An exempt employee working for a federal government contractor in West Virginia is required to use vacation time during a government shutdown.

There is a $500 fine for intentionally violating this law. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while government agencies are exempt from this law, private creditors are not. Option C is not mentioned in the given information and goes beyond the stated requirements. Option D is fabricated and not based on the provided facts.\n\nIt's important to note that this law is specific to Connecticut, and the question specifies that the creditor is operating in Connecticut.

(Reference for Loot Boxes and Booster Packs below). The main debate is whether or not these type of products are illegal lotteries.\n\nThe law at question is California Penal Code 319, and specifically the definition of a lottery:\n\n> 319. A lottery is any scheme for the disposal or distribution of property by chance, among persons who have paid or promised to pay any\n>  valuable consideration for the chance of obtaining such property or a\n>  portion of it, or for any share or any interest in such property, upon\n>  any agreement, understanding, or expectation that it is to be\n>  distributed or disposed of by lot or chance, whether called a lottery,\n>  raffle, or gift enterprise, or by whatever name the same may be known.\n\n**Does this constitute MTG Booster sales (physical sales) as a lottery?**\n\n**Please note:**\n\n* The definition makes no mention of receiving/losing \"value\" from any such property, only that you received it by chance. IMO, by purchasing a booster, you have purchased a chance at receiving individual cards on a statistical spectrum (rarity). The chance bit is all that matters, not even the value of the cards. Because there is no mention of inheriting some value, or the ability to obtain a greater monetary value after the lottery, then the argument around not acknowledging the secondary market is negated.\n* The definition makes no mention of receiving anything vs receiving nothing, thus the argument of \"everyone receives something\" is negated\n* The definition makes no distinguishment of such property having sole monetary value vs some other intrinsic value such as being able to play a competitive game.\n* However, I believe that the nuance in this law is the definition of such property. Does a range of cards on a statistical spectrum of rarity each constitute an individual property vs the booster itself as the individual property? But, couldn't this argument be made about a lottery ticket? Would wizards need to make every card the same rarity and distribute each evenly if this were true? How can we navigate around a booster pack being purchased to receive a chance at some cards?\n* One area I find difficult to research is Magic Repacks on eBay. Not sure if anyone has any thoughts on this?\n\n**For Magic Arena (electronic version of the game):**\n\n* The argument might stand that WOTC does not give up actual \"ownership\" of the cards, however, in the context of 319, there is no explicit mention of ownership. Only \"distribution\" of such property. The game aspect may not conceal the fact there exists a purchase of chance within the game.\n\nReference:\n\n[Booster Pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_pack)\n\n[Loot Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box)\n\n[California 319](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?chapter=9.&part=1.&lawCode=PEN&title=9.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So the way I understand the thinking, is that TCG Booster cards have a set number (lets say 11\\) per each pack and each pack costs a set value X. The producer of the card thus values all cards in the pack at a price x/11 \\= $cost to make \\+ $profits for work per card. That is the materials and packaging per card in pack is all valued at the same regardless of rarity. After the company sells the card, secondhand sales of the card are not factored into their valuation of the card. A rare card could potentially be valued much lower than a common card based on the games current meta and popular strategy and use, though usually, the rare cards tend to be more important to the game.\n\nThey also have a gareente that out of these 11 cards a subset of them will always be common, another subset will always be uncommon, and the remainder will be rare or super\\-rare. Usually it will be something like 7:3:1\\. There might be an additional \"Secret Rare\" card that will occur once per box of booster packs. Again, while the value of the cards on the secondary market is going to be wildly disparent based on the pack of cards, the manufactured value will always be x/11 per pack.\n\nAs far as the law is concerned, the fact that everyone gets the same amount of cards from the rarity and that all cards are valued the same is enough. The secondary market doesn't matter. They don't care if the rarist card you get isn't a good card in a meta\\-game or a popular character in the fandom (i.e. Charizard), so long as it's cost to the manufacturer is the same as the secret rare card that occurs once per shipped box.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Based on the interpretation of California Penal Code 319 and the explanation of TCG booster packs, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of Magic: The Gathering booster packs in California?\n\nA) MTG booster packs are likely legal because the secondary market value of cards is irrelevant to the manufacturer's valuation.\n\nB) MTG booster packs are likely illegal because they distribute property by chance to people who have paid consideration.\n\nC) MTG booster packs are in a legal grey area because the law doesn't specifically address collectible card games.\n\nD) MTG booster packs are definitely illegal because rare cards have higher monetary value than common cards.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The most accurate statement is A. The key factors that likely make MTG booster packs legal under California Penal Code 319 are:\n\n1. The manufacturer values all cards in a pack equally, regardless of rarity.\n2. Each pack contains a guaranteed distribution of rarities (e.g., 7 common, 3 uncommon, 1 rare).\n3. The secondary market value of cards is not considered in the manufacturer's valuation or pricing.\n4. Every purchaser receives the same number of cards for the same price.\n\nThese factors differentiate booster packs from traditional lotteries where the chance of receiving nothing or a prize of varying value is central to the scheme. The consistent distribution of cards and the manufacturer's uniform valuation of all cards, regardless of rarity or secondary market value, are key to the legal argument that these products are not lotteries as defined by the law."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87129/can-an-employer-enforce-arbitration-after-the-expiration-of-a-contract-in-nj", "docs_id": 87129, "title": "Can an Employer Enforce Arbitration After the Expiration of a Contract in NJ?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose an employer hires an employee for exactly one year and terminates the employee after the year is over.

Or can it be argued that since the contract was terminated already, the arbitration agreement \"expired\" and can no longer bind them to arbitrate even though the suit is based on something that occurred while the arbitration agreement was still in effect?\n\nWhile my gut feeling is that something like this *is subject to arbitration*, I'm wondering if there are any case precedents to support this assumption, especially in NJ?\n\nIn short, the question is whether a suit brought after the expiration of a contract, where the merits of the claim is based on pr\\-expiration time frame, is subject to arbitration or not?\n\n**CLARIFICATION**:\n\nWhile this question is similar to [this one](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86606/is-a-firm-required-to-arbitrate-disputes-arising-after-the-expiration-of-employm) it is not the same.\n\nIn [that question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86606/is-a-firm-required-to-arbitrate-disputes-arising-after-the-expiration-of-employm) the employee disputes the validity of termination so there are reasons to argue that the contract *is still in effect*. In this question, there is no disagreement between the employer and employee that the employee was properly terminated and the contract is no longer active. However, since the dispute relates to an incident that occurred while the arbitration agreement was active, the question is whether one of the parties can compel arbitration.\n\nMoreover, the [top answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/86624/36096) in that question primarily focuses on the fact that it is unlikely that the contract truly *expired* in that case. It merely transitioned from one phase to another. In this case, I am painting a scenario where there is no doubt at all that the contract expired.\n\nWhile there is some similarities between the two cases, my point in this question is to focus only on one specific component: Does it depend on what gave rise to dispute or when the dispute is being brought to court?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Yes**\n\nI would reach the same [conclusion as DaleM](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/87140/9517), i.e. that the arbitration clause still applies to the dispute in the question, but for a different reason.\\<1\\>\n\nWhile the severability principle is indeed a concept in arbitration law, I don't believe that is the relevant doctrine here.\\<2\\>\n\n**Termination Of Employment v. Termination Of An Employment Contract**\n\nWhat terminates when a period of employment ends is **the employment itself, not the contract of employment**. The contract remains effective as to rights and obligations arising during the course of the employment covered by the contract.\n\n(This concept would also sometimes be described in terms along the lines of \"the right to a remedy for the workplace injury and the right to have disputes related to that resolved in arbitration are vested rights\" that are not modified when the contract term of employment ends.)\n\nThis concept isn't particular to the arbitration obligation.\n\nFor example, if contract of employment that did not contain an arbitration clause provided that the employee was paid $200 an hour for the first six months and $220 an hour for the second six months of a one year fixed term employment agreement, but the employer failed to adjust paychecks according after the first six months and continued paying the employee at $200 an hour instead (assume to avoid the issue of waiver that this wasn't readily apparent on the face of the paystubs provided to the employee), the employee could bring suit thirteen months after the employee's employment terminated for the $20 an hour not paid as agreed during the last six months of the contract even though the employment period had ended.\n\nThe contract still remains in force to govern the rights and obligations of the parties arising during the period of employment.\n\n**Examples Of Termination Of The Contract Itself**\n\nIn contrast, sometimes one contract is replaced, even retroactively, with another contract, in what is called a \"[novation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/novation.asp)\" of the original contract. This truly does terminate the old contract, so that only the replacement contract remains.\n\nSo, if, for example, the original employment contract contained an arbitration clause, but this was replaced by a new employment contract without an arbitration clause three months later (in the sample case, before the worker was injured\\<3\\>), then the arbitration clause would not apply because the contract, and not just the employment was terminated.\n\nSimilarly, support that the workplace injury was the second dispute between the employer and employee that had come up. The first was a dispute over the rate of pay received which was resolved by a settlement agreement negotiated by lawyers for the parties before either arbitration or litigation in court was commenced, which expressly terminated all rights, known and unknown, of the parties arising under the contract, and the second was the workplace injury for which the relationship of the injury to work was only discovered later on. In this case, the contract and not just the employment had been expressly terminated, and so the arbitration clause would not apply to the workplace injury dispute (which would be barred by the settlement agreement and which may or may not have had an arbitration clause of its own).\n\n**End Notes**\n\n\\<1\\> At least assuming that the dispute would have been subject to arbitration if a dispute were litigated while the employee was still employed. There can be circumstances when a workplace injury is not subject to arbitration even if the employer and employee undoubtedly agreed to an arbitration clause that applies to the dispute in question. For example, workplace injuries arising from sexual assault are not subject to arbitration in the United States. *See* 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401\\-402\\.\n\n\\<2\\> The severability principle usually concerns a determination of the enforceability of an arbitration clause in the face of certain kinds of arguments that the entire contract as a whole is voidable. It also does not apply in cases where there is a dispute over whether any contract of any kind was formed in the first place. For example, if someone presented the court with a contract containing an arbitration clause and sought to compel arbitration, and the defense to a motion to compel arbitration was that the defendant had never met or had any connection with or communication with the defendant or anyone related to the alleged contract.\n\n\\<3\\> The hard case, where the novation takes place after the injury, is complicated by legal doctrines regarding the conditions under which a vested legal right can be waived, which may or may not be met depending upon the circumstances under which the novation was entered into by the parties and presents conceptually distinct legal questions in addition to the legal questions already present in the simple case where the injury takes place after the novation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee was hired under a one-year contract that included an arbitration clause for all work-related disputes.

The situation described primarily involves negotiation among family members to decide how to divide the property. While it has elements related to estate planning, it's not strictly an estate planning issue. The top answer emphasizes that this falls under \"negotiation\" and that most general lawyers with property transfer experience can handle it. Additionally, the answer suggests involving an accountant to manage potential tax implications. The family needs to agree on the division, and legal expertise is crucial to structure the transfer properly to avoid unnecessary taxes.

United States*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/320/81) case, the court had to determine whether imposing a curfew on those of Japanese descent was valid. The main constitutional issue ended up being the effectiveness of the [Fifth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) in providing for due process of law in times of war. In the end, the court decided that a curfew was indeed justified.\n\nFollowing this, the majority of the court found in [*Korematsu v. United States*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/214), that the exclusion of those with Japanese ancestry from certain military zones (in this case, the West coast) was also constitutional. In their decision, they heavily relied upon the *Hirabayashi* case.\n\nThe question of internment of people with Japanese ancestry was not actually decided constitutionally. Another case, a habeas corpus case, [*Ex parte Endo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_parte_Endo) might have resolved it, but the Court concluded this case in favor of Endo without going to the constitutional level. A day before this decision was announced, the government suspended Executive Order 9066, leaving the question unresolved.\n\nIn these cases, Justice Frank Murphy's opinions stand out. In *Hirabayashi*, he sternly warned of the racism involved, but felt that the curfew was indeed justified. However, in *Korematsu*, he evidently felt that the exclusion was without basis and dissented, calling the majority opinion \"legalization of racism.\"\n\nCurrent Law\n===========\n\nIn theory, these cases still stand. This is because they haven't been explicitly overruled, and the changes to the constitution since *Hirabayashi* aren't relevant: Amendments XXII and XXV have to do with procedural issues with the office of the President, amendments XXIII, XIV, and XXVI are related to voting rights, and XXVII addresses Congressional salaries. The constitution for the purpose of a similar order is thus unchanged, and so should theoretically be covered under *Korematsu* \\& *Hirabayashi*.\n\nHowever, its effective status as precedent is shaky. For one, it has been widely condemned, and courts would likely avoid using *Korematsu* \\& *Hirabayashi* if possible, or attempt to make a distinction from them given a slightly different order. Second, the convictions against Korematsu and Hirabayashi were overturned in the 1980s based on evidence being possibly concealed by the government. This was [confirmed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/blog/confession-error-solicitor-generals-mistakes-during-japanese-american-internment-cases) by the Department of Justice in 2011\\. However, this is an error of *fact*, and as such the *ratio decidendi* (legal reasoning) used would still technically stand as precedent.\n\n**Lengthy Update:** The Supreme Court has since declared *Korematsu* incorrect in *[Trump v. Hawaii](https://casetext.com/case/trump-v-hawaii-4)*. However in doing so, the court explicitly distinguished the two cases. Thus, many consider the declaration to be *obiter dictum*, i.e. an aside that is non\\-precedential. I'll quote the relevant portion so that readers may decide for themselves:\n\n> Finally, the dissent invokes *Korematsu v. United States*, 323 U.S. 214, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944\\). Whatever rhetorical advantage the dissent may see in doing so, *Korematsu* has nothing to do with this case. The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority. But it is wholly inapt to liken that morally repugnant order to a facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> The dissent's reference to *Korematsu*, however, affords this Court the opportunity to make express what is already obvious: *Korematsu* was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and\u2014to be clear\u2014\"has no place in law under the Constitution.\"\n\nAdditionally further muddying the issue is that the judgment directly moves from referencing *Korematsu* to referencing concentration camps. But as noted above, *Korematsu* dealt with exclusion, not internment in concentration camps as is often popularly believed (though Murphy's \\& Roberts's dissents dispute the distinction so the *Trump v. Hawaii* judgment may implicitly be validating this). *Korematsu* paragraph 20:\n\n> It is said that we are dealing here with the case of imprisonment of a citizen in a concentration camp solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition towards the United States. Our task would be simple, our duty clear, were this a case involving the imprisonment of a loyal citizen in a concentration camp because of racial prejudice. Regardless of the true nature of the assembly and relocation centers\u2014and we deem it unjustifiable to call them concentration camps with all the ugly connotations that term implies\u2014we are dealing specifically with nothing but an exclusion order.\n\nFuture Challenges\n=================\n\nIf another such order occurred, it would almost certainly reach the Supreme Court. The Court would then have to adhere to, reconcile with, or overrule *Korematsu* \\& *Hirabayashi*. In *Hirabayashi*, the following key piece of reasoning was given (and quoted in *Korematsu*):\n\n> Whatever views we may entertain regarding the loyalty to this country of the citizens of Japanese ancestry, we cannot reject as unfounded the judgment of the military authorities and of Congress that there were disloyal members of that population, whose number and strength could not be precisely and quickly ascertained. We cannot say that the war\\-making branches of the Government did not have ground for believing that in a critical hour such persons could not readily be isolated and separately dealt with, and constituted a menace to the national defense and safety, which demanded that prompt and adequate measures be taken to guard against it.\n\nRegardless of personal beliefs, it is hard to argue the logic behind this particular statement (mainly because it is so broad, in my opinion). However, these \"prompt and adequate measures\" would still have to be weighed against the Fifth Amendment. Additionally, we now have a historical example of what may happen if race\\-based exclusion were allowed, and this could inform the justices' decision.\n\nA completely different way that such an order could be ruled unconstitutional could be through separation of powers violations. It could be ruled that Congress [cannot constitutionally delegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondelegation_doctrine#United_States) the powers expressed in Executive Order 9066, but this is rare. It was mentioned in *Hirabayashi*, but the court did not consider this issue, saying that since Congress agreed with the order, this point was moot.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nThough the letter of the law suggests that another order like Executive Order 9066 is possible, in practice it would face significant hurdles. Such an order would likely face challenges based on the Fifth Amendment and almost certainly make its way to SCOTUS. Then, it would be up to them to decide.\n\nI'll end with this [quote](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/scalia_korematsu_was_wrong_but_you_are_kidding_yourself_if_you_think_it_won) from the late Justice Antonin Scalia:\n\n> Well, of course, *Korematsu* was wrong \\[...] But you are kidding yourself if you think the same thing will not happen again.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the current legal status of Executive Order 9066 and the Korematsu v. United States decision?\n\nA) Executive Order 9066 and the Korematsu decision have been explicitly overturned by a subsequent Supreme Court ruling, making them completely invalid as legal precedents.\n\nB) The Korematsu decision remains fully valid as legal precedent, and a similar executive order could be easily implemented today without legal challenges.\n\nC) While Korematsu has been widely condemned and criticized, its legal status remains complex, with the Supreme Court's statement in Trump v. Hawaii potentially being considered obiter dictum rather than binding precedent.\n\nD) The Constitution has been amended since World War II to explicitly prohibit actions similar to Executive Order 9066, making such orders unconstitutional today.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it most accurately reflects the nuanced and complex legal status of the Korematsu decision and Executive Order 9066. While the Supreme Court did state in Trump v. Hawaii that \"Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided,\" this statement was made in a context distinguishing the two cases, which some legal experts consider to be obiter dictum (a non-binding aside) rather than a formal overruling. Additionally, the Constitution has not been amended in ways that would directly prevent such an order, and the core legal reasoning behind Korematsu has not been definitively overturned. This leaves the status of such potential future orders in a gray area, likely to face significant legal challenges but without a clear-cut constitutional prohibition."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15042/what-legal-course-is-there-with-a-bad-neighbor", "docs_id": 15042, "title": "What legal course is there with a bad neighbor?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a very bad neighbor.

It may also be that each time the apartments contact him to voice their concern, he physically goes over there and basically has a tantrum, but without making direct threats. Most of the apartment staff are tiny women (shorter than 5ft).\n\nWhen I asked if I could install a hidden camera to watch my car, I was told by management they wouldn't give permission, but also weren't *not* giving permission, and wished me luck trying to catch him on film.\n\nIf I install a hidden camera, is it legal, and could I contact the police/evict him/file a restraining order? Would that even be considered legal evidence, or would I be liable for unlawful surveillance?\n\nIs there some sort of legal incentive I've not clearly communicated to management to evict him?\n\nIf he actually is insane, what sort of liability for his actions does he have?\n\nI'm really just stumped and would like some advice from someone not emotionally close to the situation which could help guide my actions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am sympathetic to your problem but there is probably not a legal solution: at least not an easy or cheap one. To help you clarify a whole mish\\-mash of issues I will address each of your points.\n\n> 1. frequently calls false noise complaints on neighbors resulting in police action.\n\nIf the person genuinely believes that these complaints are valid, even if they do not end up being substantiated, he is within his rights to make such complaints. If you can document an ongoing pattern of unproven complaints this *might* amount to harassment and you could then seek a court order that he stop the harassing behaviour. However, if even a few of these complaints are proven this would become much harder.\n\n> 2. stands in front of the building in a menacing way as people enter/exit.\n\nHe is entitled to stand wherever he likes in whatever \"way\" he likes. This is only an issue if the person entering/exiting has a reasonable fear that he will he will visit actual harm upon them, o, of course, if he actually does visit physical harm upon them. If so, then this is assault and can be reported to the police or be the basis of a civil action.\n\n> 3. hates black people.\n\nSo, he's a bigot \\- this is not actually illegal. Discriminating against someone on the basis that they are black is illegal, hating them on that basis isn't.\n\n> 4. hates Middle Eastern people and Muslims.\n\nDitto.\n\n> 5. constantly pounds on the floor/walls/ceilings.\n\nIt can't be \"constantly\" \\- it might be often or even frequently, if you intent to take legal action hyperbolic language is not going to aid your case. To make a real complaint about this you would need to diarise each occurrence.\n\nNotwithstanding, unless he is damaging someone else's property or is violating a noise ordinance this is not illegal.\n\n> 6. screams curses at children.\n\nClearly reprehensible behaviour: not clearly illegal. Unless this is assault (see above) or qualifies as offensive behavior under the criminal code wherever you are (unlikely) then he can scream whatever he wants at whoever he likes. Again, a pattern of such behavior may constitute harassment.\n\n> 7. Continues to park in handicap parking despite not being handicap, and receiving very expensive parking tickets.\n\nThis is illegal and he is being punished for it. Unfortunately the expression [Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time.](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Don%27t%20do%20the%20crime%2C%20if%20you%20can%27t%20do%20the%20time.) has a corollary: if you are willing and able to take the punishment then you do as much crime as you want. \n\n> And to add to the list, I suspect he's been putting nails in my car tire, always on the same tire, on the inside wall of the tire; I just replaced my 5th tire in 3 months.\n\nThis is a crime. If you can get evidence to prove it then you can report him to the police and/or sue him for the damage.\n\nYou have stated in your comments that you will be asking another question specifically about filming him, so I won't address this here.\n\n> Is there some sort of legal incentive I've not clearly communicated to management to evict him?\n\nThat depends on if any of his actions are actually grounds for terminating his lease and, if they are, the landlord wants to do so. A remote landlord who is getting his rent on time and not having their property damaged has no incentive to evict a tenant: no matter how annoying they are to others.\n\nIt is possible, that you have a case for breaking your lease and/or suing your landlord for damages as you are not getting \"quiet enjoyment\" of the property. A suit along those lines may resolve the matter because either you or he will be evicted. Consult a lawyer.\n\n> If he actually is insane, what sort of liability for his actions does he have?\n\nThe same as anybody else. Liability for civil wrongs is an objective test of what a reasonable person would be liable for: it is not based on the specific characteristics of the person.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information provided about the problematic neighbor, which of the following actions would most likely result in a successful legal outcome for the resident experiencing issues?\n\nA) Filing a lawsuit against the neighbor for emotional distress caused by his bigoted views towards certain racial and religious groups\nB) Secretly installing a hidden camera to catch the neighbor vandalizing the resident's car tire\nC) Reporting the neighbor to the police for standing in front of the building in a menacing way\nD) Documenting a consistent pattern of false noise complaints made by the neighbor and seeking a court order to stop the harassing behavior\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option A is incorrect because having bigoted views, while reprehensible, is not illegal in itself. Option B could potentially be illegal depending on local laws regarding surveillance and may not be admissible as evidence. Option C is unlikely to result in legal action as standing in a particular way is not inherently illegal unless it causes reasonable fear of harm.
