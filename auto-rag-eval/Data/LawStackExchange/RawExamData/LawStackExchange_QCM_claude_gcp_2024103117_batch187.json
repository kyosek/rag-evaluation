The presence of roaches (A) alone is typically not considered a breach of habitability. The Fire Marshal's warning (B) is a serious concern but doesn't automatically allow lease termination.

For example, a smart lightbulb might expose a `SetBrightness(value)` interface that other software can use to actuate the bulb's functions. Now that the 12\\-year battle of [Google v. Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.#Decision) is over, with SCOTUS ruling in favor of Google, is the non\\-copyrightability of software APIs considered settled law?\n\nI was considering using a GPL\\-licensed library that claims that merely *referencing* the library's API, even if the library is not actually included in the product, would require the entire project to be GPL. In light of Google v. Oracle, it *seems* like that claim is no longer valid. Is my interpretation correct, or am I missing something? Obviously, anyone can sue anyone for anything, but in light of the SCOTUS decision it seems that if the author of a GPL library were to bring suit against another for using the API *without the library*, it would probably be easy to get a summary dismissal with that case as the basis.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is not settled law: neither the copyright question, nor the fair use question.\n\nIn [*Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/593/18-956/#tab-opinion-4382274), 593 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2021\\), the US Supreme Court addressed the reproduction of a [subset of the Java API](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/9530/46948).\n\nThe majority assumed for the sake of argument that the Java API was protected by copyright, but went on to hold that the reproduction was a fair use.\n\n> We shall assume, but purely for argument\u2019s sake, that the entire Sun Java API falls within the definition of that which can be copyrighted. We shall ask instead whether Google\u2019s use of part of that API was a \u201cfair use.\u201d Unlike the Federal Circuit, we conclude that it was.\n\nSo, it is an open question whether an API is protected by copyright, but the precedent from the Federal Circuit will be persuasive authority. The Federal Circuit held that the API is protected by copyright and the Supreme Court did not upset that conclusion.\n\nSecond, the factors that led the court to conclude the reproduction of part of the Java API was fair use could turn out another way in another fact scenario. Some of the reasoning seems to generalize, but some seems specific to the Java development ecosystem. Briefly, the court recognized:\n\n* API authorship is a creative process, but is \"functional in nature\"\n* The reproduction was intended to assist interoperability; it was commercial; there was no evidence of bad faith\n* The amount of code taken was a small amount of the entire Java work, an amount consistent with its goals\n* The market harms to Oracle were dubious\n\nMy prediction is that there will continue to be significant case\\-by\\-case uncertainty as to the applicability of the fair\\-use defence in this context.\n\n---\n\nHowever, *Google v. Oracle* was about API *reproduction*, not API use.

The first thing to do is get an elementary understanding of the law, perhaps by studying the questions and answers on Law SE. Since wills are not contracts, you would learn that contract law is not an important issue (and eventually you could learn how it does become relevant). The biggest impediment to self\\-drafted contracts and wills is the author's lack of basic understanding of law. Let's say that a reading list for basics of law is a complex separate question.\n\nSecond thing is to understand the importance of jurisdiction: it depends on what country and state you are in.

That said, it does not only apply to companies based in an EU country. According to Article 3, you will be affected if you are a data controller or data processor and any of the following apply:\n> \n> \n> * you are established in the EU (or somewhere else subject to EU law), or\n> * you offer goods or services to individuals in the EU, or\n> * you **monitor the behavior of individuals in the EU.**\n\nWhat does the last point here, \"monitor behaviour of individuals in the EU\", mean?\n\nLet's say, for basic functionality of a website, some rudimentary use of cookies is required to make the UI function as expected. Would that amount to \"monitoring behaviour\", because some UI state information might be saved in cookies?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The text from Article 3 of [the regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) is:\n\n> 2. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:\n> \n> \n> (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or\n> \n> \n> (b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.\n\nArticle 3 is about the scope of the regulation. This particular question is clarified by [Recital 24](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-24/) (emphasis added).\n\n> 1 The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. 2 In order to determine whether a processing activity can be **considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects**, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes.\n\nThe point of all this is that if you are collecting data about someone who is currently in the EU then the GDPR applies to you, regardless of where you are. The \"currently in the EU\" bit is significant: the GDPR doesn't apply if you collect data about the activities of an EU citizen who happens to be currently in the US, but it does apply to a US citizen who is visiting the EU. The term \"behaviour\" is used to distinguish data about what someone is currently doing from static data such as date and place of birth (which is presumably much more tied to nationality than current location).\n\nBased on this recital, it seems unlikely that some functional cookies constitute \"monitoring\".

The analytics software tracking user behavior, including page views and click patterns, falls under the definition of monitoring as described in Recital 24 of the GDPR, which mentions \"tracking on the internet\" and \"profiling.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because session cookies used for short-term functionality are unlikely to be considered monitoring under the GDPR, especially if they expire when the browser is closed.\n\nOption B, while involving personal data of EU residents, does not necessarily constitute monitoring of behavior as defined in the GDPR context.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the GDPR applies to individuals currently in the EU, not EU citizens residing elsewhere.

The initial copyright owner is the author of the work. In cases of employment, the \"author\" might be the natural person who authored the work, or the corporate person who employed the natural author.\n\nTo clarify your thinking about registration: copyright registration is a public record of authorship (or copyright ownership).

According to the Berne Convention, copyright is established at the moment of creation, not publication. The startup, as the original author of the majority of the code, automatically holds copyright. While Alan may have rights to his specific contributions, he cannot claim ownership of the entire codebase. The startup can use various forms of evidence to support their claim, including sworn testimony from employees, code analysis showing different coding styles, and version control history.

If you want to vote in B, become a resident and register in B; if you want to remain a resident of A and vote in A, don't do that.\n\nEstablishing residency in B generally boils down to intending to reside in B for more than a temporary period. I suspect that most states do not have a universal definition of \"resident\", so for example in Washington, each agency has its criteria for residency. To register to vote, you have to be a legal resident and live at the address for 30 days (prior to the next election). One way to establish residency is getting a drivers license, which has a [residency requirement](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.16A.140) that is satisfied by receiving state benefits (only available to residents), registering to vote (hmmm), getting, according to [Licensing](http://www.dol.wa.gov/driverslicense/moving.html), or \"Declaring residency for the purpose of obtaining a state license or tuition fees at resident rates\", according to the actual law, in\\-state tuition, or get any state license at resident rates (we see a pattern here). The Department of Licensing also accepts utility bills with address (excluding cell phone, internet, or satellite), bank statements, and so on. This, BTW, is the most common path to *establishing* residency: take a bank statement or similar with street address to the license office. For [hunting and fishing](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=77.08.075), you have to live in a permanent place of abode in the state for 90 days. There are a number of ways to show that: use a Washington address for federal taxes; run for public office or use a Washington address for some court papers; be a custodial parent of a child attending school in the state; register to vote, have a driver's license; register a vehicle in the state. The suicide law restricts the right to medical suicide to residents, proof of which includes (is not limited to) having a Washington driver's license (which is not the same as a state ID card), being registered to vote, or owning / leasing property in the state.\n\nThere is a [social services definition](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=388-468&full=true), based on either living in Washington intending to continue for an indefinite period, or entering the state looking for a job with a job commitment and it explicitly says \"A person does not need to live in the state for a specific period of time to be considered a resident\". But for [tuition purposes](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/Rcw/default.aspx?cite=28B.15.012), you have to have moved to the state for reasons other than tuition, and you have to have been here at least a year. Ohio similarly has an agency\\-by\\-agency approach to \"residency\". If you exclude financial benefits and focus on drivers license or state ID and voter registration, you can probably make a reasonable guess as to the requirements. There is no official registration or form to fill out to become \"a resident\" (as far as I know, in any state), so the law will say what could constitute evidence that you *are* a resident. It may come down to \"intending to reside for an indefinite period\" in B.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A college student from State A is attending university in State B.

This would mean that, under GDPR\\-law, the SAAS\\-provider needs to provide a DPA and sign it with the school?\n3. The responsibility of having the DPA signed lies with the school, and not with the SAAS\\-provider? The provider must provide it, and sign it if requested by the school?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Under GDPR the Controller is the party which has defined \"purpose\" and \"scope\", meaning what the Processor is supposed to do while Processing Personal Data within the scope of a Service being rendered by the Controller.\n\nSo, if the Controller has defined what the Software does and the other company has developed the software \"tailor\\-made\" as per the Controller's request and now makes it available for the Controller to use it as a Service, then YES, the SaaS Company is the Processor and the School the Controller.\n\nHowever, most likelly, the SaaS company has developed a Software on its own that addresses \"most common needs\" of schools, and that makes them also a controller, for they has defined WHAT the SW does... so on that case:\n\\- the School is a Controller under that Service Scope\n\\- the SaaS company is both a Co\\-controller and a Processor (since it enables the tool as a Service).\n\n2. Controllers, being the ones that define \"purpose\" and \"scope\" should also be the ones enabling their own DPA for the Processor to sign... if the SW was \"tailor\\-made\" at the request of the School, then the School must provide the DPA for the SaaS company to sign. On the other hand if the SW already existed, hence both act as Co\\-Controllers and since the SW scope is the one that bears most relevancy within the \"relationship\" and Shared Services, the SaaS Company should provide the DPA for the School to sign (similar to what happens with Cloud hosting companies line AWS or Azure).\n3. It's not a matter of \"responsibility\" but of \"risk mitigation\" for the Controller since under GDPR the Controller becomes liable for any non\\-compliance points on the Processor's side.\nAgain, if the School is the Controller and the SaaS company the Processor, then it is of the utmost interest of the School to have a DPA ratified between both.\nNevertheless, and since it is most likely that both act as Co\\-controllers, it is most relevant for both to have the DPA in order.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A school uses a cloud-based software (SaaS) for managing student data, teacher communications, and parent interactions.

The school must provide a DPA for the SaaS company to sign.\n\nD) Both the school and the SaaS company are Controllers, and neither needs to sign a DPA as they are equal partners in data processing.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the SaaS company has developed software that addresses common needs of schools, rather than creating a tailor-made solution at the school's request. This means the SaaS company has defined the purpose and scope of data processing to some extent, making them a Co-controller. However, they also act as a Processor by providing the service to the school. The school remains a Controller as they decide what specific data to input and how to use the system.\n\nSince the SaaS company's software scope is most relevant to the relationship, they should provide the DPA for the school to sign.

If one party wants the police there, it is standard to wait. If **both** decide it not necessary, it is fine to leave. Either way, leaving or staying does not give rise to the avoidance of a finding of fault against one party or another. The state of Wisconsin is a Tort State (as opposed to a no\\-fault state). These are insurance related issues as opposed to legal issues, but utterly intertwined. The accident reports filed by each party, any police reports and other relevant data will be submitted to the DMV and the insurance, and the insurance companies will assign fault if the DMV or police haven't, either by agreement or inter\\-company arbitration.\n\nRelating to your question, however, you will see the processes required [HERE](http://www.dmv.com/wi/wisconsin/auto-accidents).

The DOT will cross\\-check this information\n>  with the insurance company shown on the report. If you did not have\n>  liability insurance when the accident occurred and were unable to\n>  provide restitution for injuries or damages sustained due to your\n>  negligence, your driving privileges will be suspended.

If not, certainly that will be problematic. \n\n\\*\\*I know you are saying there was no damage or injury. However, while you are saying this is what the other driver acquiesced to, it may be that it is not the case either afterward or he/she wanted to avoid (potentially dangerous) interaction at the scene. That said, while you can clearly see the situations by which the police are necessitated, you also indicate the other driver called the police. In that case, you *probably* should have stayed once you were alerted to that fact, as leaving puts you in the precarious position of only the other driver's side being documented by the police, and your absence may lead the officer to find you at fault or with something to hide. \n\nThe officer will file a report, either way, of which you must get a copy. If he disagrees with your assessment of the damage/injury and feels you left in the face of those situations proscribed, you will know because you will be arrested or summoned for leaving the scene. That is to be determined by the reporting officer.\n\nIn the future, if there is an accident and one driver explicitly states the police have been called, you should wait. You don't have to say anything at all to the officer, if you don't want to. In most states, all you need to do is give the officer your driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. It always looks worse to leave the scene knowing they are coming, since it may lead to a determination that it was illegal to do so. Whereas, no additional harm can come from remaining present.\n\nSo far, I cannot find a state statute there whereby it is explicitly illegal to leave once one driver calls for emergency assistance.

Can I terminate my September 30th (58 or 59 days) and avoid paying for rent in October assuming I served written notice to them tomorrow?\n\nWhy would it say \"58 days **or** two rentals periods\"?\n\nTo make things more confusing, there is this statute in Minnesota:\n\n(Emphasis mine)\n[504B.145 RESTRICTION ON AUTOMATIC RENEWALS OF LEASES.](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=504b.145)\n\n> Notwithstanding the provisions of any residential lease, in order to enforce any automatic renewal clause of a lease of an original term of two months or more which states, in effect, **that the term shall be deemed renewed for a specified additional period of time of two months or more unless the tenant gives notice to the landlord of an intention to quit the premises at the expiration of the term due to expire**, the landlord must give notice to the tenant as provided in this section. The notice must be in writing and direct the tenant's attention to the automatic renewal provision of the lease. **The notice must be served personally or mailed by certified mail at least 15 days, but not more than 30 days prior to the time that the tenant is required to furnish notice of an intention to quit.**\n\nI didn't understand the lease completely, now I'm even more confused by the Minnesota Statute\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From the time that the lease expired and you remained with permission, you had a shorter period of obligation and protection. I assume that the lease ended long ago, and you've been living there month to month.\n\nAssuming that we can read \"two rental periods\" as \"two whole months\" (if there is something else in the lease that indicates this, such as a rent due\\-date), then we can interpret the notice requirement as saying that you must give notice before the first of the month 2 months before the intended end of tenancy \u2013 that is *one* meaning of the lease. Another meaning is that you can give notice 58 days in advance. The lease has an ambiguity as to what the notice requirement is. Since you did not write the lease, and they did (well, someone, whose obligations they inherited, did), the ambiguity is construed against the party to wrote it. In the present circumstance, because you want to leave soon, you would not be held to the notice requirement that favors the landlord. It's entirely non\\-obvious why such wording would be used.\n\nIn [504B.135](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=504B.135), the statutes say\n\n> (a) A tenancy at will may be terminated by either party by giving\n>  notice in writing. The time of the notice must be at least as long as\n>  the interval between the time rent is due or three months, whichever\n>  is less.\n> \n> \n> (b) If a tenant neglects or refuses to pay rent due on a tenancy at\n>  will, the landlord may terminate the tenancy by giving the tenant 14\n>  days notice to quit in writing.\n\nOnce you're past the end of the lease, you are a tenant at will, by [the definitions section](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=504B.001):\n\n> \"Tenancy at will\" means a tenancy in which the tenant holds possession\n>  by permission of the landlord but without a fixed ending date.\n\nAssuming that you pay rent at the first of the month, then the lesser of a whole calendar month and three months is, obviously, a whole calendar month. \n\nThe stuff at the end of the statute that you cite \u2013 \"The notice must be in writing and direct the tenant's attention\" \u2013 is addressed to the landlord's notice to tenant, where he says \"Your tenancy will not auto\\-renew\". This applies to leases of 2 months or longer, not recycled 1 month leases, and requires the landlord to give the tenant appropriate notice (it does not define the tenant's notice requirement).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant has been renting an apartment on a month-to-month basis after the expiration of their original lease.

Since notice was given on August 2nd, the earliest the tenant can vacate is September 30th, which is the end of the next full rental period after notice was given. The ambiguity in the lease terms (58 days vs. two rental periods) would likely be construed in favor of the tenant, but cannot override the minimum notice period required by state law."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13862/disclaimer-for-app", "docs_id": 13862, "title": "Disclaimer for App", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm developing an App, through which illustrators/creators can distribute their own comic books for free and other readers can download the books for free as well.

In the ruling, the court found that the evidence \"does not support a finding that USDA continues to be a participant, passive or active, in discrimination\", and does find that there were past successful remediation efforts, thus \"the Court expresses serious concerns over whether the Government will be able to establish a strong basis in evidence warranting the implementation of Section 1005's race\\-based remedial action\", moreover \"Plaintiff has convincingly shown that the relief provided by Section 1005 is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest\".

I am neither the OP of that question nor in any way related to the OP, I'm asking this question out of personal curiosity. In brief, the situation is that the OP has a medical issue, but his boss (verbally) threatened to fire him if he went to the doctor. Various answers in that thread are suggesting getting written proof that the boss verbally denied the trip to the doctor to use in court later.\n\nNow, here's my question: Clearly, this boss is a jerk. Also, this boss is probably not an idiot. If he's being asked to provide in writing something that he said verbally, he's going to know something's up.

Every time you have a \"conversation\" about this issue verbally, confirm back in writing.\n\nAssume that the boss does not respond to any of these emails to confirm or deny the content as stated, and the \"chain\" of emails, such as it is, is completely one\\-sided, with the OP emailing his boss various things of this nature.

[Recorded recollection](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Hearsay/Traditional_Exceptions#Past_Recollection_Recorded) might be one of the better exceptions. There is also a chance that you could get it in as a [business record](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Hearsay/Traditional_Exceptions#Business_Records) of the company if you were using a company email account and the company stores all of its email communications. The documents also sometimes come in to [provide fair context](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Hearsay/Traditional_Exceptions#Narrative) for a conversation with a party\\-opponent's statements that are admissible.\n\nIt appears that Canada does not follow the modern British rule (which [repealed the hearsay rule in civil cases in 1995](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/38/section/1)), which if it were available, would come in without any difficulty at all. But, Canada does have what it calls a \"[principled exception](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Hearsay/Principled_Exception)\" (which is somewhat broader than the parallel U.S. residual hearsay exception) that is generally available if the document can be shown to be reliable and there is an unavailable witness, or if there proponent of the document can show that it is reliable and necessary for other reasons.\n\nEven if the document itself is not admissible since it is hearsay, you could still testify as to what the boss said from your own recollection, and then have your lawyer ask you why you are sure that this is what was said. You would answer that you contemporaneously wrote a confirming letter to the boss spelling out what was said and you reviewed it to refresh your recollection before testifying at the hearing or trial.\n\nThese kinds of confirming letters are used quite frequently in business and employment litigation. And, in my experience, these statements tend to be surprisingly effective and persuasive, because, while they do not foreclose the possibility that the person writing it was lying or inaccurate in the confirming email account, it does rule out the possibility that you forgot exactly what was said, and you provided the boss with an opportunity to dispute you which the boss didn't feel an obligation to correct.\n\nIf one party has a coherent account in confirming emails of what was said, and the other party is trying to remember what happened a year or two earlier without notes from the witness stand, the person with the coherent, documented account is almost always going to come across as more credible unless the other side can show that your confirming emails are not infrequently gross misrepresentations of what really occurred.

In Canadian courts, one-sided confirming emails sent by an employee to their boss about verbal conversations are not automatically admissible as direct evidence due to the hearsay rule. However, they may be admissible under certain exceptions, such as recorded recollection, business records, or the principled exception if shown to be reliable and necessary. Even if not directly admissible, these emails can be used to refresh the sender's memory when testifying, and can lend credibility to their account of events.

But it is a really big channel.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Indiviual words and short phrases such as titles cannot be protected by copyright. However, they can be protected by trademark law. \"Android\" is a trademark in the US, in the EU, and I am pretty sure in most if not all other countries.\n\nTrademark protection is specific to a purpose or area. If you are writing an SF novel which contains an artificial being, you can describe that being as \"an android\" without infringing the trademark protection on the mobile phone OS. However, using the term \"android\" to describe a pieces of mobile phone software is likely to be an infringement. \n\nTrademark law is different in different countries. For example, in some countries, there is no protection unless a trademark is registered. In others, including the US, simply using a term to label a product or service in commerce can create protection, although registration can give additional rights to the trademark holder. The exact rights protected and the standards for measuring infringement will also vary, but there are many similarities in trademark laws across the world.\n\nOne can use a trademark to refer to the trademarked product or service, and this is not an infringement. For example, one can write a review of Android phones vs Iphones, and use the term \"Android\". This is called \"*Nominative use*\" or sometimes \"*Nominative fair use*\". One must be careful not to imply that the trademark owner has approved, endorsed, or sponsored the use. With a review, this is usually fairly obvious. But in other cases of nominative use it can be more of an issue. For example, one might write in an advertisement \"This software is compatible with Android phones.\" That is nominative use, but a reader might think that the software has been in some way approved by the trademark holder. The ad should therefore make it very clear that there has been no such approval, sponsorship, or affiliation. This is often do0ne with an explicit disclaimer, such as \"XYZ software is not produced by, approved, sponsored by, or affiliated with Android, which is a trademark of Google.\" \n\nIn general one should use no more of a trademark than is needed to identify a product under nominative use. It is generally better practice to sue the name, but not the logo. Use of a logo is more likely to appear to indicate some sort of affiliation. But this is not an absolute rule. For example, a product which is compatible with many other products might display a list of logos, provided it makes clear that this merely indicates compatibility. not approval.\n\nThe basic standard is that one may not use a trademark so that a reasonable person, a customer or potential customer, might plausibly be confused into thinking that a product or service comes from the trademark holder, or is in some way approved by, endorsed by, or is affiliated with the trademark holder, or that the reputation associated with the trademark properly attaches to the product that uses the trademark without permission. Also, one may not use a trademark so as to dilute it, treating it as a generic term for all products of a similar type. For example, one should not use \"Xerox\" as a synonym for \"photocopy\", as that dilutes the Xerox trademark. \n\nOne may offer training or instruction about a trademarked product, and one may use the trademark to identify the product about which instruction is begin offered. This is a form of nominative use, and like other forms, the user must make the lack of any affiliation clear, and avoid possible consumer confusion. This would apply to publicly posted videos.\n\nUsing a handle such as \"AndroidGuy\" to indicate that one is a fan of, or an expert with, Android phones could be a form of nominative use, but seems rather likely to create confusion. If others might reasonably think this indicates that \"AndroidGuy\" is some sort of official representative of Android, or has in some way been approved or authorized by Google, that would be infringement.\n\nA channel name, unlike a handle, comes with a description, that could help clarify the lack of affiliation. But again, if anyone might reasonably be confused into thinking the channel or the videos posted there are sponsored by Google, that might be infringement. If the videos are being sold, or are used to advertise commercial courses or any other products or services, one must be particularly careful to avoid any implied affiliation. \n\nTrademark infringement, like copyright infringement, is usually a civil matter, not a criminal one. That means that the trademark holder must bring a court case or other legal proceeding to stop the infringement, or to recover damages or penalties. Some holders are more aggressive about this than others. This also means that a holder can file suit even in cases that are clearly permitted nominative use, and it is up to the defendant to assert and demonstrate that the use is permitted under the relevant law.

However, to avoid potential trademark infringement, the developer should take steps to prevent consumer confusion:\n\n1. Clearly disclaim any affiliation with Google or the Android brand.\n2. Avoid implying that the channel is endorsed or sponsored by Google.\n3. Use only as much of the trademark as necessary to identify the subject matter.\n4.

The seller can get into various kinds of trouble, including losing their license, under [liquor board regulations](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=314-11). However, as long as the establishment follows the rules for [acceptable ID](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=314-11-025), they [escape liability](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.20.210) if in fact they sell alcohol to a minor: the license holder is [legally allowed](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.20.170) to accept an identification of the specific type. That is the sense in which this is required by law: the customer must have actually presented the identification, in order for the establishment to escape liability ([RCW 66\\.20\\.210](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.20.210)). Looking old enough is not the issue. It is legal to sell alcohol to a person who is over 21, and the law does not *require* presentation of identification as a condition for a sale. However, under [RCW 66\\.20\\.180](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=66.20.180) a person is require to produce ID \"upon request of any *licensee*, peace officer, or enforcement officer of the board\". The legal risk attached to sales in an age\\-marginal situation is very high, and actual presentation of ID is required to escape liability by the establishment, so in that sense, it is \"required by law\".\n\nAll requests to produce ID for liquor sales (at least in Washington, and leaving out deliveries which are governed by other laws) are driven by company policy. Typical policies are quite rational, being designed to protect the company's interest in not getting into a heap of trouble for an under\\-age sale. There is no law saying when you must ask, or when you are protected if you don't ask. Usually, store policy is to use \"common sense\" so that 90 year olds are not required to produce ID (they may be asked, jokingly).\n\nNon\\-compliance with RCW 66\\.20\\.180 carries no legal penalty, that is, there is nothing in the statute that says \"if the customer doesn't...\". The most obvious would be that the seller would refuse to sell, which the seller can arbitrarily do anyhow. There is no statutory penalty imposed on a licensee if they request ID of a person over 21 and the person fails / refuses to produce the ID. Obviously, the licensee cannot be punished if a customer fails to provide ID (and leaves), especially if they lost it. But the law \"requires\" them to provide an ID, with ne except \"unless you leave / put the bottle back\". Somewhat less obviously, if the legislature wants to, it can enact a provision that once a licensee requests ID, they are forbidden to sell alcohol to that customer until ID is provided. But there currently is no such law.\n\n\"The law\" also included regulations, such as [WAC 314\\-17\\-105](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=314-17-105). This regulation is a chart, and the relevant entry is\n\n> PERMIT: Failure to produce permit or identification upon request. See\n>  RCW 66\\.20\\.310 and 66\\.20\\.180\\.\n\nfor which the 1st offense consequence is \"5\\-day permit suspension OR $100 monetary option\". This is a problematic regulation (potential lawsuit fodder), since it can be interpreted in a number of ways. The question is, of whom is the permit or identification predicated? Only the licensee has a permit, but customers and employees can both have identification.

A\u2019s mum invites mum, dad, A and A\u2019s brother B to a meal in an expensive restaurant. At the end, mum gets the bill, pays money, and mum, dad and brother B leave.\n\nA wants to leave but mum didn\u2019t pay the complete bill: She didn\u2019t pay for B\u2019s meal and didn\u2019t pay a tip which is maybe legal but very rude. So A is stopped from leaving the restaurant.\n\nQuestion: Is the restaurant entitled to ask *any* member of the group to pay (and since A is the only one still present they demand money from A)? If A explains the situation and the restaurant owner is sympathetic, would he be entitled to ask for payment from mum instead (who isn\u2019t there anymore, but A can provide name, address and phone number)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Who entered the contract with the restaurant?\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIn order for the restaurant to collect from a person, that person must have entered into a contract for the meal. That is, from the restaurant's point of view, they must have indicated that they would like some food and, since everyone knows how restaurants work, they know that the food will have to be paid for.\n\nWhether a given person entered a contract will depend on the specific facts. If they opened their mouth and said to the waiter something like \u201cI\u2019ll have the chicken\u201d, they almost certainly entered a contract and they are obliged to pay. This is even if they had an expectation that someone else would pay for them \\- the restaurant is not involved in any other contracts or arrangements you might have with third\\-parties. You ordered, you\u2019re on the hook.\n\nIn a situation where you didn\u2019t order, the answer is still probably yes, you have to pay. Again, because you know how restaurants work, by eating the meal that was placed in front of you rather than saying, \u201cJust so you know, your contract for this meal is with that guy over there, is that okay?\u201d, you probably entered a contract by your action of eating the meal.\n\nMore broadly, when a group collectively enters a contract with the restaurant, they are probably agreeing with the restaurant that they will be jointly and severally bound. That is, each is responsible for all and the restaurant can pursue any or all of the people they have a contract with.\n\nA minor dining with their parents is probably not entering a contract with the restaurant. Not because minors can\u2019t enter contracts (they absolutely [can](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/58279/344)) but because of the normal expectation that the parent is entering the contract.\n\nThis is because of a principle that contract terms may be implied by [custom](https://legalvision.com.au/different-types-of-implied-terms/). That is, if there is a general understanding that this is the way things are done, then that will be something the law will enforce. This is a simple expedient adopted in order to make the world work \\- if every term of every contract had to be explicitly detailed in advance this would be a) unworkable and b) impossible.\n\nEven if there is no contract, the restaurant has equitable remedies like unjust enrichment. The diner has had the benefit of the meal and it would be unjust if the restaurant was left out of pocket. Equitable remedies can be even more complicated than contract law so we\u2019ll just leave it at that.\n\nAs for whether the restaurant will accept a promise from one diner that another will pay, that\u2019s up to them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A group of five friends (Alex, Bella, Chris, Dana, and Ethan) go to a restaurant for dinner.

The remaining friends realize they don't have enough money to cover the bill. The restaurant demands payment from the group. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation?\n\nA) Only Alex is liable for the bill since they made the reservation and ordered for everyone.\n\nB) The restaurant can only pursue payment from those who explicitly ordered their own meals.\n\nC) The restaurant can legally demand payment from any or all members of the group, regardless of who ordered or who is still present.\n\nD) The restaurant has no legal recourse if the remaining friends explain that Alex, who left, was supposed to pay.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the principles outlined in the documentation:\n\n1. By participating in the meal, all members of the group likely entered into an implicit contract with the restaurant, even if they didn't personally order.\n2. When a group collectively enters a restaurant, they are typically considered to be jointly and severally bound, meaning the restaurant can pursue any or all members for payment.\n3. The restaurant has the right to demand payment from any member of the group, regardless of who made the reservation or who is still present.\n4. Custom and implied terms in contracts allow for this understanding in restaurant situations.\n5.

This is typically implemented without prior notice and often with an additional fee attached. Typically the landlord will have a preexisting clause in the lease that says the landlord may choose to amend the lease at a later date. The landlord then amends the lease to insist that rent payments are only accepted in the form of deductions from a landlord\\-issued debit card.

If landlords can or cannot, what section of the law defines who can and cannot compel a citizen into banking against the citizen's will?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Typically the landlord will have a preexisting clause in the lease that says the landlord may choose to amend the lease at a later date.\n\nWhile that may be in contracts, I don't see that holding up in court. You can't unilaterally amend contracts to add new terms without acceptance on part of the lessee. Any clause in the contract like that will require notification of the lessee of the change and a chance for the lessee to terminate the contract without recourse on part of the lessor. Generally this must be done in the same format as the original lease (written). Most jurisdictions don't allow for a verbal amendment to a written lease.\n\nSo in a way, yes, it is legal for a landlord to require payment via a certain method (like a direct debit from a bank account). They cannot however change the payment terms unilaterally without notification and acceptance. They can use language such as sending the notification (via registered mail) and then saying that a failure to respond is acceptance (because you are, by actions, accepting the terms by continuing to live there).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Ohio, a landlord attempts to unilaterally amend an existing lease to require rent payments only through a landlord-issued debit card.

Option D is correct because it acknowledges the landlord's ability to propose changes, but also recognizes the tenant's right to be notified and given a choice to accept or reject the new terms.

The government can reasonably restrict such expressions to some extent, thus violent riots can be prohibited, and permanent vandalism with spray paint can be banned. Chalk can even be banned. Any bans must, however, be viewpoint\\-neutral.\n\nGovernment protection of public expressions must also be viewpoint\\-neutral, therefore the police cannot elect to de\\-police just one side of an issue (based on viewpoint, as opposed to different conduct of participants). Therefore they must protect protesters coming from one side of an issue from vigilantes from the other side, or protect neither side \u2013 the government cannot favor a particular viewpoint in law enforcement.\n\nChalk is a commonly used expressive medium, and municipalities have massive discretion to ignore it and wait for the next rain to clean it up, or else they may actively intervene to stop and remove such expressions \u2013 in a viewpoint neutral fashion. Furthermore, a municipality may rightfully tolerate voluntary civilian clean\\-up in the aftermath of a political outburst.\n\nThe (remote) possibility exists that the municipality is not viewpoint\\-neutral in protecting public expressions \u2013 preventing vigilante cleanups by one side while encouraging vigilante cleanups by the other side, and that would violate the First Amendment. The First Amendment does not require individuals to be viewpoint\\-neutral, only governments.\n\nYou might imagine that the drawer could file a lawsuit for damages. A possible scenario would be if the municipality set up a controlled and protected space for artistic expressions, somebody \u2013 with permission to create the work \u2013 labors over an elaborate display, and a vandal trashes it. The vandal could be sued. The difference between that and the above scenario is that you have warring ideologies, one involving the application of chalk without permission and the other involving the removal of chalk without permission.
