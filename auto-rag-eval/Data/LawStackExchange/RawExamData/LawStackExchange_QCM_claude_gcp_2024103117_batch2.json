MacOS components like xnu or dyld are licensed under Apple Public Software License, which is open\\-source license without any restriction for decompilation. Is it legal to decompile macOS executables, whose source code is already available at opensource.apple.com?\n\n[Software License Agreement For macOS Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSBigSur.pdf) states that:\n\n> N.

You are allowed to disassemble the code if copyright law allows it (only in rare situations) or the license allows it.\n\nYou need to check the exact text of the license. Most likely you don't have the right to disassemble code that has been compiled by Apple, but there would likely be some way for you to get the source code, and with the source code the right to compile your own application, and because it is your own application, the right to disassemble the code as part of your own application.\n\nNow if there is a legal way for you to disassemble the code by compiling it yourself, and there is no practical difference except wasting some of your time between this and disassembling the code as part of Apple's application, Apple might not care.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under what circumstances would it be legally permissible to decompile and analyze macOS open-source components for a blog post or screencast?\n\nA) It is always legal to decompile any macOS components, as long as the source code is available on opensource.apple.com.\n\nB) Decompilation is strictly forbidden by the macOS Software License Agreement, regardless of the component's open-source status.\n\nC) It is legal to decompile only if you first compile the open-source code yourself using the available source code, rather than decompiling Apple's pre-compiled executables.\n\nD) Decompilation is legal for any macOS component, as long as it's done for educational or non-commercial purposes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question touches on the complex interplay between Apple's general software license and the specific licenses for open-source components. The macOS Software License Agreement generally prohibits decompilation, but makes an exception for open-source components governed by their own licenses. The Apple Public Software License allows use and manipulation of the \"Original Code,\" which includes both source code and object code originally made available by Apple.\n\nHowever, the safest legal approach would be to compile the open-source code yourself using the available source code, rather than decompiling Apple's pre-compiled executables. This approach ensures you're working with code you've generated yourself, which you have more rights to manipulate under the open-source license.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the legal situation.

[Here is a resource](https://www.mit.edu/~jfc/right.html) on the various keep\\-right laws of the states. No state has a \"fast lane\" that allows speeds greater that the legal limit, nor does any state have a law requiring drivers to drive *exactly* the posted limit. Every state has some provision regarding slow\\-moving vehicles, and none frame the matter in terms of fast\\-moving vehicles. The legal convention is that slow\\-moving vehicles must be on the right, not the left. Some states have the restriction that you may not drive in the left lane except to pass, for example [625 ILCS 5/11\\-701(b), (d)](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=062500050HCh%2E%2011&ActID=1815&ChapAct=625%20%3BILCS%20%3B5%2F&ChapterID=49&ChapterName=VEHICLES&SectionID=28620&SeqStart=99900000&SeqEnd=122700000&ActName=Illinois%20Vehicle%20Code%2E).

The documentation clearly states that no state has a \"fast lane\" that allows speeds greater than the legal limit. The \"Slower Traffic Keep Right\" signs and similar regulations are aimed at preventing slow-moving vehicles from impeding traffic flow, not at encouraging speeding. These laws and signs reflect a legal convention that slow-moving vehicles should keep to the right, but they do not imply approval for exceeding speed limits in left lanes or any other lanes. The U.S. Department of Transportation does not recognize \"fast lanes\" that permit speeding, and speed limits are determined by individual states, not federal authorities. While some states have specific laws about left lane usage (e.g., only for passing), these laws do not override posted speed limits."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60912/californian-resident-travelling-in-eu-which-privacy-law-applies", "docs_id": 60912, "title": "Californian resident travelling in EU - which privacy law applies?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a Californian resident is travelling within the EU, it seems both European GDPR and Californian CCPA privacy laws will apply.\n\nSometimes businesses have single privacy emails, so if a deleting request is sent how is it responded to?

So which law will be applied?\n\n(Though not a part of the question, what if this person has dual citizenship of a third country that has different privacy laws? It would be helpful if someone could answer this last question too; it is not required but will be helpful.)\n\n**This is in response to a comment seeking differences:**\n\nFirstly a difference would be records for accountability . Obviously records to be maintained for ccpa should be separate given the format and laws .\nSecondly for gdpr there is an obligation tell about E.U. authorities that in my non lawyer knowledge is not required for ccpa .\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not an either\u2013or. You may have certain rights under both CCPA and GDPR, but they have rather different mechanisms for determining their scope.\n\n**When does the CCPA apply?**\n\nCCPA applies to certain businesses and consumers. It covers any business (regardless of legal structure) that that does business in the State of California and has a certain scale. A consumer means a natural person who is a California resident.\n\nThese aspects are not influenced by your current location. When you as a California resident travel to the EU, you still have all your CCPA rights against businesses that do business in California. You do not have any CCPA rights against businesses that don't do business in California, for example a national rail company in the EU you've bought a train ticket for.\n\n**When does the GDPR apply?**\n\nWhereas the location of the user/data subject can be a factor in the GDPR context, their residency or nationality does not.\n\nThe GDPR applies to all processing activities by data controllers who are established in the EU, including any businesses, non\\-profits, and individuals. This includes processing activities in the context of an EU establishment of a non\\-EU company. For example, GDPR would apply with respect to processing of personal data by a hotel you're staying at in the EU.\n\nThe GDPR also applies to non\\-EU data controllers in the context of (a) offering goods or services to people who are in the EU, or (b) monitoring behaviour of people who are in the EU. Here, \u201coffering\u201d does not mean \u201cdoing business\u201d, but \u201ctargeting or marketing\u201d. For example, you might have installed a smartphone app that assists with sightseeing while in Paris. If this app monitors your behaviour while you are in the EU (such as by tracking your GPS position to alert you to nearby points of interest), that would fall under the GDPR while you are in the EU. The app may also fall under the GDPR per case (a) if it is marketed to / targeted at people who are currently in Paris.\n\nThat the GDPR applies in such cases comes from the offering/monitoring while you are in the EU, not from your continued presence in the EU. You would be able to exercise your GDPR rights relating to this processing even after leaving the EU.\n\nNote that some service or processing activity can fall under CCPA and GDPR simultaneously.\nFor example, this app would also fall under CCPA if the company also does business in California, e.g. if it also provides sightseeing information for Los Angeles or San Francisco.\nAnd both CCPA and GDPR could apply when an EU company does business in California.\n\n**Under which privacy law would a deletion request be dealt with?**\n\nIn practice, most companies don't have this sorted out properly and results are unpredictable. Ideally, a company would just comply with both laws simultaneously, thus making it unnecessary to determine which law applies. Information that is only required under on law can be provided with conditional statements, e.g. \u201cIf this processing activity is covered by GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in your country\u201d.\n\nAs mentioned above, both laws can apply simultaneously. Whether GDPR applies and whether CCPA applies are independent questions. However, the answer to neither of these depends on your current location at the time of making the request.\n\nIn this answer, any statement about the EU applies equivalently to the UK.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A California resident is traveling in France and uses a smartphone app that provides sightseeing information for both Paris and Los Angeles.

CCPA applies because the user is a California resident and the app does business in California (providing information for Los Angeles). GDPR applies because the app is monitoring the behavior (GPS tracking) of a person who is currently in the EU.

It is required to keep noises at very low levels during \"quiet hours\" like at night, on Sundays and holidays. However, I'm pretty sure there are also typically noisy festivals and events in Germany.\n\nWhat if some typically noisy events fall on quiet hours? What are some exceptions for the Quiet Hours law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"Quiet Hours law\" is part of environmental protection laws: it regulates noise immissions. \n\nIn general, what is allowed differs quite a bit depending on zoning and day vs. night.  \n\nE.g. in a purely industrial area outdoor noise immission may be up to 70 dB(A) any time of the day. Whereas in hospital or nursing home zones only 45 dB(A) during the day and 35 dB(A) during the night are allowed.\n\nIt also depends on the type of noise source, e.g. construction noise has a longer night (20:00 \\- 7:00 compared to 22:00 \\- 6:00 for normal \"commercial\" noise sources) and some penalty for early/late day noise, commercial noise has a penalty\\* for early/late daytime and sundays; sports noise has day, night and quiet hours and they differ working days vs. sundays and holidays. There are no legal limits on noise emitted by children (incl. kindergarden, playgrounds), but neighborhood noise (party) does have restrictions, and machine\\-emitted noise has further restrictions. \n\n\\* penalties: some of these regulations use [weighted sound pressure levels](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bewerteter_Schalldruckpegel) that upweight certain particularly disturbing characteristics of the noise (information content of noise, particular tones sticking out, impulse\\-type\u00a0\\[sudden] noise, ...). \n\nFestivals and events are covered by the \n\n* \"recreational noise directive\" ([Freizeitl\u00e4rmrichtlinie](https://www.lai-immissionsschutz.de/documents/freizeitlaermrichtline_1503575715.pdf), state law) \n\n\t+ puts emphasis on communal planning as in don't put hospital and fair grounds or outdoor recreational swimming pool next to each other, keep some distance between the local skateboard ramp and residential housing.  \n\n\tAlso, the town market place (where fairs are held) would be an urban zone (or \"core\" zone) which has higher noise limits than a purely residential zone.\n\t+ Exceptions can be granted for rare (up to 18 days/year) events and festivals that are tightly bound to a particular location (\"hohe Standortgebundenheit\", e.g. [Kieler Woche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiel_Week), [Oktoberfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest) or the annual village fair, but also \"moving\" festivals like the [Hessentag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessentag)) or socially adequate and accepted.  \n\n\tThese exceptions can include moving the night hours up to 2 hours (usually only for Friday or Saturday evenings or evenings before public holidays).\n\n\tThe higher the (expected) noise level and the more often, the more strictly the exception has to be evaluated. Also, not more than 2 weekends in a row are supposed to be subject to such rare events, and the neighboring residents have to be told (usually \\>\\= 2 weeks in advance).\n\n\tThere are also technical measures such as focusing sound on the festival area and making sure loud speakers do not emit sound in other directions more than necessary.\n* \"sports grounds noise directive\" ([Sportanlagenl\u00e4rmschutzverordnung](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bimschv_18/BJNR015880991.html))\n\n\t+ again, higher immission levels are allowed for rare events, rare being up to 18 days/year\n\t+ exceptions can be granted for sports events of major national or international importance, so when the soccer world cup came to Germany, residents had to put up with that.\n* sometimes exceptions are granted by directive, e.g. [public viewing during the 2018 soccer world cup](https://www.bmu.de/fileadmin/Daten_BMU/Download_PDF/Laermschutz/wm_2018_laermschutz_bf.pdf)\n* Pubs are commercial businesses and subject to the [TA L\u00e4rm](http://www.verwaltungsvorschriften-im-internet.de/bsvwvbund_26081998_IG19980826.htm), but sometimes somewhat less strict rules be used (e.g. [see here for NRW](https://www.umwelt.nrw.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Broschueren/laermschutz_in_biergaerten.pdf)). A pub thus cannot be in a *purely* residential zone: where you have a pub, you are at least in a general residential zone which has higher noise limits.  \n\nDiskotheken (night clubs) are often in industrial zones.\n* A private party is so\\-called neighborhood noise (Nachbarschaftsl\u00e4rm) and imission here is governed by [state law, plus possibly communal bylaws and last but not least binding clauses in e.g. the rent contract](https://www.mietrecht.com/ruhezeiten/).\nIf there isn't any particular law (AFAIK, e.g. Hesse does not have a state law on this), there's the catch\\-all [\u00a7117 OWiG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_owig/englisch_owig.html#p0697) on Inadmissable Noise: \n\n> (1\\) Whoever, without a justified reason, or to an inadmissible extent, or to an extent avoidable under the circumstances, causes noise which is suitable to create considerable disturbance to the general public or to the neighbourhood, or to inflict harm upon the health of another, shall be deemed to have committed a regulatory offence.\n\nA common rule of thumb would be that between 22:00 \\- 6:00 and on Sundays or holidays you shouldn't do anything that can be heard outside your flat ([Zimmerlautst\u00e4rke](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmerlautst%C3%A4rke)). \n\nA typical *practical* approach is to tell your neighbours that you'll have a party and will they please excuse if there's some noise? Bonus points if you invite them. This doesn't change anything about legal noise levels, but it usually does the trick in terms of no neighbours complaining/not disturbing them.\n\n---\n\n* There are so\\-called [silent holidays](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesetzliche_Feiertage_in_Deutschland#Stille_Tage) (again state law, e.g. [NRW](http://www.lexsoft.de/cgi-bin/lexsoft/justizportal_nrw.cgi?xid=166902,7)) with particularly heavy restrictions (no sports events, no markets/fairs/circus, no recreational events, ...)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small town in Germany is planning its annual summer festival, which typically involves live music and runs late into the night.

These exceptions can include moving the night hours up to 2 hours (usually only for Friday or Saturday evenings or evenings before public holidays).

The exception would need to be evaluated based on factors such as the expected noise level and frequency of such events. The town would also need to inform neighboring residents at least 2 weeks in advance. Options A and B are incorrect as they represent extremes that don't align with the nuanced regulations described.

Or does it apply automatically without doing any paperwork?\n\nIf it's okay to use some parts of other copywriter videos? What are the limitations? Eg. Max copyrighted video length, Attribution,...etc.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fair Use\n--------\n\nFair use (in the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") which is the only jurisdiction where it applies) is defined by [17 USC 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107). It does not matter whether the user is a formal educational institution nor not. It will matter whether the use is educational or not, but that alone will not determine whether a use is a fair use or not. There is no set limit of length below which a use is a fair use. In general the more of the source that is used, the less strong the case for fair use is, but in some cases the use of the entire source can be a fair use, and in others the use of even a small fraction has been held not to be a fair use.\n\nThat a use is on a Youtube channel does not determine whether it is a fair use or not.\n\n### The Four Factors\n\nThe actual law specifying the factors to consider reads:\n\n> The fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n> \n> \n> (4\\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nCourt cases have said that no one of these factors is final \\- each must be considered. Some cases have emphasized one factor, some have emphasized another. In addition the law permits a court to consider other factors, not listed specifically in 17 USC 107\\.\n\n### The factors analyzed\n\nThe effect of the factors is, roughly:\n\nFactor (1\\) favors fair use when the use is for educational purposes. It also favors fair use when the use is not for profit. Note that this is not the same as no fee being charged. Profits made by advertising can also be considered. And a non\\-profit user may still charge a fee to cover costs.\n\nFactor (2\\) favors fair use when the original is basically factual, such as a textbook or a news report, and weighs against fair use when the original is a creative work, such as a work of fiction, a poem, or a song.\n\nFactor (3\\) favors fair use when only a small part of the original is used, and weighs against fair use when much or all of the original is used. There is **no** absolute standard for how much, either in terms of word count or duration, is allowable.\n\nFactor (4\\) favors fair use when the actual and potential market for the original is not harmed by the use. It weighs against fair use when the use might tend to reduce the paid market for the original. If an individual use would have only a minimal effect, but if many people were to make similar uses that would have a sizable negative effect on the market, that would weigh against fair use. If there is a potential market that is not being exploited currently, but which the copyright holder might exploit in future, and the use might harm such a potential market, that would weigh against fair use. In the use would tend to substitute for the original, so that people would be less likely to seek out the original, that would weigh against fair use.\n\nFair use cases often use the term \"transformative\". A use is transformative when it uses the work is a significantly different way from the original. For example, a poem may be published to cause an emotional effect on the readers. But a poetry text may use the verse as an example of a technique of poetic composition. That would be a transformative use. Being transformative is sometime thought of as a fifth factor, but more often as a way to analyze factor (1\\). In any case a transformative use is much more likely to be held to be a fair use.\n\nUS Registration\n---------------\n\nUnder current US law, any copyrightable work is protected teh moment it is \"fixed in tangible form\". This includes bein written down, and beign saved as a computer record, as well as an executed sculpture or pictorial work. (A copyright notice and Registration was required prior to 1978\\.) This matches the law in almost every other country.\n\nHowever, one must file for and obtain a certificate of registration before one can file suit in a US court for copyright infringement. In addition, unless one registers a work with the US copyright office before the infringement occurs, or within three months after the work is first published, certain rights under US law are forfeited. Specifically, the right to statutory damages, and the right to costs and attorney fees. Statutory damages can be assessed on proof of infringement, with no need to prove the amount of financial harm done or any profit by the infringer. They can range anywhere from $750 to $30,000 per work infringed, or up to $150,000 if the infringement is found to be \"willful\".

Fair use is a complex doctrine that depends on four main factors as outlined in 17 USC 107: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and (4) the effect on the potential market. All of these factors must be considered, and no single factor is determinative.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fair use does not automatically apply to all educational content, and other factors must be considered.\n\nOption B is wrong because registration with the US Copyright Office is not required to invoke fair use, although registration does provide certain benefits in case of litigation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because being non-profit alone does not guarantee fair use.

When I say \"merits\" I mean a score that would result in treatment by lenders that is significantly more consistent with what people with similar histories typically get.\n\nI presume that credit bureaus use a deterministic algorithm to calculate credit scores, in which case it wouldn't be possible to \"give someone a credit score lower than what his credit history merits.\" More accurately, it wouldn't be possible to do that without bypassing the algorithm in some way.\n\nYou might be able to argue defamation if you could prove that the credit bureau did in fact bypass its algorithm when it assigned your credit rating. You would probably have to show that your reputation was damaged because someone (i.e., a lender) knew that the ratings were deterministic and drew incorrect conclusions about you based on your incorrect score.\n\nThe problem here will be to show that the credit rating was erroneous given the credit bureau's algorithm. To do that, you'd have to get your hands on the algorithm, which seems like it would be impossible to do, so you could do the calculation yourself.\n\nEven if you *can* do that, a more likely strategy would be to pursue the credit bureau under the [Fair Credit Reporting Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Credit_Reporting_Act) or some other consumer protection law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer discovers their credit score is lower than expected, despite all information on their credit report being accurate.

Copyright law does not distinguish the various chronological states of a work as it is developed, whereby you might say that the text is really a series of 100 versions, each one being a derivative of the previous one. Instead, you have one whole work, the final product (the version of record). If you then want to recycle the text or graphics of that paper (beyond what is covered by fair use), you would need permission from the (new) rights\\-holder. You would need to scrutinize the language of the transfer agreement, but it is unlikely that any agreement also transfers copyright in earlier drafts, or elements of earlier drafts.\n\nIf an earlier version had a clearly different drawing which you also created, the courts would probably not find that you had transferred the rights to that drawing as part of the rights transfer of the version of record (assuming no explicit \"and all previous works\" clause). But if earlier versions had a minimally different drawing, it is reasonable to think that the courts would find distribution of that earlier image to be infringing. One of the main questions asked in an infringement case is whether the works are substantially similar. If your earlier version of the text has \"But\" where the published version has \"However\", the versions would be so substantially similar that the earlier version would be found to be infringing, despite not being a verbatim copy of the published version. The same goes for minor changes to drawings.

When Dr. Smith transferred copyright to the journal, it likely covered the entire work as published, including the diagram. While Dr. Smith may retain rights to earlier drafts or significantly different versions of the artwork, a slightly modified version of the published diagram could be considered substantially similar and thus infringing on the journal's copyright. Dr. Smith could potentially create a new diagram using similar base components (like individual line drawings) if the overall composition is substantially different. However, the line between \"substantially similar\" and \"different enough\" is not always clear, making this a complex copyright issue.

An EU paper on GDPR states the following (page 11, 12 of\n[Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR](https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_3_2018_territorial_scope_after_public_consultation_en_1.pdf)):\n\n> The separate question then arises of whether the processor is processing in the context of its\n> establishment in the Union. If so, the processor will be subject to GDPR processor obligations under\n> Article 3(1\\). However, this does not cause the non\\-EU controller to become subject to the GDPR\n> controller obligations. That is to say, a \u201cnon\\-EU\u201d controller (as described above) will not become\n> subject to the GDPR simply because it chooses to use a processor in the Union.\n\nConcerning the scenario above, is it sufficient to make sure that my hosting company in the EU fullfills GDPR, describe the setup (including a link to the hosting company's privacy policy) in my data policy, and point data requests to the hosting company?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is in this context important to recall what a data controller and a data processor is. The data controller is the person or entity responsible for the data processing. They determine the purposes and means of this processing. A data processor merely performs data processing on the controller's behalf.\n\nThe processor must not process data for their own purposes, but can make low\\-level decisions about the means of processing. For example, a controller may specify the purpose of ensuring the security and integrity of the services, or the purpose of creating basic statistics. The processor might implement this in part through the means of keeping a logfile. Often, such purposes are agreed upon via a data processing agreement or the terms of service, leading to the legal fiction that the processor was instructed by the controller.\n\nIn your scenario, the controller is presumably not subject to the GDPR1, and therefore does not need a clear purpose or a legal basis for their processing activities. However, the EU\\-based data processor is bound by the GDPR, and can only process data as instructed by the controller. The processor has to comply with the GDPR with respect to *how* they carry out the processing activities, but the processing activities themselves don't have to be GDPR\\-compliant. Thus, it might be perfectly fine for an EU\\-based hosting provider to keep logfiles with IP addresses, even if those logfiles wouldn't be GDPR\\-compliant.\n\n1: Whether GDPR applies to a non\\-EU data controller depends not on whether processing occurs in the EU, but on whether the controller is offering goods or services to people in the EU, or observing behaviour of people in the EU \u2013 see Art 3(2\\) GDPR.\n\nThe cited guidelines continue to enumerate which provisions of the GDPR would still apply to EU processors working on behalf of non\\-EU data controllers (pages 12\u201313\\). These requirements are about how the controller and processor work together and relate to internal compliance of the data processor, but they do not affect the processing activities themselves.\n\nYou mention that you would link to the hosting provider's privacy policy and direct data subject requests to the hoster. This misunderstands the role of the data processor. The data controller is the single point of contact for data subjects. The data processor is not a data controller in this scenario. They cannot issue a privacy policy for the controller's processing activities, and cannot respond to data subject requests. Their only relationship is with the data controller. If the hosting provider were to post a privacy policy for these processing activities, they would act like a controller (possibly a joint controller) and could bring the processing activities within scope of the GDPR \u2013 not what you are intending.\n\nHowever, since GDPR does not apply to the processing activities in this scenario, the data subject rights in the GDPR do not apply. As far as GDPR is concerned, no privacy policy is needed and no data subject requests have to be answered. If the data processor receives such requests, their only obligation is to forward them to the controller, who can then handle them (possibly ignoring them).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A non-EU website owner uses an EU-based hosting company for their simple website.

So if the discretion vests solely in the President, she can state that she won\u2019t be doing X because *she can always change her mind*, however, discretion rarely vests solely in a single office.\n\nFor the example you cite, it\u2019s likely that a number of people down the line from the President have discretion and **telling** them what to do is likely unlawful (whether anyone would sue or who might have standing is another question).

While the President has the authority to set policy priorities for executive agencies, including the Department of Justice, they cannot override the prosecutorial discretion vested in individual DOJ officials. The memorandum can serve as a guideline for policy, potentially influencing how discretion is exercised, but it cannot compel prosecutors to cease all prosecutions if they believe individual cases merit pursuit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the President must \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\" this does not preclude setting enforcement priorities.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it overstates the binding nature of the memorandum on officials with individual discretion.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the President does not need Congressional approval to set enforcement priorities, and the memorandum does not nullify the law itself.\n\nThis question tests understanding of executive power, prosecutorial discretion, and the limits of presidential directives in law enforcement."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/72793/international-law-sanctions", "docs_id": 72793, "title": "International law: sanctions", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am analyzing the United Nations Charters, specifically focusing on sanctions.

In English law, force majeure only applies if explicitly stated in the contract, which is not the case here. The doctrine of frustration is too narrow to apply, as it requires performance to become impossible, not just more difficult or expensive.

If the advisor is an expert in the field he or she is advising about?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The most important consideration is whether you're giving advice \"as\" something special. An example would be claiming to be a medical doctor and advising people to do something clearly harmful such as \"take 10 Tylenol and call me next week\". In such an extreme case, there could be criminal charges. Less severe would be an accountant giving grossly wrong and incompetent tax advice to a client, in which case the accountant could be civilly liable. (For instance, telling a client \"you don't have to declare royalties for textbook sales\"). In such cases, a client depends on the professional to give competent advice, and you rely on him to work according to a certain professional standard of care. There is a difference between the standard of care that an ordinary \"reasonable person\" owes to any other person, and the standard of care owed by a professional in an area. What would be excusable bad advice that I might give on how to build a wall would be inexcusable if given by an engineer.\n\nThe basic idea is that if you interact with a person (even indirectly, manufacturing something that a 3rd party buys), you have a certain duty to be cautious. If this is just an ordinary\\-person on ordinary\\-person interaction, then the parties (both parties) are expected to exhibit the degree of caution that a \"reasonable person\" would exhibit (attempts to pin down what a \"reasonable person\" would do have proven impossible, though juries always know subjectively what a reasonable person would do). However, your duty to not give bad advice is offset by the advice\\-taker's duty to not take bad advice \u2013 that is, if a reasonable person would know that taking 10 Tylenol is a bad idea (thus I, as a non\\-physician might have some duty to not give such stupid advice), then the person who stupidly took 10 Tylenol was contributorily negligent in taking the 10 Tylenol.\n\nAs far as I can tell, if you do not represent yourself as a member of a technical guild (lawyer, doctor, accountant, many others) giving technical advice in that capacity, and you are not directly contracting with a person (i.e. they hire you to give them advice on how to keep your yard from falling over the cliff), then you can say stuff like \"If X, then you should Y\", and not have to pay if someone does that Y and they suffer a loss.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A popular fitness blogger with no medical qualifications regularly posts workout and nutrition advice on their website.

Criminal charges are unlikely unless the blogger falsely claimed medical credentials. The correct answer is C because even without professional qualifications, the blogger still has a duty to exercise reasonable care when giving advice that could potentially harm others. A court would likely consider factors such as the blogger's influence, the specificity of the advice, and whether a reasonable person in the blogger's position should have known the advice could be harmful.

The correct answer, C, fulfills these requirements:\n\n1. The patient is experiencing unbearable suffering.\n2. The request for euthanasia is voluntary.\n3. The patient is aware of their condition.\n4. The patient is likely terminally ill, implying that their condition is incurable and progressive.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the patient's current state contradicts their previous wishes, and they may no longer be considered fully aware of their condition. Option B is not valid because personality changes alone, without unbearable physical suffering, do not qualify for euthanasia under current laws.

Are there any known examples of a grand jury \"going rogue\" as they describe?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Traditionally, anyone could bring a bill of indictment to a grand jury. [This article](http://www.constitution.org/lrev/roots/runaway.htm) from Creighton Law Review provides some historical context. Government prosecutors are the overwhelming norm now, but private prosecution used to be more common. Indeed, New Jersey still has limited authorization for private prosecution (Court rule [3:23\\-9(d)](http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/r3-23.html)). The New Jersey rule governing the grand jury is [3:6](http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/rule_3_6.pdf), and rule 3:6\\-8(a) on return of indictment says:\n\n> An indictment may be found only upon the concurrence of 12 or more\n>  jurors and shall be returned in open court to the Assignment Judge or,\n>  in the Assignment Judge's absence, to any Superior Court judge\n>  assigned to the Law Division in the county.

Such judge may direct that the indictment\n>  shall be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been\n>  released pending trial and in that event it shall be sealed by the\n>  clerk, and no person shall disclose its finding except as necessary\n>  for the issuance and execution of a warrant or summons.\n\nNote that the jurors decide on an indictment and return the indictment to a judge, not the prosecutor. In the rules governing grand juries, the prosecutor is allowed to be present and to speak, but has no official controlling role, other than whatever leadership is granted by the foreman. I don't know whether it is universal that grand juries do what the prosecutor tells them to, such as indicting a ham sandwich, but at least theoretically they have the power to act independently. The rules actually do not say who can ask questions of a witness, which could lead one to conclude that of course it is the prosecutor (and that the prosecutor does everything, except vote on the indictment).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of grand jury proceedings in New Jersey, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the power and independence of grand juries?\n\nA) Grand juries can only indict based on cases presented by the prosecutor and have no independent power to call witnesses or demand evidence.\n\nB) Grand juries have the theoretical power to act independently, but in practice, they almost always follow the prosecutor's lead and cannot indict without the prosecutor's formal request.\n\nC) Grand juries have full independence to call witnesses, demand evidence, and return indictments directly to a judge, without requiring the prosecutor's approval or initiation of the process.\n\nD) Grand juries can only \"go rogue\" and act independently if explicitly authorized by the Assignment Judge of the county.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the New Jersey Court Rule 3:6-8(a), grand juries have the power to return indictments directly to a judge, not to the prosecutor. The rules do not specify that the prosecutor must initiate or approve the process. Additionally, the historical context and the quoted expert suggest that grand juries theoretically have the power to act independently, call witnesses, and demand evidence.

Does it matter if my state (Colorado) was or was not part of the team that sued them as part of the class?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can sue them in small claims court if the court has jurisdiction. If they have any presence in the state, that might be sufficient. If they have no presence in the state, then you can't sue them in any state court in your state.\n\nAbsent presence in your state, you would have to file in a state where they have a presence. (You can't file in federal court because the federal court would not have subject matter jurisdiction.)\n\nIf you didn't agree to be a member of the class, then you have preserved your right to sue. It doesn't matter if your state was or was not a member of the class.\n\nI'd have to look at the particulars, which I don't have. So I'm making some assumptions.\n\nTo file a suit against an entity, the court in which you're filing must have jurisdiction. To have jurisdiction, the entity must have at least a threshold level of presence in your state. The tiniest office will suffice. An employee in the state who works from home might do. But if the entity has no presence in the state, you have two choices.\n\n(1\\) You can file a diversity suit in federal district court, but that requires that the case has a reasonable expectation of award of more than $75,000 or presents a federal question of law.\n\n(2\\) You can file in a state court that has jurisdiction over the defendant\n\nThere's something called forum shopping, where the defendant has a presence in multiple states, albeit the headquarters is in one state, and the plaintiff seeks to sue in the state where the plaintiff is most likely to win and receive the greatest award. Courts don't like this. I'm not sure how they handle it. But surely they would want the plaintiff to justify choosing the particular forum.\n\nIt might be reasonable, for example, if the defendant's HQ is in NY, the plaintiff is in CO, the defendant doesn't have a presence in CO, but does have a presence in KS reasonably close to plaintiff. The reasoning would be that neither party is suffering a hardship. Of course, it might matter if the defendant's only KS location was a 5'x5' storage unit in Kansas City.\n\nThere may be laws that further limit where the suit may be filed. There may be a relationship between the parties that limits where the suit may be filed. There may be some arbitration thing, arising from law or relationship.\n\nThe courts may impose limitations on the options available to those who decline to join.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A LICENSED ATTORNEY.

John can sue Equifax in Colorado small claims court only if Equifax has some presence in Colorado, such as an office or employee. This is because for a court to have jurisdiction over a defendant, the entity must have at least a threshold level of presence in the state. The presence could be as minimal as a small office or even an employee working from home in the state.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Colorado's participation in the class action lawsuit does not determine John's ability to sue in small claims court. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because John cannot sue in any state's small claims court regardless of Equifax's presence.

As they seem to have a 'contact the webmaster' approach to it, is it possible to get the content (at the minimum the inacurate one) removed from their index?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR applies to such sites if they offer services in the EU/EEA. If they clearly wanted to avoid being subject to the GDPR, they should block visitors from the EEA. For the GDPR, only location matters. Other concerns like residence or citizenship are generally irrelevant.\n\nPersonal data does not turn non\\-personal just because it was public. So the GDPR still applies when the data was collected from public sources. However, the data controller (who determines the purpose of processing) often has to balance your rights and interests against other interests (e.g. when using *legitimate interest* as a legal basis for some processing). For the purpose of publicly displaying your data, only showing data that was already public anyway makes it easier to argue that this is fine.\n\nBut when the GDPR applies, you have data subject rights. Relevant rights include:\n\n* a right to access, to see all the data they have about you\n* a right to rectification, to correct wrong data they hold about you\n* a right to restriction, effectively an opt\\-out\n* a right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)\n\nThese rights apply both against the website and against Google Search (arguably, both are doing the exact same thing). Google correctly points out that they can't remove information from the Web, but they can hide information from search results.\n\nIf you feel that your requests have not been resolved correctly, you can issue a complaint with your country's data protection authority.

However, the judge declares that Ahok is guilty anyway.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. Indonesia Law uses Civil Law structures which use an Inquisitorial Trial. The chief difference is that in the United States (which has a Common Law Structure) the judge usually does not decide the case, but interprets the law (Trier of Law) and with a few exceptions, will determine the sentence once guilt is found. The Jury decides the case (Trier of Fact) and pronounces guilt (It is the right of the defense to request a Bench Trial, which gives the Judge both roles. The prosecution cannot object to this request).\n\nIn a Civil Court, the big difference is that their is no Jury and the Judge has both roles (Trier of Law, and Trier of Fact). As the name suggests, rather than two sides fighting each other (adversarial), the two sides are answering questions posed to them by the Judge or usually a panel of Judges are used and the Judge may initiate further investigation in the evidence.\n\nThe United States does use Inquisitional Trials from time to time, but they are often seen in misdemeanors, traffic courts, and small claims courts. The latter is a popular daytime TV genre (think Judge Judy) while misdemeanors and traffic court decisions are often time funny and make great Youtube videos. There are not many great Adversarial media as many throw out rules for time sake (real U.S. trials have many long boring periods during testimony) and story/drama sake.

These requirements are generally set out in a law commonly known as the Statute of Frauds. *See* the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_frauds).

A failure to return the object for 1000 days means the entire amount due is payable, in addition to the fee for replacement.

The crux of the procedural dance is their receipt of official notices and counter notices, and their responses. The trigger is a sworn statement by the copyright holder: in the scenario that you describe, there is no such take\\-down notice. A take\\-down notice is directed at a specific infringement (delivered to Youtube), and the required remedy is that the content host must remove the copied material. This was done in the particular case, so there is no further issue.\n\nThe copyright owner would have to separately serve notice on MeTube or FreeTube for distributing the same work. SE or similar platform is not even close to the liability ballpark until it gets served with notice. YouTube, on the other hand, could be liable if they restored the content after taking it down (this is covered via the counter\\-claim and put\\-back provisions). The copyright owner's whack\\-a\\-mole department has to dilligently find all of those infringers.\n\n\"Infringing\" boils down to copying, not to \"referring to\", and in the cases you are asking about, there is no copying of the content \u2013 there is a reference (link) to allegedly infringing material. The case [Intellectual Reserve, Inc. v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry, Inc.](https://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/cjoyce/copyright/release10/intres.html), 75 F. Supp. 2d 1290 gives indications of what actions *other than* actual copying might be deemed \"contributory infringement\". The court points out that browsing anything requires copying \u2013 \"in making a copy, even a temporary one, the person who browsed infringes the copyright\" \u2013\nalthough if the person browsing \"was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages\". So yes, there is always potential for end\\-users to be sued for infringement, and usually an escape hatch for innocent infringers.\n\nThe other question raised in this case, about the platform's liabilities, is somewhat mooted by the apparent age of the would\\-be infringement which sees to predate DMCA. But the case does include an element of infringement\\-by\\-link, and the court found in that instance that \"defendants have actively encouraged the infringement of plaintiff's copyright\", citing various facts where the host overtly directed users to infringing sites, for example \"Please mirror these files . . . . It will be a LOT quicker for you to download the compressed version . . . Needless to say, we need a LOT of mirror sites, as absolutely soon as possible\". This is markedly different from what happens on SE. Inline linking is generally considered safe (the burden of stopping copyright infringement is on the actual host).

Companies which do not trade are known as dormant companies and are defined at [Section 1169 of the Companies Act 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1169). It is perfectly legitimate to create and own a dormant company for as long as you wish, so long as you comply with annual filing requirements. That includes the duty to [file an annual confirmation statement](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/853A) and to [file annual (dormant) accounts](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/441).\n\n> I also found Ownr which let's me pay CAD $49 (one time fee) to\n> register a sole proprietorship\n\nA sole proprietorship is not a company; it's merely you as an individual operating as a business.

Do I need to worry about filing taxes even if I don't\n> get any revenue/expenses as I won't really be doing any business\n> activities?\n\nYes, there is a pitfall. The parties to the contract will be the service provider, and your company. Therefore your premise that there are no \"*revenue / expenses as I won't really be doing any business activities*\" is wrong. It will be the company purchasing the services and then reselling them (or gifting them) to you. Accordingly, your company will no longer be dormant and will be subject to the usual accounting and tax rules that apply to trading companies.\n\nThere are ways around this; for example the company can act as your agent for the purposes of entering into the contract and, provided that you pay for the services from your personal funds, the company may still be able to remain dormant. You would probably also need to inform the service provider of the agency arrangement as undisclosed principals can result in a deemed contract between the service provider and the agent.

It is a legitimate interest to comply with standard security practices.

Option A is incorrect because GDPR does not always require consent for processing personal data. Option B is false as IP logging isn't prohibited. Option C is correct, reflecting Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR, which allows processing for legitimate interests like security without explicit consent, if it doesn't override user rights.

A cheaper inheritance process when there is wide confidence debts are low compared to goods and rights? A way for creditors to mate with notaries in order to trick naive inheritors not using inventory benefit? Both?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a tradeoff between the delay and administrative costs associated with the Spanish equivalent of a probate proceeding, and the limitation of liability for the debts of a decedent that the proceeding can provide.\n\nIf you take the assets \"pure and simple\" you have to assume all of the decedent's debts with them, even if it might turn out that those debts exceed the value of the assets that you inherited. This is much cheaper and faster.\n\nBut, if you do not, and insist on an inventory and formal administration, if the estate is insolvent (i.e. if it is not able to pay all of the decedent's debts with the proceeds of the decedent's assets), then the worst case scenario for the heir is that you get no inheritance and the creditors of the decedent don't get paid to the extent that the decedent's assets aren't sufficient to pay them in full.\n\nIf you know that the estate is insolvent, or if the insolvency is a close thing or the insolvency is hard to evaluate because the debts of the decedent are unliquidated (e.g. a potential lawsuit for a personal injury the decedent caused) or complex (e.g. for a decedent with complex business deals), you would not want to take \"pure and simple\" and risk being exposed to those debts unless you felt a personal moral obligation to pay those creditors from your own funds anyway.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Juan's wealthy uncle has recently passed away, leaving behind a complex estate with various business interests.

Accepting purely and simply would make Juan responsible for all debts, even if they exceed the value of the inheritance.\nB) Rejecting the inheritance outright may cause Juan to miss out on potentially valuable assets if the estate is actually solvent.\nC) This is the most prudent option.

The documentation provides key insights:\n\n1. Federal law (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981) prohibits racial discrimination in franchising, but does not cover religious discrimination. The text specifically states: \"discrimination on the basis of religion in franchising contracts is not prohibited by federal law.\"\n\n2. However, some states have broader anti-discrimination laws that may prohibit religious discrimination in franchising. The passage notes: \"although it is prohibited by state law in some states.\"\n\n3. Answer A is incorrect because private companies do not have unlimited discretion in franchising decisions, as evidenced by federal protections against racial discrimination.\n\n4. Answer B is incorrect because religious discrimination is not treated the same as racial discrimination under federal law in the franchising context.\n\n5.

This says that statehood doesn't depend on recognition by other states; it merely requires four things:\n\n* A defined territory\n* A permanent population\n* An effective government\n* The capacity to enter into relations with other states.\n\nYou immediately run into issues around the defined territory (you don't really have one) and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. But let's ignore those for a second. Meeting these requirements in some abstract world doesn't mean you get *treated* like a state. If no one else agrees with your claim to statehood and they act inconsistently with it, you have little recourse. You might get them not caring enough to do anything about it, but if they decide you're not a country you're out of luck.\n\nYou have some misconceptions about statehood as well. A country is allowed to forbid trade with any foreign country, even ones it recognizes as sovereign states. See: US embargo on Cuba. It is also entitled to deny foreign ships access to its ports. Ships flying the flag of a sovereign state are entitled to innocent passage through territorial waters of another state, but not to the use of that state's ports.\n\nA country can certainly allow people to be killed and still be a country. See: the US, which has the death penalty for certain crimes. But if you're killing nationals of a foreign country, that foreign country is likely to take a keen interest in your activities. If the killings are judicially\\-ordered executions based on violations of your penal laws, that's one thing \\-\\- Australia might consider it awful that an Australian citizen was shot by Indonesia for drug smuggling, but they recognize that Indonesia is a real country with its own laws that it has a right to apply. If it's just lawless there, the keen interest might culminate in a travel warning.

The length of time the business owner has been using the logo does not overcome this requirement.

What matters is when it was *delivered*. The rebuttable presumption is that the notice is effective when it would have been \"delivered in the ordinary course of post\" (e.g. next day for first class, etc.). To rebut that, the burden of proof shifts to the recipient, who must prove (on balance of probabilities in a civil case) that it was delivered late or not at all. In practice that will be extremely difficult in the majority of cases.\n\nYou might try to make an argument that \"letter containing the document\" implies an envelope. However, in my view, the ordinary meaning of the word letter means a piece of paper with some written words on it.

In fact, the definition is much broader.\n\nOption B is incorrect because CERD has not issued a specific definition of \"race.\" Instead, it has adopted General Recommendations to clarify protections for various groups without explicitly categorizing them.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the convention's definition of racial discrimination is not limited to race and color only.

This addresses the landlord's concern directly and removes the basis for the notice. While the landlord's entry without notice may be questionable, pursuing legal action (option A) is likely an overreaction and could escalate the situation unnecessarily. Ignoring the notice due to a minor typo (option B) is unwise, as clerical errors are generally not sufficient grounds to invalidate such notices.

The legality of posting copyrighted material, even short clips, is not straightforward and depends on various factors.
