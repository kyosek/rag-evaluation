Since we can't trademark a meme, we can't sue other people for using a similar name, but can we be sued by someone for using a meme, which is public domain? I am wondering if we can be sued outside of trademark or copyright reasons for using a meme in the naming of a company or product since it may cause confusion of sort or because we're using something that is in the public domain, which may hurt the public interest in some way.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A phrase which is too generic or in too wide currnt use to be a valid trademark, may nevertheless be used as a business name or slogan.\n\nFor example \"Good Pizza\" is so generic that I am reasonably sure that it could not be registered as a trademark, but a business could use that as a name or slogan. A business that did so would forgo any of the advantages of trademark protection or of having a clearly unique name, but as no one else owns trademark rights to the phrase either, no one could sue such a business over its choice of name, or not with any hope of success.\n\nSimilarly, if a phrase taken from a meme cannot be registered, no one else can have it as a trademark, and so no one can sue successfully.\n\nAs to copyright, names, titles, and short phrases are simply not protectable by copyright at all. See the US Copyright office circular 01 \"Copyright Basics\" which says on page 2;\n\n> Copyright does not protect ... Titles, names, short phrases, and slogans\n\nCircular 33 \"Works Not Protected by Copyright\" says on pages 2\\-3:\n\n> **Names, Titles, Short Phrases**\n> \n> \n> Words and short phrases, such as names, titles, and slogans, are uncopyrightable because they contain an insufficient amount of authorship. The Office will not register individual words or brief combinations of words, even if the word or short phrase is novel, distinctive, or lends itself to a play on words.\n> \n> \n> Examples of names, titles, or short phrases that do not contain a sufficient amount of creativity\n> to support a claim in copyright include:\n> \n> \n> * The name of an individual (including pseudonyms, pen names, or stage names)\n> * The title or subtitle of a work, such as a book, a song, or a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work\n> * The name of a business or organization\n> * The name of a band or performing group\n> * The name of a product or service\n> * A domain name or URL\n> * The name of a character\n> * **Catchwords or catchphrases**\n> * Mottos, slogans, or other short expressions\n\nAs for\n\n> ... if we can be sued outside of trademark or copyright reasons\n\nTrademark and copyright are basically the only kinds of suit likely to be brought over a business name, logo or similar identification, particularly in the fact patter discussed in the question. (However, see the section on \"fraud\" below.) Things that are in the public domain are free for anyone to use, not protected **against** anyone's use. What is not permitted is trying to claim an exclusive right to PD items., by a copyright or trademark claim.\n\nThe one exception I can think of is that if someone had established a phrase as a trademark, and it **later** became a meme, then **perhaps** the trademark owner could sue over uses of it. But with the phrase having become generic, it might well lose any trademark protection.\n\nThe first thing a plaintiff must do in presenting a trademark suit is establish that the mark is a currently valid trademark, owned by the plaintiff. If the mark is not a valid tm, the suit is over because it has no protection.\n\nFraud\n-----\n\nA comment states:\n\n> ... Intentionally misleading others to believe you are a particular party using a non\\-protectable name, when in fact you are a different party, seems like fraud, and it very much hinges on the name/similar identification.\n\nIn the fact patter from this comment, the name is derived from a **meme**, and so there is no other particular person. In that case one cannot plausibly be deceiving anyone into thinking that a business is actually a different business, because there is no business which is **uniquely** identified by the name.\n\nStill, it is possible for fraud to occur in a fact pattern similar to this. Say a local store calls itself \"good pizza\", a name not protect able as a trademark, because it is too generic. But it is popular and has a good reputation. Another store, hoping to confuse customers, calls itself \"Goode Pizza\". A customer calls \"Goode Pizza\" and aks \"Are you the Good Pizza on George Street?\" (which is the location of the first store. An employee answers \"Yes\" (falsely) and the customer then places a delivery order. That **might** be fraud.\n\nFor a fraud case, in most jurisdictions, it must be proved that:\n\n1. A person knowingly made a **false statement** (or in some jurisdictions an intentionally misleading statement\");\n2. with the **intention** of getting a financial advantage, or depriving another of an advantage or benefit;\n3. The statement was **material** to the transaction (meaning that the other party might well have not agreed to the transaction, or demanded different terms, in the absence of the fraudulent statement);\n4. The other party **relied** on the fraudulent statement;\n5. it was **reasonable** for the other party to rely on the fraudulent statement; and\n6. **harm** was done to the other party as a result of this reliance.\n\nSome jurisdictions omit or modify some of these elements.\n\nIn the Good Pizza / Goode Pizza scenario above, ther is a knowingly false statement. Since the customer asked about the identity of the store, it can be assumed that it was material to the transaction. The imitation of the other store's name suggests an intention to mislead, although more proof might be needed. There was reliance, and it was probably reasonable. What is not clear is the harm done \\-\\- additional evidence might be needed on that element. This scenario is, however, rather different from the situation discussed in the question.\n\nNote that in the US, trademarks can be protected from mere use, without registration, if they otherwise qualify. In general there will be a preference to frame such a case as one of trademark infringement, rather than fraud, if possible, because fraud is usually harder to prove (trademark infringement dose notr require proof of intention to mislead nor of knowing falsehood), and statutory damages may be available in a trademark infringement case, without any need to prove actual damages.

I agree that if any portion is held invalid or unenforceable, I will continue to be bound by the remaining terms.\" What legal concept does this clause represent, and what is its primary purpose?\n\nA) Indemnification - To protect the drafting party from all legal liability\nB) Severability - To ensure the rest of the contract remains enforceable if part is found invalid\nC) Force Majeure - To excuse performance in case of unforeseen circumstances\nD) Novation - To substitute a new contract for the original one if any part is unenforceable\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This clause represents the legal concept of severability. The primary purpose of a severability clause is to ensure that if any portion of the contract is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the contract will still be binding on the parties. This protects the overall intent of the agreement and prevents the entire contract from being voided due to a single problematic clause.

The concept of \"probable consequence\" does not require absolute certainty (ruling out A) or that the consequence be more likely than not to occur (ruling out B). For non-murder offenses, an objective test is applied (ruling out C, which describes a subjective test). The correct approach, as suggested by case law, is to consider whether a reasonable person ought to have known that the offense was a substantial or real possibility, not just a negligible one, even if it wasn't necessarily more probable than not.

You seem to gear the bulk of your inquiry toward when the government can search, but then move to when a corporate entity has the right to do so, which is a very different thing. These are different issues with different concepts and rules that dictate when this can occur lawfully. You might want to narrow your question a bit.\n\nBy way of generalization: the citizens of the U.S. *have* an *implied* right to privacy as construed through the Bill of Rights, even though there is no explicit right written into the constitution. The most common way to conduct a search in the U.S. is with probable cause through a search warrant. There are questions and answers both on here, as well as resources all over the internet, pertaining to constitutionally accepted forms of search and seizure such that you could get that information fairly easily. However, as with the U.K., and despite any rights (explicit or implicit), there are many ways your computer could be searched by the government \\- both known to the owner and unknown \\- and even remotely, that use means less common to the standard search warrant. As you've probably heard from the revelations of Edward Snowden (Wikileaks), the governments of the world have been shown to search metadata and other electronic records without a warrant under laws aimed toward protecting national security. In the U.S. the Patriot Act gave wide reaching powers to invade the privacy of individuals that required no oversight or basis for doing so. Corporations that deal with the transmission of data work with government entities to to accomplish this end.\n\nAs one individual has already noted, you subject yourself to search (which includes your computer) upon entry to the country through customs. There are many ways that the government can and does engender to search computers, computer files, emails, metadata, etc.\n\nA corporation may search your personal computer under a contractual relationship you create with it (for instance if you work from home and elect to use your home computer, and to do so you elect to agree to allow the entity to inspect your computer for their intellectual property in certain circumstances). They can also do this pursuant to a civil lawsuit, which can allow for the inspection of your computer through the process of discovery. \n\nThese are just some of the ways your information can become subject to inspection (search) by government or corporate entities.

The shop contained two chairs, one staffed by Dunahoo, the other by shop owner Murphy. Had the customer chosen Murphy and tipped him it would have been legal since Murphy was a proprietor, not an employee. Dunahoo's arrangement with Murphy was that he was to receive a salary of $15 a week plus 60 percent of his billings above that amount, plus tips. **When the case went to the Iowa Supreme Court, it turned on the discriminatory nature of the bill, which, contrary to the United States and Iowa constitutions, denied equal protection under its laws to all citizen \u2014 separate classes were established.** Dunahoo's conviction was reversed by a 4\u20132 margin.

Murder is not a strict liability crime, so the ability of the defendant to form the intent to commit the crime is relevant.\n\n* In the case of the Charleston church shooting, the defendant was twice evaluated for competence to stand trial.\n\nAgain, no doubt about who did it, but most if not all jurisdictions require a defendant to be sufficiently sane to participate in their defense.\n\n* In the case of the Parkland shooting, the initial delay was confusion over who the defense lawyer would be.\n\nFlorida will only provide a public defender to someone who cannot afford their own defense lawyer, and it took nearly a year to determine that the defendant had inherited enough money to afford a private lawyer. Due to this delay, the trial was initially scheduled for mid\\-2020, which caused it to be delayed by the COVID\\-19 outbreak.\n\n* In the case of the Tree of Life shooting, it appears to be straight\\-up delaying tactics by the defense.\n\nThere are a great many motions, appeals of motions, requests for delay, and other things a lawyer can do to slow things down.

The passage illustrates that delays in high-profile criminal cases are often due to various legal procedures and circumstances, rather than just evidence gathering. Examples include competency evaluations in the Charleston church shooting case, an insanity plea in the Aurora theater shooting case, confusion over legal representation in the Parkland shooting case, and deliberate delaying tactics by the defense in the Tree of Life shooting case.

This provides a clear record of when the user gave consent and for which version of the agreement. While other options like IP addresses or the full text of the agreement can be helpful, the date stamps directly evidence the user's action of consent, which is key for contract enforceability.

Clayton County, Georgia, No. 17\\-1618 (S. Ct. June 15, 2020\\),\\[1] the Supreme Court held that firing individuals because of their sexual orientation or transgender status violates Title VII\u2019s prohibition on discrimination because of sex.\n\nIndividuals who identify as non\\-human animals report sexual aspects of their identity to academic researchers (Brooks *et al* 2022\\. PMID [35576143](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35576143/)):\n\n> evidence was found that most furries did, indeed, report being sexually attracted to various facets of their furry interest (e.g., furry\\-themed media) and were sexually motivated to engage in various furry\\-themed behaviors (e.g., interacting with other furries)\n\nThus, my question is if individuals who identify as non\\-human animals are members of a [protected class](https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/small-business/3-who-protected-employment-discrimination) with respect to employment discrimination. Could such an individual assert this protection through the sexual orientation class?\n\nThe question focuses on the United States, but I would also be interested in prospectives from around the world.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, no. This is because \"protected class\" is defined statutorily for a particular purpose, for example \"civil rights\", \"employment\", \"housing\". There can be variation in federal vs. state or municipal protected classes and what classes have which rights (e.g. \"race\" is included in all protected classes but pregnancy\\-discrimination is not federally protected w.r.t. housing), but so far nobody has defined \"self\\-identifies as non\\-human\" as a protected class.\n\nIf Congress were to pass a blanket law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of species, then (1\\) it would be illegal to not consider my dog as a job candidate and (2\\) it would be illegal to take into consideration whether a job candidate is a human versus a dog or a fern. But there is no such law.\n\n\"Non\\-binary\" is not, per se, a protected class. The rationale of Bostock v. Clayton County is that one cannot legally discriminate based on whether a person is male or female, therefore one cannot legally discriminate based on whether one is a male who has sex with a female versus whether one is a male who has sex with a male, or whether one is a male who abjures sex, because they all reduce to discrimination based on whether one is male (or female).

Under this test *Schenck* would hav gone the other way. This test says nothing about the truth of the speech, and a perfectly true statement may nevertheless be incitement if it seeks to arouse lawless action, and is likely to succeed.\n\n*Near vs Minnesota* held that bare truth must be a defense in any prior restraint case (unlike truth published \"with good motives and for justifiable ends\" which the saturate at issue in *Near* allowed as a defense), but went on to greatly restrict any prior restraint, even if the content was false.\n\nDefamation is really the primary situation in which falsity is a vital element of the offense, and so truth is a defense.\n\nFalsity is an element of perjury also, and so truth would be an absolute defense there as well. Falsity is also an element of the common\\-law tort of fraud, and of most statutory versions of fraud, but in some of those a true but misleading statement can still be held fraudulent, so truth is not an absolute defense.\n\nI cannot think of another such legal situation.\n**Updatew:**\n\nA comment asked:\n\n> What if I inform all of Joe's neighbours that Joe had been arrested for murder \\- when I fully know that he was completely exonerated and the real murderer is in jail right now.

As those statements are false, and apparently knowingly false, they can be the basis of a defamation action.

Suppose a person commits an offence, for example robbery, and is sentenced to jail for one year. After serving his time he does the same thing again and now is sentenced to two years' imprisonment instead of one just because of the earlier crime. The extra year he is required to serve is just because of the first crime, but he has already been charged, sentenced and served his time for that crime.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Habitual offender laws are written such that they represent distinct crimes. In your given example, the trier of fact will be asked to judge two distinct crimes:\n\n* Did the defendant rob the bank\n* Did the defendant break the habitual offender act\n\nAn example from California, [Penal Code Section 193\\.7](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=193.7.) defines habitual offenders for traffic offenses:\n\n> A person convicted of a violation of subdivision (b) of Section 191\\.5 that occurred within seven years of two or more separate violations of Section 23103, as specified in Section 23103\\.5, of, or Section 23152 or 23153 of, the Vehicle Code, or any combination thereof, that resulted in convictions, shall be designated as an habitual traffic offender subject to paragraph (3\\) of subdivision (e) of Section 14601\\.3 of the Vehicle Code, for a period of three years, subsequent to the conviction. The person shall be advised of this designation pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 13350 of the Vehicle Code.\n\nThe conviction of being an habitual traffic offender is applied an underlying statute's sentencing guidelines. In the case of [California's Vehicle Code 14601\\.3(e)(3\\)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=14601.3.&lawCode=VEH):\n\n> Any habitual traffic offender designated under Section 193\\.7 of the Penal Code or under subdivision (b) of Section 23546, subdivision (b) of Section 23550, subdivision (b) of Section 23550\\.5, or subdivision (d) of Section 23566 who is convicted of a violation of Section 14601\\.2 shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for 180 days and by a fine of two thousand dollars ($2,000\\). The penalty in this paragraph shall be consecutive to that imposed for the violation of any other law.\n\nIn this case, there is enhanced sentencing if one is convicted of the crime of driving under a suspended or revoked license if the person is also convicted of being an habitual traffic offender.\n\nThe [jury instruction template used](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/3100/3250/) when determining if an enhanced sentence is warranted requires that the defendant be found guilty of the underlying crime as well as the additional allegation of the sentencing factor:\n\n> If you \ufb01nd the defendant guilty of the crime\\[s] charged in Count\\[s]\n>  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\[,] \\[or of attempting to commit (that/those) crime\\[s]]\\[ or thelesser crimes\\[s] of ], you must then decide whether\\[, for each crime,] the People have proved the additional allegation that \\<*insert description of enhancement, sentencing factor, or factual issue*\\>. \\[You must decide whether the People have proved this allegation for each crime and return a separate \ufb01nding for each crime.\n> \n> \n> To prove this allegation, the People must prove that:\n> \n> \n> \\<*Insert elements required.*\\>\n> \n> \n> The People have the burden of proving each allegation beyond a reasonable doubt.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal process and rationale behind this situation?\n\nA) The defendant is being punished twice for the same crime, violating the principle of double jeopardy.\n\nB) The habitual offender statute creates a separate offense that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, in addition to the robbery charge.\n\nC) The sentencing enhancement is automatically applied based on the defendant's criminal history, without requiring additional proof.\n\nD) The jury only needs to determine guilt for the robbery charge, while the judge independently decides on the habitual offender status.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Habitual offender laws are structured to create distinct crimes that must be proven separately from the underlying offense. In this case, the prosecution would need to prove both the robbery charge and the habitual offender allegation beyond a reasonable doubt. This approach allows for enhanced sentencing without violating double jeopardy principles, as the defendant is not being punished again for a previous crime but rather for a new offense of being a repeat offender.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the habitual offender statute creates a new offense, avoiding double jeopardy issues. Option C is wrong because the habitual offender status must be proven, not automatically applied.

The defendant makes a motion to have the evidence from the search suppressed on the grounds that the police had no probable cause to search the vehicle. Whether the police had probable cause in the case is complex issue involving many different facts. Let's imagine that one of these facts is that the police officer stated that the car owner's mechanic told him that the the car's airbag system had been tinkered with, a violation of US Federal regulations. During oral argument the defense argues that the possible violation of a Federal regulation is not grounds for a search. The judge then speaks out and says that violation of a regulation is still a crime and therefore potentially grounds for search. Later, in the written decision, the judge dismisses the motion to suppress, but does not explicitly give his reasons or gives other reasons, not involving the violation of a regulation.\n\nSo, let's assume for the sake of argument that the judge made an error when he stated that violating a regulation is a \"crime\" and therefore grounds for local police to search a vehicle.

There is more to that determination than how the company labels you, but that is a starting point. Based on the minimal autonomy that you imply that you have, you would probably be found to be an employee. Then there are [limits on the number of hours](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41#BK32) that you can work in a week or day, which they are complying with. The employer is required to [record the hours that you worked](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41#BK28), and it is a [crime to keep false records](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41#BK256). It is also required that an employer pay for the time you work. Therefore the employer cannot legally refuse to pay you for your labor, and they cannot legally falsify records.\n\nThe employer can limit your pay to 15 hours per week, if you work just 15 hours per week. They can also set ridiculous performance standards, whereby at the end of the week you will not have done what they wanted you to do. Their only recourse is to [dismiss you](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41#BK127). In response, you can [file a complaint](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/00e41#BK200), but note that the concept of \"wrongful dismissal\" under the act is about entitlement to termination or severance pay. The arbitrator may find that the employer contravened the act, and can order them to rescind the termination. Or, before you get fired, you can complain and the arbitrator could order the employer to either modify their work requirements or else to pay you for the time worked.\n\nThe difficult point (for you) in this case is that the act does not address employer performance expectations, and employers are generally allowed to set their own performance standards. If you have a written employment contract, there might be provisions regarding termination which could help you. Without a written contact, there is no statutory provision that prevents an employer for terminating you, but they may have to give you notice and pay for doing so, as long as you are not terminated for \"just cause\".

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The employer's actions are legal as long as they clearly communicate performance standards to the employee.\n\nB) The employer can legally limit pay to 15 hours per week regardless of actual hours worked, as long as they don't exceed daily or weekly work hour limits.\n\nC) The employer is violating labor laws by not paying for all hours worked and potentially falsifying work records.\n\nD) The employee has no recourse as long as they are classified as a contract worker rather than a regular employee.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to Ontario labor laws, employers are required to pay for all hours worked and maintain accurate records of those hours. Refusing to pay for work performed and asking employees to misreport their hours in future pay periods is a violation of labor laws. The employer cannot legally refuse to pay for labor performed, even if it exceeds a predetermined weekly limit. Additionally, falsifying work records is considered a crime. While employers can set performance standards, they cannot use this as a means to avoid paying for actual hours worked.

Do they need a gambling license?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Arguments that they are digital game items with no \"real world value\" is a very bad argument to be tried to use here. That same argument could easily be used for BitCoin, gold, or silver, and yet, those are all considered to have value. If you tried to make a casino that ONLY took one (or a combination of those) as payment, they'd still under the jurisdiction of the local gaming laws. I'll add the site is a raffle site and almost every state in the USA considers raffles \"gambling\". There are very specific requirements which can allow them to be operated but that site definitely doesn't follow any of them.\n\nIt doesn't matter who assigns the cash value to it, just that enough people assign cash value. That is all that matters and given how many users sites like OPSkins.com have (over one million users), I'd definitely have to say that these game items have enough people that consider them to have value.\n\nAlso, just because you use something that doesn't have value to an outside observer, doesn't mean it's not illegal. They could be using blades of grass for all that matters, it would still be under the jurisdiction of gaming laws if there is a major cash exchange for blades of grass. In reality is just means they're using a fiat currency and that makes sites like OPSkins.com money launderers.\n\nThe only reason the question wasn't raised earlier was because the only gambling site prior to CSGOJackpot.com was CSGOLounge.com which is located in eastern Europe. On top of that, it has no house cut and therefore it allows betting there to be classified as \"a game of skill\" since you can obtain an edge and consistently win. Though that doesn't mean it wouldn't still need a gaming license given Navada's recent decision to ban paid fantasy sports sites FanDuel and DraftKings from operating in Navada.\n\nHowever, with the rise of many other gambling sites, expect the government to come in and start saying something, especially given that about half of the game's population is under 18\\.\n\nEDIT: One last point I'll make is that to say the game company doesn't set any prices is also an invalid argument because Valve sets the prices for keys, stickers, and sticker capsules (which it sells all three directly to customers). These are all fixed prices in USD. While there are sales for the sticker stuff here and there, keys are always a fixed price of $2\\.49 USD. This never changes and therefore Valve pegs the \"value\" of a key to be at most $2\\.49 USD. Because they don't let you sell it back to them, you can sell them second hand at a lower rate but the basic rate is still based on the $2\\.49 initial sale price.\n\nAlso, given the current laws on digital properties, the Steam Community Market Terms of Service, as well as the IRS's rulings (which you can confirm with an IRS agent), it all comes down to the secondary transfers of items being viewed as being taxable.

The answer explains that enough people assign cash value to these items, and there are marketplaces like OPSkins.com where these items are traded. The document also mentions that raffles, which these sites essentially operate, are considered gambling in most U.S. states. Additionally, it points out that the fact that Valve (the game company) sets fixed USD prices for certain in-game items further establishes their real-world value. The answer also notes that these transactions are likely taxable, which further supports their economic value.

They have inquisitorial power and decide the case based on all the evidence, the law that was argued and their own knowledge of the law.\n\nPrecedence\n----------\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, the cases decided by the courts are just as much the law of the land as the acts passed by parliament. When a court hands down a decision on a certain fact pattern, then all courts lower in the hierarchy **must** make the same decision when presented by a similar fact pattern. These are binding precedents.\n\nIn addition, decisions of same level or lower courts (where not actually the ones being appealed) as well as decisions in \"parallel\" jurisdictions are persuasive precedents. A parallel jurisdiction is anything where the law is close enough that it makes sense to use it: Australian courts will tend to look first to other Australian states, then to England \\& Wales, Canada, New Zealand and other Commonwealth countries then the United States of America and then to civil law jurisdictions. There is nothing nativist in this, it is just that these are the jurisdictions where the laws are \"closest\" to one another: partly because the courts have historically done this (which tends to lock the common law together), partly because there has been governmental will in creating harmonized laws in Australia (i.e. enacted in each state and territory but essentially the same law \\- often word for word) and partly because parliaments, when drafting legislation, nick ideas from other parliaments.\n\nIf the Supreme Court of Western Australia has made a decision on a similar fact pattern under a similar law, a District Court judge in New South Wales had better have some damn good reasons for deciding this case differently but they wouldn't automatically be wrong if they did. However, if the precedent had been set in the Supreme Court of New South Wales than the District Court judge would be wrong to decide differently.\n\nNaturally, a *lot* of argument in common law courts is about why the facts of this case are sufficiently similar/distinct that the precedent should/shouldn't apply. Also, common law judgments emphasize the reasoning that led the judge from the evidence to the conclusion and include detailed analysis of the case each party presented \\- this is because they need to be understandable to a wide audience.\n\nCourt hierarchy can be quite complex, this is the one for NSW, Australia:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXdxa.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXdxa.jpg)\n\nIn a civil law jurisdiction, courts are not bound by the rules of precedence \\- each judgement is a first principles analysis of the facts and the law. This is not to say that civil law judges do not use other judgments in their analysis but they are not *required* to do so.\n\nBroadly speaking, the common law approach promotes consistency, the civil law approach promotes individualized justice.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the key differences between common law and civil law systems?\n\nA) Common law relies solely on statutory codes, while civil law is based entirely on judicial precedents.\n\nB) In common law, judges have inquisitorial powers, while in civil law, judges are limited to the arguments presented by the parties.\n\nC) Common law systems prioritize consistency through binding precedents, while civil law systems focus on individualized justice through first-principles analysis.\n\nD) Civil law jurisdictions always have a unified civil code, while common law jurisdictions never codify their laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because both systems use a combination of statutory law and case law, though they prioritize them differently. \n\nOption B inverts the roles - it's actually civil law judges who have more inquisitorial powers, while common law judges are more constrained by the arguments presented.\n\nOption C correctly captures a key distinction: common law systems emphasize consistency through binding precedents, while civil law systems allow judges more flexibility to analyze each case from first principles, potentially leading to more individualized outcomes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the presence or absence of a unified civil code is not a defining feature of either system.

The only thing that matters is what a \"reasonable person\" looking at the videos would have thought. Context might make a difference; if the videos were made by an identifiable company then a reasonable person might assume the producers would have at least obtained consent and complied with their local laws about safety.

If \"pornography\" could only refer to consensual images then the prosecution would need to obtain evidence of the consent or otherwise of the participants.

A decent percentage of his disposable income is due to Bob's illegal activities, but he has some disposable income coming from his legal activities. Both sources of income are placed into a bank, and bob then makes payments using a credit/debit card.\n\nI'm wondering where the line is drawn for stating that someone has received illegal goods, as there is no longer a way to tell what money was legally earned and what was illegally earned. I'm wondering both in cases in which one is aware of bobs illegal activities and in cases where the receiver of the money does not know it's illegal, but could still be compelled to refund it if it were illegally obtained.\n\nA few examples of the ambiguous situations I can think of:\n\nI assume if Bob buys a single drink at a local bar this would not be ruled as spending illegal money and the bar would not be committing an offense even if the owner of the bar was aware that Bob had an illegal income source, as Bob could easily purchase a drink with his legal income.\n\nLikewise I assume if bob goes out to buy a Yacht that he could never afford with his legal income it would be considered to be purchased with illegal profits.\n\nHowever, what about a more ambiguous case. If bob buys an expensive fur coat for someone, which he could afford to do with his legal income, but which he likely wouldn't have chosen to spend money on if he didn't have the additional illegal income, does the coat count as profiting from illegal goods? \n\nWhat if Bob offers a smaller sum of money to many people, small enough that Bob could easily afford to give such a gift to one person, but the combined cost of so many small gifts adds up to an amount bob couldn't/wouldn't have been able to afford without his supplementary income? Could someone argue that the gift they received from Bob came from his legal income, but the other gifts Bob made to others was due to Bob's illegal activities, by claiming Bob was likely to give a gift to them without the extra illegal income but not to the others etc?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For the offense of receiving stolen goods, \"tracing\" does not usually apply. It must be the actual good stolen and not proceeds of illegal activity.\n\nTracing could come up in an effort to impose a \"constructive trust\" (usually by a private party) or \"civil forfeiture\" (usually by law enforcement) on the proceeds of embezzlement or fraud, for example. Tracing in this circumstance is governed by broad considerations of equity law and are highly fact specific. The methods are fairly ad hoc and mostly come down to rules of reason. \n\nFor example, a court might find that anything clearly purchased with clean assets that were not comingled with dirty assets are not subject to forfeiture or a constructive trust, but that the entire amount of comingled assets might be subject to forfeiture or a constructive trust up to the total amount less the amount of clean assets which were comingled. \n\nThis issue came up in the U.S. Supreme Court of *[Luis v. United States](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-419_nmip.pdf)* in 2014 over whether clean funds of someone subject to fraud liability could be frozen to protect the solvency of someone who may have already squandered the dirty funds when the defendant wants to use the clean funds for an expensive legal defense of the case (SCOTUS said that assets purely traceable to clean sources can't be tied up so as to prevent them from being used in a legal defense of the case.)\n\nTracing generally does not extend to a bona fide purchaser for value (i.e. someone with no knowledge of wrongdoing is paid fair market value for something or pays fair market value for an asset) of something from the person engaged in misconduct because there was no economic benefit from the transaction to either party's net worth.\n\n> What if Bob offers a smaller sum of money to many people, small enough\n>  that Bob could easily afford to give such a gift to one person, but\n>  the combined cost of so many small gifts adds up to an amount bob\n>  couldn't/wouldn't have been able to afford without his supplementary\n>  income?

His solvency at the time of the gift rather than tracing from legal or illegal income respectively, would be the relevant legal issue.

This situation involves comingled funds (legal and illegal income mixed in one account) and potentially fraudulent transfers. The key points are:\n\n1. Tracing specific dollars to legal or illegal sources is not typically done in these cases.\n2. When funds are comingled, courts may consider the entire amount subject to forfeiture up to the amount of illegal funds.\n3. The gifts may be considered fraudulent transfers if Bob would be insolvent without his illegal income.\n4. The recipients' knowledge of Bob's illegal activities is not the determining factor for forfeiture in this case.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the court wouldn't necessarily consider each gift separately.

The evolution of Confrontation Clause interpretation from 2011 to 2015 shows a trend towards a more nuanced approach that considers the primary purpose and context of statements.\n\nIn Michigan v. Bryant (2011), the Court introduced the \"primary purpose\" test, allowing statements made primarily to address an ongoing emergency to be non-testimonial. \n\nWilliams v. Illinois (2012) further refined this by allowing certain forms of expert testimony based on hearsay, if used to inform an expert's opinion rather than as direct evidence.\n\nOhio v. Clark (2015) expanded on the \"primary purpose\" test, holding that statements not made with the primary purpose of creating evidence could be admissible without violating the Confrontation Clause.\n\nThis progression shows a more complex analysis of hearsay statements, potentially allowing some forms that might have previously been considered testimonial, based on their purpose and context.\n\nOption A is too broad and overstates the Court's actions.

Despite the inaccurate labeling in the agreement calling Bob a \"subtenant,\" the actual arrangement (direct payment to the landlord with no intermediate tenant) indicates that Bob is, in fact, a tenant. Courts and fact-finders would likely look beyond the improper labels to determine the true nature of the relationship.

Which has 8 million inhabitants, something like 10 districts, and is [*growing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_New_York_City).\n\nBack [in 1918 H1N1](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html) killed between 2% and 10% of those that got it and in total about 675,000 (of 103\\.2 million) in the US, mainly in cities that did lag in their reaction to the fall/winter wave in 1918\\. As three (not fully) random examples: [Philadelphia lost 16000](https://archives.upenn.edu/exhibits/penn-history/flu) for something around 941 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (the town had about 1\\.7 million inhabitants at the time), [LA had a death toll of only 494 per 100,000](https://www.influenzaarchive.org/cities/city-losangeles.html#), [all of Nebraska lost between 2800 and 7500 people](https://history.nebraska.gov/blog/1918-flu-pandemic-nebraska) on a population of 1\\.3 million \\- for \\- for between 200 and 580 deaths per 100,000\\.

That's because redistricting on the state level can only happen after the reapportionment of the seats has been handed out by the clerk of the House of representatives. Reapportionment has a deadline of 25th January the year after the census. That's *after* the house term starts. Since at that moment the districts are still in existence, the term of the current holder first needs to run out before the new districts take effect. So the district ceases to exist the same day they leave office on January 3rd.\n\nA good example would be New York:\n\nThe 45th district was redistricted from the 43rd District and elected first for in 1944, and was redistricted back into the 43rd District after the 1950 census. It was last voted for in 1950, well before the results of the census were handed out and redistricting happened. So the district ceased to be the same day Daniel A. Reed left the office on January 3rd of 1953\\.\n\nThe [28th Congressional District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York%27s_28th_congressional_district) was established in 1823 and eliminated on January 3rd 2013 as a result of the 2010 census. The last election for its seat was \\- obviously \\- in 2010\\.\n\nAs a result, any changes to the district map stemming from the 2020 census will take effect only on January 3rd 2023, and a massive depopulation showing in the 2030 census will have an effect only in the elections for the house that begins its term on January 3rd 2033\\.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the event of a catastrophic depopulation of a U.S. state occurring in 2025, when would the number of representatives for that state likely change?\n\nA) Immediately after the event, through emergency legislation\nB) After the next scheduled census in 2030\nC) In January 2031, at the start of the new Congressional term\nD) In January 2033, when the results of the 2030 census take effect\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, changes in congressional representation are based on the decennial census. Even if a catastrophic event occurred in 2025, the next scheduled census would still be in 2030. The results of this census would then be used to reapportion seats and redraw district boundaries. However, these changes do not take effect immediately. The redistricting process takes time, and new district boundaries only come into effect with the start of a new Congressional term following the next election cycle. Therefore, any changes resulting from the 2030 census would not be implemented until January 3, 2033, when the new Congressional term begins.\n\nOption A is incorrect because emergency legislation for an extra census is highly unlikely, even in extreme circumstances.

The health club contract law is [here](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.142&full=true#19.142.050): the crucial thing is, you have to read the contract. The law did not anticipate a governmentally\\-mandated shutdown, but does address the question of cancellations in RCW 19\\.142\\.040(7\\). The two most\\-relevant conditions are:\n\n> (c) If a contract extends for more than one year, the buyer may cancel\n>  the contract for any reason upon thirty days' written notice to the\n>  health studio;\n> \n> \n> (d) If the health studio facilities are *permanently* closed and\n>  comparable facilities owned and operated by the seller are not made\n>  available within a ten\\-mile radius of the closed facility;\n\nBut, I assume neither is actually applicable (membership is not longer than a year, the closure is not permanent). (8\\) also requires \"Clauses explaining the buyer's right to a refund and relief from future payment obligations after cancellation of the contract\" (that is, they have to say what your rights are).\n\nThere is nothing illegal about a contract clause that says something like \"If the facility is temporarily shut down due to circumstances beyond our control, we will extend your membership (obligation) by the duration of the shut\\-down\". As a general matter of contract law, one party cannot unilaterally modify the term of a contract, unless there is a clause that permits them to do so. State law *requires* that the contract have a stated duration. So one argument that you could make is that without an escape clause in the contract, they are in government\\-mandated breech of contract.

Figuratively it also describes the concept that a judge does not \"add up\" the number of arguments but instead bases his or her decision on the strength of those arguments.\n\nWiktionary:\n\n> The principle that a judge should base their decision on the strength of the arguments rather than their quantity.\n\nBriefly googling I'm unable to find any more definitive sources/references, which are what I'm looking for.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The form *calculat* is late Latin, and so we may not find this exact phrasing in our earliest Roman sources. The general principle regarding correction of numerical errors is in the Digest of Justinian (530\\-533\\), which deals in 49\\.8 with decisions which can be rescinded without an appeal. The authority cited is Aemilius Macer, a jurist of the third century, whose work *De Appellationibus* (\"On Appeals\") is quoted as [saying](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/justinian/digest49.shtml):\n\n> si calculi error in sententia esse dicatur, appellare necesse non est: veluti si iudex ita pronuntiaverit: \"cum constet titium seio ex illa specie quinquaginta, item ex illa specie viginti quinque debere, idcirco lucium titium seio centum condemno\": nam quoniam error computationis est, nec appellare necesse est et citra provocationem corrigitur. sed et si huius quaestionis iudex sententiam centum confirmaverit, si quidem ideo, quod quinquaginta et viginti quinque fieri centum putaverit, adhuc idem error computationis est nec appellare necesse est: si vero ideo, quoniam et alias species viginti quinque fuisse dixerit, appellationi locus est.\n\nTranslation [from Samuel P. Scott, 1932](https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/D49_Scott.htm#VIII):\n\n> If an error in the calculation is alleged to exist in the decision, it is not necessary to appeal, for instance, if the judge decides as follows: \"As it is proved that Titius owes Seius fifty sesterces for such\\-and\\-such an article, and also twenty\\-five for another; therefore I hold that Lucius Titius shall pay Seius a hundred sesterces;\" because, as the mistake is one of computation, it is not necessary to appeal, and it can be corrected without doing so. If, however, the judge of this question should render a decision for a hundred sesterces, for the reason that he thought that fifty and twenty\\-five made a hundred, still, the same mistake is one of computation, and it is not necessary to appeal. But when the judge decides that there is another sum of twenty\\-five sesterces due, there will be ground for appeal.\n\nAnother maxim for this situation is *error calculi non nocet*, an error in calculation does no harm. In the Corpus Iuris Civilis, 2\\.5, a similar formulation is attributed to a ruling from the co\\-Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, so the same rough time as Macer: *errorem calculi ... veritati non adferre praeiudicum*, an error in calculation does not prejudice the truth. The \"*non nocet*\" phrase can be found in much later sources, such as the 14th century [commentary](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IRk2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA129-IA1#v=onepage&q&f=false) by [Baldus de Ubaldis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldus_de_Ubaldis) on Justinian. I think that this is a more precise and common term than *iudex non calculat* for that idea.\n\nThe cited law is that a judge can correct their own calculational error, to make the outcome accord with the just outcome they had intended. The form *iudex non calculat* matches this idea for saying that the arithmetical working is not primary, but rather something that is deduced from the decision. This is also a feature of modern law systems, wherein obvious mistakes in court orders can be corrected by the court itself, on application.\n\nFor the secondary meaning, assessing the strength of arguments rather than their quantity, this is so commonplace that it's hard to identify any particular source. It's certainly an idea we find in Cicero's rhetoric. His *Orator*, for example, [has](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9776/pg9776-images.html):\n\n> The stress of an argument does not always, and in every cause, depend upon similar topics. He will, therefore, exercise his judgment; and not only discover what may be said, but thoroughly examine the force of it. ... An Orator, therefore, should carefully examine each, that he may be able to select with propriety. Otherwise, how can he enlarge upon those which are most pertinent, and dwell upon such as more particularly affect his cause?\n\nCicero is suggesting that we should choose and hone our strongest arguments, not just reel off everything we can think of. Inclusion of weak or irrelevant material may make the overall case weaker, as well as trying the patience of the listener. I've heard similar sentiments from contemporary judges, so it's clearly something we've been struggling with for a couple of thousand years and counting.\n\nThe phrase \"*iudex non calculat*\" does not appear to have much current live use: perhaps mainly jurists disclaiming any interest in figures, using the phrase slightly ironically.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the original Roman legal concept behind the phrase \"iudex non calculat\"?\n\nA) Judges should not consider mathematical calculations when making legal decisions.\nB) The quantity of arguments presented is more important than their quality in court.\nC) Obvious calculation errors in a court decision can be corrected without affecting the validity of the decision itself.\nD) Judges are not required to provide detailed explanations for their rulings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"iudex non calculat\" is related to the Roman legal concept that obvious calculation errors in a court decision do not invalidate the decision and can be corrected at any time.

The concept is also expressed in the maxim \"error calculi non nocet\" (an error in calculation does no harm).

As highlighted in the discussion, a nominee for a federal district court judgeship is expected to have comprehensive knowledge of fundamental legal concepts and doctrines that are relevant to federal trial court proceedings. This includes familiarity with terms like the Daubert standard, motions in limine, and abstention doctrines, which are routinely encountered in federal district courts. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a federal judge needs broad legal knowledge beyond just their prior practice area. Option B underestimates the level of knowledge required, as judges are expected to already possess this information, not learn it on the job. Option D goes too far, as while judges need broad knowledge, they aren't expected to be experts in all specialized legal fields."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36489/is-it-illegal-to-start-a-cult-following-after-a-specific-person-who-is-unaware", "docs_id": 36489, "title": "Is it illegal to start a cult following after a specific person?

It's unlikely to be considered a genuine religious practice protected by law. However, it could potentially violate school policies on respect, appropriate behavior, and maintaining a positive learning environment. The school authorities would likely address this as a disciplinary issue rather than a legal one, unless the activities escalated to harassment or caused significant distress to the teacher. The students' claim of religious intolerance would likely not hold up, as their \"cult\" would not be recognized as a legitimate religion.

Twins, triplets, or other multiple births were considered a single birth event. Therefore, even though three children were born, it would be considered compliant with the one-child policy because it resulted from a single pregnancy and delivery.

As the page [\"Patent Disclosure: Everything You Need to Know\"](https://www.upcounsel.com/patent-disclosure) from *UpCounsel* states:\n\n> \\[A] patent disclosure is a public claim of data about an invention. In general, it is any part of the patenting process in which data regarding an invention is disclosed. **A good disclosure tells someone else how to create the product.** \\[*Emphasis added*]\n> \n> \n> The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the right to offer exclusive rights to people for their inventions for set periods of time. This is **only if and when the inventor agrees to adequately disclose the invention in writing.** \\[*Emphasis added*]\n> \n> \n> A formal patent disclosure ... stipulates a set of claims regarding the invention, as well as other data that reveals the unique nature of the product. It should be expressed in writing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as part of the patent application.\n> \n> \n> **What Is Included in a Patent Disclosure?**\n> \n> \n> * **The Specification**. A primary disclosure or \"specification\" is a main document in a patent application. It describes the ways in which the invention is innovative compared to similar inventions and explains the scope of monopoly the applicant believes he or she has to the invention. The specification describes the item and the way to make and to use it, in clear and exact terms. Someone in the field must be able to reasonably create it with these instructions. Further, the specification notes the patent application filing date on which inventor can the rely. It also offers evidence that the invention belongs to the person in question.\n> * **The Enablement**. This explains how to create the object and how someone in the field can do so. The instructions cannot be vague or unclear, but must be exact and detailed. When the patent expires, the enablement should still be usable. This section should include any figures or drawings, with explanations. Again, you will want to show how your invention is special. So, you might want to include many details and different variations of the invention. Later, many of these variations may be deleted from the document as unnecessary. This section may be numerous pages long.\n> * **Best Mode Requirement**. The path revealed must be the best way of creating the item within the author's awareness at the time of filing. Therefore, it may include specific or unique techniques. *There should be no concealment*. A poor\\-quality disclosure can risk the appearance of concealment. \\[*Italics added*]\n> * **Claims**. This area tells the reader the exclusive rights the patent offers to the inventor....\n\nThe official page [\"Duty of Disclosure, Candor, and Good Faith\"](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2001.html) from the USPTO cites 37 CFR 1\\.56 on the duty to disclose information material to patentability. This regulation provides, in the relevant part:\n\n> **A patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest.** The public interest is best served, and the most effective patent examination occurs when, at the time an application is being examined, the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of all information material to patentability. Each individual associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application has a duty of candor and good faith in dealing with the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to the Office all information known to that individual to be material to patentability as defined in this section. The duty to disclose information exists with respect to each pending claim ...\n\nThese disclosures include the state of prior art, as kown to the applicant and the applicant's associates.\n\nThe page [\"BEST MODE: Noncompliance with the Duty of Disclosure is Not an Option\"](https://www.iptechblog.com/2021/06/best-mode-noncompliance-with-the-duty-of-disclosure-is-not-an-option/) states:\n\n> When you apply for a patent in the United States, you have a legal duty to disclose prior art that could be used to reject your application \u2014 in essence, information that may be used against you by the examiner of your application. While persons accused of a crime have a right to remain silent, so as to avoid self\\-incrimination, inventors applying for a patent have no such right. To the contrary, an inventor\u2019s failure to comply with the duty of disclosure risks any resulting patent being unenforceable.\n\nThe page [\"THE PATENT BARGAIN AND THE CURSE OF RETROACTIVITY\"](http://www.toikkalawgroup.com/blog/the-patent-bargain-and-the-curse-of-retroactivity) states:\n\n> One of the requirements for the USPTO to issue a patent is that the applicant\u2019s claimed invention be fully disclosed in the application and published in the patent. This is sometimes referred to as the \u201cpatent bargain.\u201d This is at the opposite end of the spectrum from trade secrets law, under which a company can sue for \u00a9 misappropriation of a trade secret but only if it takes reasonable measures to maintain confidentiality of the trade secret. ...\n> \n> \n> Under patent law an inventor must fully disclose his or her invention before enforceable patent rights come into being. This disclosure requirement is sometimes termed the \u201cpatent bargain,\u201d under which **an inventor gains the right to exclude others from practicing a patented invention in exchange for disclosing the invention so that it may be known by the public** and indeed practiced after the patent term has expired. ... \\[*Emphasis added*]\n\nIn general a patent application is not just a description of a specific industrial process. It includes the research by which that process was discovered or developed. That research can benefit others in the same field, and so \"promote the progress of science and the useful arts\" in helping others to do further research and make further discoveries, which can often be done without infringing the patent itself.\n\nOf course, once patent protection expires, anyone may use the patent, and the final patent documents are supposed to include sufficient information that \"one skilled in the art\" will be able to build the invention or use the process that had been patented. This is in contrast to the situation which would exist had the inventor retained the discovery as a trade secret. In that case no one would have been able to use the patented discovery until some other person independently discovered and disclosed it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary purpose of the patent disclosure requirement in US patent law?\n\nA) To prevent inventors from keeping their inventions as trade secrets\nB) To allow patent examiners to reject applications more easily\nC) To promote the progress of science by sharing knowledge in exchange for temporary exclusive rights\nD) To ensure that patent holders can sue for infringement more effectively\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The primary purpose of the patent disclosure requirement in US patent law is to promote the progress of science and useful arts by sharing knowledge in exchange for temporary exclusive rights.
