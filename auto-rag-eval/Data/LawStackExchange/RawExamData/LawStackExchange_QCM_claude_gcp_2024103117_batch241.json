Or can my employer record, without my knowledge, conversations I have with my wife on my personal cell phone during my lunch break?

While video surveillance without audio might be more commonly accepted, the legality of audio recording varies based on jurisdiction and circumstances.\n\nC is incorrect because it suggests unlimited surveillance rights for the employer, which is not accurate. There are legal restrictions and considerations that employers must adhere to.\n\nD is correct because it acknowledges the complexity of the issue.

Mike's lawyer challenges the constitutionality of the provision on the grounds that \"Mike's Bikes\" does not operate outside Mike's home state, nor does it sell to more than a few residents of other states.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The ADA does not explicitly cite any constitutional provision as the source of the Congressional authority to pass it. It may be presumed to be supporters by the Interstate commerce clause. During the 20th century and to the present this clause has been interpreted very broadly to grant regulatory authority over almost any economic activity in the US. An early and leading case on this point was [*Wickard v Filburn* 317 U.S. 111 (1942\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn). In this case regulation under the Commerce Clause of the planting and harvesting of wheat intended to be fed to livestock on the farm, and consumed by the residents thereof, but not separately marketed, was held to be proper and within the power of congress. The opinion in this case says:\n\n> (at 120\\) We believe that a review of the course of decision under the Commerce Clause will make plain, however, that questions of the power of Congress are not to be decided by reference to any formula which would give controlling force to nomenclature such as \"production\" and \"indirect\" and foreclose consideration of the actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate commerce.\n\nQuoting *Swift \\& Co. v. United States*, 196 U. S. 375, 196 U. S. 398 (at page 122\\) the opinion further said that:\n\n> \"commerce among the States is not a technical legal conception, but a practical one, drawn from the course of business.\"\n\nThe opinion went on to say that:\n\n> (at 124\\-125\\) That an activity is of local character may help in a doubtful case to determine whether Congress intended to reach it. The same consideration might help in determining whether, in the absence of Congressional action, it would be permissible for the state to exert its power on the subject matter, even though, in so doing, it to some degree affected interstate commerce. But even if appellee's activity be local, and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce, and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as \"direct\" or \"indirect.\"\n> \n> \n> (at pages 127\\-128\\) That appellee's own contribution to the demand for wheat may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from the scope of federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial.\n> \n> \n> (at pages 128\\-129\\) Congress may properly have considered that wheat consumed on the farm where grown, if wholly outside the scheme of regulation, would have a substantial effect in defeating and obstructing its purpose to stimulate trade therein at increased prices.\n\nNone of the cases under the ADA that I have found challenge the congressional power to pass the act. In [the Wikipedia article on the act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990), it is said to be largely based on the scheme of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\\.

Filburn, Congress can regulate activities that have a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce, even if the individual business's impact seems trivial.\n\nD) The challenge will likely succeed because the ADA does not explicitly cite the Interstate Commerce Clause as its constitutional basis, making it vulnerable to constitutional challenges.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the current interpretation of the Commerce Clause and its application to federal regulations like the ADA. The Supreme Court, in cases like Wickard v.

(ie upon the signing or agreement of a written or verbal lease? On the first / \"move in\" day of the lease itself? Upon handing over the keys to the tenant? Etc).\n\nOf course, s21B(3\\) of HA1988 provides the restriction on usage by LL of s21(1\\) or s21(4\\) until they are no longer in breach of regulations referred to by 21B(1\\). While 21B(2\\)(b) refers vaguely and non\\-specifically to \"the time the requirement applies,\" this is again in the context of defining criteria for ascertaining what version of a document must be served and not per se in that of setting out when to serve it. And this is the closest that anywhere else in s21B comes to touching on the matter.\n\nSo, while we have a statutory provision laying out the consequence for not serving the document in a timely way (no allowance to use s21\\), we are left with no statutory source for the oft\\-repeated, yet apparently ill\\-defined idea that this booklet is to be served \"at the start of a tenancy\". What is this idea's basis or origin?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The beginning of the tenancy is defined in [section 45(2\\) of the Housing Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/45) as:\n\n> the day on which the tenancy is entered into or, if it is later, the day on which, under the terms of any lease, agreement or other document, the tenant is entitled to possession under the tenancy.\n\n(This applies to the statutory instrument because it is made under section [21B](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/21B) of the 1988 Act, and definitions carry over from primary to secondary legislation in this way.) The definition probably matches what people would expect.\n\nSection 21B, and the 2015 Regulations, just say that the landlord has to give this information to their tenant. But it follows that if the tenancy has begun, then the landlord's obligation also begins. It binds from day 1\\. Therefore, the government is justified in saying in the booklet:\n\n> The landlord, or the letting agent, should give the current version of this guide to the tenant when a new assured shorthold tenancy starts.\n\nBecause of all the other paperwork involved, it's most common for the booklet to be given as part of the bundle of documents when the tenancy agreement is signed \\- so, along with the inventory and so on. This is typically not too distant in time from when the tenant is entitled to actually move in, and landlords will often only sign on the day itself even if the tenant has completed their part of the formalities earlier.\n\nPerhaps your doubt is about whether it is \"OK\" for the landlord to provide the booklet before the actual start date of the tenancy, as opposed to waiting until the tenancy is in effect. In the same way, we could imagine a prospective tenant wanting to see the energy performance certificate well before agreeing to sign anything. Does the landlord have to give them another copy on day 1 of the tenancy, even though it's the same as the copy they already have?\n\nIn fact, there *are* specific different rules for those other items of information.\n\n* The most recent gas safety certificate must normally be given \"to any new tenant of premises ... before that tenant occupies those premises\" ([SI 1998/2451 reg.36(6\\)(b)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/2451/regulation/36/made))\n* The EPC must be given to any *prospective* tenant at the earliest opportunity, and in any event must have been given to \"the person who ultimately becomes the buyer or tenant\" ([SI 2012/3118 reg.6](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/3118/regulation/6/made), and compare the definition of \"prospective tenant\" in [regulation 3](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/3118/regulation/3/made)).\n* The EICR must similarly be given to new and prospective tenants before they occupy the premises ([SI 2022/312 reg.3(e)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/312/regulation/3/made)).\n\nSo these are meant to be given before the tenancy begins. They are part of what the prospective tenant should know before deciding whether to sign the agreement. The government's [model tenancy agreement](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1084131/Model_agreement_for_a_shorthold_assured_tenancy.pdf) has checklists for landlord and tenant in relation to these documents, plus the \"How to rent\" booklet. That is consistent with the idea that the tenant is meant to have this information on the day that the tenancy is to begin, whether that's because they're just being given it now, or because they've already seen it. Armed with all the knowledge, they can now proceed to signing the agreement.\n\nIndeed, the content of the \"How to rent\" booklet makes it less useful if it's provided after the agreement has started. A lot of the material is about searching for a property, making sure that you are prepared to sign, and avoiding bad behaviour by potential landlords. Even though it would meet the letter of the law to only get this information after signing (but still on the day), it also meets letter and spirit to get it on the day, *before* signing. Or if you had it even earlier, it would be a bold argument to say that the landlord hadn't given you the information just because they emailed it to you a week before the tenancy actually began \\- especially if you have checked the appropriate little box on the tenancy agreement to say you received it.\n\nNonetheless, because the only practical consequence for landlords is their ability to serve a s.21 notice, it's also common for them to play it safe and send another copy of the booklet before sending the notice itself. They will also often send updated copies as they arise, even though the regulation doesn't require it; some insurers ask for this just to really cement the chance of making a proper s.21 notice.\n\nI'm not aware of judicial precedent on *early* delivery of the booklet, but we can get some guidance from a recent Court of Appeal decision on s.21A, [Trecarrell House v Rouncefield \\[2020] EWCA Civ 760](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Approved-judgment-Trecarrell-House-Ltd-v-Rouncefield-18-06-2020.pdf). This case examined the nature of breaches and remedies that prevent serving an eviction notice. The conclusion was that if the tenant received a gas safety certificate \"before or with\" the s.21 notice, then the landlord has fulfilled their obligation \\- they are not irreparably in breach just becuse they did not give that information at the beginning. What matters for the Housing Act is that the tenant received it by the time that it was needed for the s.21 process. Likewise, it would seem that if the tenant had the \"How to rent\" booklet from the landlord before the beginning of their tenancy, then the landlord is not in breach \\- because the tenant has the information the whole time even though the act of giving the booklet predated the tenancy itself.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A landlord, Sarah, is preparing to rent out her property to a new tenant, John.

The key issue is how the company handled the co-inventor's declaration. If they forged a signature, it could be considered fraud. If they claimed they couldn't reach the co-inventor (which may be permissible under certain circumstances), the application might still be valid. The non-employee co-inventor retains rights to the invention, and both parties (the company and the co-inventor) could potentially be considered equal co-owners of the patent. This situation creates complications but doesn't necessarily invalidate the patent or constitute automatic IP theft.

We trade seats.\n\nIs this legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can look up the contract of carriage for the flight\\-type (e.g. domestic or international) and airline, here is [one sample](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/dl-dgr-master-04mar22.pdf). That contract does not address the question. Nothing in the contract says \"you must sit in the seat that you were assigned\", and nothing expressly forbid seat\\-swapping (for consideration or otherwise). It is therefore reasonable to assume that seat\\-swapping is allowed, and it is unlikely that an airline would care (leaving aside Putt\\-Putt Air which runs tiny little planes with careful weight\\-balancing).\n\n[Assaulting a crew member](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/46504) is a crime, and under a [separate law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/46318), it can result in a civil penalty, which extends to \"any action that poses an imminent threat to the safety of the aircraft or other individuals on the aircraft\". This translates into certain regulations such as [14 CFR 91\\.11](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91), which says that \"No person may assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with a crewmember in the performance of the crewmember's duties aboard an aircraft being operated\".\n\nThere is no actual law that says you must comply with crew member instructions. Failure to comply *might* be interfering with crew member's duties, but isn't so automatically. There are also specific enforceable regulations regarding smoking and seat belts in [14 CFR 121\\.317](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-G/part-121).\n\nSo there is nothing illegal about voluntary seat\\-swapping, whether for free or for money.

Crucially they aren't specific to just the costs related to an individual item, but rather the estimated income is weighed against the estimated costs of **all** lost property handling in that year.\n\nThe legal basis for this comes from the [London Transport Act 1982](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/1982/5/pdfs/ukla_19820005_en.pdf), subsequently amended various times (e.g. by [The Transport for London (Consequential Provisions) Order 2003](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/1615/schedule/1/paragraph/33/made?wrap=true&view=plain)) but the original gives the gist in Part V, Section 19 :\n\n> The Executive shall have power to fix the charges to be paid to them from time to time for the safe keeping and redelivery of lost property and the charges shall be of such amounts or at such rates as the Executive shall think fit:\n> \n> \n> Provided that \\-\n> \n> \n> (a) the total of the charges fixed under this subsection and estimated to be received in any year shall not exceed by an unreasonable proportion the cost to the Executive in that year of making provision for the safe keeping and redelivery of lost property ;\n\nSince you specifically mentioned the driver award this is further explained in TfL's [Lost Property Fees](https://content.tfl.gov.uk/lost-property-fees-april-2016.pdf) documentation:\n\n> **Cab\\-driver award**\n> \n> \n> Items found in licensed cabs are subject to an additional award, which is given in full to the driver.

The London Transport Act 1982 and its amendments provide the legal basis for TfL to charge fees for lost property handling. Specifically, the act states that the total charges estimated to be received in any year shall not exceed by an unreasonable proportion the cost to the Executive (TfL) in that year of making provision for the safe keeping and redelivery of lost property.

There are three sections in the Contract which seem like they might be relevant:\n\n> RULE 21 REFUSAL OF TRANSPORT\n\ndiscusses the reasons for which United has the right to remove a passenger from its plane.

In this specific situation, the passenger had already boarded \u2013 United had already given the passenger his \"reserved space\", and was now asking him to \"give it back\".\n\nIs there any real difference between those two events? Does the fact that the Contract of Carriage talks about \"boarding\", but not \"removal after boarding\", make any legal difference as far as United's rights in this case?\n\n---\n\nJust to clarify: I realize that overbooking itself is a legal business practice, as it's called out specifically in the Contract. But the Contact also lays out specifically what happens when overbooking occurs, and this event doesn't appear to be covered.\n\nI also recognize that United's airplane is ultimately private property and remaining in your seat after being told to leave is probably trespassing in some sense. And once security was called and the passenger disobeyed, he was clearly in the wrong. But that doesn't mean UA didn't breach their contract in having him removed in the first place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Rule 21 A: *Breach of Contract of Carriage* is one reason invoking the right to remove \\- \"Failure by Passenger to comply with the Rules of the Contract of Carriage\". 21(H): *Safety* then provides a set of rules that must be complied with:\n\n> Whenever refusal or removal of a Passenger may be necessary for the\n>  safety of such Passenger or other Passengers or members of the crew\n>  including, but not limited to:\n\nwhich includes \n\n> 2. Passengers who fail to comply with or interfere with the duties of the members of the flight crew, federal regulations, or security\n>  directives;\n\nThis does not directly authorize ejecting boarded passengers because of overbooking, but it provides a basis for concluding that there has been a breach. One can reasonably wonder whether the wording of the clause means that passengers can only be ejected for refusing to comply with an obviously safety\\-related\ninstruction. However, 21(H)(16\\) includes as a safety reason \"Passengers who have or cause a malodorous condition (other than individuals qualifying as disabled)\", and (5\\) includes being \"not properly clothed\". (4\\) also includes \"Passengers who, through and as a result of their conduct, cause a disturbance such that the captain or member of the cockpit crew must leave the cockpit in order to attend to the disturbance\", which could be applicable in a particular instance (e.g. if the flight attendant says \"please go\" and then has to call the captain to say the same).\n\nThese extensions to \"safety\" are contrary to a reasonable interpretation of \"safety\", but [14 CFR 91\\.3(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.3) states that \"The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft\". So as long as the pilot makes the determination, he has the final authority, until that regulation is changed. There is nothing in regulations about pilots that limits what the captain can do, in this respect, and there is (per case law) no provision for judicial review of pilot decisions. [Cerqueira v American Airlines](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2445069/cerqueira-v-american-airlines-inc/) indicates a possibilty for cause of action in case a decision is \"arbitrary and capricious\" (a standard originating in [Williams v.

Appx. 657 plaintiff argued that the airline's removal of her failed to meed the safety standard of the statute, and again the court affirms that there is no provision for review of pilot decisions, though review is allowed in some districts if the decision of arbitrary or capricious. Although Lu raised the \"was not inimical to safety\" argument, the court responds:\n\n> Lu did not allege any discriminatory animus for her removal from the\n>  flight.

To test the limits of pilot removal discretion, we would need a scenario where a boarded passenger is randomly selected for removal due to overbooking, and where the passenger has done nothing that could be construed as a threat to safety (e.g. arguing with the attendant, refusing to leave), and where the pilot does not allege a safety\\-based reason for removal.

The pilot, as the final authority on the aircraft, has significant discretion in these matters. However, case law such as Cerqueira v American Airlines and Williams v.

Since the gadget and packaging are lost, I cannot find the serial number myself. I have had the same conversation with them 3 times now and it is incredibly frustrating \\- especially since it takes between 1 and 2 hours for the insurance company to answer their calls !

Provide as much information as you can (your name, date of purchase, store you purchased it from, copy of the receipt, etc.) and ask for the serial number. If they still have it, and it is stored in a way which is linked to you in an identifiable way, then they are obliged to provide it without undue delay (and in any event within 30 days). You may want to provide a copy of your passport in the request to pre\\-empt them coming back with an ID check request under Article 12(6\\), which then allows them to delay processing the request until you have replied.\n\nAs stated above, if they no longer have the data or you are not identifiable from the data then they do not have to provide it. If they do have to provide it but refuse then you can complain to the [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/) or ask the County Court for a compliance order under section 167 of the Data Protection Act 2018\\.\n\nThe insurer\n-----------\n\nRegulation 3(1\\) of the [Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/1277/contents) prohibits \"*unfair commercial practices*\". Regulation 3(4\\) provides that a commerical practice is unfair if, inter alia, it is listed in Schedule 1\\.\n\nParagraph 27 of Schedule 1 contains the following item:\n\n> Requiring a consumer who wishes to claim on an insurance policy to\n> produce documents which could not reasonably be considered relevant as\n> to whether the claim was valid, or failing systematically to respond\n> to pertinent correspondence, in order to dissuade a consumer from\n> exercising his contractual rights.\n\nAs you've provided proof that you purchased the item, you can try to argue that having the serial number of the lost item can not \"reasonably be considered relevant\". Yes, the contract says that you must provide it, but consumer rights legislation overrides contractual provisions.\n\nYou may also want to consider dealing with the insurer by email/post instead of by phone, (a) to avoid continuing to waste time on hold, and (b) because if they systematically fail to respond then this may also cause them to be in breach of the above provision, (c) to acquire evidence which you can use later.\n\nEscalating\n----------\n\nIf you get no results from the insurer, make a formal complaint to them through their complaints process. Under the [FCA Handbook](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/DISP) rule DISP 1\\.3\\.1R, the insurer is required to provide a complaints procedure. Under rule DISP 1\\.6\\.2R they are required to provide a final response to a complaint within 8 weeks.\n\nIf you are not happy with the response, you can escalate the complaint to the [Financial Ombudsman Service](https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/contact-us/complain-online) which has the power to make financial awards pursuant to [section 229](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/section/229) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (\"FSMA\"). Doing so is free of charge and is therefore a good alternative to going to court. The ombudsman can also make awards that are not strictly based on law (i.e. they can go further than the courts can) because of [section 228 of FSMA](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/section/228) which provides that:\n\n> \"A complaint is to be determined by reference to what is, in the\n> opinion of the ombudsman, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances\n> of the case.\"\n\nYou must generally escalate a complaint to the Ombudsman within 6 months of receiving your final response from the insurer (rule DISP 2\\.8\\.2R).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer purchased ear buds 10 months ago and is trying to make an insurance claim for loss.

This approach allows the consumer to formally request the serial number if the retailer still has it stored in a way that's linked to the consumer's identity. The retailer is obliged to respond within 30 days, which is faster than other options. It's also a legal right, unlike option A, which is premature and likely unnecessary. Option C is too soon, as the consumer should first exhaust options with the retailer and insurer before escalating to the Ombudsman.

How is it different from other kinds of evidence. Is it correct that circumstantial evidence is weaker or less valuable than direct evidence?\n\nPlease cite reliable sources for any answers.\n\nI am particularly interested in answers for the US (any state) but answers from other jurisdictions would also be welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Overview\n--------\n\nThe term \"circumstantial evidence\" refers to evidence that does not directly establish the elements of the crime, but that permits the finder of fact to draw inferences about what happened. It is called circumstantial because it shows the circumstances, often of the crime scene, but in any case of something in some way related to the alleged crime.\n\nFor example, a knife found in a dead body would be circumstantial evidence, as would fingerprints found on the knife.\n\nAn eye\\-witness account of the crime would be ***direct evidence***, not ***circumstantial evidence***. So would a video of the events of the crime, say from a security camera. Most physical evidence is circumstantial evidence. Much eye\\-witness is direct evidence. There is also ***opinion evidence***, also known as ***expert testimony***. In a US court at least, pretty much all evidence falls into one of these three categories.\n\nCircumstantial evidence can be misinterpreted, and it can even be faked, although that is comparatively rare. Direct evidence can include lies, misunderstandings, and particularly misperceptions.1\n\nFor example, a witness sees two people struggling, hears a shot and sees a flash, then one drops dead. This is direct evidence, not circumstantial. But does it prove murder, or even intentional killing? It need not; one person could have drawn a gun and the other struggled to seize it, and the gun fired in the struggle, killing the person who originally drew it, with no one intending that result.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose a victim reports a rape. Semen is obtained from the victim's person. The victim shows bruises and injuries characteristic of rape. DNA tests match the accused, as do fingerprints in the victim's blood at the scene of the crime. That is all circumstantial, but taken together, there seems only one reasonable interpretation.\n\nSources\n-------\n\n* The definition of [\"circumstantial evidence\"](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=191) from Law.con's legal dictionary reads:\n\n> evidence in a trial which is not directly from an eyewitness or participant and requires some reasoning to prove a fact.\n\nThe page goes on to state:\n\n> There is a public perception that such evidence is weak (\"all they have is circumstantial evidence\"), but the probable conclusion from the circumstances may be so strong that there can be little doubt as to a vital fact (\"beyond a reasonable doubt\" in a criminal case, and \"a preponderance of the evidence\" in a civil case). Particularly in criminal cases, \"eyewitness\" (\"I saw Frankie shoot Johnny\") type evidence is often lacking and may be unreliable, so circumstantial evidence becomes essential. Prior threats to the victim, fingerprints found at the scene of the crime, ownership of the murder weapon, and the accused being seen in the neighborhood, certainly point to the suspect as being the killer, but each bit of evidence is circumstantial.\n* The *Britannica* article on [\"Circumstantial Evidence\"](https://www.britannica.com/topic/circumstantial-evidence) defines the term as:\n\n> circumstantial evidence, in law, evidence not drawn from direct observation of a fact in issue.\n\nThe page goes on to state:\n\n> If a witness testifies that he saw a defendant fire a bullet into the body of a person who then died, this is direct testimony of material facts in murder, and the only question is whether the witness is telling the truth. If, however, the witness is able to testify only that he heard the shot and that he arrived on the scene seconds later to see the accused standing over the corpse with a smoking pistol in his hand, the evidence is circumstantial; the accused may have been shooting at the escaping killer or merely have been a bystander who picked up the weapon after the killer had dropped it.\n* Merriam\\-webster's [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/circumstantial%20evidence) is:\n\n> evidence that tends to prove a fact by proving other events or circumstances which afford a basis for a reasonable inference of the occurrence of the fact at issue.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n\\[1] See for example [\"Eyewitness identification: Effects of suggestion and bias in identification from photographs\"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03333151).

I could not think of a concise and accurate way to phrase it.\n\nI will phrase this question in terms of charitable trusts, but my question is really about the general principle. I am assuming that the particular statutes which apply to the given situation are silent on this issue.\n\nLet's say we have a charitable trust. It is determined (by a regulator or a court of first instance) that the trust is invalid. Let's call this point A in time. At point A, it is as if the trust has never existed (which means we have a resulting trust back to the settlor). The trustees appeal. If they lose, then nothing changes \\- the trust never existed. If they win, then the trust has always existed. Let's call this point B in time.\n\nMy question is, how do the trustees figure out what their legal duties are between point A and B? What happens if they do something during this time which would be considered a breach of trust if the charitable trust is reinstated? What if they are legally compelled to do so e.g. the beneficiary of the resulting trust asks for his money back. If there is no charitable trust, then the trustees cannot refuse the request. On the other hand, if the charitable trust is reinstated then they have spent charitable funds on a non\\-charitable purpose.\n\nWhat is the general principle? How should you behave when you are in situation X, but the outcome of an appeal could mean that you are retrospectively in situation Y, and you are faced with a conflicting set of rules for a given action during the interim?\n\nIdeally I would like a UK specific answer, but would also welcome more general answers based on common law systems.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ohwilleke's answer (i.e. 'there isn't a simple answer') covers the general principles clearly. But for your specific situation (England and Wales, appeal to the High Court Chancery Division or Court of Appeal), the answer is \"Do nothing irrevocable if possible; if necessary, apply for interim directions to the Court\".

This approach aligns with the advice given in the top answer, which states \"Do nothing irrevocable if possible; if necessary, apply for interim directions to the Court\". This course of action protects the trustees from potential liability regardless of the appeal's outcome. Option A is too drastic and irreversible, potentially causing problems if the appeal succeeds.

The specific wording comes from EU consumer rights law.\n\nConsumers \\- ordinary members of the public who buy products and services \\- have certain legal rights that businesses don't. The theory is that what's going on when you buy a TV for your house is different from what's going on when you buy 1000 TVs for your hotel chain. The appropriate remedies and processes if you're dissatisfied are different. By asking you to identify yourself as *not a consumer*, the idea is that you wouldn't be able to use consumer rights law in the event you find Google's services to be defective, too expensive, not matching the advertising, etc.\n\nIn the UK's transposition of EU law, the onus is on the trader (Google) to prove that you are not a consumer, in any legal proceedings. If they can point to you ticking a box saying that you are not a consumer, the argument is much easier for them to make.\n\nEU legislation using this phrase, or nearly, includes \\-\n\n* [Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A31993L0013), Article 2\n\n> \u2018consumer\u2019 means any natural person who, in contracts covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes which are outside his trade, business or profession;  \n> \n> \u2018seller or supplier\u2019 means any natural or legal person who, in contracts covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes relating to his trade, business or profession, whether publicly owned or privately owned.\n* [Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31985L0577), Article 2\n\n> \u2018consumer\u2019 means a natural person who, in transactions covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes which can be regarded as outside his trade or profession;   \n> \n> \u2018trader\u2019 means a natural or legal person who, for the transaction in question, acts in his commercial or professional capacity, and anyone acting in the name or on behalf of a trader.\n* [Directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32011L0083), the main current directive on this topic, Article 2\n\n> \u2018consumer\u2019 means any natural person who, in contracts covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes which are outside his trade, business, craft or profession;   \n> \n> \u2018trader\u2019 means any natural person or any legal person, irrespective of whether privately or publicly owned, who is acting, including through any other person acting in his name or on his behalf, for purposes relating to his trade, business, craft or profession in relation to contracts covered by this Directive\n* [Directive 2019/770 of 20 May 2019 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32019L0770), specially relevant to the Google service, makes the same definitions as in the Directive of 2011\\.\n\nNational legislation implementing these directives uses the same phrases in English.

By checking this box, the user is declaring they are not acting as a consumer, which has significant legal implications. A personal project for tracking one's own fitness goals, even if created by a professional developer, would typically fall under personal use rather than professional activities. Choosing to use Firebase under these terms for a purely personal project could potentially waive important consumer protections. The correct approach would be to not use Firebase for this personal project or to seek a version of the service that doesn't require this declaration, as it's not being used for trade, business, craft, or professional purposes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because monetization isn't the determining factor; it's about the purpose of use. \nOption C is incorrect because future intent doesn't change the current nature of the project. \nOption D, while tempting, blurs the line between personal and professional use in a way that could be legally problematic."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73240/can-i-rebrand-my-own-car", "docs_id": 73240, "title": "Can I rebrand my own car?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know full well that rebranding goods for sale without an agreement with trademark owners is illegal.

The family's actions in handling the personal injury claim, including researching, writing a demand letter, and negotiating with the insurance company, likely constitute the unauthorized practice of law. As non-lawyers, they cannot charge for these services, and attempting to claim an hourly rate for their time could be seen as illegal.

The ones who want to disclaim now also want to do so to help the same beneficiary.\n\n**Original Question**\n\nConsider a situation where:\n\n1. There are many beneficiaries for an inheritance.\n2. Some of the beneficiaries disclaim while the grantor is alive.\n3. A decade passes and the grantor dies.\n4. The beneficiaries who did not disclaim earlier want to disclaim now.\n\nDo all disclaimers have to be \"brought up to date,\" or is it OK that the disclaimers were executed over many years, and some while the grantor was alive and some when the grantor is dead?\n\nIf this varies by state, then the state of interest is Utah.\n\nDoes everyone need to **dis**claim within a similar timeframe (such as within 12 months), or can substantial time elapse between disclaimers (such as years or even decades)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What Is A Disclaimer?\n=====================\n\nA disclaimer is an unequivocal and irrevocable rejection of a donative transfer of property, such as a gift or inheritance, without providing any direction or guidance regarding who will receive it in lieu of the disclaimer beneficiary of the transfer.\n\nIn other words, even if someone leaves you something in their will, you can refuse to accept it.\n\nWhy Would Someone Make A Disclaimer?\n====================================\n\nThere are a variety of reasons someone might disclaim an inheritance.\n\n* A disclaimer might reduce the amount of taxes owed related to the property disclaimed in the long run. The specifics of the tax laws that could cause this to be the case are beyond the scope of this answer.\n* The person disclaiming the inheritance might have large outstanding debts that would lead to an imminent bankruptcy, such that the inheritance would just go to their creditors any way.\n* The property inherited might have negative value before, for example, it is a toxic waste site that any owner of the property would have to clean up at the owner's expense.\n* The property inherited might have negative emotional value to the person disclaiming it, for example, a firearm that was used by the decedent to kill their mother.\n* Inheriting the property might disqualify the person receiving it from essential government benefits such as Medicaid coverage for a seriously ill person who could not obtain insurance otherwise and could not pay the medical bills that could have to be paid with the inherited assets since those assets are not worth much or are to illiquid to be sold in time to pay for necessary medical care.\n* Inheriting the property might cause financial aid grants for someone in college to drop so much that almost all of the inheritance would be consumed by increased tuition bills.\n* The person receiving the inheritance might believe that the person who will receive it if a disclaimer is made (i.e. the person who would have received it if the person making the disclaimer had predeceased the decedent leaving the inheritance), needs the inheritance more than the person who is entitled to it.\n\nOnly Property Interests That Exist Can Be Disclaimed\n====================================================\n\nYou can't disclaim the mere possibility that someone might leave you a gift or inheritance in the future, there has to be some presently existing right to give up before it can be disclaimed. (The technical name for a possibility like this is an \"expectancy\".) So, you can't disclaim an inheritance (which is a right that comes into being only when someone dies) while they are still alive, although you could disclaim an interest as a beneficiary in a trust that exists already but only takes effect when someone dies.\n\nSo, a disclaimer of an inheritance made before someone dies is meaningless and basically \"doesn't count\". Describing a timely disclaimer following an ineffective disclaimer made during life as bringing the disclaimer up to date isn't really a very accurate description of what is going on, but yes, disclaimers made prior to death do need to be \"brought up to date.\"\n\nAn Aside: What Is An Inheritance?\n=================================\n\nThe narrow meaning of \"inheritance\" is property received as a result of the death of someone who doesn't have a will, in contrast to a \"devise\" which is property received from someone who died under their will.\n\nBut, often the word \"inheritance\" is used in a broader sense that includes property received both from intestate and testate estates \\- i.e. both from decedents who do and from decedents do not have wills.\n\nA very broad sense of \"inheritance\" includes all major donative transfers even if they take the form of lifetime transfers, beneficiary designations, jointly owned property, or trust distributions, but this very broad sense is less common.\n\nNormally, the terms \"grantor\" and \"beneficiary\" are used to refer to a person who creates a trust and who is entitled to benefits from a trust, rather than in connection with an inheritance. But, the tags \"wills\" and \"probate\" were attached to he question, which would be inconsistent with the existence of a trust. So, it isn't entirely clear what is really meant by the question.\n\nDisclaimer Deadlines For Federal Tax Purposes\n=============================================\n\nMost disclaimers, historically, were done for tax purposes and needed to be made within the nine month deadline from date of death for filing an estate tax return established by the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe IRS deadline is found at [26 USC \u00a7 2518](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/2518) as clarified by [Treasury Regulation \u00a7 25\\.2518\\-2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/25.2518-2).\n\nDisclaimer Deadlines Under State Law\n====================================\n\nMost states followed the IRS lead when they set deadlines for making disclaimers under state law (which governs whether, how and when it is possible to disclaim since a state does not have to allow disclaimers in every situation that the IRS does but can allow disclaimers that the IRS does not recognize as valid for tax purposes to have validity for other state law purposes). The current trend is for states to adopt more flexible rules as, for example, is the case in Colorado.\n\nIn Utah, however, disclaimers are governed by Utah Code \u00a7 75\\-2\\-801, which tracks the IRS requirements for making a valid disclaimer for tax purposes. This lengthy statute has a lot of rules governing the mechanics of how a disclaimer is done, rules about when you can be disqualified from making a disclaimer, and how to count the deadlines, but the primary portions of that statute governing the deadlines which establish the nine month deadline are subsection (2\\)(a) and (2\\)(b):\n\n> (2\\) The following rules govern the time when a disclaimer shall be\n> filed or delivered:\n> \n> \n> (a) If the property or interest has devolved to the disclaimant under\n> a testamentary instrument or by the laws of intestacy, the disclaimer\n> shall be filed, if of a present interest, **not later than nine months\n> after the death of the deceased owner or deceased donee of a power of\n> appointment** and, if of a future interest, **not later than nine\n> months after the event determining that the taker of the property or\n> interest is finally ascertained and his interest is indefeasibly\n> vested.** The disclaimer shall be filed in the district court of the\n> county in which proceedings for the administration of the estate of\n> the deceased owner or deceased donee of the power have been commenced.\n> A copy of the disclaimer shall be delivered in person or mailed by\n> registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to any\n> personal representative or other fiduciary of the decedent or donee of\n> the power.\n> \n> \n> (b) If a property or interest has devolved to the disclaimant under a\n> nontestamentary instrument or contract, the disclaimer shall be\n> delivered or filed, if of a present interest, **not later than nine\n> months after the effective date of the nontestamentary instrument or\n> contract** and, if of a future interest, **not later than nine months\n> after the event determining that the taker of the property or interest\n> is finally ascertained and his interest is indefeasibly vested.** If\n> the person entitled to disclaim does not know of the existence of the\n> interest, the disclaimer shall be delivered or filed **not later than\n> nine months after the person learns of the existence of the\n> interest.** The effective date of a revocable instrument or contract\n> is the date on which the maker no longer has power to revoke it or to\n> transfer to the maker or another the entire legal and equitable\n> ownership of the interest. The disclaimer or a copy thereof shall be\n> delivered in person or mailed by registered or certified mail, return\n> receipt requested, to the person who has legal title to or possession\n> of the interest disclaimed.\n\nAnother Key Limitation On When A Disclaimer Can Be Made\n=======================================================\n\nIn addition to these deadline requirements, under federal law and the law of every state, a disclaimer must be made before the person entitled to receive the gift or inheritance takes any action which is inconsistent with a disclaimer such as receiving an economic benefit from the property that the person making the disclaimer would like to disclaim.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A trust was established by a wealthy individual named John for the benefit of his four children: Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diana.

The crime of which one is falsely accused needs to be considered an *infamous crime* or involve moral turpitude. Under \\[US] defamation law, a crime is deemed serious or infamous when it is classified as felony or its punishment could exceed one year of prison. The case law cited in [*Lakin v. Rund*, 896 N.W.2d 76 (2016\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/inmico20161202231) reflects how this criterion is uniform among US jurisdictions.\n\nAnother difficult issue in defamation lawsuits is the need to prove the defendant's mental state known as *actual malice*. Even where there is clear proof of a defamer's actual malice, a plaintiff can be denied justice because of judge's *arbitrary* choice to side with the defendant (just like with non\\-defamation lawsuits). For case law from various jurisdictions regarding defamation law and actual malice, you might want to see the citations in my briefs in the SCOTUS [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/17-1560.html) and [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/17-1576.html). Most of the records in regard to the latter case are available [here](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/viggers-v-pacha_74.html).\n\nDefamation lawsuits are not exempt of having to comply with the procedural laws involved in judicial proceedings either, nor is the discovery, drafting, or legal research any simpler for being a lawsuit about defamation.\n\nIn the context of the comments that prompted your question here, the \"repeated violations\" that SE imputed to former moderator Monica would hardly be grounds for a viable lawsuit against SE for *defamation per se* or otherwise. Here are some reasons:\n\n* Rejecting a policy of gender pronouns such as the one SE seeks to\nimpose is not considered an infamous crime.

The answer highlights that defamation lawsuits are not simple and require significant effort. Key points supporting this include:\n\n1. Defamation lawsuits must comply with complex procedural laws.\n2. Plaintiffs often need to prove the defendant's mental state, known as \"actual malice.\"\n3. Even with strong evidence, judges may arbitrarily side with defendants.\n4.

If the recipient has signed an NDA or is under some other sort of individual duty of confidentiality, s/he should normally not publish the letters or disclose their contents, and if s/he does so there will usually be some sort of penalty possible. But in some cases this may not apply. For example, the duty to report a crime will generally supersede a private NDA. So\\-called \"whistle\\-blower\" laws may give additional protection to disclosures when they apply.\n\nIf the letter is protected by Government secrecy classification or some other government regulation, disclosure of the contents may carry a penalty. But this may not always apply. For example, consider the case of [*New York Times Co. v. United States*, 403 U.S. 713 (1971\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._United_States), known as the Pentagon Papers case. According to the Wikipedia article:\n\n> The question before the court was whether the constitutional freedom of the press, guaranteed by the First Amendment, was subordinate to a claimed need of the executive branch of government to maintain the secrecy of information. The Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment did protect the right of The New York Times to print the materials.\n\nHowever, an ordinary letter from a private lawyer will not involve Free Press issues. \n\nIt is also the case that a letter, like any other modern original writing, is protected by copyright. To publish the letter without permission might be a copyright infringement (unless one of the exceptions to copyright applies) and an infringement suit might be filed. But usually the would be little or no economic value to such a letter, and so little or no damages available in a copyright suit. This might mean that such a suit would not be effective in deterring or dealing with such a publication. \n\nIf the recipient reports on the contents of the letter without actually copying it in the report, there would be no plausible copyright issue and the device of an infringement suit would not be available.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A lawyer sends a cease and desist letter to an Australian citizen on behalf of their client.

While the recipient has physical possession of the letter, this doesn't automatically grant the right to publish it. Key considerations include:\n\n1. Copyright: The letter is likely protected by copyright, and publishing without permission could be an infringement.\n2. Confidentiality agreements: If the recipient signed an NDA or is under another confidentiality obligation, publishing could violate that agreement.\n3. Content of the letter: If the letter contains sensitive information or is subject to government classification, publishing could have legal consequences.\n4.

Trademarks can use certain words or word combinations, but often in a way that is stylized or symbolic of a particular unique style and may include font, coloring, and other unique artistic takes. For example, McDonalds cannot copyright or trademark the letter \"M\" but it can trademark the \"Golden Arches\" a unique stylized \"M\" that they use as signage to at all their locations. If the name is a brand of a certain product such, then the name can be trademarked but only with respect to that product. For example, if the Acme Wash\\-Master is a dish washing machine they can't sue Ace Wash Master, a unique dog bathing system, for using the name \"Wash Master\" since it's both styled different (Acme uses a dash between words.

According to the information provided, you cannot copyright a word or name in itself. The number \"13\" is a common term that cannot be exclusively owned by any single entity. While trademarks can protect specific stylized versions or unique presentations of words or numbers, the basic use of \"13\" as an album title would not infringe on existing trademarks. The record company can use \"13\" as the album title without legal concerns, as long as they're not copying a specific stylized version of the number that's already trademarked.
