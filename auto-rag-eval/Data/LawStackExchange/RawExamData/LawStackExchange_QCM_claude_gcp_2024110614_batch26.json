I want to lend money to a friend, are there any legal ways that I can make some sort of a 'contract' for the return? What is the most practical way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Choice of **jurisdiction**: You\u2019re pretty much free to choose your jurisdiction. You don\u2019t have to contract under German law. The German state will intervene though if you\u2019re doing criminal stuff.\n2. Legally, the best is of course to draft a **written agreement**. You\u2019re completely free in the terms (unless it becomes immoral, [\u00a7\u00a0138\u00a0BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p0417)), but a loan, [\u00a7\u00a0488\u00a0BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p1754) (*Darlehensvertrag*), with a 0% interest rate (if it\u2019s meant as a short\\-term aid) is standard.\n3. The *next level* is to **collateralize** your loan, specifically with a pledge, [\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01204\u00a0ff.\u00a0BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p4533), i.\u202fe. your friend gives you a valuable item which you may (and actually *have* to) sell for profit if he doesn\u2019t return the loan. However, unlike contract law, in *property law* you are *not* completely free regarding the terms (numerus clausus of property law, *Typenzwang des Sachenrechts*). Here it becomes too difficult though for the layman, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend that unless you *know* what you\u2019re doing.\n4. Ultimately, I/we think it\u2019s nice of you to consider helping out your friend, but as [Nike Dattani](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78245/how-to-lend-money-to-a-friend-in-germany-with-the-possibility-to-enforce-return#comment166570_78245) already portrayed it can get *really* nasty if you intend to legally enforce such matters.

Option B is the best balance for several reasons:\n\n1. It follows the legal advice to create a written agreement, which provides some protection (\u00a7 488 BGB).\n2. The 0% interest rate is mentioned as standard for short-term aid between friends, maintaining the spirit of helping.\n3.

Here it is in relevant part:\n\n> For the purposes of this chapter, chapter one hundred and eleven and\n>  chapter two hundred and thirty\\-nine, occupancy of a dwelling unit\n>  within premises licensed as a rooming house or lodging house, except\n>  for fraternities, sororities and dormitories of educational\n>  institutions, for three consecutive months shall constitute a tenancy\n>  at will\n\nThus you are not a tenant at will: if you have counterevidence that shows that you are, you could mention that. [Section 8](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleI/Chapter186/Section8) says\n\n> If land is held by lease of a person having an estate therein\n>  determinable on a life or on a contingency, and such estate determines\n>  before the end of a period for which rent is payable, or if an estate\n>  created by a written lease or an estate at will is determined before\n>  the end of such period by surrender, either express or by operation of\n>  law, by notice to quit for non\\-payment of rent, or by the death of any\n>  party, the landlord or his executor or administrator may recover in\n>  contract, a proportional part of such rent according to the portion of\n>  the last period for which such rent was accruing which had expired at\n>  such determination.\n\nwhich means more or less \"you owe the rest of the rent\": but it does say that this is for a person who \"has a lease\". There does not seem to be any statutory definition of \"lease\". Presumably you agreed to something spelling out the amount, when due, what you can do etc. which would be your \"lease\". Since there is no statutory override, whatever the lease says, goes. One other source of law would be Landlord\\-Tenant Regulations ([940 CMR 3\\.17](http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/regulations/940-cmr-3-00.pdf)), which however does not seem to add anything else.\n\nHaving gone through that, there is the distinct possibility that you have been granted a [license to live](https://studentlife.mit.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/2017FA%20-%20Graduate%20Housing%20License%20Agreement%20v4.pdf) in the unit, and you do not have a lease (you have a license), which is extremely clever of them. This version includes an Early Departure fee of one month's rent: of course, this document may not be applicable to you, but it is a possible document.

Based on the provided legal information and considering the complexities of student housing agreements, which of the following statements is most likely to be true?\n\nA) The student is legally obligated to pay rent until March 31st because dorm rooms are exempt from standard tenancy-at-will regulations.\n\nB) The student can refuse to pay rent beyond March 8th, citing the 30-day notice provision in Massachusetts tenant rights.\n\nC) The legality of the university's demand depends on whether the housing agreement is classified as a lease or a license.\n\nD) The student must pay a prorated amount for the days between March 8th and March 31st, as mandated by Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their application to a specific scenario. The correct answer is C because the legality of the university's demand critically depends on the nature of the housing agreement.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. Standard tenancy-at-will regulations don't apply to dorm rooms, as stated in MCL c 187 \u00a717, which explicitly excludes \"dormitories of educational institutions\" from tenancy-at-will provisions.\n\n2. The 30-day notice provision cited in the Massachusetts tenant rights document may not be applicable in this case due to the dorm room exemption.\n\n3. The answer hinges on whether the student has a lease or a license. If it's a lease, Section 8 of the provided law suggests the student might owe rent for the entire period. However, if it's a license (which is common in university housing), different rules may apply.\n\n4. The example of MIT's housing license agreement shows that universities often use license agreements rather than leases, which can include specific terms like Early Departure fees.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple pieces of legal information, recognize the importance of document classification (lease vs. license) in determining rights and obligations, and understand that standard tenant protections may not apply in specialized housing situations like university dorms.

This is because:\n\n1. Express contract law (option A) is unlikely to apply, as the homeowner never signed a contract with the HOA, and it wasn't mentioned in the closing documents or deed.\n\n2. Statutory obligation (option B) is not mentioned in the documentation and would vary by state. Without specific information about state laws, this is not the strongest argument.\n\n3. Unjust enrichment (option C) is explicitly mentioned in the documentation as a valid basis for compelling payment. The resident obtains benefits from the HOA's activities, such as maintenance of common areas and roads, which supports this theory.\n\n4.

As was stated, US mail carries risk.\n\n*Or are they in some cases risking a breach of client confidentiality even if they do?* If they do... what? inform clients of risks?\n\nIt is up to the lawyer to inform the client of the danger of using email. Certain cases warrant more precaution than others. The lawyer will need to weigh all of this. It is also possible that a heightened level of security makes communication too cumbersome or expensive. What if the client does not want to pay for the extra time it takes you to encrypt/decrypt? What if the client cannot figure out the software? No matter how sloppy the client is, it is incumbent upon the lawyer to protect communication.\n\nIt's ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1\\.6(a) that explains this for us. \n*A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent*...\n\ncontinuing to paragraph (c):\n\n*(c) A lawyer shall make **reasonable efforts** to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information relating to the representation of a client.*\n\nComment 18 in part (relating to safeguarding information): *unauthorized access...does not constitute a violation of paragraph (c) if the lawyer has made **reasonable efforts** to prevent the access or disclosure.*\n\ncontinuing:\n\n*Factors to be considered in **determining the reasonableness** of the lawyer\u2019s efforts include, but are not limited to, the sensitivity of the information, the likelihood of disclosure if additional safeguards are not employed, the **cost** of employing additional safeguards, the **difficulty** of implementing the safeguards, and the extent to which the safeguards adversely affect the lawyer\u2019s ability to represent clients (e.g., by making a device or important piece of **software excessively difficult to use**).*\n\nComment 19 in part:\n\\*When transmitting a communication that includes information relating to the representation of a client, the lawyer must take **reasonable precautions** to prevent the information from coming into the hands of unintended recipients. This duty, however, does not require that the lawyer use special security measures if the method of communication affords a reasonable expectation of privacy. **Special circumstances, however, may warrant special precautions**. Factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of the lawyer's expectation of confidentiality include the sensitivity of the information and the extent to which the privacy of the communication is protected by law or by a confidentiality agreement.\n\nBoth instances require reasonable efforts \\- those an ordinary person would use.\n\nABA Formal Opinion 1\\-459 tells us that\n*A lawyer sending or receiving substantive communications with a client via e\\-mail or other electronic means ordinarily must warn the client about the risk of sending or receiving electronic communications using a computer or other device, or e\\-mail account, where there is a significant risk that a third party may gain access.*\n\nThis comment pertains to specific situations, like a client emailing a lawyer from the client's work\\-computer. It does not specifically apply to hacker\\-threat.\n\nAnd to muddy all of this up, it's not only communication and information that is at risk. Property is also at risk and the duty to protect property is higher than the duty over communication. Secret recipes, customer lists, strategic plans \\- these are all forms of property and lawyers have special duties to safeguard client property. Comment (1\\) to Rule 1\\.15 says that *a lawyer should hold property of others with the care required of a professional fiduciary.* This is **higher than the reasonableness requirement for protecting information**.

While it might seem like a simple breach of contract (option B), the specific nature of real estate transactions and the doctrine of specific performance make C the most appropriate answer. \n\nSpecific performance is an equitable remedy often applied in real estate cases because property is considered unique. In this case, Sam can file a lawsuit seeking specific performance, which would compel Olivia to fulfill her contractual obligation of delivering the property free of encumbrances.

This waiver does not contain any provision requiring Stack Exchange (or anyone else) to moderate \"fairly\" or to be \"neutral,\" nor does it say anything about terms of service. Regardless, it's hard to see how they could violate these terms anyway:\n\n> Stack Overflow reserves the right to refuse, suspend or terminate your access to the public Network if it determines, **in its sole discretion**, that you have in any way violated these Public Network Terms or are otherwise ineligible to access or use the Network or Services.

There is nothing in the GDPR that exempts a data controller from its provisions because the data is \"B2B\". It is true that the GDPR does not protect data that identifies businesses and other entities that are not natural persons. But a natural person is still a natural person when s/he is an employee. Data that identifies or is associated with an employee is still personal data.\n\nThe question also seems to assumes that publication of any data associated with a person requires that person's consent under the GDPR. That is also incorrect. The GDPR requires a ***lawful basis*** for any processing. Storage is processing. So is posting to a web site, whether internal to a business or on the open internet. All such processing requires a lawful basis. Consent is only one of the six possible lawful bases available under the GDPR.\n\nA company that wants to post an employee directory, or the contact info of selected employees so that a customer can send communications to them, may obtain the consent of those employees, which may be the simplest basis to establish. Or it might also use legitimate interest. It certainly seems to me that a business has a legitimate interest in letting its customers know how to reach the proper employee to deal with the customer's needs.\n\nIt does not matter who pays for a telephone, a telephone number that is associated with a specific natural person is still personal data (PD).

See [*In re Lipsky*, 460 S.W.3d 579, 593 (2015\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/intxco20150424940). The user ought to be judicious as to whether to publish the chatbot's output.

The correct answer is C because it demonstrates key elements that could lead to a successful defamation claim:\n\n1. Awareness of falsity: The startup knew about the false statements for weeks, which could be interpreted as \"reckless disregard for the truth\" - a key component of malice in defamation law.\n\n2. Failure to act: Despite knowing about the false statements, the company chose not to take action, which could be seen as endorsing or continuing the publication of false information.\n\n3. Potential for special damages: The scenario implies that the false statements caused harm to the competitor, likely resulting in measurable financial losses.\n\n4. Insufficient defense: While the startup included a disclaimer, their awareness and inaction may override this protection, especially if it caused significant harm.\n\nOption A is incorrect because measurable damages are typically required for a defamation claim, especially for non-public figures.

But [punching someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl4ViIwy7KA) or biting their ear is clearly outside the context of the game \u2013 why no criminal charges?\n\nEdit: [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl4ViIwy7KA) is a good example.\n\nClarification: I'm asking whether or not it's technically legal to do these sorts of things. Not whether they are or should be enforced.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (Note that some of the below may be UK specific, but the general principle applies in many other jurisdictions)\n\nWell the first thing is to stop working from this from the wrong direction: There is no law that makes it legal to assault someone: the law only makes it illegal to assault someone (eg in the UK, the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 apply). The law states that it is illegal to assault someone. So let's explore how sport works.\n\nIn most legal systems, you are able to give **consent** for certain activities or risks. This is also why certain other activities (for example, things a couple may enjoy in their own home) are not necessarily assault if consented to.\n\nEssentially, therefore, your consent gives the person doing the hitting the *legal excuse* (a little different to a normal excuse for forgetting your homework or being late to work): or a defense that their actions were reasonable. This stops the issue being the law, therefore, and becomes an issue of what does/doesn't constitute an \"excuse\".\n\nIt is not therefore a question of \"**What law allows you to commit a crime during sport**?\" instead it is really one of \"**Exactly how much consent can a person give, to allow consent to be used as an excuse, and at what point is that consent no longer an excuse**?\"\n\nFor example in *R v Brown* (UK Case Law) it was established that you cannot give unlimited consent. Similarly in every jurisdiction I'm aware of, that consent is only able to be given within the realms of the rules of the sport. As soon as the rules are broken, a crime may have been committed.\n\nI won't go into the details of R v Brown here, as I'm not convinced that it's suitable for SE (although I'm sure you can find it), but to give a more sport\\-related example, R v Donovan established that\n\n> No person can license another to commit a crime, if (the jury) were satisfied that the blows struck ... were likely or intended to do bodily harm ... they ought to convict ... only if they were not so satisfied (was it) necessary to consider the further question whether the prosecution had negatived consent.\n\nAgain, similar case law or exemptions exist in most jurisdictions. Essentially what this establishes is that if the intent is to cause harm, rather than to undertake the sport or activity to which consent has been given, it is still a crime\n\nThe question after this is then generally one of whether it is in the public interest to prosecute, and often (but not always) the victim's wishes are taken into account.\n\nIn some cases, the sportsman *is* prosecuted: [for example this British football player](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6252157.stm) who assaulted an opponent. In other cases there is either insufficient evidence, or insufficient interest in the prosecution.\n\nIn many cases where the rules are broken but no serious harm is done, for example where rules are broken accidentally or in a minor way, the police or prosecution service (or equivalent) may simply regard the matter as sufficiently dealt with. This is the same as with most other cases, where not every instance of assault is necessarily prosecuted: two teenage brothers fighting may not result in a prosecution, or an assault in the street may not carry enough evidence.\n\n*And to indirectly answer the question* \\- the reason players are often not prosecuted is because \"In the public interest\" incorporates an element of public opinion. If a certain action has become (or always been seen as) acceptable, it is unlikely to be prosecuted. For example minor fouls in games, or accidental fouls causing injuries. The other primary reason is that the victim chooses not to press charges (although this isn't required, and the police are able to press charges themselves, it is often taken into account)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about legal issues in sports, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A professional basketball player, frustrated during a game, intentionally elbows an opponent in the face, causing significant injury. The injured player wants to press charges. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The incident is completely protected under the consent given by participating in the sport, and no charges can be filed.\n\nB) Criminal charges can only be filed if the league's governing body approves the prosecution.\n\nC) Criminal charges can be pursued, as the action likely exceeds the scope of consent given for participating in the sport.\n\nD) The incident can only be handled through the sport's internal disciplinary procedures, not the criminal justice system.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the concept of consent in sports and its limits. The correct answer is C because the documentation clearly states that consent in sports is not unlimited and is generally confined to actions within the rules of the sport. An intentional elbow to the face likely falls outside the scope of basketball's rules and the consent given by participating.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes blanket protection for any action during a sport, which the documentation contradicts. Option B is incorrect as there's no mention of league approval being necessary for criminal charges. The law, not the league, determines what constitutes a crime.

The Restatement of Torts sets forth a variety of absolute immunities from defamation liability (a common law tort) that are almost universally honored by state courts.\n\nBoth parties to litigation and witnesses have absolute immunity from defamation liability for statements made in connection with a judicial proceeding.\n\n> A party to a private litigation or a private prosecutor or defendant\n> in a criminal prosecution is absolutely privileged to publish\n> defamatory matter concerning another in communications preliminary to\n> a proposed judicial proceeding, or in the institution of or during the\n> course and as a part of, a judicial proceeding in which he\n> participates, if the matter has some relation to the proceeding.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 587 (1977\\)\n\n> A witness is absolutely privileged to publish defamatory matter\n> concerning another in communications preliminary to a proposed\n> judicial proceeding or as a part of a judicial proceeding in which he\n> is testifying, if it has some relation to the proceeding.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 588 (1977\\).\n\nThere are also similar absolute privileges from defamation liability for judicial officers (Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 585\\), attorneys' at law for a party (Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 586\\), and jurors (Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 589\\).\n\nThe absolute privilege from defamation liability for attorneys for a party in connection with court proceedings has been described as follows:\n\n> Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 586 (1977\\), adopted in *Colorado in\n> Renner v.

Valencia Associates*, 712 P.2d 1024, 1027 (Colo. App. 1985\\)\n\nThere is also a widely recognized (and arguably constitutionally required) qualified immunity from defamation liability for people making an accurate report of what was said in court that would otherwise be defamatory, so long as it is indeed a substantially accurate account:\n\n> \\[U]nder the common law doctrine of fair report, reports of in\\-court\n> proceedings containing defamatory material are privileged if they are\n> fair and substantially correct, or are substantially accurate accounts\n> of what took place. *See Rosenberg v. Helinski*, 328 Md. 664, 616 A.2d\n> 866 (1992\\); *Cianci v.

Co*., 5 P.3d 959, 964 (Colo. App. 2000\\).\n\nThere are myriad cases upholding these privileges, which have been widely recognized even prior to the Revolutionary War in North American common law court cases adopting the English common law rules in place at the time.\n\nWhy Does Absolute Immunity Exist In These Circumstances?\n========================================================\n\nThere are several basic policy justifications for this form of immunity.\n\nOne is that is avoids the risk of collateral litigation arising from ordinary lawsuits and criminal prosecutions.\n\nA second one that is closely related is that it eliminates the extraneous considerations that might discourage someone from being truthful at trial for fear of a defamation lawsuit which might be costly to defend even if the court participant prevailed.\n\nA third one is that it creates an incentive to use the court system to resolve disputes over sensitive issues that could damage reputations, rather than in public relations fights in the media and other public forums that are less structured, or, for example, in duels (a pervasive problem in much of the U.S. until the late 19th century when they were effectively banned and American culture ceased to approve of them as valid or necessary to avenge one's honor).\n\nAlso, while defamation litigation is prohibited based upon statements made in court proceedings, there are, in principle, other means of punishing false statements made in court proceedings or other defamatory conduct in court proceedings. It is a crime, perjury, to make a false statement under oath in a court proceeding (although perjury is rarely prosecuted in practice relative to how frequently it occurs).\n\nA judge can strike scandalous and unnecessary materials in court documents that would be defamatory, can order court documents placed under seal, can order that the public be barred from court proceedings in certain kinds of circumstances, can bar parties to court cases and their attorneys from disclosing otherwise secret matters in court cases, and can hold someone in contempt of court for improperly making defamatory statements public when they were ordered not to do so.\n\nFinally, if a trier of fact does not believe a false statement made in a court proceeding, the judge or jury can rule against that person on the claim that the false statement supports, and a judge can say that the judge believed that the statement made was false.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A journalist is reporting on a high-profile defamation lawsuit between two celebrities.

The correct answer is C because of the fair report privilege, which provides a qualified immunity from defamation liability for people making an accurate report of what was said in court, even if those statements would otherwise be defamatory.\n\nThe question requires analysis of several factors:\n1.

This common law principle exists in most states and allows schools to make decisions and enforce rules that are in the best interest of students' education and well-being, similar to how a parent would.\n\nOption A, while related to school authority, specifically refers to search and seizure issues and doesn't directly address the broader authority to create and enforce school policies.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is no specific federal legislation granting schools this authority. The documentation clearly states that this authority arises under state common law, not federal law.\n\nOption D, implied consent, might seem plausible but is not the primary legal basis for the school's authority. The documentation shows that even without explicit agreement to the handbook, the school still has this authority.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of the legal concept to a specific scenario, integrating multiple aspects of the provided information and testing critical thinking about the source and extent of school authority."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83839/is-there-a-law-against-signing-a-contract-to-do-something-illegal", "docs_id": 83839, "title": "Is there a law against signing a contract to do something illegal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Inspired by this question over on workplace.SE \\- [Severance contract requires a lie.

A contract can't force people to declare lies under oath or demand them to murder someone. Thus, a contract demanding such is illegal.\n\nAs a result, such a clause would not just be unenforceable, it might void the entire contract wholesale if it is not severable. In the least, any clause demanding illegal acts was [null and void *ab initio*](https://content.next.westlaw.com/Glossary/PracticalLaw/I41334c8d07ef11ebbea4f0dc9fb69570?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true), and **never** was valid.\n\n### void contracts in law\n\n* [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\") explicitly makes contracts void that are \"Sittenwidrig\" in [\u00a7 138 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__138.html) and also illegal ones in [\u00a7 134 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__134.html)\n\t+ Declarations to the *Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit* are made under threat of perjury, and thus lying is illegal.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) The employee has committed a felony by signing a contract to perform an illegal act, regardless of their intention\nB) The contract is legally binding, and the employee must adhere to all terms or face breach of contract penalties\nC) The contract is void ab initio, but the employee could still face conspiracy charges for agreeing to potentially illegal terms\nD) The contract is unenforceable only in regards to the clause requiring false statements, while other provisions remain valid\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex legal concepts and potential consequences. The contract requiring the employee to lie about their employment status is an illegal contract, as it demands an unlawful act (lying to government agencies). According to the documentation, such contracts are \"null and void ab initio,\" meaning they were never valid to begin with. \n\nHowever, the act of signing such a contract, even without the intention to follow through, could be seen as evidence of a conspiracy between the employer and employee to commit an illegal act. The documentation specifically states that \"Conspiracy is illegal and usually a felony.\" This makes option C the most accurate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely signing an illegal contract is not automatically a felony, especially without intent to follow through. Option B is wrong because illegal contracts are not legally binding. Option D is partially correct about the contract being unenforceable, but it doesn't account for the potential conspiracy issue and oversimplifies the complexity of contract severability in this context.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts (illegal contracts, conspiracy, intent) and application to a real-world scenario, testing critical thinking rather than simple recall."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/92005/when-is-the-next-significant-date-on-the-horizon-in-the-judicial-proceedings-aga", "docs_id": 92005, "title": "When is the next significant date on the horizon in the judicial proceedings against Julian Assange?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Australian journalist Julian Paul Assange is in remand pending the CPS appeal against his triumph in the extradition proceedings against him for offences under the U.S. espionage act.\n\nWhen is the next relevant date or time frame within these proceedings?

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. US law prohibits bigamy (being married to more than one person simultaneously) regardless of where previous marriages occurred or the citizenship status of those involved.\n2. The documentation explicitly states that \"Only the currently unmarried may lawfully marry in the US\" and that this applies to \"holders of any visa type.\"\n3. Obtaining a divorce in the home country before proceeding with a US marriage would ensure compliance with US law against bigamy.\n4. Maintaining F-2 visa status while going through this process is permissible, as the visa status itself doesn't prevent legal marriage after proper dissolution of a previous marriage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it would constitute bigamy, which is illegal in the US. Option C is also illegal as it would involve bigamy at the time of the US marriage.

Therefore, it would stand to reason that \"they we're unable to contact\" the responsible party would not be a very solid legal defense, no? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The ordinance is not very specific about how notice is to be given: therefore, it need not be in writing, and it need not be sent by mail. It would not be surprising if the \"notification\" came in the form of a city person inspecting the reported obstruction, walking up to the house and knocking and finding nobody home (thus triggering the \"In case the owner cannot be found\" condition), whereupon the city removes the rocks. That clause does not mean \"In case we do not know who the owner is\", it almost certainly means \"in case the owner cannot be contacted immediately\". Article III is in general about obstructions on streets, which are not allowed, except by permit in section 78 under \"Permit to Obstruct Traffic Lane\". Assuming that no obstruction permit was obtained, what usually happens is that an officer is sent to tell the owner to remove the obstruction (more or less immediately), and if nobody is at the site whom they can tell, they probably won't go any further (e.g. asking neighbors where the owner is).\n\nThere is no legal definition of \"reasonable time\", instead the law simply takes that to mean \"the amount of time a reasonable person would require\". It would thus depend particularly on the size of the obstruction and the volume of traffic. One measure would be how quickly the rocks were moved \\-\\- if it was a matter of days and there was no notice, written or otherwise, then there would not be the kind of urgency that might justify the \"We knocked and nobody was home\" version of notification.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner in Bloomington, Illinois, placed landscaping rocks on the street in front of their house.

Which of the following strategies would be most effective in challenging the city's decision?\n\nA) File a lawsuit against the city for trespassing and theft of property\nB) Argue that the city failed to provide \"reasonable time\" for removal as required by the ordinance\nC) Claim that the rocks were not an obstruction since they were intended for landscaping\nD) Demand a full refund based on the city's failure to obtain a removal permit\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most effective strategy is to argue that the city failed to provide \"reasonable time\" for removal as required by the ordinance. The city code (Chapter 38, Section 81) states that the Superintendent of Streets \"shall notify the person causing such obstruction to remove the same within a reasonable time.\" In this case, the city removed the rocks without any correspondence or notification, which appears to violate the ordinance's requirement for notification and allowance of reasonable time for removal.\n\nOption A is too aggressive and likely unwarranted, as the city has authority to remove obstructions. Option C is weak because the rocks, regardless of their intended use, were still an obstruction on the street. Option D is incorrect because the city doesn't need a permit to remove obstructions; rather, citizens need permits to place obstructions.\n\nThe \"reasonable time\" argument (Option B) directly addresses the procedural failure by the city and aligns with the ordinance's requirements. It also leaves room for negotiation on what constitutes \"reasonable time\" and whether immediate removal was justified.

To be a refugee you must have a real and imminent fear of persecution which is generally defined to include matters like bodily harm or arbitrary detention or seizure of property on account of your status.\n\nThe generalized protections existing under the law from private violence and civil rights violations in the U.S., while imperfect, is not going to suffice as a general matter to establish refugee status, particularly because many of those protections arise under federal law.\n\nA generalized fear of a \"civil war\" someday, and a general dissatisfaction with the amount of corruption present in the government and the bad policies of the government, in the United States, is not sufficient.\n\nAlso, the United States is a free immigration zone, which means that people can freely travel and relocate to other parts of the United States, and while some places in the United States might be quite unfriendly to LGBT individuals, there are other places in the United States that are much more welcoming both in theory, based upon enacted laws, and in practice.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, there are state anti\\-discrimination laws, one of the leading candidates for Governor is a gay man who is currently one of our Congressmen, we have had lesbian speakers of the state house, a high official in Denver's school district is a gay man who was a former state legislator, and a DA in a fairly conservative suburb of Denver vigorously prosecuted and obtained a conviction against a man who murdered a transwoman on account of her trans\\-status including a hate crime count, and a transman serves in the U.S. military in one of the state's federal military bases. When I walk the halls of my children's high school in Denver, the walls are full of official administration proclamations of support for LGBT students that is backed up by action and reflected in how my children's many LGBT friends were treated in their school. Denver's clerk's office proudly proclaims that it marries hundreds, if not thousands, of same sex couples every year.\n\nThis doesn't mean life is perfect in Colorado, but it isn't official persecution of the kind that would rise to refugee status either. And, since anyone in the U.S. can move to Colorado or other relatively LGBT friendly states, there would not be any ground to claim refugee status. Canada, for example, would not admit someone as a refugee based upon persecution for LGBT status if that person did not demonstrate that they could not escape persecution by moving to metropolitan Denver or San Francisco or New York City.\n\nThe U.S. is not necessarily the very best place in the world to be LGBT, but it is certainly near the top, despite the fact that the struggle for LGBT rights is ongoing and will be indefinitely and it isn't perfect.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An LGBTQ+ individual is considering claiming refugee status from the United States due to perceived persecution.

The death penalty was partially abolished by the state supreme court in Washington in [State v. Gregory](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8854659891232700142) \u2013 for the third time. The court states that \"None of these prior decisions held that the death penalty is per se unconstitutional, nor do we\". Instead, it was found unconstitutional in its application: it is \"invalid because it is imposed in an arbitrary and racially biased manner\". This is similar to the situation with [Furman v. Georgia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/408/238/), where\n\n> The Court holds that the imposition and carrying out of the death\n> penalty in these cases constitute cruel and unusual punishment in\n> violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The judgment in\n> each case is therefore reversed insofar as it leaves undisturbed the\n> death sentence imposed, and the cases are remanded for further\n> proceedings\n\n4 years later in [Gregg v. Georgia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/428/153/), SCOTUS found that the revised procedure was consistent with the 8th Amendment. In these cases, imposition of the death penalty was invalidated, so any person so sentenced could therefore not be executed. These rulings were time\\-independent, that is, they refer to the imposition and carrying out of sentence, regardless of when the crime was committed.\n\n[Dobbert v. Florida](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/432/282/) interacts with these cases. Dobbert committed murder in the period when there was no constitutional execution, but the trial was carried out under a modified procedural regime that constitutionally allowed for execution. The court states that\n\n> The new statute simply altered the methods employed in determining\n> whether the death penalty was to be imposed, and there was no change\n> in the quantum of punishment attached to the crime\n\nso the revised procedures could be followed even though the statutory change was enacted after the crime was committed. This is one way in which a sentence could be \"abolished\" when the act was committed. and yet imposed at sentencing.\n\nIn the ruling, the court attempts to clarify the no ex post facto law clause of the Constitution. Citing [Beazell v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/269/167),the court observes that\n\n> It is settled, by decisions of this Court so well known that their\n> citation may be dispensed with, that any statute which punishes as a\n> crime an act previously committed which was innocent when done, which\n> makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime after its commission,\n> or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available\n> according to law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited\n> as ex post facto\n\nSo for instance suppose that a legislature decides to modify the statutory penalty for murder to 10 years in prison. That is therefore the penalty for any murder carried out at the time. If a person person commits murder in that period, even if they are not tried or sentences until after the legislature re\\-imposes the death penalty, that new sentence cannot apply to murder in question. The crucial difference involves distinguishing changes in the law of procedure, vs. what the actual penalty will be.\n\nAs also stated by the court, the concept of \"ex post facto law\" involves not just change in law, it crucially involves making things worse for the defendant:\n\n> It is axiomatic that for a law to be ex post facto it must be more\n> onerous than the prior law\n\nThere is no general US legal finding that a person is entitled to a lesser penalty when the legislature statutorily reduces the penalty for a crime, however that effect could come from appropriate legislative action, as plays a role in [Concepcion v. US](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1650_3dq3.pdf). Congress enacted a retroactive *amelioration* of the law (pertaining to weight thresholds related to sentencing in drug laws). SCOTUS presupposes in their ruling that this is possible because of this act of Congress (the issue in this case is about court discretion in what information is considered \u2013 a procedural question).

The state's Supreme Court ruling cited arbitrary and racially biased application as the reason for abolishment. Which of the following outcomes is most likely, based on U.S. legal precedents?\n\nA) The person can still be sentenced to death because the death penalty was in effect when the crime was committed.\nB) The person cannot be sentenced to death due to the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.\nC) The person's eligibility for the death penalty depends on whether the abolishment was retroactively applied by the legislature.\nD) The person can be sentenced to death if the state implements new, constitutionally valid procedures for imposing capital punishment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and precedents discussed in the documentation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The abolishment of the death penalty due to arbitrary and racially biased application is similar to the situation in State v. Gregory and Furman v. Georgia. These rulings invalidated the imposition of the death penalty based on its application, not the penalty itself.\n\n2. The ex post facto clause (option B) doesn't apply here because it primarily prevents making punishments more severe retroactively, not less severe.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because changes in law can affect sentencing, especially if explicitly made retroactive by the legislature.\n\n4. Option D, while related to the Gregg v. Georgia case, is less likely in this scenario where the state has abolished the death penalty entirely.\n\n5. The key factor is whether the legislature made the abolishment retroactive. As stated in the documentation, \"Retroactive application of a change in a punishment statute is not automatic, it requires specific legislative enactment.\" This is exemplified by the Concepcion v.

But for the sake of argument, here is the [US courts criminal complaint](http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/ao091.pdf) form. Notice that you are required to give your name and swear to the truth of the accusations. So it is impossible to file an official criminal complaint anonymously. (The form does not mean that a citizen could file a criminal complaint in US courts: it means that the person filing the complaint *must identify himself*). However, you can anonymously describe the facts to the police or the prosecutor, which could *lead to* an official complaint. Incidentally, if you believe that the person actually committed rape, notifying HR is not an appropriate response.\n\nGiven what you describe, there was no sexual assault. An employee saying something like that could constitute \"having a hostile workplace\", with respect to sex, and the company could get sued. There is no law whatsoever pertaining to a person alerting HR to such a problem. Instead, it would all be a matter of company policy. It is possible that company policy precludes accepting anonymous complaints of inappropriate workplace behavior. The consequences of such a policy could be costly.\n\nUnder EEOC rules, sexually discriminatory statements are sexually discriminatory statements, no matter who they are said to. The company is expected to take action if it know, or should know, about the conduct. By refusing to accept a complaint (anonymous or otherwise), the company could be mistakenly thinking that they are protected if they don't actually know.\n\nYou yourself might file a complaint with EEOC, or with HR, but no official legal complaint can be anonymous.

Based on this scenario and the information provided, what is the most likely legal outcome?\n\nA) The customer can sue ParcelHero for negligence and recover damages for all lost items\nB) ParcelHero may take legal action against the customer for breach of contract\nC) The customer can file a complaint with the UK postal regulator for service failure\nD) Both ParcelHero and the customer share equal liability for the lost items\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the customer violated ParcelHero's terms of service by sending a prohibited item (passport). According to the documentation, passports are clearly listed as prohibited items. By sending a prohibited item, the customer breached the contract with ParcelHero. The terms state that \"Customer shall be liable at all times for any and all Charges incurred by PH in returning, storing or disposing of an Undeliverable Consignment.\" This means that not only is the customer not in a position to take legal action against ParcelHero, but ParcelHero could potentially take action against the customer for the breach of contract and any associated costs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the customer's breach of contract by sending prohibited items likely absolves ParcelHero of liability for lost items. Option C is incorrect because the issue stems from the customer's violation of terms, not a general service failure. Option D is incorrect because the liability is not equally shared; the customer bears responsibility for violating the terms of service.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the given scenario, application of contract law principles, and integration of the specific terms of service mentioned in the documentation.

So does Title VI\n----------------------------------\n\nThe US Department of Justice (DoJ) has issued a [*Title IX Legal Manual*](https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ix#IV.%C2%A0%20Discriminatory%20Conduct). This reads in the section  [Scope of Coverage](https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ix#III.%C2%A0%20Scope%20of%20Coverage):\n\n> Title IX prohibits, with certain exceptions, any entity that receives \"federal financial assistance\" from discriminating against individuals on the basis of sex in education programs or activities. The clearest example of federal financial assistance is the award or grant of money. However, federal financial assistance may also be in nonmonetary form. See *United States Dept of Transp. v. Paralyzed Veterans*, 477 U.S. 597, 607 n.11 (1986\\).\n\nMuch the same is true of Title VI of the Civil Rights act of 1964\\.\n\nThe term \"federal financial assistance\" is interpreted quite broadly, and most, perhaps all, community colleges will be within the scope of Title IX and Title VI.\n\nFederal Anti\\-discrimination Law\n--------------------------------\n\n[Nolo's page](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/federal-antidiscrimination-laws-29451.html) lists several laws (all should spply to any community college) and their scope, including:\n\n* **Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964** (42 U.S.C. 2000e and following)\n\n> prohibits employers from discriminating against applicants and employees on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin (including membership in a Native American tribe). It also prohibits employers from retaliating against an applicant or employee who asserts his or her rights under the law.\n* **Pregnancy Discrimination Act**\n\n> amended Title VII to make it illegal for employers to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition\n* **Age Discrimination in Employment Act** (29 USC 621\\-634\\).\n* **Americans With Disabilities Act** (42 U.S.C. 12101\\-12213\\).\n* **Equal Pay Act** (29 U.S.C. 206(d))\n* **Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986** (IRCA) (8 U.S.C. 1324\\).\n\n> IRCA prohibits employers from discriminating against applicants and employees on the basis of their citizenship or national origin. IRCA's prohibition on discrimination applies to all terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, including hiring, firing, compensation, benefits, job assignments, promotions, and discipline.\n* **Civil Rights Act of 1866** (Section 1981\\)\n\n> Although the law's original purpose was to protect African Americans, courts have interpreted it to protect people of all races from discrimination and harassment. Section 1981 has also been interpreted to prohibit discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, if the discrimination is racial in character.  \n> \n> Section 1981 protects all private employees and all employees of state and local governments. It also protects independent contractors from discrimination by hiring firms and protects partners in a partnership from discrimination. It does not apply to federal employees, however.\n* **Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act** (42 U.S.C. 2000ff and following).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A 35-year-old transgender student at a community college complains that an instructor consistently misgenders them and makes disparaging remarks about their appearance.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal situation and potential courses of action?\n\nA) The student can only sue the instructor as an individual, since community colleges are exempt from federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\nB) The student can file a Title IX complaint against the college, but cannot pursue action against the instructor directly due to sovereign immunity.\n\nC) The student can sue both the community college and the instructor under multiple federal laws, including Title IX and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nD) The student has no legal recourse because community colleges are too financially constrained to make litigation worthwhile.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple legal concepts presented in the documentation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Community colleges receiving federal financial assistance (which most do) are subject to Title IX, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, including gender identity.\n\n2. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act also applies to community colleges, prohibiting discrimination based on sex and other protected characteristics.\n\n3. The documentation explicitly states that these laws apply to community colleges, contradicting options A and D.\n\n4. The student can pursue action against both the college and the instructor.

The financial status of the college or instructor is not a legal barrier to filing a lawsuit, contrary to option D. The documentation specifically addresses and dismisses this misconception.\n\n6.

The agent we're going through wanted a holding deposit when we agreed to start the process (fine), which came with an agreement that the deposit is returned if we sign the tenancy agreement (reasonable), but *not* returned if we don't (ok, so they're protecting themselves against some loon block\\-reserving their entire property listing. Fine). I agreed because the justification sounded reasonable (with hindsight: I am not a smart man).\n\nThe fees had to be paid before seeing the tenancy agreement. The agency has thus far refused to negotiate terms on any bit of paper it's got me to sign (so we're clear: not asking about that.

The question is more that I don't understand enough about contract law to work out whether or not this was legally questionable rather than just the agency screwing me).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Competent parties can contract for any terms that are not forbidden by law, and a contract is valid if each party provides consideration (i.e., something of value). It sounds like the contract you're questioning is essentially, \"I will give you money in exchange for you showing me an agreement and giving me the option to sign it.\" The act of \"showing an agreement\" evidently has some value, as does the \"option to sign,\" so your counterparty has provided consideration.

While the practice may seem ethically dubious, it's not inherently illegal. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Competent parties can contract for any terms not forbidden by law, and this agreement likely provides consideration from both sides.\n2. The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 require fairness, but don't automatically void contracts perceived as unfair.\n3.

The holding deposit agreement is separate from the tenancy agreement, and its terms were agreed to, even if reluctantly.\n\nThe tenant may have grounds to argue unfairness, especially if the tenancy terms are significantly one-sided or if the holding deposit is disproportionate. However, the mere act of requiring a non-refundable deposit before showing the full agreement isn't automatically illegal.\n\nThe correct answer is C because it acknowledges the potential for unfairness while recognizing that the initial agreement is likely still valid.

The essence of mutual mistake is that the parties are at cross\\-purposes; each party has made a different mistake concerning a fundamental element of the contract. \n\nIn this case, the plaintiff was buying hemp but the defendant was selling tow. The defendant did not mislead the plaintiff1 but the circumstances were such that the plaintiff's erroneous conclusion from the available information was reasonable.\n\nWith misrepresentation, the parties are not at odds about the fundamentals but rather one party has caused the other to believe something that is not true. For example, in [Leaf v International Galleries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_v_International_Galleries) 1950, the plaintiff bought a painting that the defendant said was a [Constable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Constable). It wasn't, so the statement was misleading; however, there was no mistake because both parties were in agreement that it was *this* painting that was the subject of the sale.\n\nConsider this example. I mention that I'm thinking of selling my car (my Porche). You've always appreciated my Ferarri and express interest in buying. We agree on a price: you to buy the Ferarri, me to sell the Porche. That is pretty much the textbook definition of mutual mistake. No one misled anyone, we were both not understanding what was being offered and what was being accepted \\- mistake is fundamentally tied to the offer and acceptance in that it is a mistake when they don't line up. \n\nIn contrast, if we realize the mistake and you are still interested in the Porche and ask \"What year is it?\" \\- if I say \"2017\" when it is actually 2016, then that is a misrepresentation. It's not a mistake because we are not at cross\\-purposes; we are both talking about the Porche.\n\n1Silence is not a \\[mis]representation unless there is a legal obligation to divulge information and absent a deliberate attempt to mislead by the silence. For example, if I know the house I'm selling has termites, I don't have to tell you that but I also can't say \"I've had a recent pest inspection\" and then remain silent about what it found because a reasonable person would conclude from my statement that the house has no pests.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small auction house is selling a mixed lot of textiles. The catalog lists \"100 bales of fine fibers\" without specifying the exact type. Company X, specializing in hemp products, bids significantly higher than other bidders, assuming all bales are hemp. In reality, the lot contains a mix of hemp and lower-value tow. After winning the bid, Company X refuses to pay, claiming a misunderstanding. Based on the principles illustrated in Scriven Brothers & Co. v Hindley (1913), what is the most likely legal outcome?\n\nA) The contract is valid and enforceable; Company X must pay the full bid amount\nB) The contract is voidable due to innocent misrepresentation by the auction house\nC) There is no valid contract due to mutual mistake about the fundamental nature of the goods\nD) Company X can claim partial refund for the tow bales but must purchase the hemp bales\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario closely mirrors the Scriven Brothers & Co. v Hindley (1913) case. The key principles at play are:\n\n1. Mutual mistake: Both parties are at cross-purposes regarding a fundamental aspect of the contract (the nature of the goods being sold).\n\n2. Reasonable misunderstanding: Company X's assumption that all bales were hemp is reasonable given the vague catalog description, similar to how the defendants in Scriven Brothers reasonably believed they were bidding on hemp due to the sample and shipping marks.\n\n3. Lack of clear communication: The auction house failed to clearly specify the mixed nature of the lot, similar to how the auctioneer in Scriven Brothers didn't clearly distinguish between hemp and tow bales.\n\n4. No intentional misrepresentation: The auction house didn't actively misrepresent the goods; they were simply unclear, which aligns with the Scriven Brothers case where the mistake arose from ambiguity rather than deliberate deception.\n\n5. Fundamental nature of the mistake: The misunderstanding goes to the core of what's being sold, not just a minor detail.\n\nGiven these factors, the most likely outcome is that no valid contract has been formed due to mutual mistake about the fundamental nature of the goods. This aligns with the Scriven Brothers ruling where the court held that no contract had come into existence when the parties were not in agreement about the subject matter of the sale.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they assume a valid contract, which is not the case here. Option B is incorrect because this situation is better characterized as a mistake rather than a misrepresentation, as the auction house did not actively provide false information.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts from contract law, application to a real-world scenario, and critical thinking about the distinctions between mistake and misrepresentation."}, "51": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14154/when-does-a-boyfriend-or-girlfriend-become-a-tenant", "docs_id": 14154, "title": "When does a boyfriend or girlfriend become a tenant?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My roommate's boyfriend spends more nights here at our shared apartment than I do.

It addresses the social aspect of the problem first, as suggested in the expert's answer: \"Social problems are best sorted out by talking to one another.\"\n\n2.

Option B is correct because:\n\n1. The act of putting the item in the pocket, even briefly, could provide probable cause for a police officer to charge the customer with attempted theft.\n2.

For anyone unfamiliar with the furry fandom, a \"furry cub\" is essentially a young/adolescent animal of some sort that hasn't reached adulthood. So, is this considered legal in the United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Note that \"pedophilia\" is a psycological or social term, and not a legal term. What laws prohibit is the creation, distribution, and possession of [child pronography](https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/child-pornography.html) Under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251](https://codes.findlaw.com/us/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/18-usc-sect-2251.html)\\- Sexual Exploitation of Children:\n\n> Any person who employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in, or who has a minor assist any other person to engage in, or who transports any minor in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States, with the intent that such minor engage in, any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct or for the purpose of transmitting a live visual depiction of such conduct, shall be punished as provided under subsection (e), if such person knows or has reason to know that such visual depiction will be transported or transmitted using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or mailed, if that visual depiction was produced or transmitted using materials that have been mailed, shipped, or transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, or if such visual depiction has actually been transported or transmitted using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or mailed.\n\nThis means that there is no offense if no real child is involved, and this is also true of the various other US laws on child porn. Since the case of [*Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition*, 535 U.S. 234 (2002\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_v._Free_Speech_Coalition) erotica which appear to depict a minor engaging in sexual activity, but which are **not** depictions of any actual child are protected speech under the US *First Amendment* and are therefor not criminal.\n\nSo called \"furry cub porn\" might include modified images of actual minors, in which case it would seem to be covered under US laws against child porn. But if the character is totally invented, or is based on an adult rather than a minor, then it would seem to come under the rule of *Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition*.\n\nNote, the law in other countries is significantly different. In particular in the UK a realistic drawing may be considered to be a \"pesudo\\-photograph\" even if not based on an actual person, and may be punishable in the same way as an actual photo of an actual minor.\n\nNote also, the making, distribution, or posse ion of 'child porn' is a very serious criminal offense. I am not a lawyer, and one should not rely on this post to determine what acts are and are not legally safe. If there is any question, consult a lawyer.\n\nNote also that under the above statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\\), something may be \"child pornography\" if the person involved is a minor, even if that person is old enough under local law to consent to sexual activity, and even if the person did in fact so consent, and even if there was no intent to distribute the image or video. So a person taking, say, a cell\\-phone video of him\\- or herself having sex with a 17\\-year\\-old, intended for personal watching only, in a state where the age of consent to sex is 16, can still be found guilty under this law, and such cases have occurred.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A digital artist creates and posts online a series of sexually explicit drawings featuring anthropomorphic animal characters that appear to be adolescent.

The key points are:\n\n1. The Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition case established that sexually explicit content depicting minors is protected under the First Amendment if no actual children were involved in its creation.\n\n2.

Option D is incorrect because the age of consent is irrelevant for fictional characters under this ruling.\n\nOption B is correct because it accurately reflects the legal status established by the Ashcroft v.

The correct answer is B because, as stated in the documentation, \"For something to be illegal in any meaningful way, you have to be able to point to a law that makes it illegal.

However, users of the system could potentially break existing laws depending on how they use it (e.g., tax evasion, illegal goods trading).\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes unregulated technologies are automatically illegal, which contradicts the principle explained in the documentation. Option C is a common misconception that conflates regulation with legality. Option D misapplies the concept of legal tender discussed in the documentation, where it's clarified that even cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender in the US, let alone a new bartering system.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the application of a legal principle to a novel technology, integrating concepts of regulation, legality, and potential misuse.

The landlord then switched the tenant to a month-to-month arrangement at a significantly higher rate without written notice and is now demanding back-pay. Which of the following actions would be the most appropriate and legally sound response for the tenant?\n\nA) Pay the demanded back-rent to avoid eviction, then sue the landlord for the difference later\nB) Refuse to pay the new rate, continue paying the old rate, and challenge the 14-day eviction notice in court\nC) Immediately vacate the property to avoid further financial liability, then sue for wrongful eviction\nD) Negotiate a compromise rate with the landlord and sign a new lease agreement retroactively\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of tenant rights in Washington State. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. According to Washington State law, all lease changes, including switches to month-to-month arrangements and rate increases, must be communicated to the tenant in writing. The landlord's failure to do so makes the rate increase and back-pay demand illegal.\n\n2. The tenant has documented proof of requesting a new lease and receiving no notice of changes, which strengthens their legal position.\n\n3.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes her potential for recovery in this situation?\n\nA) She can recover statutory damages and attorney's fees for all infringements, regardless of when they occurred.\nB) She can only recover actual damages for infringements that occurred before registration, but can seek statutory damages and attorney's fees for any future infringements.\nC) She cannot file an infringement suit at all because the infringement began before registration.\nD) She can recover actual damages for all infringements, but is not eligible for statutory damages or attorney's fees for any of the infringements.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided copyright law information. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Registration is not required to file an infringement suit, but it affects the types of damages that can be recovered.\n2. Statutory damages and attorney's fees are only available for infringements that occur after the effective date of registration.\n3. For works that are not registered at the time infringement begins, only actual damages can be recovered, even if registration occurs later.\n\nIn this scenario, the infringement began a year ago, and the copyright was just registered today. According to 17 U.S. Code section 412, no statutory damages or attorney's fees can be awarded for \"any infringement of copyright commenced after first publication of the work and before the effective date of its registration.\"\n\nTherefore, the photographer can file a suit and recover actual damages for all infringements, including those that occurred before registration.

Even when a plaintiff chooses state\n>  court, it may be possible for the defendant to have the case \"removed\"\n>  to federal court.\n> \n> \n> If the trademark owner is able to prove infringement, available\n>  remedies may include the following:\n> \n> \n> * a court order (injunction) that the defendant stop using the accused mark;\n> * an order requiring the destruction or forfeiture of infringing articles;\n> * monetary relief, including defendant's profits, any damages sustained by the plaintiff, and the costs of the action; and\n> * an order that the defendant, in certain cases, pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees.\n> \n> \n> Conversely, a court may find instead that\n> \n> \n> 1. you are not infringing the trademark,\n> 2. a defense bars the plaintiff's claim(s), or\n> 3. other reasons exist why the trademark owner is not entitled to prevail.\n> \n> \n> **How do I know whether I'm infringing?** \n> \n> \n> To support a trademark infringement claim in court, a plaintiff must prove that it owns a valid mark, that it has priority (its rights\n>  in the mark(s) are \"senior\" to the defendant's), and that the\n>  defendant's mark is likely to cause confusion in the minds of\n>  consumers about the source or sponsorship of the goods or services\n>  offered under the parties' marks.

This aligns with the USPTO guidance, which states that a key factor in trademark infringement cases is \"the degree of similarity between the marks at issue and whether the parties' goods and/or services are sufficiently related that consumers are likely to assume (mistakenly) that they come from a common source.\"\n\nWhile options A and B might contribute to the case, they are not as central to the core issue of trademark infringement as consumer confusion.

The correct answer, B, reflects the legal reasoning that has been developed through case law to reconcile DNR orders with the right to life. While the right to life is indeed considered \"absolute\" in that it cannot be voluntarily renounced in most circumstances (such as suicide prevention), courts have interpreted this right to include the right to refuse medical treatment, even if that treatment would prolong life. This interpretation balances the sanctity of life with personal autonomy and dignity in medical decision-making.\n\nOption A is incorrect because DNR orders are not typically classified as euthanasia, passive or otherwise.

I know politics is sticky business, and not everything is going to be clean, but what I saw struck me as exceptionally bad.\n\nIn software design, there's a widely used phrase to describe certain particularly jumbled programs: spaghetti code. This term can be applied to programs which have poor data structure designs, are poorly organized, or simply just don't make logical sense in terms of the way they are laid out.

Is it simply a case of \"This is how it's been for\n>  awhile, don't fix what isn't broken.\" or is there more to it than\n>  that?\n\nFirst of all, the United States Code is generally not designed to be used by non\\-lawyers.\n\nSecond, one of the main ways to research case law interpreting a statute is by doing a boolean search on the code section of that statute. Every time you change a title or section number, you impair the ability of people doing legal research (both judges and lawyers) to find previous case law interpreting the meaning of the statute. \n\nThird, you make it much harder to determine when the substance of the provision was originally enacted (e.g. if you want legislative history or to determine which of two conflicting statutory provisions was enacted first) since an annotated statute will often show when the current section was enacted but will not explain what it was derived from.\n\nFourth, the location of a statute within the context of other statutory sections often informs its meaning. Machine gun may have one definition in two or three laws, and a different one in two or three other laws, and there may be yet other laws where machine gun is an undefined term. Moving a statutory section from one part of the code to another could influence the default definition that one uses for an undefined term changing substantive law.\n\nFifth, usually a new codification will also involve some drafting standards, for example, to add gender neutrality or to avoid notoriously ambiguous constructions (like 250 word sentences). But, it isn't at all uncommon for very slight changes like the position of a comma or the formatting of a section with multiple indents, to result in a change of the likely meaning of a somewhat ambiguous statute and it is pretty much impossible to know a priori when a statutory section is ambiguous until you are confronted with a fact pattern that makes the ambiguity in that context clear. This isn't confined to obscure laws of little importance. For example, the question of whether Obamacare applied in states that hadn't set up their own exchanges hinged on these kinds of issues.\n\nNone of this is to say that you should never recodify the statutes. But, a basically aesthetic motivation that mostly matters to people who make up a tiny portion of the main users of the product (non\\-lawyers) that poses multiple threats to how statutes will be located using legal research tools, and how it will be interpreted once located, means that reorganizing statutes is not something to be done lightly.\n\nIn short, there are a lot of serious, substantive costs that can accompany a recodification of a law.\n\nAs a result, re\\-codification is most often done only as part of an overall omnibus reform of an area of law on the merits where the interest in being able to track prior interpretive caselaw and determine the original meaning of a statute enacted long ago is at its lowest.\n\n> Barring the even more ridiculous case of Congress repealing everything\n>  and passing the exact same laws again, just under different\n>  Titles/Chapters/etc,\n\nThis is not so ridiculous. \n\nMost states have done exactly that one or two times in their history (sometimes more for older states). Also, many newly admitted to the union states also do something similar. For example, the basic template for the statutes in Colorado was the statutes of the state of Illinois. Basically, the first time around, somebody started with an Illinois statute book, eliminated Illinois specific laws and laws that they didn't like, rearranged them and adopted them as the original statutes of the State of Colorado (it may have actually been version 2\\.0 after a stopgap set of statutes, I don't recall which).\n\nAlso, most states completely repeal and readopt all of their statutes in codified form on the recommendation of the codifier to a legislative committee, to reflect the acts passed in the previous session, every year. This doesn't involve overhauls really, but in principle is a complete repeal and reenactment.\n\nWhile the federal government has never overhauled the entire U.S. Code in this manner, it has been done at the level of individual titles of the U.S. Code. \n\nFor example, the most recent major reorganization and overhaul of the structure of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26\\) was in 1986\\. The copyright laws were overhauled in the late 1970s. Both of those accompanied major substantive changes in those areas of law.\n\nAnother major recodification of many parts of the U.S. Code took place following 9\\-11 in connection with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, which reorganized both the bureaucracy and the associated U.S. Code language associated with dozens of federal agencies.\n\n> would it be possible for Congress to arbitrarily\n>  merge, combine, and delete Titles, and to rearrange the location of\n>  laws, definitions, etc? Are there laws/regulations governing this?\n\nYes.

That's when the INTERPOL comes in. They usually requests the police from that country to act up. A judge from that country will grant their local police access to the data to be delivered to the country that requested it.\n\n> Can the police get a search warrant for data 'in the cloud'?\n\nYes. If the servers are located within the boundaries of your own country, it's a normal procedure. But like the above answer states, it's easier to subpoena the records than to execute a search warrant. In a subpoena, the company itself is bound to provide everything the police asks.\n\n> Can the police get a search warrant for such third party systems?\n\nYes. If there's enough probable cause, the investigation can lead to allow the police to try and discover files that are held by servers that store the cloud data. But if the servers are located outside the country and the company does not have any office opened in the country, a search warrant won't have validity in another jurisdiction and the police can't act without breaking the sovereignty principle. That's where the INTERPOL services are handy. The department is built in the principle of polices from different countries helping each other. The downside is that it's too bureaucratic and it takes a lot of time.\n\n> For instance if he has a virtual machine hosted by Amazon, would they serve the warrant on Amazon, or on the suspect?\n\nLike mentioned by @Viktor, if the company has an office within the bounds of your country, it's easier to subpoena the records because that way the company will filter and provide only the data linked to the suspect being investigated. That is, the subpoena will have both the name of the company (Amazon) and the name of the Suspect, so the company can provide only the necessary files.\n\nUpdate\n------\n\n> If the police lack sufficient evidence for a search warrant, but an interpol country was, for some reason, willing to work with the police to collect and provide that information would they be able to use it even if they wouldn't have been able to subpoena a US country?\n\nHypothetically speaking, I see your follow\\-up as a company that **do have** a local office and the Federal Police was turned down by a judge on a warrant/subpoena. In that case, there's no reason for another's country police to act on their own country. The suspect is a foreign suspect, the crime is a foreign crime and the police has no reason to work on it.\n\nBut for the sake of argument, let's say that the local police was turned down by a judge for lack of evidence or something and the suspect has been investigated by a foreign country or whatever. If the information that the local police desires to obtain is available through the INTERPOL, it's most likely to be accepted since it's a data stored by an international police department. In your scenario, the foreign police was granted a legal right to search and collected the data for legal purpose.

This is consistent with the documentation mentioning that an affidavit would be deemed hearsay and violate the defendant's right to face their accuser.\n\n2. Option B aligns with the documentation's suggestion to \"show the actual place the defendant lived.\" Utility bills and lease agreements are tangible, admissible evidence that can establish residence without requiring in-person testimony.\n\n3.

Not only did the interview go well, it could not have gone better! The principal and school board chair both believed I was a perfect fit for the school, and they were excited to have me join the school. I filled out all the necessary paperwork and cleared my state\\-mandated background check. Three weeks later, after I had quit my former job, hired a long\\-distance moving company, and nearly sold my car, the school board denied approval of my contract but gave no reason for it. The principal and school board chair ardently argued for approval of my contract but the board was steadfast. When pressed repeatedly, the board gave no adequate reason given. (School boards routinely approve of any teacher applicant who has the approval of administrators. Denial to applicants who have successfully passed the interview process is rare.)\n\nWhen the principal told me of the news, she was upset because she believed it was unethical. Besides, she knew I was good for the school and could tell that the students would enjoy having me as a teacher. She explained that the school board's decision was final and that the chair could not overrule or veto that decision. \n\nThe school board chair, the principal, and I all acted in good faith and were looking forward to the coming school year. Do I have any recourse in this matter? Do I not have the right to know why I was denied the job after the principal and school board chair promised it to me?

Which of the following legal concepts is most relevant to the applicant's potential case against the school?\n\nA) Breach of contract\nB) Promissory estoppel\nC) Wrongful termination\nD) Negligent misrepresentation\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most relevant legal concept in this scenario is promissory estoppel. While the question might seem to involve a breach of contract, the top answer explicitly states that \"These offer letters typically state explicitly that the offer is contingent on approval by the relevant governing board. This is sufficient to thwart promissory estoppel.\"\n\nPromissory estoppel is a legal principle that can be used when a promise is made and relied upon, causing detriment to the person who relied on it. In this case, the applicant made significant life changes (quitting a job, hiring movers, nearly selling a car) based on the promise of employment.\n\nHowever, the answer also indicates that such contingencies are common enough that \"a reasonable person would know that the principal (for instance) does not have final authority to make a contract.\" This suggests that while promissory estoppel is the most relevant concept, it may not be successful in this case due to the reasonable expectation of board approval.\n\nBreach of contract (A) is incorrect because there likely wasn't a formal contract, given the board's final say. Wrongful termination (C) doesn't apply as the applicant was never officially employed.

I've also seen it used in the phrase *without prejudice, save as to costs*.\n\nWhat is the purpose and legal effect of this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Without prejudice* in a legal communication has a similar effect as *off the record* does in journalism. Without prejudice can be applied to any form of communication written or verbal; mediations, for example, are almost always conducted on a without prejudice basis.\n\nThe legal effect is that anything said or written in the communication is inadmissible in a court. A typical example is in a settlement offer: \"We have your claim for $1,000,000 and we think its a load of c\\*\\*p for reasons A, B \\& C, however, without prejudice we offer the amount of $3\\.50 as full and final settlement of your claim. This offer remains open for 7 days.\" The party that receives such a letter can not use or rely on anything it says in legal proceedings.\n\nIt is a practical and invaluable method of allowing real negotiation and concessions to be made without the risk that these will be used against you if it all falls in a heap and you end up in court.\n\n*Without prejudice, save as to costs* has the same effect with the addition that you are specifically making a settlement offer (like my example above). If a matter is resolved by a trial the judge will award costs either against each one party or order that each party pays their own costs; in general, the costs \"follow the event\" i.e. the losing party usually gets stuck with the costs. If the \"losing\" party can show that they made a reasonable offer of settlement then they can apply to have the \"winning\" party pay their costs from that point on. For example see [NSW Costs](http://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/civil/costs.html).\n\nNow, a document either is or is not *without prejudice* irrespective of if it carries the words or not \\- you can\u2019t make a document that is not part or a bona fide negotiation *without prejudice* just by writing the words on it and one that is part of a negotiation is *without prejudice* even if it omits the words.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about \"without prejudice\" communications in legal matters, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A law firm sends a letter to the opposing party in a complex intellectual property dispute.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The \"without prejudice\" part of the principle means that the entire contents of the letter, including the analysis of case weaknesses and the settlement offer, are inadmissible in court. This protects parties during negotiations and allows for frank discussions without fear of later prejudice in court.\n\n2. The \"save as to costs\" part means that while the letter's contents cannot be used as evidence in the main proceedings, they can be revealed when discussing costs after the trial. If the case proceeds to trial and the outcome is less favorable than the offer made in the letter, the offering party can use this to argue for a more favorable costs arrangement.\n\n3. This answer integrates multiple concepts from the documentation, including the general inadmissibility of \"without prejudice\" communications and the specific exception for costs considerations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misunderstands the \"without prejudice\" principle, which protects the entire communication, not just parts of it. Option C is wrong because it suggests that the contents are admissible, which goes against the core purpose of \"without prejudice\" communications.

You have a contract with a business to provide some service, and you get a bargain on the price of the service as long as you stay with them for some period, such as 2 years.

The correct answer is B because it allows the attorney to indirectly appeal to the jury's potential desire for nullification without explicitly mentioning it or encouraging it, which would be unethical and potentially result in penalties.\n\nOption A, while subtle, still risks being seen as an attempt to inform the jury about nullification, which is prohibited according to the documentation.

Which of the following best represents the legal situation regarding potential compensation for loss of value?\n\nA) The collector can sue for negligence if they can prove the manufacturer was at fault for the engine failure\nB) The collector is entitled to compensation for the difference between the projected value with and without the engine replacement\nC) The collector has no legal recourse for loss of value as long as the manufacturer fulfills the warranty obligations\nD) The collector can claim damages for pure economic loss based on the car's reduced collectibility\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts presented in the documentation. The correct answer is C because, as stated in the top answer, \"Barring manufacturer negligence (and even this is a dubious theory, given that recovery would be for pure economic loss), there is probably no legal theory that would allow recovery of any loss of resale value.\" The key points are:\n\n1. The warranty typically only promises to repair or replace defective parts, not guarantee against any failure or loss of value.\n2. As long as the manufacturer fulfills the warranty obligations (replacing the engine in this case), there is no breach of contract.\n3. The buyer received exactly what they contracted for - a car with a warranty to repair, not a guarantee against failure or loss of value.\n\nOption A is incorrect because proving negligence would be difficult, and even if proven, recovery for pure economic loss is dubious.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there is no legal basis for such compensation if the warranty is fulfilled.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, as mentioned, recovery for pure economic loss is unlikely in this scenario.\n\nThis question tests the application of legal principles to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts and critical thinking about the limits of warranty obligations and potential legal remedies."}, "89": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21677/is-there-a-law-in-the-uk-that-makes-possession-of-specific-publications-illegal", "docs_id": 21677, "title": "Is there a law in the UK that makes possession of specific publications illegal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just read the following in [an article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/02/three-musketeers-convicted-of-plotting-terrorist-attack) in The Guardian (emphasis mine):\n\n> In prison they met their co\\-defendant Rahman, 32, one of nine men prosecuted in connection with a plan to attack the London stock exchange, **who was serving five years for owning copies of an al\\-Qaida magazine**.

[A BBC article from 2007](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7084801.stm) uses the same phrase, with regard to \"Section 57 of the Terrorism Act\", which appears to refer to the [Terrorism Act 2000](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/57):\n\n> 57 Possession for terrorist purposes.\n> \n> \n> (1\\)A person commits an offence if he possesses an article in\n>  circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that his\n>  possession is for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation\n>  or instigation of an act of terrorism.\n> \n> \n> (2\\)It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this\n>  section to prove that his possession of the article was not for a\n>  purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of\n>  an act of terrorism.\n> \n> \n> (3\\)In proceedings for an offence under this section, if it is proved\n>  that an article\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a)was on any premises at the same time as the accused, or\n> \n> \n> (b)was on premises of which the accused was the occupier or which he\n>  habitually used otherwise than as a member of the public,\n> \n> \n> the court may assume that the accused possessed the article, unless he\n>  proves that he did not know of its presence on the premises or that he\n>  had no control over it.\n> \n> \n> (4\\)A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a)on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not\n>  exceeding 15 years,\\* to a fine or to both, or\n> \n> \n> (b)on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six\n>  months, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or to both.\n\n\\*Interestingly, the maximum term of imprisonment appears to have originally been 10 years, [but was increased in 2006](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/13#section-13-1).\n\nThat law's not specific to publications, but in an attempt to answer your question more fully there does seem to be at least one law that \"makes it illegal to own copies of a publication\": the [Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Section_63_of_the_Criminal_Justice_and_Immigration_Act_2008&oldid=788945290), for example, renders possession of 'extreme pornography' illegal, and the definitions do not require (to reference your footnote) that the materials \"imply an illegal act took place\". Rather, the materials are illegal because (to quote a government consultation, via the Wikipedia page linked above)\n\n> such material may encourage or reinforce interest in violent and aberrant sexual activity to the detriment of society as a whole\n\nThat may or may not bother you from a freedom of speech point of view, but it leads me nicely onto a discussion of the underlying ethics/morality/rights debate that you impled in your question:\n\n**\"We punish thoughtcrime, these days?\"**\n\nAs far as I understand, Rahman was in physical possession of the magazine. So no \u2013 not \"thoughtcrime\". Merely thinking about the magazine \u2013 or believing the views expressed in its contents \u2013 would not, of itself, be illegal. Indeed, as the article points out in its description of main case under discussion (*i.e.* the \"Three Musketeers\" case, not Rahman's prior conviction),\n\n> the prosecution described as the defendants\u2019 \u201chateful beliefs\u201d \u2013 but the judge, Mr Justice Globe, told them they could not convict based on \u201cmindset evidence\u201d alone.\n\nHowever, like hate speech (speech, not thought), or conspiracy to commit a crime (which is what the men in the Three Musketeers case were being charged with), saying (or writing) certain things is, quite reasonably, illegal, if the intent of those words is incitement to commit a crime.\n\nRestrictions on free speech exist everywhere, and any (political) debate around it generally centres less on an *absolute* right to free speech, and more on where the line should be drawn. Even in the US \u2013 which tends to draw the line at the permissive end of the spectrum \u2013 speech intended solely to cause damage is not immune from reproach. The classic example is \"[\\[falsely] shouting fire in a crowded theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater&oldid=776960550)\":\n\n> The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic. \\[...] The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger\n\nSimilarly, the publication of a magazine, the sole purpose of which is to (inspire or facilitate) damage, can be illegal. It would then seem reasonable for *supplying* that magazine to others to be illegal. Possession with a clear intent to supply (like with drugs) would also, reasonably, be illegal. And if drug possession, with no intent to supply, can be illegal, then why not possession of illegal material, even if there's no intent to supply?\n\nI make no attempt here to justify (nor even to outline fully) the *exact details* of English law when it comes to these matters; however, there's an important distinction between freedom of speech (with regard to which nearly everyone accepts *some* restriction or regulation) and freedom of thought or conscience. To the best of my knowledge, there's no law (in Britain) that restricts either of those.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A legal scholar is analyzing the case of Rahman, who was convicted for possessing copies of an al-Qaida magazine.

The correct answer, C, is supported by several key points:\n\n1. The documentation mentions that Rahman was likely prosecuted under Section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which criminalizes possession of an article \"in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that his possession is for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.\"\n\n2. The law specifically provides a defense if the person can prove their possession was not for terrorist purposes, indicating that mere possession without terrorist intent is not the target of the law.\n\n3. The answer addresses the \"thoughtcrime\" concern by distinguishing between criminalizing thoughts or beliefs (which is not the case here) and criminalizing possession with suspected terrorist intent.\n\n4. The documentation emphasizes that in the related \"Three Musketeers\" case, the judge explicitly stated that conviction could not be based on \"mindset evidence\" alone, further supporting that beliefs themselves are not criminalized.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the conviction was based on possession, not beliefs. Option B is too broad and not supported by the documentation.

While law enforcement searches and seizures within the interior of the United States typically require a judicial warrant supported by probable cause, federal officers may conduct routine inspections and searches of persons attempting to cross the international border without a warrant or any particularized suspicion of unlawful activity.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. According to English contract law, a contract requires offer and acceptance to be formed. In this case, the contract was sent (offered) but never signed or formally accepted by the developer.\n\n2. The developer's act of beginning work could potentially be seen as implied acceptance.

However, the developer has performed work based on the proposed arrangement.

However, regular incarceration (Option A) would severely impede the President's ability to perform their duties and pose significant national security risks.\n\n2. House arrest in the White House (Option B) allows for a balance between punishment and maintaining the functions of the presidency. It addresses the judge's likely consideration of keeping the President \"as able as possible to keep performing the official functions of the office.\"\n\n3. While deferring the sentence (Option C) might seem logical, it doesn't align with the principle of immediate consequences for criminal actions, especially for such a serious crime.\n\n4. Option D, while creative, is not mentioned in the documentation and would likely face legal and practical challenges.\n\nOption B also aligns with the documentation's suggestion that a judge might order house arrest, allowing the President to be \"constantly surrounded by police officers\" while still performing official duties. This solution addresses both the punitive aspect of the conviction and the practical needs of the office, making it the most plausible scenario given the unusual circumstances.\n\nThis question requires students to integrate multiple concepts, consider real-world implications, and apply critical thinking to a complex legal and political scenario."}, "94": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6257/made-partial-to-landscaper-last-spring", "docs_id": 6257, "title": "Made partial to landscaper last spring?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live in Missouri.\nI met with a landscaper last spring, he gave me a price of $3700 to do some work about 9 months ago.

Typically the aggregator would be a [joint controller](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-26-gdpr/) with the user, however the user probably uses this for [purely personal reasons](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-18/) only, so the GDPR does not apply to the user.\n\nThat would also mean, the controller is required to [inform](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/) the data subject where that is feasible.\n\n> The GDPR gives users the right to have their stored data deleted.\n\nOnly in some specific situations. See [this](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/37916/18215) answer for more details.\nIn this situation it boils down to whether [Art.21(1\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/) applies:\n\n> 1. The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of [Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)(1\\), including profiling based on those provisions. The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nIt is difficult to say whether such \"compelling legitimate grounds\" exist, but in this example, the aggregator processes data which is either publicly visible, or at least visible to the user which receives the information. So as long as the user is able to get the data also in a different way, there are not much rights taken away from the data subject. So I would say that the controller has a compelling legitimate ground to process the data. Of course, the aggregator may not use the data for other purposes, unless it also has a compelling legitimate ground to process it for that purpose.\n\nHowever if advanced data analytics like [profiling](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) is done on the aggregated personal data, it may shift towards having no compelling legitimate ground to process the data.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about GDPR and data controllers, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A social media aggregator app processes and displays users' friends' activities from various platforms.

The correct answer, C, represents the best balance between respecting the data subject's rights and maintaining the aggregator's service obligations:\n\n1. It acknowledges the friend's right to object to data processing (Article 21 GDPR).\n2. It attempts to honor the deletion request while preserving essential functionality.\n3. It applies data minimization by anonymizing the data rather than keeping full identifiable information.\n4. It maintains transparency by informing users of the change.\n\nOption A is overly restrictive and could unnecessarily impair the service. Option B misuses the concept of \"legitimate interest\" and fails to respect the data subject's rights. Option D ignores the deletion request entirely, which violates GDPR principles.\n\nThis solution aligns with the documentation's suggestion of a compromise: \"As a compromise, would it be permissible to substitute deleted information with anonymous records.\" It also considers the \"compelling legitimate grounds\" mentioned in the explanation, balancing the aggregator's need to function with the data subject's rights.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking about GDPR application, requiring integration of multiple concepts like data controller responsibilities, legitimate interest, data minimization, and balancing rights and obligations in complex scenarios."}}
