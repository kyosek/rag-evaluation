No problem. \n\nOnce the officers saw I was cooperative and not trying to be difficult, they lowered their defenses and became much more cordial. \n\nI learned that I \"matched the description\" of someone who apparently had just moments before committed an armed robbery a few blocks away.

The presence of a lawyer, while generally advisable in legal situations, does not mitigate the core risk of being wrongly identified in a lineup.\n\nOption C is incorrect because providing an alibi does not prevent misidentification in a lineup, and agreeing to participate still exposes the individual to unnecessary risk. Additionally, volunteering information (like an alibi) without legal counsel present is generally not advisable.\n\nOption D is problematic because it implies a willingness to participate based on the suspect's description.

On July 29th, more than 30 days before my original move\\-out date, I asked if I could extend my lease for an extra 9 days, since that's when my flight home was and it was more comfortable. Of course, I asked the corresponding rent, and the \"property manager\" (not the owner, whom I've never dealt with) told me it was $357 (\\*1\\). That worked for me, so we decided to go forward (all of this via email with the property manager of the place I was at). My contract required only a 20 days notice to move out or make changes, so everything seemed to be alright.\n\nI moved out successfully on Sept 10th and left the place in a pristine condition. I had rented furniture which were picked up on the 11th.\n\nAbout 2 days ago, after sending an email asking when my deposit refund would be mailed to me, the manager said this:\n\n> So I spoke with my manager and she told me, under no circumstances do we prorate for move out. I'm so sorry, I didn't know we didn't do that. It hadn't come up before.\n> \n> \n> Because of this you still have part of your rent due. We can keep your deposit as part of your payment, but your deposit wasnt very high so you will still have rent due. I will get the totals and let you know.\n\nNeedless to say, I am a pissed. I do not intend to pay this extra rent (which is a significant amount) since we had agreed **in writing** (\\*2\\) about the new rent. I also would very much like my deposit back.\n\nMy first instinct is to say exactly that, and that I will seek legal help if they do not comply. It is not my issue that the manager didn't know this, or that my manager's manager hadn't communicated it to her.\n\n**Should I?** Is this a lost cause? Will I be in a world of pain to get my money? I am not living in the US anymore, so I couldn't meet in person with either them or a judge/attorney.\n\n---\n\nA few more details:\n\n* I payed monthly via an ACH recurring debit form, filling one for each month and choosing *one\\-time payments*, so I don't think they can just take the extra rent without my consent.\n* I imagine not paying would hurt my credit score. I do not necessarily care about it deeply, as I am not US based (but I might live there again temporarily).\n* The deposit is $298\\.\n* The email history with the manager is a bit messy, but I could transcribe and post it here. It was basically me asking questions and getting 1\\-line answers. The most relevant bit on July 29th, almost unedited is:\n\n> **Me**: \"Say I wanted to move out on Sept 9th, what would be the rent for September in that case? Is it a full month?\"\n> \n> \n> **Manager**: \"Yes because I didn't get \\[20 days] notice. You would have to pay for the whole month.\"\n> \n> \n> **Me**: \"But that's around 40 days from now..? In any case, moving out on Aug 31 as the lease says would be fine by me!\"\n> \n> \n> **Manager**: \"I am so sorry your right I was thinking August 9th. The rent for September would be. $357\\.\"\n\n* Adding to my anger is the fact that 1\\) the apartment was an absolute dump when I got there (filth, food in sink/oven, broken shower, ...) which I had to deal with (and got offered a $100 rent refund for, which I took) and 2\\) my contract specified a first\\-month's rent of about 50%, and when I realized I had paid more than that she replied \"it appears I got the numbers wrong on your lease \\[...] that was for another unit\". At the moment I took it as an honest mistake.\n\n(\\*1\\) We later agreed that I would stay an extra 11 days instead, but she did not update this amount. I guess I should pay the extra two days, I seem to have missed that.\n\n(\\*2\\) At least I hope emails count as \"in writing\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Unless your lease clearly denies the possibility of prorating, the emails are binding (and yes, emails count as *in writing*). The landlord ought to honor the conditions outlined in the emails, and it is not your fault that the manager was ignorant about his or her employer's/landlord's policies at the time the manager computed the prorated amount.\n\nAdditionally, if the lease only speaks in terms of *20\\-day notice*, then it implies that prorating may apply. It is possible that the lease contains language in the sense of when the notice becomes \"*effective*\". If so, that would require a more detailed review of the language therein, since even in that scenario you might prevail on the basis of the doctrine of *contra proferentem*.\n\nHere the difficult part seems to be that you are not in the US. Because the amount at issue is not high enough, the grievance/complaint would have to be filed in Small Claims court.

Which legal principle best supports the tenant's position in this dispute?\n\nA) Statute of frauds\nB) Promissory estoppel\nC) Contra proferentem\nD) Equitable tolling\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The principle of promissory estoppel best supports the tenant's position in this case. Promissory estoppel applies when one party relies on a promise made by another party to their detriment. Here, the tenant relied on the property manager's written agreement (via email) to prorate the rent for the extended stay.

Assured shorthold tenancies are subsets of assured tenancies, so first we need to look at the latter.\n\n**1\\. Is the tenancy an assured tenancy?**\n\n* [Section 1(1\\)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/1): tenant(s) must be individual(s).\n* [Section 1(1\\)(b)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/1): at least one of the tenants must occupy the dwelling\\-house as their only or principal home.\n* [Section 1(1\\)(c)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/1): the tenancy must not be excluded by in Section 1(2\\) or 1(6\\). Section 1(2\\) in turn refers to [Part 1 of Schedule 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/schedule/1) which contains a list of exceptions. They are quite detailed but, briefly, the following are excluded: tenancies with high rateable values, tenancies at very low rents, business tenancies, licenced premises, agricultural tenancies, student accommodation provided by universities etc., holiday lets, tenancies with resident landlords, crown tenancies, some local authority lets.\n\n**2\\. Is the assured tenancy an assured shorthold tenancy?**\n\n* [Section 19A](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/19A): the tenancy must either have come into existence after Section 96 of the Housing Act 1996 came into force (the vast majority of cases) **or** it falls under [Section 20](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/20).\n* [Section 19A](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/19A): the tenancy does not fall within one of the exceptions in [Schedule 2A](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/schedule/2A).\n\nTurning to your scenarios:\n\n**Tim rents an entire flat or alternatively a single bedroom through Airbnb for a week. (The landlord doesn't live in the same house.) Is he an AST?**\n\nNot an AST; excluded by Schedule 1 as a holiday let.\n\n**Suppose he rents it for a month, or two months. At what point does he become an AST with corresponding PFE?**\n\nAs long as it is a holiday let, it will not be an AST. It would only be an AST if it were Tim's only or principal home (and all the other criteria apply). There is no magical \"point\" at which it changes from one to the other; it's down to the reality of the facts.\n\n**Larry goes to Berlin for a week\\-long holiday and sublets his HMO room on spare room.com to Theodore for the week. Upon returning Theodore declines to leave.**\n\nThis depends on the specifics of how it was let to Theodore. It sounds like a holiday let on the face of it though.\n\n**Now what if Larry instead goes away for one month or three months and sublets his room (or flat if it makes a difference) for those periods. Again at what stage does it become AST?**\n\nAs above, it becomes an AST when all the criteria for an AST are met per the statutory definition.\n\n**Further, let us suppose that for Larry's fortnight holiday he collects a \u00a3300 deposit.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Emma is an individual tenant, satisfying Section 1(1)(a) of the Housing Act 1988.\n2.

It's likely to have come into existence after the relevant sections of the Housing Act 1996.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's explicitly described as a holiday let, which is excluded under Schedule 1.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there's no tenancy agreement; Tom is staying for free, so it's likely a licence rather than a tenancy.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the tenant is a company, not an individual, failing to meet Section 1(1)(a).

The scientist wants to maximize the impact of the lawsuit's outcome. Which combination of remedies would likely be most effective in addressing both the personal and professional damage caused by the defamation?\n\nA) Monetary damages and a public retraction published by the magazine\nB) An injunction requiring an apology and monetary damages donated to a research ethics organization\nC) Monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the magazine from publishing any future articles about the scientist\nD) A negotiated settlement including co-authorship of a feature article on research integrity\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation, targeting higher cognitive levels. The correct answer, B, combines two key remedies mentioned in the documentation: monetary damages and an injunction requiring an apology. This combination addresses both personal and professional aspects of the defamation:\n\n1. Monetary damages compensate for the harm done to the scientist's reputation and potential career impacts.\n2. The injunction requiring an apology helps to publicly correct the false information.\n3. Donating the damages to a research ethics organization demonstrates the scientist's commitment to integrity, further countering the false claims.\n\nOption A is less effective because a simple retraction may not have the same impact as a required apology. Option C, while including monetary damages, could be seen as an overreach and might even fuel further speculation about the scientist's integrity. Option D, involving a negotiated settlement, could be viable but doesn't leverage the court's authority to mandate an apology and might be seen as compromising the scientist's position.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of legal remedies with real-world professional considerations in a scientific context.

I don't expect my work to be published for many years. Right now I am just collecting ideas. However, I am nervous on what I will be allowed to do. I have 3 main questions\n\n1. If something appeared in that sci\\-fi universe prior to me re\\-iterating it; does that mean it's fair game for me to use? Its already used in that sci\\-fi universe but in a very obscure publication of it but once it's been used; can I use it again without any problem?\n2. Does intellectual law protect very specific plot concepts? I have a concept I thought of and like I said, I probably won't get published for several years. If someone publishes a story with that concept; can I still use it?\n3. Are you allowed to borrow names of different generic sci\\-fi inventions that aren't super\\-important to the story. I want to use a name for a piece of tech from Star Trek and I was wondering if that is okay.\n\nI won't say which franchise I hope to be writing for; but it's very big and quite popular.\n\n**UPDATE**: Basically I am writing a timeline of sorts in\\-universe of all technological, scientific, cultural, socioeconomic and historical achievements in that universe written from a in\\-universe point of view\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If one is writing *about* a work of fiction, one may describe the work, and use terms from the work in doing so. One might write, for example:\n\n> In *Spaceman Sam* the characters use \"blasters\" as weapons, while in *Jack of the Galaxy* \"contragravity\" is used to propel \"aircars\"\n\nThese are ***facts***, and copyright may never be used to protect facts. Moreover, such uses as reviews and criticism are particularly likely to constitute ***fair use*** under US law, or another ***exception to copyright*** under the law of some other country, even if some otherwise protected content is quoted.\n\n> If something appeared in that sci\\-fi universe prior to me re\\-iterating it; does that mean it's fair game for me to use?\n\nIf the \"something\" that appeared earlier is an \"idea\" or a name, it is indeed fair game. This is true whether it is obscure or well\\-known. In any case describing the facts of the fiction, even in detail, is generally not an infringement.\n\nIf \"re\\-iterating\" something from an existing work **in a new fiction** involves an extensive quotation, or a detailed, point\\-by\\-point reuse of a fictional element, that might constitute infringement, unless ***fair use*** or another ***exception to copyright*** applies.\n\n> Does intellectual law protect very specific plot concepts?\n\nNo, it doesn't. A plot concept is an ***idea***. In the US, [17 USV 103(b)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102) reads:\n\n> (b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\n\nLaws in other countries are similar on this point. This is sometimes known as the [idea/expression distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea%E2%80%93expression_distinction). This means that while the expression used to embody a concept is often protected by copyright, the concept itself never is.\n\n> Are you allowed to borrow names of different generic sci\\-fi inventions that aren't super\\-important to the story.\n\nYes. In fact even the names of fictional technological devices that **are** very important to a story may be, and often are, reused in different works by different authors. For example Ursula LeGuin used \"ansible\" as the name of a faster\\-then\\-light communicator, in fact an instantaneous communication device, in her \"Hanish\" series, particularly in *The Left Hand of Darkness*, *The Dispossessed*, and *The Word for World is Forest*. (She wrote that the term was derived from the word \"answerable\".) The term and concept were reused by Vernor Vinge in \"The Blabber\" and *A Fire Upon the Deep*, and by Elizabeth Moon in the \"Sassanek\" series and more centrally in the \"Vatta's war\" series starting with *Trading in Danger*.\n\nMoreover, the names of fictional characters are not protected. An author might introduce characters with names borrowed from Tolkien, Heinlein, or other well\\-known (or obscure) fictional works. US Copyright Office circular \\#33 \"Works not protected by Copyright\" says that \"names, titles, and short phrases\" may not be protected by copyright, and will not be separably registered.\n\nHowever, if a character has not only the name of a previous character, but a detailed, point\\-by\\-point similarity in distinctive elements to a character in a protected work, that may be enough to make the newer work a derivative work, and thus be infringing if permission is not obtained from the copyright holder on the source work. The same is true of the detailed reproduction of a distinctive setting from a source work. But a mere name and broad, general description is not enough tom make a later work derivative. The more details are reproduced, and the more distinctive and specific those details are, the more likely the newer work is to be found distinctive.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An aspiring author is creating a detailed in-universe timeline for a popular sci-fi franchise, including technological and cultural developments.

Option C is the most likely to pose a legal risk because it involves direct reproduction of copyrighted material. The documentation states that while facts, ideas, and names are not protected by copyright, \"extensive quotation, or a detailed, point-by-point reuse of a fictional element, that might constitute infringement.\" \n\nOption A is less risky because names of technological devices, even important ones, are often reused across different works and are not protected by copyright.

The correct answer is D for several reasons:\n\n1.

In this case, the allegation was only made to the companies involved, not to external parties.\n\n2.

The case law A-G Ref (No 1 of 1983) [1985] QB 182 further reinforces this principle, establishing that there is a legal obligation to return money received by mistake, even if it hasn't been spent.\n\nThe fact that Alice has a receipt showing her debt was paid doesn't negate her obligation to return the erroneous refund. TechCorp's mistake in refunding the money doesn't transfer ownership of that money to Alice. Keeping the refund without intending to return it could be considered theft under the law.\n\nThis question requires the integration of statutory law (Theft Act 1968) and case law, and applies these concepts to a real-world scenario. It tests the ability to analyze a situation beyond surface-level facts (like having a receipt) and understand the deeper legal principles at play.

I know there is a line, how and where is that \"line\"\n> defined?\n\nThis distinction captures the key point. If your sign stating \"Active Mine Field\" would, in the overall context, be understood as humor and not as a true statement of fact, it will be protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIf, however, someone is basically defrauded by a sign, because it appears to a reasonable person to be making a true statement of fact upon which a person reasonably relies to their detriment (or perhaps could reasonably rely to their detriment for criminal law purposes), then it is probably not protected.\n\nFor example, suppose that your \"Active Minefield\" sign causes the fire department, when responding to a wildfire next door to your property, to take the long way around your property or to call in the bomb squad at great expense. You could have civil liability as a result. Similarly, if the fire department refused to respond to a fire on your property due to such a sign, your insurance company might have a ground to deny your insurance claim for damages that a prompt fire department response could have prevented.\n\nAnd @user6726 points out circumstances where there could be criminal liability, although there, as in the civil case, the First Amendment would require those criminal statutes to be employed in enough of a common sense fashion to only be invoked in cases where a reasonable person would believe the sign to be purporting to be a true statement of fact in the overall context of the situation, in order to withstand an \"as applied\" constitutional challenge to a facially valid statute.\n\nSo, a \"space lasers\" sign (at least as of 2022 when there are no such things) would probably not give rise to legal or civil liability, but an \"Active Minefield\" sign without something involved in the presentations to clearly indicate that it is a joke (or a fictional depiction for temporary theatrical purposes, for example) to a reasonable person, could result in civil or criminal liability.\n\nSimilarly, if the sign was very artistic and also had pictures of Bugs Bunny and Coyote chasing each other, and images of obviously fake \"land mines\", or if the sign were accompanied by a picture of cow turds everywhere that made clear that the \"minefield\" was a field full of excrement rather than high explosives, it wouldn't be actionable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A landowner wants to deter trespassers by posting humorous warning signs on their private property.

The correct answer is B because an \"Active Minefield\" sign without any context to suggest it's a joke could be reasonably interpreted as a true statement of fact by observers, including emergency responders. This could lead to detrimental reliance (e.g., fire departments avoiding the area), potentially resulting in civil or criminal liability for the landowner.\n\nOption A is clearly humorous and unlikely to be taken seriously. Option C, while more plausible than invisible unicorns, still involves technology that doesn't currently exist, making it less likely to be interpreted as fact. Option D is fantastical enough to be recognized as a joke by most reasonable people.\n\nThe key factor is whether a reasonable person would interpret the sign as a true statement of fact in the overall context.

If so, how recently (has it been used in this century, for example)? Under what circumstances would it hypothetically apply following the abolition of slavery?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not aware of it invoking, but a careful read of the 13th Amendment will find there's an exception to the slavery ban:\n\n> Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n\nThis means that prisoners can be forced to work for the government for no pay if they are duely convicted for their crimes (often seen as a chain gang, which you can see from countless films, mostly exist so someone can escape from them in the story). Obviously these days the issue is largely moot as most prison work programs pay the prisoners, though this may be cents for labor otherwise netting above minimum wage, and chain gangs are no longer used (work details beside the roads are usually paid and its only for model prisoners. It's a treat for good behavior, not a punishment).\n\nSo while prisoner slavery is not used in modern society, it is still legal in the U.S. and thus the Fugative Slave Clause is still law and can be used in the modern setting since contrary to modern thinking slavery isn't 100% illegal in the United States... it's just most of the parties who could use this one type of legal slavery do not choose to use it, it makes the Article IV clause largely irrelevent.

While the Fugitive Slave Clause technically remains in the Constitution, it has become largely irrelevant due to the 13th Amendment's abolition of slavery. However, the 13th Amendment does allow for involuntary servitude as punishment for crime, making the situation complex.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, although the Fugitive Slave Clause remains in the Constitution, it's not typically invoked for modern legal issues.

Such a case might eventually reach the Supreme Court, but it's not the first step in resolving the situation.\n\nOption D is correct because standard interstate extradition laws would apply in this case. Under the Extradition Clause of the Constitution (Article IV, Section 2, Clause 2), states are required to return fugitives who have fled from justice in another state. This process is well-established and would be the primary mechanism for returning an escaped prisoner, regardless of the labor conditions they fled from.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring students to integrate knowledge of historical constitutional provisions (Fugitive Slave Clause), more recent amendments (13th Amendment), and current legal practices (interstate extradition).

Any easy way to be sure when it should be fine to use it and when I should do recon without it?\n\nThanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Every Internet access company, network, webhost, telephone company, etc, has a TOS (Terms of Service) that 99% of the time forbids any automated access by bots or any type of pentesting such as port scanning.\n\nTo legally port scan, you will need to get permission from each part of the network used as to not violate one or more TOSs and be civilly (and possibly criminally) liable.\n\nOf course, many pentesters do not have permission to port scan or look for bugs, but that doesn't absolve them of liability; they are just too many for network admins and company security staff to track and catch.\n\nSee [Legality of scanning a site with SSLLabs SSL Server Test in order to find and report weaknesses](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2033/legality-of-scanning-a-site-with-ssllabs-ssl-server-test-in-order-to-find-and-re)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A security researcher based in Scotland is developing a tool for bug bounty programs that incorporates port scanning capabilities. Which of the following scenarios presents the highest legal risk when using this tool without explicit permission?\n\nA) Scanning a UK-based target that is explicitly listed in the bug bounty program's scope\nB) Performing a port scan on a US-based web application hosted on a shared server\nC) Conducting a scan on an EU-based target that uses cloud infrastructure from a different provider\nD) Running the tool against a personal test server owned by the researcher\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple factors presented in the documentation and real-world application of legal concepts. The correct answer is B because it presents the highest legal risk for several reasons:\n\n1. Shared hosting: The documentation mentions that shared hosting situations are particularly problematic. In this case, scanning a web application on a shared server could inadvertently affect other customers' services, potentially violating their rights and the hosting provider's terms of service.\n\n2. International jurisdiction: The researcher is in Scotland, but the target is in the US, adding complexity to the legal landscape and potentially exposing the researcher to legal action in multiple jurisdictions.\n\n3. Lack of explicit permission: While the web application might be in scope for a bug bounty program, the shared hosting environment likely isn't. This creates a situation where the researcher might have permission to test the application but not the underlying infrastructure.\n\n4. Terms of Service violations: As mentioned in the documentation, nearly all internet service providers and hosting companies have Terms of Service that prohibit unauthorized port scanning or automated access.\n\nOption A is less risky because the target is explicitly listed in the program's scope, although caution is still advised. Option C involves cloud infrastructure, which may have its own terms of service, but is less risky than shared hosting. Option D is the least risky as it involves the researcher's own server.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts (international law, terms of service, shared hosting risks) and apply them to a real-world scenario in the context of ethical hacking and bug bounty programs."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1992/has-a-verdict-of-not-proven-ever-had-a-different-effect-to-one-of-not-guilty", "docs_id": 1992, "title": "Has a verdict of &#39;not proven&#39; ever had a different effect to one of &#39;not guilty&#39;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Scotland there are three verdicts available in criminal trials: guilty, not guilty, and [not proven](http://www.copfs.gov.uk/glossary-of-legal-terms#N). In modern use there is no practical difference between not guilty and not proven: the defendant is acquitted in both cases.\n\nHas there ever been a case where a verdict of *not proven* ended up having a different practical effect on the defendant than if he had been found *not guilty*?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There actually **is** a practical effect to a \"not proven\" v. \"not guilty\" verdict in Scotland, but it is mostly sociological or social in nature rather than legal. If your question is, are there future legal concerns, than no. Not proven *is*, to be sure, an acquittal. However, it is an acquittal that the tells the public something important: that the trier(s) of fact *thought the person likely guilty*. That's a fairly substantial distinction.\n\nIn Scotland, a criminal case may be decided either \"*in solemn procedure*\", which is simply the Scot term for a jury trial v. \"*in summary*\" or in \"summary procedure\" which is the U.S. equivalent of a bench trial. The difference between the two (and the divergence from the U.S. procedural vehicle) is that for lesser crimes the accused doesn't have an automatic right of a jury trial for any criminal matter. \n\nIn some ways this lesser included makes up for the fact that the Scottish accused is without absolute right to choose jury or bench trial, which in the U.S. can be very meaningful from a tactical perspective. Think of how important the make\\-up and emotional proclivities of juries are to both convictions and acquittals. A bench trial can be beneficial to the truly unlikable defendant, or in especially brutal crimes, where juries may convict out of fear or sympathy for the victim, even if the case is weak. At the same time, they may nullify the conviction for the sympathetic defendant. Juries are notoriously emotional and bias driven. Being able to choose a bench trial where the judge will follow the evidence and avoid the emotional response of a jury can be invaluable. Just as a sympathetic defendant can appeal to the emotions of the jury for acquittal or jury nullification, on the opposite spectrum. \n\nIn Scotland, lesser crimes are always (with limited exclusions) tried by a judge, while more serious allegations always (again w/ limited exclusions) get a jury trial, automatically. The d*efendant does not choose* the type of trial he is afforded. Hence, a defense or a prosecution cannot fiddle with the balance of proof based on emotion or lack there of. They get what they get. There are various rules procedurally that differ in comparison, but since this isn't the question that is the general rule and should suffice for background.\n\nAlso hugely important is the fact that in Scotland, jurors decide a case by *majority vote* (like a civil trial in the U.S.); hence, there are no hung juries and they don't need a consensus. So, one way or another the verdict *will be given* in a Scottish criminal action. Scots also get comparatively huge juries to any other country (15 jurors) and they *only need 8 in agreement* to reach a verdict.\n\nTactically, the \"not proven\" is a lesser included verdict (like U.S. uses lesser included charges in cases that are weaker for the prosecution). This lesser included finding can be used by choice when the Prosecution has a sympathetic defendant or when the defendant is probably guilty or unlikable. If the jury thinks the defendant (called \"accused\") probably did the crime, but the prosecution has failed to prove the elements, they can/will issue a \"not proven\" verdict. This sends a big message. This, again, is typically only reserved for those cases when there is strong but not conclusive proof that someone committed a crime. They don't want to profess their innocence with a not guilty verdict, so they are still acquitted, but with he stigma of the \"not proven\" verdict attached.\n\nSome estimates have from 1/5 to a full 1/3 of all acquittal verdicts by Scottish juries as \"not proven\" as opposed to \"not guilty\". Not proven can also be used by judges in the bench trial (summary procedure), however it's much less common. The proportion of 'not proven\" acquittals in general is higher in the more severe cases; but so then are the proportion of acquittals versus convictions. These would likely be hung juries in the U.S..\n\nBoth in the \"solemn\" and the \"summary\" acquittals, not proven is interpreted as indicating that the jury or judge, respectively, is not convinced of the innocence of the accused; in fact, they may be morally or even factually convinced that the accused is guilty, but do not find the proofs sufficient for a conviction under the elements of the crime on the jury instruction/verdict form. \n\nI look at this as similar to the adage oft used in the U.S., which is an acquittal, despite the fact that the verdict is termed \"not guilty\" does by no means indicate the person is in fact \"not guilty\", it just means the prosecution couldn't prove its case. Sociologists in the U.S., as well as legal scholars, have studied the phenomenon, and it appears that most not guilty verdicts in fact let go a guilty person. This can be intuited by the evidence the jury never saw, either by suppression from bad searches, by the exclusion of witness testimony due to procedural rules like hearsay, privilege, etc., and other forms of keeping relevant evidence from the jury to protect the rights of the accused. But in the U.S. the person can go forth and say, \"Hey, I was proven not guilty!\"\n\nScotland also has another interesting rule of criminal procedure, whereby a criminal can't be convicted without corroborated evidence. What this means is that if all the prosecution has is the victim witness, by way of proof, testifying, and no physical or corroboration testimony, Scottish law requires acquittal, but often will be so by the verdict \"not proven\". This is huge, if you think about it. Use, for example, a rape trial. A woman testifies, saying that Joe Schmoe climbed through her window and raped her. She knows Joe \\- he's her neighbor. Nobody saw him climb in. But she knows it's him. He leaves no physical evidence, having shaved his entire body and used appropriate protection (gloves, condemn, etc.). She has a rape kit done. Rape is obvious, but the only proof is her testimony. Joe goes free. But in Scotland, he goes free with a stigma attached. He's found \"not proven\" rather than \"not guilty\". I think this corroboration rule has a lot to do with why this verdict system still exists. In the U.S. the trier of fact would weigh the testimony and decide if one person was substantially more believable than the other, and a verdict would issue. That is a substantial difference, procedurally.\n\nSince Scotland doesn't have the hung jury because there is no consensus required they use the \"not proven\" in the same way a U.S. jury uses the hung jury when one or more jurors thinks the prosecution didn't prove their case but it's fairly clear the defendant is, in fact guilty. Then, you will often get a \"hold out\" juror, and since the U.S. requires a unanimous verdict, the hold out hangs the jury. It's sort of the opposite of jury nullification. The person knows that the evidence fell short, but their conscience can't reconcile letting the person go free, so they will vote guilty to hang the jury, almost ensuring the prosecution gets another shot.\n\nThere has been a lot of debate about this three verdict system in comparative law circles, with many legal scholars saying it's antiquated. But I think it serves an important purpose. It carries the stigma of likely guilt for those people who probably committed the crime but got off. Further, the hung jury cost tax payers millions of dollars in the U.S., and this is often the side effect of people not wanting there to be absolutely no recognition of the fact that the accused probably committed (especially serious) crime(s). The Scots, on the other hand, have found away to accomplish this without the cost and emotional toll multiple trials takes on all the players involved, from witnesses and victims, their families, the accused, and even the lawyers and the prosecutions, who have to put in all the work of a trial just to start anew. \n\nHere is a really good scholarly article that deals with this interesting phenomenon not seen in (I don't believe) any other country:\n\n<https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/iiclr/article/viewFile/17848/18019>", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Scotland's legal system, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A high-profile murder case in Scotland has concluded with a \"not proven\" verdict.

This would typically require permission from the copyright holder. However, there are several factors that complicate this:\n\n1. Fair use doctrine: The sketches might be considered transformative, especially as they cross mediums from music to visual art. This could potentially qualify for fair use protection.\n\n2. Depiction of historical events: If the song lyrics primarily describe historical events, and the sketches depict these events rather than unique creative elements of the song, this strengthens the case for fair use.\n\n3. Selection and arrangement: Even if individual elements aren't protected, the specific selection and arrangement of scenes might be copyrightable if it's not purely chronological or alphabetical.\n\n4. Degree of similarity: Without seeing both works, it's impossible to judge how closely the visual art mirrors the protected elements of the song.\n\nGiven these factors, a definitive answer isn't possible without more information and potentially a legal review.

As the record shows, some of the commissioners at the Commission\u2019s formal, public hearings endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial domain, disparaged Phillips\u2019 faith as despicable and characterized it as merely rhetorical, and compared his invocation of his sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the Holocaust. No commissioners objected to the comments. Nor were they mentioned in the later state\\-court ruling or disavowed in the briefs filed here. The comments thus cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the Commission\u2019s adjudication of Phillips\u2019 case.\n> \n> \n> Another indication of hostility is the different treatment of Phillips\u2019 case and the cases of other bakers with objections to anti\\-gay messages who prevailed before the Commission. The Commission ruled against Phillips in part on the theory that any message on the requested wedding cake would be attributed to the customer, not to the baker. Yet the Division did not address this point in any of the cases involving requests for cakes depicting anti\\-gay marriage symbolism. The Division also considered that each bakery was willing to sell other products to the prospective customers, but the Commission found\n> Phillips\u2019 willingness to do the same irrelevant.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> For these reasons, the Commission\u2019s treatment of Phillips\u2019 case violated the State\u2019s duty under the First Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint.

I'll create a challenging multiple-choice question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation about the Masterpiece Cakeshop case and the subsequent 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis case. Here's the question:\n\nQuestion: A web designer refuses to create wedding websites for same-sex couples, citing religious beliefs. The state's civil rights commission finds this violates anti-discrimination laws. The case reaches the Supreme Court. Based on the Masterpiece Cakeshop precedent, what is the most likely outcome and reasoning?\n\nA) The Court will rule in favor of the web designer, citing the precedent set in Masterpiece Cakeshop that religious objections to same-sex marriage are protected speech.\n\nB) The Court will rule against the web designer, as website design is not considered artistic expression like cake decorating.\n\nC) The Court will remand the case to lower courts, instructing them to consider whether the civil rights commission showed hostility towards the designer's religious beliefs.\n\nD) The Court will rule on the merits of the free speech claim, as Masterpiece Cakeshop explicitly left this question open for future cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision and its implications for future similar cases. The correct answer is D because the Masterpiece Cakeshop case did not actually decide on the merits of the free speech claim related to compelled artistic expression. Instead, it focused on the procedural issue of religious hostility shown by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.\n\nThe decision explicitly stated that \"whatever the outcome of some future controversy involving facts similar to these\" and that the outcome of such cases \"must await further elaboration in the courts.\" This indicates that the Supreme Court intentionally left the substantive free speech issue unresolved.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Masterpiece Cakeshop did not set a precedent protecting religious objections to same-sex marriage as free speech. It merely ruled on the commission's hostility.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Court has not made a distinction between website design and cake decorating in terms of artistic expression. This would be a new legal argument not supported by the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision.\n\nOption C is plausible but incorrect. While the Court could theoretically remand on these grounds, the question states that the case has already reached the Supreme Court, suggesting that lower courts have already considered the case. Given that Masterpiece Cakeshop explicitly left the free speech question open, it's more likely the Court would take this opportunity to rule on the merits.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze legal precedents, understand the limitations of previous rulings, and apply critical thinking to predict likely outcomes in similar but distinct cases."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51584/can-someone-be-compelled-to-prove-they-are-complying-with-a-contract-if-contra", "docs_id": 51584, "title": "Can someone be compelled to prove they are complying with a contract?

The other answer rightly explains the notion of *preponderance of evidence*, which pertains to the *procedural* aspect. Here, I will mainly address the *substantive* standpoint as per the situation you describe.\n\nThe HOA rule most likely is intended to serve one or more purposes, such as preserving the prestige of the neighborhood, and to avoid safety hazards. The prolonged presence of an abandoned vehicle \\-\\-just like any piece of junk\\-\\-\\- tends to contravene those purposes.\n\nRegardless of the vehicle's true state, the effect of its apparent abandonment is visibly detrimental to the neighborhood, and it frustrates the ultimate purposes of the HOA rule: to preserve safety conditions in the neighborhood as well as the value of the properties.\n\nAlso, the presumption that an abandoned vehicle is inoperable seems reasonable. The most straight\\-forward way to disprove the board's allegations of inoperability is to actually move the vehicle at least once in a while. Accordingly, the owner's inexplicable reluctance to take that simple step reinforces the *supported* suspicion that the vehicle is indeed inoperable, and thus in breach of the HOA rule.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An HOA board is dealing with a potential violation of a rule prohibiting inoperable vehicles in driveways. A board member insists that the homeowner must prove compliance or face punishment. Which of the following best describes the legal and ethical considerations in this situation?\n\nA) The board can demand proof of compliance as it's inherent in all contracts that parties must demonstrate adherence.\nB) The homeowner must move the vehicle within 7 days or be found in violation, as stated in the HOA bylaws.\nC) The board should gather concrete evidence of inoperability before taking action, as the burden of proof lies with the accuser.\nD) The homeowner's refusal to move the vehicle is sufficient proof of violation, justifying immediate penalties.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple legal and ethical concepts presented in the documentation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Burden of proof: The fundamental legal principle that the accuser must prove the violation is upheld here. The documentation states, \"Is not the burden of proving the violation on the accuser?\" This principle applies in contractual disputes as well as criminal law.\n\n2. Evidence requirement: The board member's assertion that homeowners must prove compliance or be punished is not supported by legal precedent or the HOA's bylaws. The documentation notes, \"Our bylaws never stated a 7 days limit, nor do they have any language requiring homeowners to testify against themselves or provide evidence to their defense.\"\n\n3. Due process: Taking action without concrete evidence could be considered reckless and potentially violate the homeowner's rights. The question states, \"I feel it is at the very least reckless to go accusing someone if we don't have any evidence of an actual violation.\"\n\n4. Reasonable suspicion vs. proof: While the car's lack of movement might raise suspicion, it doesn't conclusively prove inoperability. The documentation points out, \"Even if it's not moving, that doesn't mean it's not capable of moving (inoperABLE).\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the claim that proving compliance is inherent in all contracts is unsupported and likely false. Option B is wrong because the 7-day limit is not in the bylaws.

If they do not respond, you ask the court to make a judgment (in my case it took 10 weeks from filing claim to getting judgment). If the defendant responds and defends themselves, expect much longer wait and uncertain outcome.\n\nEnforcement\n-----------\n\nSo, you and the defendant have both received court judgment saying that they must pay you.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states that it is possible to file a claim in the UK, and provides specific details on how to do so through the HM Courts & Tribunals Service.\n\n2.

Lawyers are not automatically excluded from juries anymore, as being called for jury duty is a right and a duty that the law abhors automatically excluding people from.

(If the lawyer just tried a similar case, then they'd get to use *for cause*.)\n\nThe real reason that the lawyer from one side or the other definitely wants a lawyer off is that the jury instructions presented by each side to the judge are crafted in a way that each word carries specific meaning and, with that, is designed to lead to a certain way of thinking. Once the lawyers have fought over the instructions and the judge decides what will be presented, the jury only gets them in writing...in some states not even in writing, they only get them read to them without a copy to take back to the room.\n\nIf a lawyer is in the jury, that person will undoubtedly be able to explain exactly what the law requires for a finding, or exactly why a certain finding should be had. They will advocate one way or another; this is undeniable. The instructions are purposefully confusing. The reason is this: when we fight over jury instruction, inherently, one of us will want an instruction that is hard to understand, for a lay person. This is because we want them to apply the law as it is commonly (mis)understood, not as it truly is, because that's not good for our case. \n\nTo have a lawyer on the jury would defeat the finely crafted instruction and its potential to confuse. They would undoubtedly explain the instruction to the jury. One may think this would be helpful, however, juries are told that any special knowledge they have about anything pertaining to the case shall not be shared as it could sway the jury. This is most true when it comes to a lawyer sitting. When a jury doesn't understand a jury instruction, their *only* recourse is to send a question to the judge. In states where they have the instruction in writing, all he can say is \"read carefully;\" he cannot give his interpretation of what the instruction means. If a judge did give his own interpretation that is grounds for a mistrial or an appeal at least. A lawyer on the jury would be able to explain, \"Oh, what this really means is X,\" and this is bad from one side's perspective, almost always. We all have biases, and even finely determined rules of law can be subtly pushed toward one direction or another with the use of a certain word over another, or the placement of one element before another. \n\nGenerally, unless the side who would most want the attorney off had exhausted their preemptory strikes, and lost the argument to remove for cause, there is very little chance a lawyer will serve. The fact of the matter is that both sides are very likely to want a lawyer stricken from the jury pool, (even from the side who may believe the lawyer to have leanings in their favor). It is *essential* to control as many factors as possible in a jury trial, and an attorney on the panel is just a wild card. The potential always exists that if a lawyer ends up on the jury, they could explain the elements of the case to their fellow jurors, who may then not rely as fully upon the carefully crafted language in the instruction(s). This could backfire on either side when certain portions of the language used may be intentionally vague or difficult to parse though for someone who doesn't practice law.\n\nAnyone interested in the process of choosing and striking jurors (in the U.S.), through the process of *voir dire*, [this](http://www.rotlaw.com/legal-library/what-does-it-mean-to-strike-a-juror/) is a fairly comprehensive article on the topic.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A high-profile criminal case is set for trial, and during jury selection, it's discovered that a potential juror is a practicing attorney specializing in civil litigation. Both the prosecution and defense are aware of this information. Which of the following scenarios is most likely to occur, and why?\n\nA) The attorney will be allowed to serve on the jury without objection, as their legal expertise could aid in understanding complex instructions.\nB) Only the defense will attempt to strike the attorney from the jury, fearing bias towards the prosecution.\nC) The judge will automatically dismiss the attorney from jury duty due to their legal background.\nD) Both sides will likely attempt to remove the attorney from the jury, even if it means using a peremptory strike.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This scenario is most likely because both the prosecution and defense typically prefer to exclude attorneys from juries, regardless of their legal specialization. The explanation lies in the nuanced control over jury instructions and their interpretation:\n\n1. Jury instructions are carefully crafted by both sides, with specific wording designed to influence juror thinking in subtle ways. An attorney on the jury could easily decode and explain these nuances to other jurors.\n\n2. The instructions are often intentionally complex or vague for strategic reasons. An attorney juror could clarify these points, potentially undermining a side's strategy.\n\n3. Jurors are instructed not to share special knowledge about the case, but an attorney's legal expertise would be difficult to set aside during deliberations.\n\n4. Both sides prefer predictability in how instructions will be interpreted. An attorney juror introduces an element of unpredictability, as they might interpret instructions differently than intended.\n\n5. Even if one side believes the attorney might be sympathetic to their case, the risk of having a \"wild card\" who could sway other jurors based on legal knowledge often outweighs potential benefits.\n\n6. If a cause strike (arguing the attorney is biased) fails, attorneys will likely use a peremptory strike to remove the lawyer-juror, considering it essential to control as many factors as possible in a jury trial.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation, application to a specific scenario, and understanding of the strategic thinking behind jury selection in legal proceedings."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33127/is-sabrina-child-pornography", "docs_id": 33127, "title": "Is &quot;Sabrina&quot; child pornography?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many years ago I recall hearing (can't exactly remember where/when, but I believe it had to do with a then still very young Brooke Shields) that \"Child Pornography\" laws applied, even if the actor/actress was actually over 18, but the character was NOT.

Am I (potentially, for sure) misremembering, misunderstanding or have the laws changed? \n\nI ask this after reading an article regarding the new Netflix show [\u2018Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u2019](https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/netflix-series-chilling-adventures-of-sabrina-shocks-with-underage-orgy-scene) Which also brings up the possiblity that because it is 'streaming', the law doesn't not apply in this case (then why?). \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That definition still applies, at least in federal law. Under [18 USC 2256](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256):\n\n> \u201cchild pornography\u201d means any visual depiction ...\u00a0indistinguishable\u00a0from that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\n\nBut the First Amendment limits its applicability in cases like *Sabrina*. In [Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/535/234), the Supreme Court held that the law violates free speech and was overbroad, with a lengthy discussion of the threats it posed to legitimate artistic works:\n\n> Under the CPPA, images are prohibited so long as the persons appear to be under 18 years of age. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2256(1\\). This is higher than the legal age for marriage in many States, as well as the age at which persons may consent to sexual relations. ... It is, of course, undeniable that some youths engage in sexual activity before the legal age, either on their own inclination or because they are victims of sexual abuse.\n> \n> \n> Both themes\\-teenage sexual activity and the sexual abuse of children\\-have inspired countless literary works. William Shakespeare created the most famous pair of teenage lovers, one of whom is just 13 years of age. See Romeo and Juliet, act I, sc. 2, 1\\. 9 (\"She hath not seen the change of fourteen years\"). In the drama, Shakespeare portrays the relationship as something splendid and innocent, but not juvenile. The work has inspired no less than 40 motion pictures, some of which suggest that the teenagers consummated their relationship.\u00a0E.\u00a0g., Romeo and Juliet (B. Luhrmann director, 1996\\). Shakespeare may not have written sexually explicit scenes for the Elizabethan audience, but were modern directors to adopt a less conventional approach, that fact alone would not compel the conclusion that the work was obscene.\n> \n> \n> Contemporary movies pursue similar themes. Last year's Academy Awards featured the movie, Traffic, which was nominated for Best Picture. See Predictable and Less So, the Academy Award Contenders, N. Y. Times, Feb. 14, 2001, p. Ell. The film portrays a teenager, identified as a 16year\\-old, who becomes addicted to drugs. The viewer sees the degradation of her addiction, which in the end leads her to a filthy room to trade sex for drugs. The year before, American Beauty won the Academy Award for Best Picture. See \"American Beauty\" Tops the Oscars, N. Y. Times, Mar. 27, 2000, p. El. In the course of the movie, a teenage girl engages in sexual relations with her teenage boyfriend, and another yields herself to the gratification of a middle\\-aged man. The film also contains a scene where, although the movie audience understands the act is not taking place, one character believes he is watching a teenage boy performing a sexual act on an older man.\n> \n> \n> Our society, like other cultures, has empathy and enduring fascination with the lives and destinies of the young. Art and literature express the vital interest we all have in the formative years we ourselves once knew, when wounds can be so grievous, disappointment so profound, and mistaken choices so tragic, but when moral acts and self\\-fulfillment are still in reach.\n> \n> \n> Whether or not the films we mention violate the CPPA, they explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute's prohibitions. If these films, or hundreds of others of lesser note that explore those subjects, contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within the statutory definition, the possessor of the film would be subject to severe punishment without inquiry into the work's redeeming value.\n> \n> \n> This is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: The artistic merit of a work does not depend on the presence of a single explicit scene. See\u00a0Book\u00a0Named \"John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\" v.\u00a0Attorney General of Mass.,\u00a0383 U. S. 413, 419 (1966\\) (plurality opinion) (\"\\[T]he social value of the book can neither be weighed against nor canceled by its prurient appeal or patent offensiveness\"). Under\u00a0Miller,\u00a0the First Amendment requires that redeeming value be judged by considering the work as a whole. Where the scene is part of the narrative, the work itself does not for this reason become obscene, even though the scene in isolation might be offensive. See\u00a0Kois\u00a0v.\u00a0Wisconsin,\u00a0408 U. S. 229, 231 (1972\\)\u00a0(per curiam}.\u00a0\n> \n> \n> For this reason, and the others we have noted, the CPP A cannot be read to prohibit obscenity, because it lacks the required link between its prohibitions and the affront to community standards prohibited by the definition of obscenity.\n\nIf the law were applicable to *Sabrina*, the fact that it's streamed wouldn't save it. [18 USC 2252A](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252A) prohibits knowingly receiving, distributing, reproducing, advertising, promoting or presenting child pornography, \"by any means, including by\u00a0computer.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A controversial new TV series features a scene depicting teenage characters in a sexually explicit situation. The actors are all over 18, but they are portraying characters under 18. The show's producers are concerned about potential legal issues. Which of the following best describes the legal status of this content under current U.S. federal law and relevant Supreme Court rulings?\n\nA) It is legally classified as child pornography and is not protected by the First Amendment\nB) It is exempt from child pornography laws because the actors are over 18\nC) It may fall under the definition of child pornography, but is likely protected as artistic expression\nD) It is only considered legal if distributed through streaming services rather than traditional broadcast\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the complex interplay between federal child pornography laws and First Amendment protections. The correct answer is C, based on the following key points from the documentation:\n\n1. Federal law (18 USC 2256) defines child pornography to include visual depictions \"indistinguishable from that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,\" even if the actors are over 18.\n\n2. However, the Supreme Court ruling in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002) significantly limited the application of this law to artistic works, citing First Amendment concerns.\n\n3. The Court emphasized that artistic merit must be judged by considering the work as a whole, not isolated scenes, and that exploring themes of teenage sexuality in literature and film has legitimate artistic value.\n\n4. The ruling specifically mentioned examples of acclaimed films depicting teenage sexual activity, suggesting that such content, when part of a larger narrative, is protected speech.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while the content might technically fall under the legal definition, the Supreme Court ruling provides strong First Amendment protection for artistic works. Option B is incorrect because the age of the actors doesn't exempt the content if it depicts minors. Option D is incorrect because the method of distribution (streaming vs. broadcast) doesn't affect the legal status under federal law.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and understand the nuances of how different laws and court rulings interact in practice."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51359/how-to-convince-google-to-fix-a-problem-that-caused-few-thousand-damage", "docs_id": 51359, "title": "How to convince Google to fix a problem that caused few thousand $ damage?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Edited for less mystery.

Which of the following factors would be most critical in determining the potential legal ramifications for the university?\n\nA) Whether the professor obtained explicit permission from Asimov's estate to use the story\nB) The number of students enrolled in the course compared to the number of public downloads\nC) Whether the university's website includes a disclaimer about copyright infringement\nD) The length of time the story has been publicly accessible on the university's server\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The most critical factor in determining the legal ramifications is whether the professor obtained explicit permission from Asimov's estate to use the story. This directly addresses the core issue of copyright infringement and aligns with the statement from Asimov's estate that their fiction is only legally available for free download with their permission.\n\nOption A is correct because it's the only scenario that could completely negate any claim of copyright infringement. If permission was obtained, the use would be legal regardless of other factors.\n\nOption B, while potentially relevant in assessing damages, doesn't affect the fundamental question of whether copyright infringement occurred. Even if only students accessed the material, it could still be infringement without permission or a valid fair use claim.\n\nOption C, a disclaimer, doesn't protect against copyright infringement. The mere presence of a disclaimer doesn't make unauthorized use legal.\n\nOption D, the length of time the story was accessible, might affect damages in a lawsuit but doesn't determine whether infringement occurred. Copyright infringement happens at the moment of unauthorized distribution, regardless of duration.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple concepts (copyright law, fair use, educational exceptions) and application to a real-world scenario.

The correct answer is B, based on Wisconsin Statute 632.32(6)(b), which states that no policy may exclude coverage for \"any use of the motor vehicle... while the driver is under the influence of an intoxicant.\" This law does not specify a BAC threshold, meaning that even a BAC below the legal limit cannot be used as grounds for denying a claim.

On the day of the viewing, but before my appointment, the estate agent informed me that two offers had already been made that same day, and both had been accepted. Although he couldn't reveal the amount of these offers for legal reasons, it was \"not worth me making an offer below the asking price\". So, I make an offer for \u00a3407k, and this was accepted. After thinking this through, I am now wondering how likely it is that these two other offers were genuine, and how likely it is these two offers never actually existed, but were made up to encourage me to make an offer over the asking price.\n\nAs another anecdote, after a previous viewing at a different property, the estate agent informed me that an offer for the asking price had just been accepted, and asked whether I would like to make an offer to myself.

Yes, I know that often the finances don't work out and the buyer has to back out, but it certainly seems possible that in that case too, this other offer was fake.\n\nSo, my questions are (and relating specifically to the UK, but other comments welcomed):\n\n1. When estate agents state that other offers have recently already been made and accepted, is it common for these to be fake? If anybody has any real insider knowledge about this (e.g. if you are / have been an estate agent yourself), comments would be welcomed on how often estate agents make up other offers when trying to get a buyer to increase their offer.\n2. Is it actually defined in law that it is illegal for estate agents to suggest that other offers have been made, when this is completely untrue?\n3. If I was suspicious about the estate agent faking an offer, how could I go about finding out the truth? If I were to ask the estate agent, he would certainly say to me that it was not within his capacity to reveal the details of his other clients who made these offers. So it seems difficult to ever know, even if you were very suspicious.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Yes, I believe it is common in *some* cases for people to lie about alternative offers in order to drive up asking price or encourage a quicker offer. But there are also brokers who would never consider it. People are night and day. How common it is depends on the culture of real estate transactions in a particular region and the particular person you are dealing with.\n2. Legality depends on your jurisdiction, and there is a distinction between illegality and what can be done about it. Technically it may be fraud or in violation of ethics regulations. Consult an attorney in your jurisdiction who does not regularly work with this broker.\n3. You can't necessarily know. You have to assume a selling agent is lying about everything and protect yourself by ignoring most of what he says and having a good attorney. I would especially do that when the agent tells you he has already accepted two offers on the same house, because that means he has already broken a deal today and is planning to break the second if you give him more money.\n\nThe best approach is probably, practically, to mostly ignore the claim about the competing offer and take it as a price change. If you'll pay more and be happy, fine. If you aren't willing to pay more, walk away. If they're faking the offer, they'll almost definitely come back to you and then you can even potentially negotiate a price cut. \n\nHowever, check with a local real estate attorney first about whether this increases the risk of litigation over the property that you won't want to get involved in.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A potential homebuyer in the UK is informed by an estate agent that two offers have been accepted on a property they're interested in, priced at \u00a3400,000.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, Alice (TechInno in this case) can punish Bob for breaching the contract (NDA). This aligns with the statement that Alice can \"only punish Bob for breaching contract.\"\n\n2. The NDA clause attempting to declare disclosed information as \"invalid, incorrect, and not factual\" does not protect TechInno from third-party lawsuits.

Even if the student is not making a significant income, the IRS may still classify it as a business based on these factors.

He removed his\n> case as under the law he had the right to do into the circuit court\n> for that county, and was there tried by a jury which found him guilty\n> and assessed his punishment at imprisonment for two years in the\n> penitentiary.

Despite Judge Sheffey's past involvement with the Confederacy, which could have disqualified him under a strict reading of Section 3, the court did not automatically invalidate his judicial acts. \n\nThe case shows that the courts prioritized procedural due process and stability over an immediate, sweeping application of Section 3. This is evident from the court's reasoning that \"to collaterally invalidate otherwise valid court judgements would lead to chaos.\" The court required a formal process to remove officials potentially subject to Section 3, rather than allowing their past actions to automatically disqualify them.\n\nThis interpretation balances the constitutional provision with practical considerations of governance and legal stability in the post-Civil War era. It also reflects a nuanced approach to Reconstruction, avoiding potentially disruptive blanket disqualifications while still acknowledging the amendment's intent.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect as they contradict the court's actual interpretation.

The documentation states, \"The offense in Mississippi is distributing obscene fiction, not writing it.\"\n\n2. The legal standard for obscenity is based on the Miller v.

The GDPR requires that you have *a* legal basis for processing per Art 6\\. Here, there might be a *legitimate interest* for processing, in particular the legitimate interest of the party planner. Before relying on legitimate interest as a legal basis, you must do a balancing test to ensure that the legitimate interest outweighs the affected rights and freedoms of the data subject. You should also implement safeguards to limit abuse.\n\nHowever, a key GDPR principle (Art 5\\) is transparency. Putting up a privacy policy on your website is not good enough, and Art 14 lists various information that you must provide to the data subject if you didn't obtain their personal data from the data subject themselves. You must provide this information within a reasonable period, but at the latest:\n\n* within one month\n* at the time of the first communication with the data subject\n* when the information is disclosed to a third party\n\nHere, it seems likely that your system would send out invites to all involved persons.

A data processor is bound by some contract per Art 28, which is common/necessary in a B2B context. You could structure your signup flow so that such a contract is formed with the party planner, and the party planner would then be the sole data controller who would be responsible for selecting a suitable legal basis and providing information to data subjects.\n\nBut don't do that. Such terms would likely run into consumer protection issues and might be unenforceable. Being a processor is also not a get\\-out\\-of\\-jail\\-free card, because you still have substantial compliance obligations towards the controller.\n\nMore reasonably, you and the party planner are *joint controllers* per Art 26\\.

The correct answer is D for several reasons:\n\n1. Precision requirement: Canadian courts require non-compete clauses to be precisely defined in terms of geographic scope.

The appellant is concerned about facing the same judge in the rehearing. Which of the following strategies is most likely to result in a different judge presiding over the case, while also considering the legal realities and challenges involved?\n\nA) File a motion to recuse, citing the appellate court's decision as evidence of the judge's bias\nB) Directly request the chief judge to assign a new judge based on the successful appeal\nC) File a motion to recuse, followed by a request for rehearing with the chief judge if denied\nD) Petition the appellate court to mandate a new judge as part of their reversal decision\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the legal process and application of the information provided in the documentation. The correct answer, C, is the most strategic approach given the realities of the legal system described.\n\nFiling a motion to recuse is the proper first step, as mentioned in the documentation. However, the explanation notes that \"these motions are hardly ever granted\" due to the high bar for proving bias or prejudice. The documentation also states that \"Without knowing the details of the reversal on appeal, though, it is impossible to identify whether the appellate opinion or the record of the case endorses/supports a finding of bias or other grounds for disqualification.\"\n\nGiven this difficulty, the strategy of following up with a request for rehearing with the chief judge if the initial motion is denied provides an additional opportunity for the appellant to argue their case for a new judge. This two-step approach acknowledges the reality that the initial motion is likely to be denied while still pursuing all available options within the legal system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply citing the appellate court's decision may not be sufficient to prove bias. Option B bypasses the proper legal procedure. Option D is incorrect because the appellate court typically wouldn't mandate a new judge as part of their reversal decision unless there were explicit findings of bias or misconduct.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario, and think critically about the most effective legal strategy given the challenges described."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/40666/gdpr-and-date-of-fields-creation-update", "docs_id": 40666, "title": "GDPR and date of fields creation / update", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Not sure if that's right site to ask about technical Database things but if I've a table that contains the following fields :\n\n```\nclient_id\nname\nfirst_name\n\n```\n\nand that I want to be GPDR Complient does I need to add the following fields ?\n\n```\nclient_id\nname\nname_date_created\nname_date_updated\nfirst_name\nfirst_name_date_created\nfirst_name_date_updated\n\n```\n\nOr I can just have ?\n\n```\nclient_id\nname\nfirst_name\ndate_created\ndate_updated\n\n```\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR does not directly require that changes to the data be tracked.

The correct answer, B, best aligns with GDPR requirements while being practical to implement. \n\nThe GDPR does not explicitly require tracking every change to individual data fields.

The correct answer is B because it allows the company to use JMH for testing without triggering GPL2 obligations for their main application.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it unnecessarily requires the entire application to be GPL2 licensed, which is likely undesirable for a commercial product. \n\nOption C is problematic because distributing JMH with the application, even in an \"optional\" folder, could still be considered distribution under GPL2 terms, potentially forcing the entire application to be GPL2 licensed.\n\nOption D is incorrect and potentially illegal, as modifying JMH to remove GPL2 restrictions would violate the license terms.\n\nThe key insight is that GPL2 obligations are typically triggered by distribution.

The law in California as it deals with prescriptions ([Controlled Substances Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&division=10.&title=&part=&chapter=4.&article=1.&goUp=Y), or [general pharmacy regulation](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&division=2.&title=&part=&chapter=9.&article=2.)) does not imply a requirement for a \"prescription\". If we switch to \"doctors orders\", then perhaps there is a requirement. This comes up in [this letter](https://www.lsbme.la.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Advisory%20Opinions/Self-Referred%20MRI%20Testing.pdf) ([mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/20170126044242/https://www.lsbme.la.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Advisory%20Opinions/Self-Referred%20MRI%20Testing.pdf)) from the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, who take the position that self\\-referral for MRI is the practice of medicine, which is illegal without a medical license. A radiologists who performs the procedure would exceed the scope of their license. However, there is no specific statute that says \"You must have a doctors orders to perform an MRI\", instead that follows from more general laws. They do point out that MRIs often entail injections which cannot be administered except under a doctor's orders. MRI technology is regulated under Louisiana law (start [here](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2014/code-revisedstatutes/title-37/rs-37-3200/)).\n\nX\\-ray technicians are similarly regulated in [California](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&division=104.&title=&part=1.&chapter=4.&article=5.), but that article does not apply to MRI. You must be licensed to perform an x\\-ray, acting within the scope of that license, and under the supervision of an appropriate licentiate of the healing arts. Bills have been [introduced to widen state control](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1092), to include MRI technology, but this has not yet happened. When a contrast agent is involved, you have to have a doctor's orders.\n\nIn short, it depends primarily on the extent to which MRI is regulated, but also whether an injection is required.

The legal requirement is that you have actual permission, not that a prohibition was not communicated to you.\nIt is in your interest to know whether the actual person making available a work under some license actually has the right to grant a license. But there is no way to know for certain who holds copyright. You can, however, attempt to determine that a work has been registered with the US copyright office, looking [here](https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First).

His home computer might contain records of contact between him and the terrorists: so the judge might grant a warrant. The FBI might also go to a federal court for a warrant for a different suspected crime, for example a planned bombing of Needles.

The sports team's prior use of the name \"Cosmic Crushers\" in their local context likely gives them some rights, even if they haven't formally registered the trademark. However, trademark protection is generally limited to the geographic area and industry in which it's used.

It recognizes the complexity of the situation and doesn't jump to extreme conclusions (unlike options A and C).\n2. It acknowledges that the sports team likely has some rights due to their prior use, contrary to option B which incorrectly assumes larger companies automatically have superior rights.\n3.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Private businesses generally have the right to refuse service, as long as they're not discriminating against protected classes. Vaccination status is not a protected class in most jurisdictions.\n\n2. The policy is facially neutral and applies to all customers regardless of their religious beliefs. As stated in the documentation, \"businesses can establish facially neutral rules even if they have a disparate religious impact.\"\n\n3. The First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause (option A) primarily restricts government action, not private businesses.

Option B is incorrect because private businesses typically don't have an affirmative duty to provide accommodations for religious beliefs, unlike government entities or employers.\n\n5.

The correct answer, B, is the most prudent course of action because:\n\n1. It aligns with the official Guide AN, which states that applicants should not have been absent for more than 90 days in the last 12 months preceding the application.\n2.

This addresses the first question in the documentation about what the language protects the company against.\n\nThe clause doesn't nullify the agreement under financial duress (A), as economic pressure to sign doesn't typically constitute legal duress.

They plan to continue working remotely for their US-based company while residing in Spain. Given the recent developments in Spanish immigration policy and court rulings, what is the most appropriate advice for this applicant?\n\nA) Apply for the NLV as planned, citing the 2012 court ruling to support their case for remote work\nB) Abandon the NLV application and apply for the new digital nomad visa instead\nC) Apply for both the NLV and the digital nomad visa simultaneously to increase chances of approval\nD) Seek employment with a Spanish company and apply for a work visa instead of the NLV\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analyzing multiple aspects of the evolving Spanish visa situation for remote workers. The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The 2012 court ruling (RoJ: STS 1859/2012) mentioned in the documentation, while favorable to remote work, may not be directly applicable to current NLV applications. The case was specific to a visa denial based on suspicion of false income claims, not explicitly about remote work.\n\n2. The documentation mentions \"many more complaints about NLVs being denied due to the applicants intending to work remotely\" since the original question was asked. This suggests that consulates are continuing to interpret the NLV as incompatible with any form of work, including remote work.\n\n3. Most importantly, the update states that the Spanish government has created a \"new law creating a visa type specifically for remote working.\" This digital nomad visa is designed precisely for situations like the one described in the question.\n\nOption A is incorrect because relying on the 2012 court ruling is risky given the recent trend of NLV denials for remote workers. Option C is not advisable as applying for multiple visas simultaneously could complicate the process and potentially raise suspicions. Option D unnecessarily changes the applicant's work situation when a more suitable visa option exists.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple pieces of information, understand the evolution of legal interpretations, and apply critical thinking to a real-world scenario in the context of immigration law."}, "78": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55572/the-list-of-protected-characteristics", "docs_id": 55572, "title": "The list of &quot;protected characteristics&quot;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I found the following statement about work\\-place harassment from another stackexchange:\n\n> If this is the US, in order to qualify as harassment legally, the behavior in question also has to be based on a protected characteristic (i.e. sex, race, age, etc).

References to *protected categories* are not a requisite element of *harassment*.\n\nTypically *harassment* is defined as a pattern of conduct (thus encompassing two or more acts) consisting of unconsented contact that would cause a reasonable person to be frightened, annoyed, distressed, molested, and/or experience other unpleasant emotions. See, for instance, the definition of harassment in Michigan legislation, [MCL 750\\.411h(1\\)(c)](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(c52sqae3mdxfxetiqb4gkkmv))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-750-411h).\n\nThe notion of harassment can \\-\\-but does not necessarily\\-\\- involve targeting or attacking of one or multiple *protected categories* in which the victim belongs. For instance, sexual harassment is understood as harassment with purposes of mocking the victim's sexual orientation, or procuring sexual gratification from/with that person. The adjective \"*sexual*\" merely qualifies the context of the troubling pattern of conduct, but that term in and of itself is not what imports the character of harassment.\n\nThe examples in the paragraph you quote are inaccurate and/or inconclusive because they would highly depend on the context. The adjective \"*selfish*\" is not sufficiently related to Judaism, whence it would be unreasonable for a Jew to allege *religious harassment* merely because somebody called him \"selfish\". Instead, a finding of religious harassment would involve repulsive allusions to themes or elements to which Jews would be sensitive based on historical grounds (such as nazism, and antisemitism), doctrinary grounds (jokes about pigs), and so forth.\n\n> Where I can find a complete list that includes all the possible words?\n\nFor the reasons explained above, there is no such list. Words would have to be assessed in light of the context in which the course of conduct takes place.\n\nFurthermore, not all harassment involves words.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Harassment, as defined in the documentation, typically requires a pattern of conduct consisting of two or more acts. This situation describes a single policy implementation, which doesn't meet the definition of harassment.\n\n2. However, the situation may constitute religious discrimination. The policy, while applied to all employees equally, has a disparate impact on Sarah due to her religious practices. This aligns with the concept of protected categories mentioned in the documentation, where religion is a protected characteristic.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because it misuses the term \"harassment.\" As explained, this situation doesn't meet the legal definition of harassment, which requires a pattern of conduct.\n\n4. Option B is incorrect because it fails to recognize the potential for religious discrimination, even when a policy appears neutral on its face.\n\n5.

The key points are:\n\n1. The regulation states \"A written or, at the option of the parents, electronic verbatim record of the proceedings... shall be maintained and made available to the parties.\"\n\n2. \"Verbatim\" means an exact account of what was said, not necessarily an audio recording.\n\n3. \"Electronic\" in this context refers to a digital format of the text, such as a Word or PDF document, not an audio recording.\n\n4. The presence of a court reporter and the provision of transcripts (despite errors) indicates compliance with the \"written record\" requirement.\n\n5. The school's claim that audio recordings are not permitted is consistent with the interpretation of \"electronic verbatim record\" as a digital text format.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation (C) is that the parent is entitled to either a written transcript or an electronic text version of the transcript, but not necessarily an audio recording.

What they take is an easement, but it seems just barely short of fee simple: the land reverts to the permanent owner or successor only if the railroad stops running trains along the track and thereby abandons the easement, but until then it seems to be entirely theirs. Railroads seem to continue operating on a particular track for well over a century sometimes.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* In which states in the U.S. do railroads have this power?\n* Might that be the reason why many railroad rights\\-of\\-way are held in easement rather than in fee simple?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL; DNR: \n\n1\\) It is not clear which states gave railroads the power to seize property. It is clear that eminent domain has been used to take land for railroads in every state. However, not every railroad had the power to take land; some governments took the property and then gave it to the railroad. \n\n2\\) No, railroads didn\u2019t have to use easements because they got to use eminent domain. Railroads had to use easements for the same reason they got to use eminent domain \u2013 they were using their property to serve the \u201cpublic interest\u201d. As a result, they got various subsidies and special deals. In return, they were subject to heightened government control. That control included not always having fee simple ownership of their land. \n\nHere are some details: \n\n1\\) Like many private businesses \u2013 from grain mills to canals to shopping malls and hotels \u2013 railroads got some of their land via eminent domain. Who could take the land, and under what conditions and restrictions, varied from state to state (and over time). \n\nUnfortunately, as far as I know, there is no list online telling which states gave which powers to railroads. There may be such a list in one of the treatises on eminent domain, such as Nichols' \"The Law of Eminent Domain,\" or on railroad law. (By their nature, treatises are exhaustive.) \n\nHowever, there is enough information online that you could make a fairly complete list in a few hours; my search for railroad\\+eminent\\+domain\\+(state name) got plenty of hits for every state I tried, including Hawai'i. \n\nRecent changes to state laws show how much state laws vary. In response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kelo v. City of New London, many states made it harder to use eminent domain for development projects. Some of states (South Dakota) explicitly target railroads, while others (Vermont) explicitly exempt railroads. \n\n2\\) It\u2019s an oversimplification to say railroads either: a) own their land outright (ie, fee simple); or, b) have an easement. Railroads use other forms of property, including fee\\-simple with conditions and licenses. What these forms of property share is reduced railroad control over its property. As mentioned above, the reason is simple. To encourage railroads to serve the public, they got subsidies. In return, their rights over their property was attenuated. Thus, railroads couldn't set rates at will. One of the valuable rights they gave up was the right to sell the property once they were no longer using it for railroading.\n\n3\\) The issues of eminent domain and ownership of railroad rights of way are not merely of academic interest. For example, many people today are interested in what to do with abandoned rail rights of way. Who gets the land, under what conditions, and at what price? Can the land be sold outright, \u201crailbanked,\u201d (using it in ways that allow an easy conversion back to rail in the future), turned into trails, utility rights of way, and so on. Not surprisingly, advocates for each of these uses argues that their use is most consistent with existing rights. \n\nThe growing interest in high speed rail raises again the issue of how to get the land for rail projects. \n\nIf you want to know more, there is a nice short summary of the history of railroad rights to rights of way in this [article](https://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/39-3-07_Wright.pdf) from the Vermont Law Review.

Option C is the most likely to create legal complexity because:\n\n1. The documentation mentions that railroad rights-of-way often involve complex property rights that are \"just barely short of fee simple.\" This creates ambiguity about who truly owns the land and what rights they have.\n\n2. The text states that land only reverts to the original owner or successor if the railroad abandons the easement. However, the definition of \"abandonment\" may be legally contentious, especially if the land hasn't been used for rail purposes in many years.\n\n3. The documentation explicitly mentions that \"many people today are interested in what to do with abandoned rail rights of way,\" indicating this is a current issue of debate.\n\n4. The question of who gets the land, under what conditions, and at what price when dealing with abandoned rail rights-of-way is highlighted as a complex issue in the text.\n\n5.

Does anyone know the term for this person?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the United States, we use the phrase \"[Reasonable Person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person)\" which is not to say an average person or a simple man, but an individual who understands the limitations of the situation and would act in accordance with that knowledge. For example, if a doctor improperly rendered help a patient, his actions would be evaluated based on reasonable knowledge of people with his medical knowledge, where as a person practicing medicine without a license would be subjected to a more common\\-man standard.\n\nThe phrase person is therefor substituted for a reasonable individual and thus, a \"Reasonable Landlord/Renter\" could exist in housing cases, or a \"Reasonable Doctor\" in medical torts or \"a Reasonable Woman\" in sexual assault cases, so the \"Reasonable Person\" is often used to allow the jury to put themselves in the shoes of the witnesses and the accused and see how they would react (Historically, the term was called a \"Reasonable Man\" though \"Reasonable Person\" was used to make the term more neutral to what the definition of \"Man\" was (A human male or a member of the Human Species, regardless of gender).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Maria Theresa and the law, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: In the context of law-making during Maria Theresa's reign in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, what concept most closely aligns with the modern legal principle of the \"reasonable person\" standard?\n\nA) The requirement for a common citizen to explain a law in their own words before it could be enacted\nB) The use of Hungarian terminology to describe legal concepts\nC) The practice of providing anecdotes to make legal topics more digestible\nD) The limitation of education for the general population to ensure simple laws\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The question requires analysis and application of historical legal concepts to modern principles. The correct answer is A because the practice of having a common person explain a law in their own words before it could be enacted most closely aligns with the modern \"reasonable person\" standard. Both concepts aim to ensure that laws and legal standards are comprehensible and applicable to the average person.\n\nThis practice in Maria Theresa's time served a similar purpose to the modern \"reasonable person\" standard by:\n1. Ensuring laws were understandable to the general population\n2. Using a common person's perspective to evaluate the clarity and applicability of laws\n3. Serving as a check against overly complex or obscure legal language\n\nOptions B and C are distractors related to the anecdote but don't align with the \"reasonable person\" concept.

Since I have no direct connection to anyone in the legal field, I thought I would ask some knowledgeable users about something that's always had me wondering. (Just saw the film again tonight.)\n\nI am aware that an acquittal means one can not be tried for the same crime again (double jeopardy). But a dismissal *may not* provide such protection. Acquittal meaning the prosecution could **not prove** the defendant committed the crime, whereas dismissal *may* allow for retrial.\n\nSo, is there a *legal* basis for Trotter dismissing a case merely because he'll clearly lose? Common sense leans towards thinking this may be \"Hollywood fluff\" and it could not *actually* happen at the final stages of a trial so close to jury deliberation. But.. again, I don't *really* know.\n\nI *think* this is fluff because if it were *actually* possible, why wouldn't *all* prosecutors merely drop charges if they fear they are going to lose, then go build a better case and retry the defendant.\n\nAre the requirement for an actual dismissal more stringent than the film would have the audience believe or in this aspect, is the film pretty close to reality?\n\n(I am referencing U.S. criminal law in general)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is entirely possible in a number of different motions that could have been made. At this point, Vinny had destroyed the Prosecutor's eyewitnesses by showing they had issues that called their testimony into question (The first has a timeline that doesn't line up with events, the second has poor vision and her prescription glasses were not doing their job, and the third had many obstructions blocking his view of the scene). His first witness tears apart the \"expert\" witness, who was only there to testify that the tires were the same brand (albeit, a popular brand at the time... loads of cars had the same tires).\n\nWhile it might go by a different name in different jurisdictions, the Prosecutor is allowed to make a motion to dismiss at any point prior to the jury goes to deliberation (as is the Defense; Also they might be able to make motions while the jury is in deliberations).\n\nIf properly titled, the Prosecutor should have made a \"motion for *nolle prosequi*\" (not prosecuting). This can mean any number of things including the prosecutor no longer believes the evidence can prove the charges OR even that the prosecutor is no longer convinced that those charged committed the crime.\n\nIn the \"My Cousin Vinny\" case, as the jury was seated the case cannot be retried by the State of Alabama at this point.\n\nThis is possible because the Prosecutor's duty is to uncover the truth behind a crime, no matter what that truth becomes. In this case, despite his previous beliefs, the prosecutor in My Cousin Vinny, upon realizing he was wrong, admitted it and dropped the charges. Given his backstory of having worked as a defense attorney and making the switch after getting a client off some serious charges (and knowing the client was guilty) shows that he was inherently an honest man and dedicated to finding the truth of the matter (as a government employee, he undoubtedly took a pay cut when he switched to prosecution. Private industry almost always pays way more than a government equivalent). With that in mind, it is expected of prosecutors to be perfectly honest with what evidence they have and make the choices in the case based on that evidence. This comes up in another scene when Mona Lisa Vito explains to Vinny that the prosecutor was required to give Vinny all the files he had on the case... because Vinny, by representing the Defendant, is allowed to examine all evidence against his clients. The only dirty trick he pulled was the stunt where his expert witness was not disclosed and while bad, really it's the judge allowing the witness to testify that would have caused a problem with the trial (his response to Vinny's objection could have created a mistrial on appeal).\n\nTo give a real world example, I was charged with driving on a suspended license which I had no idea I was doing at the time. As it turned out, the license was suspended for an unpaid traffic ticket that I had paid in the last minute... essentially the DMV forgot to unsuspend. A quick call fixed that issue but I still had to go to court over the charge. The day of the trial, I show up in the court room and the prosecutor walks over and tells me that they were going to enter a motion of \"*nolle prosequi*\" for the charge... essentially dropping it... because the matter was a clerical error on the state's part and not anything I did wrong.\n\nEdit: Additionally had the prosecutor not motioned to dismiss, Vinny certainly could have. In fact there are two points during the trial where Defense attorneys are expected to make these motions. The first is when the Prosecution rests their case. The second is before the jury is given the case to deliberate.\n\nAs for why it was called a motion to dismiss in the film, it's likely to due with the fact that the audience would not know what a \"motion for *nolle prosecui*\" and it is a type of motion to dismiss.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about legal proceedings in \"My Cousin Vinny\" and real-world legal practices, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A prosecutor in a high-profile murder case realizes during the trial that their key eyewitness testimony has been discredited. The defense has not yet presented their case. Which of the following actions would be most ethically and legally appropriate for the prosecutor?\n\nA) Continue with the trial, hoping the jury will still find the defendant guilty based on circumstantial evidence\nB) Secretly offer a plea deal to the defendant to avoid losing the case outright\nC) File a motion for nolle prosequi, explaining to the court that the evidence no longer supports the charges\nD) Request a mistrial, citing newly discovered evidence that undermines the prosecution's case\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most ethically and legally appropriate action for the prosecutor in this scenario is to file a motion for nolle prosequi (option C). This aligns with the prosecutor's duty to seek justice and uncover the truth, not simply to win cases. As explained in the documentation, prosecutors are expected to be honest about the evidence they have and make choices based on that evidence, even if it means admitting they were wrong.\n\nOption A is unethical, as it involves pursuing a case the prosecutor no longer believes can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Option B is problematic because it attempts to salvage a weak case through negotiation rather than acknowledging the lack of evidence. Option D, requesting a mistrial, is unnecessary and potentially wasteful of court resources when the prosecutor can simply move to dismiss the charges.\n\nThe example from \"My Cousin Vinny\" demonstrates that a prosecutor can and should move to dismiss charges when it becomes clear the evidence doesn't support conviction, even at a late stage in the trial. This action protects the defendant from wrongful conviction and maintains the integrity of the justice system. It also reflects the real-world example given in the documentation, where charges were dropped due to a clerical error rather than pursuing an unjust conviction.\n\nThis question requires integration of legal concepts, ethical considerations, and real-world applications, testing critical thinking about the role and responsibilities of prosecutors in the justice system."}, "85": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7174/if-a-cybercrime-were-committed-while-the-attacker-is-on-an-aircraft-who-has-the", "docs_id": 7174, "title": "If a cybercrime were committed while the attacker is on an aircraft, who has the jurisdiction?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Say, the plane is flying from country A to B.

Is it legally binding, or just very persuasive advice? Are there any examples of a judge ignoring precedent without setting new precedent, or is that paradoxical?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Precedent in common law is based on a hierarchy of courts. [This](https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/court-structure/) is the hierarchy in the UK: as they say, it's complicated because it represents 1,000\\+ years of organic growth rather than a system that was planned.\n\nPrecedent is binding on courts lower in the hierarchy than the one who set the precedent. If a judge ignores a precedent (that was argued by one side or the other1) then the decision is **wrong** and would be overturned on appeal.\n\nPrecedent at the same level and in parallel jurisdictions is *persuasive*, if a judge ignores it they better have good reason for doing so (and put those reasons in the judgement) or they will probably have their decision overturned on appeal. A parallel jurisdiction is a common law jurisdiction in another country like Australia, Canada or (rarely) the USA. It is quite common for parliament when drafting new laws to look at similar laws in other jurisdictions as a starting point. When cases are brought under such new legislation it is right that precedent set on similar law in other jurisdictions serves as the starting point for case law in the U.K.\n\nPrecedent turns on the law and the facts involved. If parliament changes the law then many precedents may be invalidated. Similarly, the facts of cases are never exactly the same, argument in court is often not about the facts \\- these may be agreed \\- but about why these facts are the same/different so that this precedent should/should not apply.\n\nIncidentally, precedent is one of the main differences between common law (English) and civil law (European) legal systems: common law has it, civil law doesn't.\n\n1. A judge must decide the case that is argued before them, deciding on a basis that the parties didn't argue is a breach of natural justice: if both sides fail to raise an applicable precedent then it is not something the judge should consider.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The precedent is from a higher court in a different jurisdiction, making it persuasive but not binding. The documentation states that precedent from parallel jurisdictions is persuasive, and \"if a judge ignores it they better have good reason for doing so (and put those reasons in the judgement).\"\n\n2. The judge cannot simply ignore the precedent (option A) as this would likely lead to the decision being overturned on appeal. The documentation emphasizes that ignoring relevant precedent without good reason is problematic.\n\n3. Strictly applying the precedent (option B) despite significant differences in facts would be inappropriate. The documentation notes that \"the facts of cases are never exactly the same, argument in court is often not about the facts - these may be agreed - but about why these facts are the same/different so that this precedent should/should not apply.\"\n\n4. Referring the case to a higher court (option D) is unnecessary at this stage.

Yes. Unintended? Not so much.\n------------------------------------------\n\n[Source](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UTSLawRw/1999/20.html)\n\n**Sources of Parliamentary Privilege**\n\nIn [new\\-south\\-wales](/questions/tagged/new-south-wales \"show questions tagged 'new-south-wales'\"), Parliamentary Privilege derives from Article 9 of the *Bill of Rights 1688* (no, 1688 is *not* a mistake) which provides:\n\n> ... the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.\n\n**What are \"proceedings in Parliament\"?**\n\n\"\\[P]roceedings in Parliament\" is defined by case law.\n\nIn Canadian and English jurisprudence, the definition includes things done outside Parliament in the furtherance of Parliamentary business such as correspondence, and press releases. The leading cases are *Roman Corp Ltd v Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Co Ltd* and *Re Clark and Attorney\\-General of Canada* for Canada, and *Rost v Edwards* for England and Wales.\n\nAustralian case law is split. The leading case is *Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Chatterton* in the Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court where Zelling AJC held that privilege applies to restatements by an MP outside Parliament of things said inside, possibly including answering questions about those things in an interview. Prior J rejected this and Jacob J didn't address it. That's one win, one loss and one DNF for those keeping score.\n\nFor the Federal Parliament, the *Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987* defines \"proceedings in Parliament\" as:\n\n> ... all words and spoken acts done in the course of, or for purposes of or incidental to, the transacting of the business of a House or of a committee, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes:\n> \n> \n> (a) the giving of evidence before a House or a committee, and evidence so given;\n> \n> \n> (b) the presentation or submission of a document to a House or a committee;\n> \n> \n> (c) the preparation of a document for purposes of or incidental to the transacting of any such business; and\n> \n> \n> (d) the formulation, making or publication of a document, including a report, by or pursuant to an order of a House or a committee and the document so formulated, made or published\n\nThe [northern\\-territory](/questions/tagged/northern-territory \"show questions tagged 'northern-territory'\") has similar legislation.\n\nIn *Laurance v Katter*, there was a judicial split in the Court of Appeal in the Queensland Supreme Court about whether this definition was unconstitutional.\n\n> Pincus JA held that s 16(3\\) was incompatible with the implied freedom of political communication. Following the High Court's decision in *R v Richards; Ex part Fitzpatrick and Browne*, Fitzpatrick P held that s 16 could not be invalidated or read down to accommodate the implied freedom of political communication. Davies JA read down s 16(3\\); in his view, the section was enacted merely to make it clear that parliamentary privilege applies not only where a member or witness is sued but also where evidence is sought to be tendered; in both cases, the privilege applies only where the parliamentary proceedings would be impeached or questioned. Davies JA then held that this was not the case in these proceedings.\n\nThe High Court gave special leave to appeal this decision but the matter was settled before the appeal was heard.\n\nSo, the exact boundaries of Parliamentary privilege in Australia remain uncertain. However, a prudent journalist should assume that it extends not just to statements made in the House or before a Committee but to statements about those statements made outside by the MP or their staff.\n\n**Who has the privilege?**\n\nThe privilege belongs to Parliament, not any individual MP, and can only be waived by Parliament. It cannot be invalidated by the courts due to the doctrine of separation of powers. Australian parliaments take the attitude that the waiver of privilege is a procedural matter about their own internal workings and does not require legislation.\n\nIn England and Wales, legislation has been passed that allows an MP to waive privilege over their (and only their) statements but no such law exists in Australia.\n\n**Effect of Parliamentary Privilege**\n\nThere are two limbs to Parliamentary Privilege:\n\n1. It provides **absolute immunity** to the MP (and possibly their staff) for statements made under privilege. That is, following *Barilaro v Shanks\\-Markovina (No 2\\) \\[2021] FCA 950*, anything and everything that is under privilege is completely inadmissible in court.\n2. By legislation in each Australian jurisdiction, **qualified immunity** is provided for the \"fair and accurate reports of parliamentary proceedings. Thus, a media organization is protected from liability for defamation in respect of the publication of a fair and accurate report of parliamentary proceedings unless the plaintiff can establish that, in publishing the report, the media organization was actuated by malice.\"\n\nThe Federal and Northern Territory legislation appears to go further and may provide absolute immunity but that has not been tested.\n\n**Actuated by malice**\n\nMalice in law does not mean what it means in everyday English. It means, with respect to defamation, that a statement was made either knowing that it was untrue or with reckless disregard for its truthfulness. In other words, you were deliberately lying, or you made no effort to find out if you were lying.\n\nWithin the context of Parliamentary Privilege, you cannot rely on the truthfulness of statements made in Parliament to establish that what you reported was the truth. The existence of the statements might be admissible, for example, to establish if privilege attaches to them but the content of the statements themselves has no probative value. In some ways, this is like a hearsay statement: you can testify that the statement was made (if that's relevant) but you cannot testify that there is any truth\\-value to what was said.\n\nTherefore, if you make a nasty remark (that goes beyond \"fair and accurate reports\") and your only reliance on the truthfulness of your statement comes from things under Parliamentary Privilege then you have no defence to a defamation claim. So, accusing someone of perjury for what they said to a parliamentary committee rather than just reporting what they said is clearly actuated by malice: it may be true but you know that you can't prove it's true \\- that amounts to reckless disregard for the truth.\n\n**Consequences**\n\nThe purpose of Parliamentary Privilege is to allow MPs to vigorously advance the interests of their constituencies (i.e. us) without the fear that they will be called to account for what they say in either a civil or criminal court.\n\nIt has been [argued](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/apr/09/top-judge-attacks-growing-abuse-of-parliamentary-privilege) that some uses of Parliamentary Privilege are an abuse, particularly where they subvert the operations of the judiciary or law enforcement such as by naming suspects, defendants, and witnesses or where the statements would be defamation but for the privilege. However, if they are, it is for the Parliament to discipline the MP by sanction or expulsion, or for the electorate to do so through the ballot box. Such discipline is rare, partly because no one wants to unleash a weapon that could be turned upon themselves but mostly, because Parliament is loath to interfere in the electorate's right to choose their own representatives even if they are wankers.\n\nThis privilege is clearly at odds with the principle of free speech and inhibits the ability of media outlets to editorialise on matters covered by privilege. **This consequence is not unintended**, rather it is a deliberate trade\\-off of one pillar of democratic life against another.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A journalist is reporting on a politician who made seemingly contradictory statements during two separate parliamentary committee hearings.

This is one of the last flats available in the block and the builder is in a rush to complete and get the money as soon as possible. They set a deadline to complete the transaction of one month from the time we put down the reservation. This is much sooner than my partner and I would have liked, but we're accomodating their schedule, at a cost to ourselves: for example, my partner has taken time off work in order to attend an inconveniently scheduled appointment with the mortgage broker on a day's notice, and we will have to take a loss on a several weeks' rent as we were not able to find another person to take over our current lease in time.\n\nAs the scheduled completion date draws nearer, I'm beginning to worry that any minor setback will push us past the deadline. The dates that have been set by the builder are incredibly tight and don't allow any room for error.

The builder has been vaguely threatening about what will happen if we don't meet the deadline but has not said specifically what their plans are. I'm worried that even minor delays that are outside of my control could result in us going over the scheduled time and thus losing our reservation, the money we've put down, and the flat itself. As a first time buyer, I'd also like to make sure I have enough time to fully research and understand every step, rather than having to make important decisions under pressure. \n\nMy question is, what recourse do we have if we go over the deadline and the builder imposes a financial penalty and/or cancels our reservation?

If the license does not permit you to distribute modified versions, than doing so would be a copyright infringement. I cannot see how this would fall under fair use or fair dealing. So assuming that the copyright is valid, one would need to obtain permission from the copyright holder. A modified version of source code is a derivative work, and the right to prepare and distribute derivative works is one of the rights that together make up copyright. \n\nIf someone were to distribute, in violation of the license, and without such separate permission, a modified version, the copyright holder could sue, and quite possibly be awarded damages, perhaps sizable damages.\n\nHowever, if one were to merely take the general purpose and design of the previous application, and rewrite it totally, not copying or modifying the original source code, tht would be a new and different work with its own copyright. Copyright does not protect ideas or concepts. It protects the **expression** of ideas.

The project's license states: \"You may redistribute the source code of this program subject to the condition that you do not first modify it in any way.\" Which of the following approaches would most likely allow the developer to legally create and distribute an enhanced version of the software?\n\nA) Modify the source code directly and distribute it under a new name, arguing fair use\nB) Rewrite the entire application from scratch, implementing the same general functionality\nC) Distribute the original code alongside a separate patch file containing the modifications\nD) Obtain a court order to override the license restrictions for public benefit\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of copyright law concepts in the context of software licensing. The correct answer is B because rewriting the entire application from scratch, while implementing the same general functionality, creates a new and different work with its own copyright. This approach doesn't violate the original license because:\n\n1. Copyright protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves.\n2. Completely rewriting the code without copying or modifying the original source creates a new expression.\n3. The general purpose and design of an application are not protected by copyright.\n\nOption A is incorrect because directly modifying and redistributing the source code violates the license terms and likely wouldn't qualify as fair use. \n\nOption C, while creative, still involves modifying the original program (even if indirectly) and would likely be seen as circumventing the license restrictions.\n\nOption D is unrealistic and misunderstands the nature of copyright law and licensing; courts generally don't override valid license agreements for nebulous \"public benefit\" reasons.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts (copyright law, software licensing, and development practices) and apply them to a real-world scenario, requiring critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}, "97": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27256/treason-sedition-and-the-us-bill-of-rights", "docs_id": 27256, "title": "Treason, Sedition and the US Bill of Rights", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In 2018, where are lines drawn between treason, sedition, and constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and assembly?\n\n1.

Consider each case:\n\n* the foreign nation is a close ally of the US\n* the foreign nation has neutral relations with the US\n* the foreign nation is a bitter rival with cold relations to the US\n* the foreign nation is in a state of open, declared war with the US\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Relevant Law\n============\n\nTreason\n-------\n\nTreason is constitutionally defined as waging war on the United States, or giving aid and comfort to its enemies. The definition doesn't formally say so, but only someone who owes allegiance to the United States (i.e. a U.S. citizen) can be guilty of treason. The federal treason statute states:\n\n> Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, **levies war against\n> them** or adheres to their **enemies**, giving them aid and comfort within\n> the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer\n> death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under\n> this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of\n> holding any office under the United States.\n\n18 USC Section 2381\\.\n\nThe main limitations are in bold.\n\nThe word \"enemy\" has a technical meaning in the area of treason and foreign relations, which means a country or insurgent group with whom the United States is at war. Thus, the following are not \"enemies\" of the United States:\n\n* the foreign nation is a close ally of the US\n* the foreign nation has neutral relations with the US\n* the foreign nation is a bitter rival with cold relations to the US\n\nBut, this one is an enemy of the United States:\n\n* the foreign nation is in a state of open, declared war with the US\n\nHence, a U.S. citizen giving aid and comfort to ISIS (with whom we have a Congressionally authorized war) as it tries to mount a terrorist attack on the U.S. might very well be treason, but assisting Russia (with whom the U.S. is not at war) in assassinating an American would not be.\n\nI don't know if North Korea is a current \"enemy\" of the United States or not. The Korean War is not over, but I don't know if the U.S. declaration of war on North Korea is still in force.\n\nIt is also a lesser felony to failure to report treason in progress to the authorities, with treason itself defined in essentially the same way. 18 USC Section 2882\\. Thus, U.S. citizens have a legal duty enforceable with criminal law to affirmatively report treason.\n\nRebellion or insurrection\n-------------------------\n\nAlso rebellion or insurrection is a crime defined as follows:\n\n> Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages **in any rebellion or\n> insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws\n> thereof**, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this\n> title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be\n> incapable of holding any office under the United States.\n\n18 USC Section 2383\n\nThe bold language greatly restricts the applicability of this crime. This is not something you can really do by yourself, you need to be part of an organized insurgency group actively trying to overthrow the U.S. government by force.\n\nAffiliation with a foreign power is irrelevant to this offense.\n\nSedition\n--------\n\nSedition (actually seditious conspiracy) is defined as:\n\n> If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place\n> subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to\n> overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the\n> United States, or to levy war against them, or **to oppose by force the\n> authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the\n> execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take,\n> or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority\n> thereof,** they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not\n> more than twenty years, or both.\n\n18 USC Section 2384\\.\n\nThe highlighted portions are the least culpable ones that qualify for the offense of seditious conspiracy, which are subject to some significant case law glosses of interpretation. At a minimum seditious conspiracy must involve defiance of the authority of the United States.\n\nSimply committing serious crimes against the United States (e.g assassinating a high government official or blowing up a government building), while acknowledging that the United States is the legitimate government of the United States acting within its authority and not seeking regime change (not just new personnel but a new constitution not adopted by constitutional means), is not sufficient.\n\nYour involvement with a foreign power is neither necessary nor sufficient for conduct to be seditious.\n\nAdvocating the overthrow of the United States government\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdvocating the overthrow of the United States government is also a crime in some circumstances (subject to significant judicial case law glosses):\n\n> Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches\n> the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or\n> destroying the government of the United States or the government of\n> any State, Territory, District or Possession thereof, or the\n> government of any political subdivision therein, **by force or violence,\n> or by the assassination of any officer of any such government;** or\n> \n> \n> Whoever, with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such\n> government, prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells,\n> distributes, or publicly displays any written or printed matter\n> advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability,\n> or propriety of **overthrowing or destroying any government in the\n> United States by force or violence, or attempts to do so;** or\n> \n> \n> Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group,\n> or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the **overthrow\n> or destruction of any such government by force or violence;** or **becomes\n> or is a member of, or affiliates with, any such society, group, or\n> assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof\u2014**\n> \n> \n> Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty\n> years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by the United\n> States or any department or agency thereof, for the five years next\n> following his conviction.\n> \n> \n> If two or more persons conspire to commit any offense named in this\n> section, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n> than twenty years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by\n> the United States or any department or agency thereof, for the five\n> years next following his conviction.\n> \n> \n> As used in this section, the terms \u201corganizes\u201d and \u201corganize\u201d, with\n> respect to any society, group, or assembly of persons, include the\n> recruiting of new members, the forming of new units, and the\n> regrouping or expansion of existing clubs, classes, and other units of\n> such society, group, or assembly of persons.\n\n18 USC Section 2385\\.\n\nCollaboration with a foreign power isn't an element of this crime and is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish it. The key limitations and most inclusive provisions are in bold. The First Amendment significantly limits that application of this crime as applied, but it is not unconstitutional in all circumstances.\n\nYour Examples\n=============\n\nNumbers 1\\-2 would never be crimes of any kind as described and not reading anything else into them.\n\nNumbers 3\\-6 are not illegal *per se*, but you may be required to register as a foreign agent and these activities may be illegal for someone holding certain government offices.\n\nNothing in 1\\-6 would constitute treason or sedition or rebellion.\n\nCivil disobedience is a description that speaks more to the reason and motive for the action than the action itself so it is hard to say what you mean by 7\\-8\\. Somebody could call blowing up the Capitol \"civil disobedience\" or could mean protesting in violation of a curfew ordinance. Some of those activities could constitute a seditious conspiracy.\n\nWith respect to 9\\-10, the acts involved are more clear, but the motive and context remain in doubt. Some of this activity could conceivably be a seditious conspiracy, but we don't have enough context here to know.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation and guidelines, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A political activist is collaborating with a foreign entity from a country that has neutral relations with the US. They are organizing protests, publishing biased articles criticizing US policies, and engaging in minor acts of civil disobedience. Which of the following legal implications is most accurate?\n\nA) The activist could be charged with treason, as they are working with a foreign entity against US interests.\nB) The activist's actions likely constitute seditious conspiracy, as they are actively opposing US authority.\nC) The activist may need to register as a foreign agent, but their actions are likely protected by the First Amendment.\nD) The activist's engagement in civil disobedience automatically elevates their actions to rebellion or insurrection.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the provided documentation. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Treason is specifically defined as levying war against the US or adhering to its enemies. In this case, the foreign entity is from a country with neutral relations, not an \"enemy\" in the legal sense. Therefore, treason charges are not applicable.\n\n2. Seditious conspiracy requires a conspiracy to overthrow the government or oppose its authority by force. The described actions (organizing protests, publishing articles, minor civil disobedience) do not meet this threshold, especially given First Amendment protections.\n\n3. Rebellion or insurrection requires active participation in an organized attempt to overthrow the US government by force, which is not described in this scenario.\n\n4. The activist's collaboration with a foreign entity may require them to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which is mentioned in the documentation for cases 3-6.\n\n5. The First Amendment provides strong protections for freedom of speech and assembly, which would likely cover most of the described activities.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C. The activist may need to register as a foreign agent, but their actions of organizing protests, publishing articles, and engaging in minor civil disobedience are likely protected by the First Amendment, assuming they do not cross into more serious criminal activities or violent opposition to government authority.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and distinguish between protected political speech and activities that might cross into illegal territory."}, "98": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29749/is-it-possible-to-renounce-your-right-to-divorce", "docs_id": 29749, "title": "Is it possible to renounce your right to divorce", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When you get married, is it possible to enter into a contract renouncing both parties' right to a divorce?

Thus, the perpetuity as expressed in the term *whole lives* preempts the conceiving of an eventual separation.\n\nInsofar as marriage is legally cognizable as a contract (see legal definition), it might specify or imply remedies in the event that one or both spouses decide(s) that substance of marital relationship no longer exists; that is, in the event that a breach of that contract occurs. A court may order to the breaching spouse performance of certain acts (for example, alimony) in accordance to statutory law or common law.
