Prevent people from driving on sidewalks.\n2. Prevent double parking.\n\nThe participants in this movement seem to adhere to very respectful speech. However, I am wondering whether their method would be legal in the US and why it is legal in Russia.\n\nThe group's punishment consists of gluing large stickers \u2014 which cannot be easily removed \u2014 on the windshields of the offenders' cars. Sometimes, offenders say something along the lines of \"My car is my personal property. On what grounds are you damaging my personal property?\". The generic reply is \"Call the police if you wish and they will decide.\"\n\nWhile this seems a legitimate reply, I am wondering what the legal standing of such events would be in the US.

According to the documentation, the activities of the \"Stop a Douchebag\" movement, such as gluing stickers on car windshields, are \"definitely illegal in Russia as well.\" However, the police typically do not intervene or take action against the group. This is due to a combination of factors, including:\n\n1. The targets of the movement's actions are often engaged in illegal activities themselves (like driving on sidewalks or double parking).\n2. Public opinion tends to side with the movement rather than the offenders.\n3. Russian police are described as generally inactive even in more serious violations.\n4. The movement operates in a grey area where their actions, while technically illegal, address behaviors that are seen as socially unacceptable.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they suggest a level of legality or official sanction that is not supported by the given information.

Part of the decision says:\n\n> Judicial immunity arose because it was in the public interest to have\n>  judges who were at liberty to exercise their independent judgment\n>  about the merits of a case without fear of being mulcted for damages\n>  should an unsatisfied litigant be able to convince another tribunal\n>  that the judge acted not only mistakenly but with malice and\n>  corruption.

So I may be missing something obvious. (If so, then please accept my apologies).\n\nI'm not clear how it is the public's interest *not* to hold a corrupt judge accountable. In Operation Greylord the 17 judges willfully accepted bribes; it was not a matter of a \"honest\" mistake or false accusation.\n\nNaively, it seems to me a holding a judge accountable for willful criminal acts provides a deterrent. (A similar argument is usually made when the state provides a death sentence and executes its citizens). Or maybe the contra\\-positive is more import \\- a judge who knows he or she is not held accountable is free be be as corrupt as they like knowing they will probably not get caught.\n\nHow is it in the public's interest not to hold a corrupt judge accountable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Judicial immunity means only that the judge can't be *sued* by the people negatively affected by his decisions, even if they were made corruptly. \n\nThe idea is that if this were possible, then anyone who lost a case before the judge could sue him, perhaps falsely claiming that he was corrupt. Defending such suits would be a major nuisance and expense for the judge, and some fraction of such cases might be wrongly decided against him (courts do err sometimes). So, a party who said (or insinuated) to the judge that \"you'd better decide my case in my favor or else I'll sue you\" would have a credible threat, and the judge might be intimidated into giving in. This would certainly not be in the public interest, and so judicial immunity removes this possibility.\n\nIt's a trade\\-off: the harm done by false accusations would outweigh the good done by legitimate lawsuits against truly corrupt judges, and you can't allow the latter without creating the possibility of the former.\n\nHowever, judges *can* still be held accountable for corruption \\- just not through the mechanism of lawsuits by the affected parties. This is addressed within the *Dennis* decision, in the paragraph right above the one you quoted:\n\n> But judicial immunity was not designed to insulate the judiciary from all aspects of public accountability. Judges are immune from 1983 damages actions, but they are subject to criminal prosecutions as are other citizens. O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 503 (1974\\).\n\nSo a corrupt judge can still be prosecuted by the state: removed from his job, fined, sent to prison, etc. But the decision to prosecute him would be made by a state prosecutor, who has no personal stake in matters before the court, rather than by a potentially disgruntled litigant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the rationale behind judicial immunity as described in the DENNIS v.

Judicial immunity, as explained in DENNIS v. SPARKS, protects judges from civil lawsuits by parties affected by their decisions, even if those decisions were allegedly corrupt. This immunity exists to prevent judges from being intimidated or influenced by the threat of lawsuits from disgruntled litigants. However, judicial immunity does not protect judges from criminal prosecution. As stated in the decision, \"Judges are immune from 1983 damages actions, but they are subject to criminal prosecutions as are other citizens.\" This balance allows for public accountability through proper legal channels (criminal prosecution) while protecting the judicial process from potential abuse through civil lawsuits.\n\nOption A is incorrect because judicial immunity does not protect judges from all forms of accountability, particularly criminal prosecution. Option B is wrong because judges can still be criminally prosecuted despite judicial immunity.

If the city is hiring 50 police officers, the list must have at least 52 scores (50 positions plus 2\\). If it is hiring three secretaries, the list must have at least five scores (3 positions plus 2\\).\n* It's called The Rule of Three Scores because the existence of a list presumes at least one opening, which necessitates at least three scores.

It's not. Most \"illegal\" guns are bought through straw purchases in which a person with a clean record buys a gun for someone who is not legally allowed to own one.\n\nYou can work through a licensed dealer if it makes you feel better. If you don't want to use a dealer, you can simply require that a buyer have a concealed carry license as evidence that they are not a prohibited possessor.

The situation clearly meets the criteria for duress: Alex has been kidnapped (falsely imprisoned) by a criminal who has demonstrated a present intent to kill. \n\nOption A is incorrect because Alex is not conspiring with the kidnapper, but acting under threat. \n\nOption C is incorrect because Alex's actions under duress would not typically be considered accessory to murder. \n\nOption D is partially correct in that the choice of evils defense might apply, but it's not the best answer. Duress is more widely recognized and more directly applicable to this situation. Additionally, the question asks for the most accurate description of Alex's legal situation, and the duress defense provides stronger protection in more jurisdictions."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83792/how-to-protect-a-domain-address-without-owning-a-company", "docs_id": 83792, "title": "How to protect a domain address without owning a company?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have recently bought the perfect domain address for a company I plan to start in Brazil some years down the road.

According to UNCLOS Article 19, passage is innocent as long as it's not prejudicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal state. While Article 19 provides a list of activities that are not considered innocent, this list is non-exhaustive. Article 21 allows coastal states to make laws adding to this list, provided they are published. The UK had published sanctions against Syria, which made the tanker's passage non-innocent under international law. This interpretation aligns with UNCLOS while also explaining how the UK could legally seize the vessel based on suspicion of violating EU sanctions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Iran's ratification status of UNCLOS doesn't affect the UK's right to enforce laws in its territorial waters. Option B is wrong because UNCLOS does allow for restrictions on innocent passage under certain circumstances.

The opinion refers to \"the phrase \u201cthe militia\u201d in the prefatory clause\", with no capitalization when mentioning it.\n\nIn interpreting the object of \"keep and bear Arms\", \"Arms\", the opinion immediately removes capitalization in its own discussion of the term.

If those moving parts are part of claims in the patent to use in engine patent, will it be illegal to mimic them in replica?\n\nCheers,\nFilip\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several forms of intellectual property:\n\n1. Utility patents protect the functional aspects of a product for a period of approximately 20 years. If it is out of patent, it is in the public domain and you can freely make one. I can't think of any case where a patent infringement case was successfully made against someone who made a non\\-functional version of the patented item and I have no idea how the case law would play out in that. Usually those suits aren't brought because the functionality isn't imitated and it isn't valuable.\n2. Design patents protect the design for about the same time period. Usually, a functional product like an engine wouldn't be subject to a design patent \\- more often, only the exterior of a vehicle design would be subject to a design patent.\n3. A copyright protects expressions of a design or derivations of a copyright, but will not generally protect a functional design where the design parameters are governed by the laws of physics. Copyrights last much longer than patents (up to about a century depending upon who owns it), and there was a major change in the scope of copyright protection in the 1970s. Earlier copyrights required an affirmative filing to protect and had to be renewed. Later copyrights arise automatically, although filing and claiming a copyright enhances the copyright owner's rights. I would seriously doubt that an engine design would enjoy copyright protection.\n4. Trade dress/trademark covers non\\-functional aspects of a good that are associated with a brand of good to sell a product and can arise even without a public filing at common law. For example, if the engine had a company logo embossed on it, this would have trademark protection.\n\nGenerally speaking, your project would be at low risk for intellectual property infringement, particularly if the engine were a classic one, rather than a modern one. It also helps, from a practical perspective, that few companies that own intellectual property rights associated with engines are actively pursuing possible infringements of their engine designs legally. They are in the business of selling parts for vehicles to make vehicles run; they are not in the business of selling their engine designs as art.

Utility patents, which protect the functional aspects of a product like an engine, typically last for about 20 years. After this period, the design enters the public domain and can be freely replicated. Option A is incorrect because permission is not needed if the patent has expired. Option C is partially correct about trademark concerns but oversimplifies the overall intellectual property landscape.

Under U.S. patent law, Alice can potentially claim royalties from July 1, 2021, when her patent application was published. This is due to provisional rights, which allow a patent holder to claim royalties for the period between the publication of the patent application and the granting of the patent, provided certain conditions are met.

It appears to me that the German bureaucracy is preventing multiple registrations on the same address, however I have yet to receive clear answers as to why and how.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I think I can easily find myself officially homeless even though I have a job, health insurance and pay taxes. \n\nWhat do people without a home do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: All residents in Germany need to have a registered address. The reasons for that are numerous:\n\n* no need for a separate voting registration,\n* it gives a place to deliver legal notices,\n* it helps enforcing tax regulation (though tax law has another definition of \"residence\"),\n* certain taxes are assigned to the municipality where you are registered,\n* no need to do a utility bill or credit report dance when trying to prove your address to third\\-parties,\n* it was always done like that.\n\nThe last is reason enough as far as bureaucracy is concerned.\n\nAs far as your question goes, there are a few wrong assumptions.\n\nFirst, nobody is trying to limit or deny registrations. Municipalities actually get money for every resident they have registered through tax allocation.\n\nSecond, if you (semi\\-)permanently live at some place you are not considered \"officially homeless\" but as someone has didn't properly register themselves (which could result in a fine).\n\nThird, multiple people can be registered at the same address. How else could people register themselves in huge apartment buildings? Or even a family living together? If there is a suspicious amount of people registered they might want to check whether other regulation (such as minimum space per person) is adhered to. \n\nFourth, to register somewhere you need proof that you actually live there. This is where you probably ran into problems. This proof is usually [a letter given by the person allowing you live at a place](http://www.berlin.de/formularserver/formular.php?402544). Note that this is not necessarily the owner of the place but literally the person allowing you to stay (the authorities can check with the owner though). Often subletters won't sign that piece of paper, either because they think they are not allowed to or they don't have permission by the owner to sublet the place to begin with. If that happens you are supposed to tell that to the authorities (\u00a7\u00a019 Abs.\u00a02 BMG) who then can choose to fine the one providing the place for refusing to sign the paper. (The need for proof was recently reintroduced after it was noticed that there was a huge amount of people who registered at an address where they didn't actually live.)\n\nFifth, if you never have been registered before you can't actually properly pay your taxes as you need a tax ID for that. This is automatically assigned when you \u2013 surprise \u2013 register for the first time. If you are not an EU/EEA/CH citizen you also need to register yourself before they can change anything about the residence permit within Germany.\n\nTo end with an answer to your question if taken literally: German citizens can register themselves as homeless (*ohne festen Wohnsitz*) if they really are.

And it's used quite often.\n\nFor example, take unreasonable searches and seizures. Generally, if the police want to search someone's home, they normally have to obtain a warrant. In Canada, this can often be obtained by a Justice of the Peace. For some background, the [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html) says this:\n\n> Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.\n\nSo what happens if someone was searched unreasonably?\n\nIn such cases, the court would throw out the evidence. If the police searched someones home, and found a firearm, but they didn't obtain a warrant (and they didn't provide justification for not having done so), the evidence would be thrown out of court. This is to make sure that the rights of the accused are kept, and that a fair trial is run.\n\nIn [*R v Feeney \\[1997] 2 SCR 13*](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1508/index.do), the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that searching a house without a warrant constitutes an unreasonable search:\n\n> The police, during a murder investigation in 1991, entered the accused\u2019s house (an equipment trailer) without permission. When they received no answer at the door, they entered, roused the accused, touched his leg, ordered him to get up and took him to the front of the trailer for better lighting. ...\n> \n> \n> Warrantless arrests in dwelling houses are in general prohibited. Prior to such an arrest, the police officer must obtain judicial authorization for the arrest by obtaining a warrant to enter the dwelling house for the purpose of arrest. Such a warrant will only be authorized if there are reasonable grounds for the arrest, and reasonable grounds to believe that the person will be found at the address named, thus providing individuals\u2019 privacy interests in an arrest situation with the protection this Court has required with respect to searches and seizures.

Not all businesses are entities and when a business is organized as a sole proprietorship rather than as an entity, registering a vehicle in your name and registering a vehicle in the business are the same thing in any case.\n\nIt is conceivable that Virginia has, or may have at some time in the future, different registration fees, for example, for vehicles owned for personal use and vehicles owned for business use, and that it might put a cap on the number of vehicles owned for personal use for that purpose (so far as I know, there is no such limit now, but I could imagine a state government doing something like that, much as they do for certain kinds of residential real estate property tax breaks).\n\nBut whether a vehicle is owned for personal use or for business use still wouldn't change the fact that a vehicle is owned by you individually.\n\nAs a matter of good business practices, registering a large number of vehicles used for business purposes in your personal name probably isn't wise (e.g. for liability and tax purposes), but that doesn't mean that it is illegal or prohibited.\n\nThe only thing I can think of that would be similar to the kind of limitation that you are worried about is that New York City has (and perhaps a few other jurisdictions have) a highly regulated taxi industry, and to operate a taxi you must have a taxi license. Taxi licenses in New York City are fixed in number and transferrable, and all of the licenses available have been issued, so the only way you can own a taxi and actually use it as a taxi is to buy a taxi license from someone who already has one and even in theory, you couldn't buy more than the total number of taxi licenses which are outstanding.\n\nIn many businesses where you need a license to operate (e.g. liquor stores and radio stations and TV stations) there are numerical limits on how many licenses any one person can own at one time in a particular territory.\n\nBut registering a car is not a discretionarily granted license in the same way that a taxi or radio license is, it is simply a way of formally registering ownership of a particular item of tangible personal property as owned by you (the registration laws were originally passed to discourage car theft).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Virginia, what is the primary limitation on the number of vehicles an individual or business can register?\n\nA) There is a strict legal limit of 10 vehicles per individual or business\nB) The DMV imposes a cap based on the business's annual revenue\nC) The number of vehicles that can be afforded\nD) There is a quota system similar to New York City's taxi medallions\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The primary limit on the number of vehicles that can be registered under an individual's name or business in Virginia is the number of vehicles that can be afforded. There are no specific legal restrictions on the number of vehicles one can register. The answer is not A, as there is no strict legal limit mentioned. It's not B, as the DMV does not impose caps based on revenue. It's also not D, as Virginia does not have a quota system for vehicle registration like NYC's taxi medallions.

From the perspective of the citizen, is the speed limit 70 or 60?\n\nClarifications: The state code says explicitly that only the posted speed limit is enforceable. The cop writes a speed over 70 on the tickets he writes, but whether he does so because his radar gun is miscalibrated, or because he is lying, isn't clear to the citizen.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Courts, particularly traffic courts, tend to take a police officer's word over that of an accused person. While legally the limit is 70, the driver has very little recourse if the officer claims falsely that the actual speed was over 70\\.

As a cybersecurity professional I can provide some technical context around what I believe to be the situation.\n\nWhile I do not know the legal precedence, technically, IP addresses cannot typically be attributed to an individual person. There are a number of reasons for this.\n\nIn a local network, IP addresses are not unique. Rather, they are distributed by the DHCP server, and are reassigned at intervals. Forensic attribution to an individual in most environments would require a DHCP log linking the IP to the machine\u2019s MAC address, with time stamps that correlate to the individual\u2019s logon to that machine at the same time.\n\nIf the IP correlation involves a VPN, it gets more difficult. I would need to know where the log/evidence was obtained to determine what the IPs in question actually correlate to. If the evidence was obtained in local area network of the suspect, the IP addresses are likely assigned by the DHCP server (see previous). If they are obtained after encryption in transit to decryption, then very little can be determined. If they were obtained at the VPN server log, these IPs likely belong to an ISP which in turn may or may not be able to show what machine initiated the conversation.\n\nDigital photos often contain EXIF data, which is metadata about the photo. This data can contain details like, device make and model, sometimes location, time and date... If the defendant owns a Nikon such and such and the photo was taken with a Nikon such and such, and was uploaded using a VPN the defendant has an account with, and the defendant was in that location at the time and place of the photo... there may be enough there... but I\u2019m not a lawyer.\n\nI believe the discovery should include any EXIF metadata and logs to be used as evidence.\n\nYou may need a special technical whiteness to educate the court on what can and cannot be determined (technically) given the evidence.

IP addresses alone are typically insufficient to attribute digital content to a specific individual due to various technical factors. This is supported by several points in the documentation:\n\n1. IP addresses in local networks are not unique and are distributed by DHCP servers.\n2. IP addresses can be reassigned at intervals.\n3. Proper attribution often requires additional evidence such as DHCP logs, MAC addresses, and timestamp correlations.\n4. The use of VPNs can further complicate IP-based attribution.\n5. Additional factors like EXIF data from photos, device information, and location data may be needed to strengthen the connection between digital content and an individual.\n\nOption A is incorrect because IP addresses cannot always be directly linked to a specific individual.

Deadly force is not generally justified except in response to a reasonable fear of deadly force, or to prevent certain violent crimes (like rape, kidnapping, robbery, etc.) Force is *not* justified in retaliation.

You can only use force to defend yourself, not to get even.\n* If someone gets in your face without touching you, you *might* be allowed to use force, but it depends on the circumstances. You don't have to wait for someone to hit you, but you can't sucker\\-punch someone because you want more space in a mosh pit.\n* Your use of force needs to be something you reasonably believe to be necessary to stop/prevent their unlawful use of force. It also needs to be proportional to the force you're defending against; you can meet deadly force with deadly force, but shooting someone to stop them from slapping you is murder. Likewise, no one's going to believe that you really thought you *had* to beat the crap out of someone in order to stop them from slapping you, or that it's in any way proportionate to what they did.\n* Deadly force is not allowed in defense of a person unless you reasonably think *deadly* force is needed to prevent the unlawful use of deadly force, or to prevent one of a few crimes being committed against them.

Massachusetts's statutes don't seem to expressly prohibit it\u2014and I didn't find any Massachusetts cases where the registered agent's age was at issue. But registered agents have some fiduciary duties, and the agent has to have the capacity to receive all forms of legal process.\n\nSome possible roadblocks are:\n\n1. \"minor\" is a broad term that courts don't seem to have interpreted in the context of registered agents, and\n2. each form of legal process sets its own requirements.\n\n**Background**\n\nFirst, the term \"minor\" encompasses extremes: a 1 year old doesn't have the capacity to receive and forward legal process to the intended party, but a 16 year old might. Some jurisdictions recognize a \"suitable age and discretion\" rule, though it hasn't been extended to the context of registered agents. *See, e.g.*, [Fed. R. of Civ. Proc. 4(e)(2\\)(B)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_4). Massachusetts isn't one of those jurisdictions. *See* [Mass. R. Civ. Pro. 4(d)(1\\)](https://www.mass.gov/rules-of-civil-procedure/civil-procedure-rule-4-process).\n\nIn the broader law of agency, minors do have the capacity to serve as \"agents\"\u2014though their ability to affect the legal relations of the principal is limited. For example, the enforceability of minors' contracts is an issue, and minors can't enter into durable powers of attorney or serve as trustees. See Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 3\\.04\\. The problems associated with appointing a minor as an agent in Massachusetts are longstanding. In *Commonwealth v. O'Leary*, 143 Mass. 95 (1886\\), a mother had her minor daughter enter into a contract of sale for alcohol for the mother's use. While the court recognized the daughter as the mother's agent, it still characterized the transaction as an illegal sale \"to\" a minor.\n\nIn the case of a registered agent, the primary action Massachusetts expects of the agent is the receipt and forwarding of the principal's legal correspondence. Courts have found that this creates a fiduciary duty on the registered agent's part. *See* *Int'l Envtl. Mgmt. v. United Corporate Servs.*, [858 F.3d 1121](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20170526144) (8th Cir. 2017\\). This makes sense because the service of process satisfies constitutional requirements embodied in the Due Process clause. So in predicting whether a court would extend the \"suitable age and discretion\" rule to registered agents (or even needs to), it would likely consider that the agent has fiduciary duties, albeit more limited than those of a typical trustee.\n\nSecond, [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B \u00a7 49](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156B/Section49) governs corporations and requires that the agent be capable of receiving \"all lawful processes in any action or proceeding\". When the agent is an individual (as opposed to a company), that person must be a resident of Massachusetts and have a \"business address in the commonwealth\". [Mass. Gen. Laws 156C \u00a7 5](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156C/Section5) governs the process for LLCs, and [Mass Gen. Laws 156D \u00a7 15\\.07](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156D/Section15.07) details it for non\\-Massachusetts companies.\n\nMassachusetts's statutes don't expressly prohibit minors from serving as registered agents, but the agent must have the capacity to receive all forms of lawful process. Thus if some lawful process requires delivery to an adult, the minor wouldn't be capable of receiving it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Massachusetts, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal considerations regarding a minor serving as a registered agent for a company?\n\nA) It is expressly prohibited by Massachusetts statutes for minors to serve as registered agents.\n\nB) Minors can serve as registered agents without any legal concerns, as long as they are residents of Massachusetts.\n\nC) While not expressly prohibited, it presents significant legal risks and potential issues with fulfilling the role's requirements.\n\nD) Minors can serve as registered agents, but only if they are at least 16 years old and have parental consent.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While Massachusetts statutes don't expressly prohibit minors from serving as registered agents, there are several legal considerations that make it a risky proposition:\n\n1. Registered agents have fiduciary duties, which may be problematic for minors to fulfill.\n2. The agent must be capable of receiving \"all lawful processes in any action or proceeding,\" and some processes may require delivery to an adult.\n3.

These readings aren't from classical authors, but were most likely written up by the author of the textbook, to provide simple readings for beginning students.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if it's legal to reproduce the Greek readings written by the textbook author. Would it be enough for me to cite the textbook within each blog post? Or am I required to actually write the author and receive permission? \n\n---\n\n**Relevant Details**\n\nI live in the US and the book was printed in the US, and is still in print. It was copyrighted in 2000\\. I'm simply reproducing the textual content by laboriously typing up the Greek using the Polytonic Greek keyboard on Mac OS X. No pictures or scans. \n\nThe blog is a personal blog, devoted to my interests. Two of these main interests are Greek and Latin. I would say the blog has two purposes. First, it's an educational tool which helps me track my progress and access my materials. Second, it allows me to share my enthusiasm with others.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the Ancient Greek text was composed by an ancient Greek, copyright protection has long since run out. If the text is written by the textbook author and the textbook is still in copyright, then it is protected, and it would be infringement to post either the original text or a translation. [17 USC 102(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102) states the basic rule regarding what is protected: \"original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression\", and [17 USC 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) states that the copyright owner has the sole right to authorize derivative works such as translations. Hyper\\-technically, you kinda violate the law when you do homework, which is an absurdity that just struck me. No language textbook author bothers to grant permission for students to do translation exercises. A reasonable person would assume that permission to translate is implicit in the fact of publishing a language textbook. Copyright is not about \"attribution\", it is about the property rights of authors: permission is required from the author.\n\nIf you opt to go ahead and get sued, one approach to defending yourself against a suit would be to plead [fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/7683/4501), so read that analysis. Applied to your case, a fair use analysis is IMO highly unlikely to succeed. In freely distributing the original texts, you would be undercutting a major portion of the market value of the textbook. In addition, in distributing translations (free answers), you would be seriously undermining the pedagogical utility of the exercises.

Both excerpts read \"*No corporation \\[or] guarantor of an obligation of a corporation*\" rather than \"*no person*\". The prohibition restrains the corporation and its guarantor, not the \"*person dealing with the corporation or \\[the] person who who acquired rights from the corporation*\".\n\n> Why is it talking about people \"dealing with the corporation\" rather than just \"the corporation itself\"?\n\nThe purpose of this question is unclear, but maybe the previous clarification renders this one moot.\n\n> What if the \"by\\-laws\" and \"unanimous member agreement\" are in contradiction with each other as is the case I described at the beginning?\n\nIt depends on how or why the discrepancy hinders or reasonably could hinder the complainant's capacity and/or his rights. That issue is unclear from your description.\n\nIf the departure from by\\-laws does not harm (or implies no potential harm to) the complainant, the departure is immaterial and as such it does not disrupt the legal obligations the non\\-profit organization has. Accordingly, it is unlikely that a court \"*thinks fit*\" to order compliance with an item that seems ritualistic at least in relation to that complaint.\n\nIt is noteworthy, though, that requirement (b)(ii) in and of itself is rather unclear. The terms \"*advanced computing system*\" and \"*from time to time*\" are particularly vague. That vagueness foreseeably complicates the \\[judicial] ascertainment of compliance.\n\nLastly, the fact that the term \"*by\\-laws*\" is not explicitly mentioned in the statutory definition of \"*articles*\" is irrelevant. By\\-laws are for purposes of reorganization, arrangement, etc. of a corporation, and hence they fit the meaning of \"*articles*\".

If he returned it today, according to the agreement, he would owe $1500 (so he would need to pay $800 more since he once made a $200 payment, albeit late). But, he now refuses to pay more and refuses to return the car. I am pressing criminal charges, but want to focus here on just my potential in a civil suit. Also, I understand that I am unlikely to ever get paid even if I win the civil suit, but let's not discuss that.\n\nThen, what is the most I can reasonably sue for? My guess is that I can sue for the $6000 car (minus whatever value I can sell it for if I get it back) plus the $800 debt plus my court\\-related costs (maybe $500\\). Does California civil court have any punitive/double/treble recovery precedent? Is there a common practice in California civil courts which would allow me to sue beyond my true expenses?\n\nHe makes arrangements to pay or return the car but reneges on these actions. I could claim that he has caused me 40 extra hours of work to manage this but I don't believe I can expense my own time for a suit, so hoping instead for a more official California civil court punitive rule.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. You can repossess the car, with or without a court order to do so, so long as it is accomplished without a breach of the peace. If the car is never returned, you have $6,000 of damages for conversion of the car and probably punitive damages for theft of the car.\n2. You can sue for the money damages you experienced from breach of contract (which looks like $800\\), you would also get court costs if you prevailed ($500 per your question) but not attorneys' fees unless you had a contract that provided for them (you should have had an agreement in writing that said you get your attorneys' fees if you have to collect or take legal action to get the car back). You are correct that you can't sue for your own time (at least as a non\\-lawyer).\n3. You can add damages for the lost rental value of the car during the time that it was detained and the out of pocket costs you incurred repossessing the car, and for any damages to the car (e.g. cost of getting it cleaned, paint fixes from his actions, etc.) Find market quotations from low end car rental places as proof, or use the contract rate for the planned duration of the loan (probably better described as a short term lease).\n4. I am surprised that the prosecutor would pursue this criminally, because that would be unusual. If you wait for a conviction, the civil suit would be much cheaper and easier because the conviction proves liability (although not damages) in the civil suit. There also might be a restitution award in a criminal suit and if there was that wouldn't be dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n5. Intentional breach of contract is not fraud and hence usually doesn't give rise to punitive damages (which would be a thousand or two dollars at more) unless you could should an intent not to perform when the contract was entered into, and the fact that at least one payment of $200 was made really undermines that theory. But, detaining the car after the lease period expires could be a form of conversion or theft. In Colorado, we have a civil theft statute that allows for treble damages and attorneys' fees if you prevail, but I'm not sure that California has a comparable law, but some sort of exemplary damages are probably available if he stole the car in the end and never returned it.\n6. Don't worry too much about collection. Judgments remain valid for a long time. Even if he doesn't have money now, he may someday get a job from which you can garnish his wages, or a bank account that you can garnish, or buy real estate that can be subjected to a judgment lien, if he doesn't file for bankruptcy first (which lots of people don't). You can also refer the judgment to a collection agency which screws up his credit.\n\n> I'm more upset about this guy's lack of respect for agreements and\n>  people than about not being paid.

You sound like a one time occasional participant in this market, so this doesn't apply to you.\n\nInstead, your goal should be to optimize your monetary recovery from this one transaction and then to move on.

Publishing such an algorithm is legal and has precedent in the scientific community. This is supported by the example of Shor's algorithm, which theoretically solves the problem of factoring large numbers efficiently, although current technology cannot yet implement it for very large numbers. The legality of publishing such algorithms is based on the principle of academic freedom and the importance of sharing scientific discoveries. While the potential security implications are significant, the act of publishing the algorithm itself is not illegal. Options A and D are incorrect because there are no laws preventing the publication of such algorithms for national security reasons, nor is permission required from cybersecurity agencies.

Not sure if it matters but I live in Massachusetts and she lives in Georgia.\n\nBecause of her life situation she has not been able to afford car payments and I for this reason have allowed her to use one of the two cars that are in my name. In this case this means I make the monthly payments on these cars and I also pay for the car insurance for both of them.\n\nBoth of my cars are insured from the same company. On the insurance, she is listed as a driver for the car that she has with her in Georgia, and that car is also listed as garaged in Georgia.\n\nCan the car insurance company legally deny insuring the vehicle she is driving in this kind of case?\n\n**Update:** The reason for my question is that the car was in an accident where parts of the body (side front bumper, and side rear panel) got scratched. This happened when the car was parked outside a shopping center (someone tried to squeeze into a parking space next to it), meaning that she was not driving the car, or even inside it, at the time. A police report was made about this incident but it is not yet known if the driver of that other car had insurance, as they had left the scene after bumping into this car (some passerby got the tag\\# of that other car and gave it to my sister\\-in\\-law).\n\nWhen we asked the insurance company about this, we eventually received the reply that the insurance company \"is not going to insure the \\[car] that is garaged in Georgia, they are going to issue legal notice to cancel the insurance since \\[my sister\\-in\\-law's] residence is there.\"\n\nThe insurance policy has listed her as the driver on the car garaged in Georgia for 3 years. So if there was an issue with this setup, I would have thought that we had been informed about it.\n\nI am not particularly concerned about whether they are willing to cover the damage, as it is not major and the insurance in any case has a $500 deductible. The concern and question I have is about the \"legal notice\" from the insurance company, because that implies that this setup has been somehow illegal.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The insurer can absolutely deny paying any claims if they discover that you misrepresented something in obtaining your policy, or you failed to notify them of relevant changes in accordance with the policy's terms.\n\nIn fact, even changing the \"garage\" location *within a state* can affect your premium.\n\nYou should call your insurer and provide them an honest and complete description of the regular use of the car. It is up to their underwriters whether they will continue to provide insurance for that use, and whether they will change your premium accordingly.\n\n**Update** regarding the question update: The insurer could *not* legally deny a claim for any insured damage prior to notice of cancellation, so long as there was no misrepresentation and you had paid your premiums.\n\nAs to when an insurer can legally cancel a policy: This is first a contractual question, and their policy should include terms and conditions that address this. (E.g., they might reserve the right in the policy to cancel it for *any reason at any time*, in which case it's almost certainly legal.) Note that *all policy terms* must be approved by a state's insurance commission. I happen to remember that Massachusetts has some very unusual terms and restrictions for car insurance, so I wouldn't be surprised if the Massachusetts entity discovered that their policy on the out\\-of\\-state car was non\\-compliant and they *had* to cancel it.\n\nThe great thing about the tight regulation of auto insurance is that if a claim on a policy is denied, or if a policy is improperly cancelled, then you can file a complaint with the state regulator, and those tend to get resolved quickly and in the insured's favor. Therefore, you should simply review your policy terms and the cancellation notice. If anything seems out\\-of\\-order you can call both the insurer and your state regulator.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John, a Massachusetts resident, has been insuring two cars with the same insurance company.

After a minor accident involving this car, the insurance company informs John they will issue a legal notice to cancel the insurance for the Georgia-based car. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The insurance company is acting illegally by cancelling the policy after 3 years of coverage.\nB) John has likely violated the terms of his insurance policy and the company can legally cancel the coverage.\nC) The insurance company must honor any claims made before the cancellation notice, regardless of policy violations.\nD) State regulations prohibit insuring out-of-state vehicles, making the original policy invalid.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. John has likely violated the terms of his insurance policy by misrepresenting or failing to accurately report the primary location and use of the vehicle. Insurance companies have the right to cancel policies if they discover misrepresentations or significant changes that weren't reported. The fact that the policy has been in place for 3 years doesn't prevent the company from cancelling it upon discovering the true circumstances. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the insurance company can legally cancel a policy if terms have been violated, regardless of how long it's been in place. \n\nAnswer C is partially true but not the most accurate answer.
