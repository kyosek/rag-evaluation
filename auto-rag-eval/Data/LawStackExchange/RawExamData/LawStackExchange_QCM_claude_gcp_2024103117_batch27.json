You'd be allowed to keep abandoned property, but keeping lost property without looking for the owner is in many places considered theft. \n\nA car on your land is quite likely abandoned by the last driver (people don't usually lose cars). But the question is whether it is abandoned by the owner; if the car looks like it has some value then it is unlikely to be abandoned by the owner and more likely that it has been stolen. \n\nI'd report the car to the police; then it's up to them to find the owner or not. If they can find him, and the car was not abandoned, but actually lost (unlikely) or stolen (more likely), you have the satisfaction of being an honest person helping either a very stupid car owner or a crime victim to get their property back.

When a car is left on someone's property, it's important to distinguish between lost and abandoned property. While a car on private land may appear abandoned by the driver, it might not be abandoned by the owner (e.g., it could be stolen). The safest and most legally sound approach is to report the car to the police. This allows authorities to attempt to locate the owner and determines if the car was lost, stolen, or truly abandoned. If the police can't find the owner, the property may then be claimed by the finder (in this case, the landowner). This approach protects the landowner from potential theft accusations and ensures due diligence in attempting to find the rightful owner.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no automatic transfer of ownership after a specific time period without proper legal procedures.\nOption C is incorrect because an expired registration doesn't immediately grant ownership rights to the landowner.\nOption D is incorrect because there is an ethical and often legal obligation to attempt to find the owner of potentially lost or stolen property before claiming it."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/71184/when-can-employer-on-hourly-basis-cancel-work-at-the-latest", "docs_id": 71184, "title": "When can employer on hourly basis cancel work at the latest?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to find out if a new policy implemented by my employer is legal. I'm employed on an hourly basis, no minimum amount of work, with shift plans made yearly. Now they started cancelling some work less than 3 hours in advance depending on business needs (which make sense, but aren't my problem).\n\nI can't track down any specific legislation, I found SR 220 Art. 324 and SR 822\\.111 Art. 69 (official [commentary/explanations](https://www.seco.admin.ch/seco/de/home/Arbeit/Arbeitsbedingungen/Arbeitsgesetz-und-Verordnungen/Wegleitungen/Wegleitung-zur-ArGV-1.html#-305982440) by SECO) which both seem to support me, but aren't specific enough to be of any use to me.\n\nSwitzerland, Canton of Zurich.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **First Part**\n\nOR 324 is quite the right article for this. If the employer doesn't want that you work (because he has nothing to do for you) it's his problem, not yours. He still has to pay if you are there and ready to do work. This is for instance also mentioned in [this article](https://www.20min.ch/story/unverschuldete-minusstunden-was-tun-560345018339).\n\nThe meaning of this is obvious if having a contract with a fixed number of work hours per day/month/year.\n\n**Second part**\n\nProve that you have a fixed work contract.\n\nIf the shift plans are made in advance you have a proof that you have a certain number of hours to work (and thus an expected income). If I interpret [this here](https://www.slp.ch/lohnfortzahlungspflicht-bei-gelegenheitsarbeit/) correctly, this is \"echte Arbeit auf Abruf\" (true work on request), because if your employer wants your work, you *have to* be there according to the shift plan, as opposed to your employer asking \"who is ready to work tonight?\".\n\nSo your employer must pay you the hours agreed on in the shift plan, regardless of whether he has work for you or not (but you must explicitly tell him that you are willing to take work).\n\n**Third part**\n\nCan the employer change the shift plan, and to what extent?\n\nThe employer must announce changes to work hours as soon as possible, and changes on short notice are only acceptable in [emergency cases](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/sozial-und-sicher/die-festlegung-der-arbeitszeit-ist-chefsache/story/13793839). A reduction in work hours due to not enough work shall not reduce the employee's salary. The business risk is entirely with the employer and he must not shift that responsibility to his employees.

This is based on OR 324, which states that if the employer doesn't have work for the employee, it's the employer's problem, not the employee's. The business risk is entirely with the employer and they must not shift that responsibility to employees. This applies even for hourly workers if there's a set shift schedule, as it constitutes \"echte Arbeit auf Abruf\" (true work on request).

Or is what is she doing entirely legal?\n\nAlso, unfortunately, I don't know any more details about her license or method of obtaining it as we spoke in casual passing about it. I can probably ask her though, if necessary.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Utah Department of Professional Licensing](https://dopl.utah.gov/licenses/) does not issue licenses for travel agents, and there seems to be no evidence of a statutory requirement for licensing. Therefore it's unclear what status this license has. I did see a number of online places offering to train people to be travel agents, and perhaps one of them offers a certificate of training.\n\nThere is such a thing as an IATA number, and some hotel might require providing one's IATA number. If a person does not have an IATA number and the hotel does not verify the IATA number, then it would be fraud to falsely make up a number in order to obtain a benefit. The person could be sued to recover the amount of the discount. If the person has an IATA number, then there nothing obviously fraudulent, but you would have to inspect the conditions for using an agent discount.\n\n[IATA](https://www.iatan.org/en/accreditation/idcard) requires you to work at a registered agency to get an agent number, and the proof requirements are substantial enough that it would be surprising if a person could get away with just claiming to work at a travel agency. The organization would certainly be in a good position to sue a person for falsifying the application (note also that the application is subject to binding arbitration by the Travel Agency Commissioner).\n\nSo it depends on who gave the discount, what the required, what if any accreditation was used to get that discount, and what the actual facts are (i.e. does the person actually work for an agency making at least $10,000 a year).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A woman claims to have obtained a travel agent license in Utah to receive discounts on hotels and airfare, but admits she doesn't actually work as a travel agent. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of her actions?\n\nA) Her actions are completely legal as long as she obtained a certificate from an online travel agent training program.\n\nB) Her actions are fraudulent only if she fabricated an IATA number to receive discounts.\n\nC) Her actions are likely fraudulent, as Utah doesn't issue travel agent licenses and obtaining an IATA number requires verifiable employment at a registered agency.\n\nD) Her actions are legal as long as she occasionally books travel for others, regardless of income earned.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because:\n1. Utah does not issue official travel agent licenses, so any \"license\" she claims to have is not state-sanctioned.\n2. IATA numbers, which are often required for agent discounts, necessitate working at a registered agency and earning at least $10,000 annually.\n3.

I am aware of fair use, but it seems that this could fall either under fair use (since it's a form of commentary) or under copyright infringement (since I use it for commercial use and use the essence of the artifacts).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Such a booklet might or might not be ruled fair use under US law. This isn't really commentary, unless you add some analytical or critical materiel, in short some **comments**, on the quotes. That woukld make it pretty clearly fair use. But fair use is significantly broader than commentary. Let us look at the statutory factors. [This question and its answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o) lists and describes them. [17 USC 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107) is the actual law.\n\n1. **The purpose and character of the use.** The use is commercial, which weighs soemnwhat agaisnt fair use, but not overwhelmingly. The use is arguable soemwhat trasformational, but it seems to me not highly so. That weighs a little towards fair use.\n2. **The nature of the copyrighted work.** The works quoted are creative, works of entertainment, not factual or educational. This weaighs agaisnt fair use, but not overwhelmingly.\n3. **The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.** This nis not really clear from the question. One or two lines from a short song might be a substantial portion. \"*Like a bridge over troubled water / I will lay me down.* Might alone be considered the \"heart\" of the Simon \\& Garfunkel song, as it in my view, captures the key feeling of the song, even if it is only 2 short lines, one sentence. A line or two for a feature\\-length film is much less likely to be a substantial part. This factor can be quite subjective. Recall *Harper vs Nation* where a 300\\-word quote from President George H. W. Bush's long autobiography was judged to be the \"heart\" of the work, and fair use denied.\n4. **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.** This is also hard to judge without specifics, but short quotes rarely harm the market for an existing work, much less one decades old. This provably weighs in favor of fair use.\n\nSo fair use is possible for the kind of use described, but a long way for assured. Adding significant commentary on each quote would make the case for fair use significantly stronger.\n\nAs for Sweden, while the basic framework of modern copyright, derived from the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) is the same, Sweden has nothing like the fair use doctrine in its law. I think the case for copyright infringement under Swedish law would be fairly strong.\n\nAnd of course, even if a use is clearly an infringement, there is no penalty unless the copyright holder shooses to sue. One can never know if that will happen, but corporate media copyright owners tend to be more ready to sue than the general population. They often have the resources, and are inclined to think that way.

This aligns with the first fair use factor (purpose and character of use) by adding new expression and meaning. The other options may help to some degree, but adding commentary is explicitly mentioned in the source text as significantly strengthening a fair use claim. Short quotes (A) could still be substantial portions. Age of works (B) isn't a key fair use factor. Limiting to one studio (D) doesn't inherently support fair use."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/65304/estate-administration-evaluation-date-for-securities", "docs_id": 65304, "title": "Estate Administration - Evaluation Date for Securities", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose an estate has assets (stocks and/or cryptocurrencies) that will go to the primary beneficiary , but the second beneficiary gets a % of the estate (in cash).

Then $11,000 when the tax return is filed, and $12,000 on the day the assets are distributed. And the second beneficiary gets 10%. So the date of the valuation determines whether they get $1000, $1100, or $1200 (for the those assets) paid out of the checking account.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It sort of depends on what the will says, for example if the will says \"shall receive 1% of the value of my estate at the moment of my death\", that answers your question.

Ideally, you will know the current value of everything left and can do the math and transfer title all at once.

All of the securities can be transferred on one day; the house may be sold a month later and assets re\\-distributed according to the formula at that point.\n\nIn other words, you don't need a fixed instant for computing and distributing the estate, you just need to distribute each asset according to the terms of the estate.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An estate consists of $100,000 in stocks, $50,000 in cryptocurrency, and $50,000 in a checking account.

This aligns with the principle that percentage bequests typically refer to \"the totality of what is left to disburse to beneficiaries\" after obligations have been discharged. Specific bequests (like the stocks and cryptocurrencies to Beneficiary A) are distributed first, then remaining debts, taxes, and administration expenses are paid.

If it's apparent that medical treatment is necessary and the driver cannot provide it, they must arrange for transportation of the injured person to medical care. In this scenario, leaving to find help is not only permissible but required. However, the law also stipulates that the driver must provide their name, address, and vehicle registration to the injured party or police. Since this information couldn't be provided before leaving to seek help, the driver would be obligated to return to the scene to fulfill this requirement.

Nobody is entitled to a \"standard of living\". Just because you lucked out to marry a high\\-net\\-worth or high\\-earning individual, it should not \"entitle\" you to live the good life in perpetuity after you stopped being married.\n\nThis is *separate* from the idea that a spouse may have contributed to said high\\-earning status by supporting their career, which is a far valid \\- but a wholly separate \\- reason in divorce court. For example, I assume a judge can apply \"standard of living\" idea even if the wealthy spouse can show that the wealth/income didn't change upwardly during the marriage; and that the spouse didn't contribute economically at all, due to paying for hired help to do house chores, and no children resulting etc...\n2. It seems like a moral hazard, in that it encourages lower income earners to trick higher income earners into marrying them under false pretenses, just to divorce them after a couple of years for a big payout in raised standard of living, or to simply not be a good spouse since they won't suffer in the divorce.\n\nIdeally, I'm looking for an authoritative answer to \"why\", for example a reason given by a judge establishing precedent, or a politician proposing the law that passed which establishes the idea). However, a solid legal analysis would also be good.\n\n**UPDATE**: Just to clarify \\- the question isn't asking why there is spousal support/maintenance in general. It's asking very specifically, why \"established standard of living\" is the criterion used to decide the amount. In other words, if a spouse is used to a billionaire lifestyle, why is the support aimed at perpetuating that same expensive lifestyle, **as opposed to** being a modest livable amount (say, mode or median or average wage).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [A brief explanation](https://mavrideslaw.com/history-alimony-massachusetts/) follows. The Code of Hammurabi articulates the first form of alimony:\n\n> 137. If a man wish to separate from a woman who has borne him children, or from his wife who has borne him children: then he shall\n> give that wife her dowry, and a part of the usufruct of field, garden,\n> and property, so that she can rear her children. When she has brought\n> up her children, a portion of all that is given to the children, equal\n> as that of one son, shall be given to her. She may then marry the man\n> of her heart\n\nIn the Middle Ages, English ecclesiastical law mandated that a husband still has an obligation to support his wife even when they are separated (recall that divorce was not possible). This carried over to the US. As discussed in [this article](https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1631&context=luclj), there was a view (articulated in Bradwell v. Illinois by Justice Bradley that \"Man is, or should be,\nwoman's protector and defender .... The paramount destiny and\nmission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator\".\nThe basic rationale at the time was that the wife had a right to support as a consequence of the marriage, and would continue to exercise that right were it not for the conduct of the husband (by law, someone was at fault, and if it was the husband, he would have to compensate his wife).\n\nWhen no\\-fault divorce became a possibility in the late 60's, concepts of alimony were re\\-worked, so that alimony was no (usually) longer a permanent property right, and in its place there developed a desideratum of \"maintenance\" allowing the spouse with lesser economic power to maintain a diminishing property right. See [this 1973 version](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1973ex1c157.pdf?cite=1973%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20157%20%C2%A7%209) of Washington's replacement\\-for\\-alimony law, which includes \"The standard of living established during the marriage\" as [the law now](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=26.09.090) does.\n\nBecause this is established by state law in the US, and state legislatures aren't infamous about keeping close track of legislative debates, I don't think there are any surviving records of the rationale of the author of these bills. In fact, this law was drafted a few years earlier by The Uniform Law Commission \u2013 there may be some record of their discussion.\n\\[This article]\\[5], written after the law was passed, takes note of the history of contractual concepts being applied to marriage (e.g. the territorial legislature enacted a measure that \"marriage is declared to be a civil contract\"), from which perspective one expects there to be compensation for breach of contract.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the historical development and rationale behind considering \"standard of living\" in divorce asset division?\n\nA) It originated from the Code of Hammurabi and has remained unchanged in its application since ancient times.\n\nB) It was introduced in the late 1960s as a direct result of no-fault divorce laws, with no prior historical basis.\n\nC) It evolved from English ecclesiastical law, through traditional views of marriage roles, and was adapted in modern times to address changing societal norms and economic realities.\n\nD) It was solely based on the concept of breach of contract in marriage, with no consideration for gender roles or societal expectations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The consideration of \"standard of living\" in divorce asset division has a long and complex history. It evolved from ancient concepts of support (as seen in the Code of Hammurabi), through English ecclesiastical law which mandated continued support even in separation. This concept was carried into US law, initially based on traditional views of gender roles and the husband's duty to support his wife. With the introduction of no-fault divorce in the late 1960s, the concept was reworked into \"maintenance\" to allow the economically disadvantaged spouse to maintain a certain standard of living. This evolution reflects changing societal norms while still acknowledging the economic realities of marriage and divorce. While contractual concepts have played a role, they are not the sole basis for this consideration, making option C the most comprehensive and accurate answer."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52732/does-eu-law-require-permanent-usage-of-catalytic-converters-in-cars", "docs_id": 52732, "title": "Does EU law require permanent usage of catalytic converters in cars?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many countries have vehicles with permanently active catalytic converters despite the fact that they lower efficiency and produce more carbon dioxide for the same mechanical power output.\n\nThe gases the catalytic converters combust, like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, are not dangerous in the concentrations they often appear, and they spontaneously react to become other chemicals after some time in the atmosphere.\n\nCatalytic converters were introduced 35 years ago when environment policies and car configurability were different. I don't question the motives of why the laws were passed then. **Today there is a big focus on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, so why are catalytic converters still in permanent use?** Catalytic conversion can be avoided with just a software change or configuration change in the engine control unit, that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some percent.\n\nA solution could be an adaptive system that configures combustion depending on circumstances, like turning off the oxygen supply to the catalytic converter when the car is moving at higher speed and turning it on in confined spaces like parking places and smoggy cities. It could also easily be turned off and on depending on geographic location or based on data from an carbon monoxide sensor.\n\n**Does the law require permanent usage of catalytic converters in cars?**\n\nThe setting of the engine control unit is the direct cause of increased fuel consumption, since the combustion process in the engine cylinder is providing more air than is optimal in order to provide oxygen to the combustion in the catalytic converter. [Back pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure) from the catalytic converter also decreases engine efficiency and increases fuel consumption. In some vehicles there is a [secondary air injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_air_injection) to provide oxygen to the catalytic converter. This requires energy and increases fuel consumption.\n\nFor example in regard to carbon monoxide the catalytic converter can be deactivated when levels are within [WHO guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK138710/#ch2.s11) at 6 ppm. In average CO levels are [0\\.1 ppm in the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide#Occurrence).\n\nA common misunderstanding of this question is that people seems to think that I write that the total carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel will be different with or without catalytic conversion. I have not written that. I write that there will be a diffence per mechanical power produced.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no EU law that *requires* vehicles to have a permanently active catalytic converter installed. There are various \"clean air\" regulations such as [Regulation 715/2007/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:2007:171:TOC) which covers the emissions standards vehicles must meet before they can be approved for sale within the EU. As long as the standards are met, the law is not particularly concerned with *how* those standards are met (excluding obvious cheating mechanisms, etc.)\n\nAdditionally, [Directive 2014/45/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:02014L0045-20140429&from=EN#tocId2) covers vehicle roadworthiness and mandates regular emissions testing as part of it. All vehicles must meet the standards of the test to be considered roadworthy. In the UK, this is performed as part of the annual MOT test.\n\nIt appears that catalytic converters are simply one of the easiest ways to meet those standards, and it is probably cheaper/more efficient for manufacturers to install a permanently active catalytic converter (which can be applied across multiple markets) rather than implementing software or alternative solutions which may or may not meet regulations in all the markets the vehicle is sold in.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the legal requirements for catalytic converters in vehicles within the European Union?\n\nA) EU law mandates that all vehicles must have permanently active catalytic converters installed.\n\nB) There is no specific EU law requiring catalytic converters, but vehicles must meet emissions standards through any means.\n\nC) EU regulations prohibit the use of software or alternative solutions to meet emissions standards.\n\nD) Catalytic converters are only required for vehicles manufactured within the last 10 years.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. According to the information provided, there is no EU law that specifically requires vehicles to have permanently active catalytic converters.

Also, sometimes the question might be resolved differently under parallel state and federal laws.\n\nIn general, in the U.S., asking about social media accounts is something that an employer may permissibly ask unless it is use to facilitate discrimination on a prohibited ground.\n\nOne rule, which applies in some jurisdictions, is that \"resume fraud\" (i.e. a material misstatement in a resume or employment application) discovered by an employer after an otherwise wrongful termination can serve as a lawful basis for terminating employment that excuses the wrongful basis for termination of employment (at least assuming that the information withheld or misrepresented was on a matter that the employer could lawfully consider). Even if the information not disclosed was not itself a basis upon which the employer would not have hired someone, the dishonestly in the hiring process would be a basis for termination of employment.\n\n[For example](https://www.hallrender.com/2012/05/15/resume-fraud-embellishment-embarassment-and-worse/):\n\n> The Seventh Circuit, which covers Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin,\n> has consistently held that it\u2019s permissible for employers to reject\n> job applicants and fire employees who are suspected of engaging in\n> resum\u00e9 fraud. The rationale for the Seventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning is\n> very straightforward: lying to employers is a legitimate and\n> non\\-discriminatory basis for turning down an applicant or firing an\n> employee. The cases of *Carter v. Tennant Co*., *Aubuchon v. Knauf\n> Fiberglass* and *Gilty v. Village of Oak Park* all stand for this\n> proposition. . . . .\n> \n> \n> If the employer, as part of its investigation of the allegations in\n> the lawsuit, discovers that the employee engaged in resum\u00e9 fraud, can\n> the employer use that belated discovery to its advantage? According\n> to the United States Supreme Court, the answer is yes. More\n> specifically, in *McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co.*, the\n> Supreme Court essentially held that an employer\u2019s belated discovery of\n> an independent, alternative basis for firing an employee (e.g., resum\u00e9\n> fraud) can be used by the employer to reduce the plaintiff\u2019s potential\n> recovery. (Think of this as the employer\u2019s \u201cif we knew then what we\n> know now, we wouldn\u2019t have hired you in the first place\u201d defense.)\n\nIn other jurisdictions, \"resume fraud\" is not itself a basis for discharge, although it might be used as evidence to support an initially claimed valid reason for terminating employment in the face of an employee allegation that this was a mere pretext for wrongful termination.\n\nI don't know which states or how many U.S. states fall in each category. The former rule is the rule in almost all cases under federal private sector employment law.\n\nA variety of cases that address the question in the context of public employment sector employment can be found [here](https://www.aele.org/law/Digests/empl226.html).\n\nIn addition to these general rules of law, there are also often reasonable questions of fact about whether a prospective employee substantially complied with an employer's social media disclosure question on a fact by fact basis that turns on the exact wording of the question and the reasonable interpretations that language could be given by the employee.\n\nFor example, if a question has a social media disclosure requirement and one doesn't disclose a blog, one might reasonably argue that a blog is not a social media account, depending on the language used in the question.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the concept of \"resume fraud\" and its impact on employment termination?\n\nA) Resume fraud is always a valid reason for termination in all U.S. states, regardless of other circumstances.\n\nB) Resume fraud can never be used as a basis for termination if discovered after an employee has started working.\n\nC) The treatment of resume fraud varies by jurisdiction, with some courts allowing it as a legitimate basis for termination, while others do not.\n\nD) Resume fraud is only relevant in cases involving public sector employees and has no bearing on private sector employment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The provided information indicates that there is a split of authority in the U.S. regarding the status of resume fraud (including non-disclosure of information required during the hiring process). Some jurisdictions, like the Seventh Circuit, consistently allow employers to reject applicants or fire employees suspected of resume fraud. In these jurisdictions, resume fraud can even be used as a defense against wrongful termination claims if discovered after the fact. However, other jurisdictions do not consider resume fraud itself as a basis for discharge, though it might be used as supporting evidence for a claimed valid reason for termination. This variability in treatment across different jurisdictions makes C the most accurate statement among the options provided."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15385/reasons-for-uk-citizen-to-not-get-an-irish-passport", "docs_id": 15385, "title": "Reasons for UK citizen to not get an Irish passport?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The United Kingdom has opted to leave the European Union, this may make travelling and visiting my holiday home abroad more difficult, or even stop me from working abroad in the future.\n\nMy mother is about about to get an Irish passport, as her mother (my grandmother) is Irish.

The verbiage had been changed to read, \"Subject said he had fallen but was okay\". My signature on the form was also forged.

You can (and probably should, assuming you are happy to pay for the time) ask your attorney how and whether he is going to use the evidence of fraud, but that is all. Nobody who is not a specialist in this area and also has read the papers can tell you the reasons for this decision, but every lawyer has encountered clients who disagree with the advice given, usually for insufficient reason. If you lose the case when the evidence of fraud would have meant that you won, you can sue your attorney; but it is not negligent to decide not to use certain facts, much less not to use them in a particular deposition.\n\nChanging attorneys is your privilege at any time, but you need to decide why you are doing so. If it is because you disagree with this decision, you are putting your knowledge of the law above your attorney's; is it likely that another lawyer will take the oppsite view?

When faced with a situation where you disagree with your attorney's strategy, the most appropriate action is to ask for an explanation of their reasoning while respecting their expertise.

Any additional details require a decent amount of background on parts of the Constitution, so please bear with me.\n\nCanadian Federalism\n===================\n\nA quick discussion on Canadian federalism may help understand the context of the sections you are asking about. Canada's federal system has some blurry or intricate lines between provincial and federal legislative domains. Beyond the federal appointment of provincial superior court judges, a few other cases of these lines can be found in the distribution of legislative powers found in [sections 91 and 92](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-4.html) of the Constitution Act, 1867\\. \n\nFor example, while marriage and divorce is a federal competency, the solemnization of marriage is a provincial competency. Another common example is that with criminal law being a completely federal concern, the federal government can often enact criminal law on what would otherwise be a provincial concern.\n\nIn dealing with the interplay of provincial and federal powers, the Supreme Court noted in [Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_(AG)_v_PHS_Community_Services_Society) that Canadian constitutional interpretation is evolving \"towards the more flexible concepts of [double aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_aspect) and cooperative federalism.\"\n\nFor more info, see [this Wikipedia article on Canadian federalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federalism), which is surprisingly detailed.\n\nCanada's Judiciary\n==================\n\n[Section 92(14\\)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-4.html) of the Constitution Act, 1867 places the judiciary under primarily *provincial* responsibility:\n\n> The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.\n\nThere are of course exceptions, the Supreme Court being the most obvious example. These exceptions are authorized by [section 101](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#h-25) of the Constitution Act, 1867 which gives Parliament the ability to set up federal courts by ordinary statute:\n\n> The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from Time to Time provide for the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada.\n\nThis has been done for example in the areas of intellectual property, and tax, among others.\n\nNote that Canada's judiciary is **unified**. As a general rule, *any* court is competent to adjudicate both provincial and federal law, unless that jurisdiction has specifically been removed from the provincial courts by a section 101 statute. Note that the Supreme Court has final say on all provincial and federal law. This is in contrast with the U.S. where its Supreme Court cannot overrule a state supreme court on matters of state law.\n\nFor more info, see [this Wikipedia article on Canada's court system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_system_of_Canada), which again, is surprisingly detailed.\n\nAnswers to your specific questions\n==================================\n\n\"Why\" questions are usually more of a political or historical question than one of law, but I'll do my best.\n\n> Why did the framers allow provincial superior courts to adjudicate some matters falling under federal legislative power (for example, bankruptcy cases)?\n\nI would say \"some matters\" is a little misleading, it is instead most. It's less about the Constitution allowing provincial superior courts to adjudicate matters falling under federal legislative power, and more about allowing the federal government to take away jurisdiction under section 101\\. Note that provincial superior courts aren't special in this respect, any provincial court can still adjudicate on matters falling under federal legislative power.\n\n> Why didn't the framers confine to the Federal Court?\n\nBecause of section 101, this isn't needed. Should the federal government wish to take over exclusive jurisdiction of a federal competency, they can.\n\n> Why blur the distinction between provincial v. federal jurisdiction?\n\nThis question really strikes at the design of Canadian federalism. With respect to federal appointment of provincial superior court judges, I think it's only natural to have some federal input in the spirit of cooperative federalism, especially given that provincial courts can adjudicate federal legislation.\n\n*Disclaimer: The rest of this answer is much more history than law*\n\nAs a more general question with respect to these blurry or intricate distinctions throughout the Constitution, we have to go back to its design from 1864\\-1867\\. I am greatly summarizing, but the design of Canadian federalism is mainly due to two things: the American Civil War and Quebec (and a third, staying under the British monarchy, but that's less relevant to this question). For further information see [here](http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp187-e.htm) and [here](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/18745/).\n\nHaving just seen the American Civil War at its end, the framers wanted a unitary government with little to no provincial rights. However, as a practical matter, Quebec's distinct culture and legal system made this infeasible. A federation with a strong central government and provinces having power over local matters was thus envisioned. The separation of legislative domains flowed from that principle.\n\nThis does raise the question of why the judiciary was given to the provinces by default, as it does seem like an important piece that should have been given to the federal government. One reason might be that section 101 does reserve the federal government some control anyway. Another might be that the judiciary was just not that powerful at confederation. For example, it wasn't until the Constitution Act, 1982, that the courts were explicitly allowed to strike down a statute as unconstitutional thanks to [section 52(1\\)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html#h-58) (though I believe they already had been with respect to *ultra vires* laws).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between federal and provincial jurisdictions in the Canadian legal system?\n\nA) Provincial superior courts can only adjudicate matters falling under provincial legislative power.\n\nB) The Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction over all matters falling under federal legislative power.\n\nC) Provincial superior courts can adjudicate both provincial and federal matters, unless specifically excluded by federal statute.\n\nD) The Supreme Court of Canada can only rule on federal matters, while provincial supreme courts have final say on provincial matters.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because it accurately reflects the unified nature of Canada's judiciary and the relationship between federal and provincial jurisdictions.

In this case, can Uber company sue against the developer because they have also bought copyrights for the Uber application?\n\nIt's a little bit confusing for me as a developer because most of the time we use similar codes to create similar behaviors in an application. Also the way you code is like your handwritten and you can not code similar applications in different ways, it's kinda meaningless! Because most of the time we just copy and paste similar codes that we already use in another application if we want to build something similar.\n\n**So how does copyrights law work for the applications?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A fundamental principle of copyright law is that protection is only afforded to the concrete expression, and not the abstract idea. Therefore, if you write a sort program, what is protected is \"that specific program\", and not the general idea of a sort program. There are many kinds of sort algorithms: if you write a bubble sort program, you don't \"own\" all bubble sort programs, you only own the one that you wrote. If you sell your right to a particular bubble sort program, you don't thereby prevent yourself from writing another bubble sort program. But, technically, you *do* prevent yourself from copying that program, changing some variable names or maybe manually recoding a couple of lines, and re\\-licensing the code (assuming that you fully transferred copyright, or gave the customer exclusive rights to the code).\n\nThe basic question that the courts will ask is \"did you copy that program\", which they answer by looking at the similarity between the two programs. All bubble sorts have a necessary similarity. To prove infringement, the plaintiff would (ultimately) have to prove that the similarity had to have come from copying rather than independent coincidental re\\-creation. Functional considerations and general programmer practice\nwould tend to weigh against an allegation of infringement in certain cases, where \"counter\" is a common name for a counter variable, and bubble sort is a well known algorithm with limited practical differences in lines of code.\n\nThe hard part is establishing that it would be natural for such similarities to exist even when independently coded by a single person. It may be common practice to take a program that you've sold and tweak it in some fashion, but that is copyright infringement, whereas \"applying the lessons that you learned in writing X to a new program\" is not infringement, it is using the same ideas, and the ideas are not what is protected.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A developer creates a ride-sharing application similar to Uber and sells it, including the copyrights, to Company A.

In copyright law, courts focus on the concrete expression rather than abstract ideas. They would examine the similarity between the two programs, taking into account functional considerations and general programming practices. While using 90% similar code might raise suspicions, the court would need to determine if the similarities arose from copying or from independent recreation based on common algorithms and programming techniques.

For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\nIn software, making a work based on another work (excluding the fact that your work only links, i.e. makes API Calls \\- `ApacheAPI.do_something()`. Mind you, other licenses may change the definition of a derivative work, and this is not universal to all licenses) is a derivative work.

Both involve making changes to the original work that result in a new work that is dependent on or derived from the original.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while it's true that the right to modify is often considered part of creating derivative works, it's not accurate to say it's a subset, as virtually all software modifications that are substantial enough to be licensed separately would be considered derivative works.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because these rights are not always separate and distinct.

It would otherwise seem like an email exchange between people who work remotely. I've always imagined them as nine people working in the same office building. Do the nine justices continually send written letters to one another? (Is this because they don't always work in proximity to one another?) Are there assistants typing up each person's notes and sending them to the other eight Justices?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Justices communicate by exchanging written memoranda, or at least they did during Justice Stevens\u2019 time. See Jeffrey Toobin, [*The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_(book)) (2007\\), p 48:\n\n> Outsiders tend to be surprised by how rarely Supreme Court justices speak to each other, one on one. Under Rehnquist, the nine spent a good deal of time together as a group. Argument days, most Mondays and Wednesdays when they were in session, were preceded by the traditional thirty\\-six handshakes, each justice with every other, and they had lunch together most of these days as well. There were also conference discussions every Friday during these weeks. **After the conference, however, the justices tended to communicate with one another through memos, which were often drafted by their law clerks.** (After e\\-mail became ubiquitous, the memos also circulated electronically, but always with paper copies as well; among the justices, only Thomas and Breyer, and eventually Stevens, were fully comfortable communicating by e\\-mail.)\n\nSome further detail about the distribution of these memos appears later in an anecdote about *Bush v. Gore* (p 170\\):\n\n> Stevens drafted an order of just a few sentences remanding the case to the Florida Supreme Court for the setting of a statewide standard to continue the recount. He sent his messenger scurrying down the marble hallway to Kennedy and the rest of the justices. He heard nothing back, except from Ginsburg, who said she would join if it was a way of bringing the whole Court together. (The rush of events in Bush v. Gore strained the Court's technology, which was, in 2000, still rather primitive. As a security precaution, the e\\-mail system circulated only within the building. Plus, there was only a single, communal computer from which the justices and clerks could obtain access to the Internet. Because only Thomas and Breyer used computers regularly at the time, there was little pressure from the justices to update.

The text specifically mentions that \"the justices tended to communicate with one another through memos\" and that \"for the most part, the justices communicated with one another by hand-delivered memos, which were typed by their secretaries.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while email was eventually introduced, it was not the primary method of communication.

According to the information provided, using cotton towels as insulation would almost certainly result in criminal liability for the landlord if a fire were to occur. This is because cotton towels do not meet the Fire Safety Building Regulations, and the landlord deliberately used a non-conforming material. The scenario specifically states that the landlord would be \"criminally liable\" in this situation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the legal consequences do not depend solely on whether the lodger was injured. The violation of building regulations itself is the issue.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the liability goes beyond civil damages. The landlord would face criminal charges for violating safety regulations.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the consequences would be more severe than just a minor fine.

Also, there isn't enough information available to us about your relationship with Block.\n\nPresumably, you have some kind of client agreement with the company, which will say things about what they will and can do, and likewise for you. That agreement will be the primary source of privacy\\-related restrictions on what they can do w.r.t. you. If \"you\" (the account holder) are defined as being you and your ex\\-wife, then they cannot deprive your wife of her contractual right to access to information. It does not matter that you are now divorced: what matters is what is in the agreement. It is highly likely that her access to this information is based on her being a party to the contract. There is a tiny chance that this is due to a screw\\-up on their part, such as them typing in the wrong ssn when modifying an account or creating a new account.\n\nThe document you link to regarding privacy policies is just one of many \u2013 they provide 4 other links applicable to other client relations. That document tells you what information they collect, there they get it from, what they do with it and who they share with. For example they say they do not sell your information.

We may share your information to support the\n>  products and services you request or provide you information on\n>  products and services that may benefit you. We may also share your\n>  information as permitted by law or with your additional consent.\n\nThis does not preclude freely sharing information in a way that is allowed by law. [26 USC\u202f6103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6103) is relevant law. The general rule is that returns are confidential and cannot be disclosed if obtained by certain people in connection with service as an employee acording to provisions of that section. In particular,\n\n> (3\\) no other person (or officer or employee thereof) who has or had\n>  access to returns or return information under subsection\n>  (e)(1\\)(D)(iii), subsection (k)(10\\), paragraph (6\\), (10\\), (12\\), (16\\),\n>  (19\\), (20\\), or (21\\) of subsection (l), paragraph (2\\) or (4\\)(B) of\n>  subsection (m), or subsection (n),\n\nSection (e) is about permitted disclosures to persons having material interest.

It does not matter whether you file jointly or separately. What *does* matter is whether she is your spouse.\n\nIf they disclosed a return for a tax year where you were not married (and she had none of the other listed interests), that might be a violation of the law. For the most part, this law restricts government disclosure of tax returns, but there is that clause applicable to *all* employees. Your attorney would then scrutinize that extremely long section to see whether such a disclosure is illegal, and whether there is some escape from liability if you fail to notify the company that X is no longer your spouse.\n\nYou need an attorney to solve your problem.

If no other legal basis allows the processing, you need to acquire consent. Consent must be *freely given*. If something is gated behind consent without that consent being really necessary, this might coerce users and they would not be able to consent freely. The GDPR does not have a hard ban on this, but it explicitly calls out that this case must be considered when determining whether consent is valid.\n\nSo what your company is trying to do is in a dark grey area. Not necessarily wrong, but likely so.\n\nConsent could be made free if users have an actual choice. For example, some online newspaper sites had success with a \u201cpay or consent\u201d wall. (Success in the sense that some data protection authorities allowed this). In your case, this could mean that users either consent to extra data collection, or that they buy some reasonably priced premium mode.\n\nBut none of this is for you to decide. You can voice your doubts that the software would be compliant. You could also ask if the Data Protection Impact Assessment document for this proposed processing is available (creating such an assessment is likely mandatory in this case).

GDPR requires that consent be freely given, and tying extra features to unnecessary data collection could be seen as coercive. This puts the practice in a grey area that's likely to be problematic.\n\nOption A is incorrect because GDPR doesn't explicitly prohibit this practice, though it does raise concerns.\n\nOption B is overly simplistic; merely informing users is not enough to make this practice clearly legal under GDPR.\n\nOption D touches on a potential solution (offering a paid alternative), but it's not comprehensive enough to be the most accurate answer in this context.\n\nOption C best captures the nuanced legal situation described in the source material, highlighting the potential issues with consent validity without overstating the illegality of the practice."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25025/what-are-the-fines-for-negligent-administration-of-social-security-numbers", "docs_id": 25025, "title": "what are the fines for negligent administration of social security numbers?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Years ago (about 2001\\) I read a USC statute that stated that the fine for negligent storage of social security number could result in a $10k 'per record' fine.\n\nI have been looking for this USC or anything like it now and find nothing.\n\nWhat is the CFR code or USC federal statute that implements a fine for negligent storage social security numbers (private personal data) on a database or computer, especially pertaining to HIPAA?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to current federal law, what is the specific fine amount for negligent storage of social security numbers under HIPAA regulations?\n\nA) $10,000 per record\nB) $50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum of $1.5 million\nC) $100 per affected individual, up to a maximum of $25,000 per year\nD) There is no specific fine amount for negligent storage of social security numbers\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While the question mentions a recollection of a $10,000 per record fine from 2001, this is not currently accurate.

To sum it up, a teacher fed a dying puppy to a snapping turtle and was charged with animal cruelty.\n\nPersonally, I would never feed a dog to a turtle, as I consider it morally wrong. However, I started thinking, why is it illegal?\n\nPet shops sell live animals for the purpose of feeding other animals.\n\nI have had many pets in my life and fed them live food. I have fed live shrimp to fish. I gave live fish to my snakes. I fed live insects to lizards. I gave rats and mice to my python. None of these are considered animal cruelty.\n\nSo what makes feeding a dying dog to a turtle less legal than feeding a perfectly healthy rat to a snake? Both animals can be pets, so why is one animal cruelty and the other perfectly acceptable? The only thing I can think of is that Americans consider dogs to be cuter than rodents.\n\nIs this a law due to common morality? Or is there some other legal reason?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general, the law is not based on the species, it is based on the use of the animal. This gives rise to the difference between food rabbits and pet rabbits, and so on. The definition or applicable offenses are spelled out in each state's criminal code. In Washington, Chapter [9\\.08 RCW](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.08&full=true) covers \"Crimes relating to animals\", and [16\\.52 RCW](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=16.52&full=true) covers \"prevention of cruelty to animals\". 9\\.08\\.065 defines a \"pet animal\" as\n\n> a tamed or domesticated animal legally retained by a person and kept\n>  as a companion. \"Pet animal\" does not include livestock raised for\n>  commercial purposes\n\nand then makes it a crime to steal a pet animal (this is in addition to regular laws against theft that applies to any property). So if you steal someone's pet goat, that's two or more crimes, but if you steal a meat goat, that's one less crime.\n\nThe main anti\\-cruelty laws are in [16\\.52](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=16.52&full=true). Distinctions may be made between between domestic animals and generic animals, or between livestock and others, or food animals and others, so it just depends on the action being forbidden. RCW 16\\.52\\.205 says you commit first degree animal cruelty if you\n\n> intentionally (a) inflicts substantial pain on, (b) causes physical\n>  injury to, or (c) kills an animal by a means causing undue suffering\n>  or while manifesting an extreme indifference to life, or forces a\n>  minor to inflict unnecessary pain, injury, or death on an animal.\n\nThere is no other provision allowing you to torture any animal, not even a backyard rat. It is generally illegal to poison animals, but RCW 16\\.52\\.190 allows euthanizing by poison, or pest\\-eradication by poison (insects are animals too). Thus it is legal to poison a pest rat but illegal to poison a pet rat. There is also a general exception, in 16\\.52\\.180, that\n\n> No part of this chapter shall be deemed to interfere with any of the\n>  laws of this state known as the \"game laws,\" nor be deemed to\n>  interfere with the right to destroy any venomous reptile or any known\n>  as dangerous to life, limb or property, or to interfere with the right\n>  to kill animals to be used for food or with any properly conducted\n>  scientific experiments or investigations, which experiments or\n>  investigations shall be performed only under the authority of the\n>  faculty of some regularly incorporated college or university of the\n>  state of Washington or a research facility registered with the United\n>  States department of agriculture and regulated by 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2131\n>  et seq.\n\nThis allows you to kill chickens for food, and might be construed as allowing you to feed rats to your snake (the law does not say \"used as food for humans\"). The definition of 1st degree cruelty also has an exception that \"Nothing in this section may be considered to prohibit accepted animal husbandry practices\" (however, keeping an animal as a pet or educational object does not constitute \"animal husbandry\" in the ordinary meaning of words). There is no clear statutory division in Washington between feeding rats to reptiles, and feeding dogs to reptiles, and if you were to feed kittens to your monitor lizard, you might well get arrested.\n\nIdaho [animal cruelty law](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title25/T25CH35/SECT25-3504/) also forbids cruelty to any animal:\n\n> Every person who is cruel to any animal, or who causes or procures any\n>  animal to be cruelly treated, or who, having the charge or custody of\n>  any animal either as owner or otherwise, subjects any animal to\n>  cruelty shall, upon conviction, be punished in accordance with section\n>  25\\-3520A, Idaho Code.\n\nand cruel(ty) is\n\n> (a) The intentional and malicious infliction of pain, physical\n>  suffering, injury or death upon an animal; (b) To maliciously kill,\n>  maim, wound, torment, deprive of necessary sustenance, drink or\n>  shelter, cruelly beat, mutilate or cruelly kill an animal; (c) To\n>  subject an animal to needless suffering or inflict unnecessary\n>  cruelty; (d) To knowingly abandon an animal; (e) To negligently\n>  confine an animal in unsanitary conditions or to negligently house an\n>  animal in inadequate facilities; to negligently fail to provide\n>  sustenance, water or shelter to an animal.\n\nAgain, feeding a rat to a snake is not intrinsically malicious, nor is feeding a puppy to a turtle intrinsically malicious. A distinction *can* be made under the related law on [torturing a companion animal](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title25/T25CH35/SECT25-3504A/) (an extension of the original anti\\-cruelty law):\n\n> A person is guilty of the offense of torturing a companion animal if\n>  he tortures a companion animal as defined in this chapter.\n\nwhere \"companion animal\" is defined as \n\n> those animals solely kept as pets and not used as production animals,\n>  as defined in this section, including, but not limited to, domestic\n>  dogs, domestic cats, rabbits, companion birds, and other animals.\n\nThis gives a basis for distinguishing feeder rats from feeder puppies.\nTorture is then defined as\n\n> the intentional, knowing and willful infliction of unjustifiable and\n>  extreme or prolonged pain, mutilation or maiming done for the purpose\n>  of causing suffering. \"Torture\" shall not mean or include acts of\n>  omission or of neglect nor acts committed unintentionally or by\n>  accident. \"Torture\" also shall not mean or include normal or legal\n>  practices as provided in section [25\\-3514](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title25/T25CH35/SECT25-3514/), Idaho Code.\n\nAnd thus it is not clear that feeding an animal to a turtle counts, since the purpose is to feed the turtle, not to cause suffering. The exceptions spelled out in 25\\-3514 might be applicable, but there are not *clearly* applicable. One exception is \"The humane slaughter of any animal normally and commonly raised as food, for production of fiber or equines\" \u2013 perhaps using an animal as feed for another animal can be \"humane slaughter\", perhaps rats are \"normally and commonly\" raised as food, unlike dogs.\n\nIt is not currently against federal law to slaughter cats and dogs for meat, but there is a [bill in Congress](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1406?r=1) which would make it so.

The provided information indicates that laws often distinguish between animals kept as pets and those raised for food or other purposes. For example, in some jurisdictions, there are specific protections for \"companion animals\" or \"pet animals,\" which can include various species. The legality also depends on whether the action is considered part of accepted animal husbandry practices or necessary for feeding. While there may be more protections for certain species like dogs and cats in some areas, the overarching principle in many animal cruelty laws is based on the animal's use and classification rather than species alone. Options A and D are incorrect as they present extreme positions not supported by the information given.

The board receives the hearing officer's report and denies the applicant again, without giving any reason.\n\nAssuming all of the above is permitted by statute, does anybody see a due process problem? Can anyone point to any specific case law? To me it looks awfully close to a sham hearing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The clause \"assuming all of the above is permitted by statute\" introduces an invalid assumption. \"Permitted by the statute\" is (a) a question of legal interpretation and (b) only a part of the \"due process\" question.\n\nIn US law, \"due process\" means \"follows the law\". One source of law is the constitution (state or US). A second is a statute. A third is regulations that are statutorily authorized. A fourth is case law. If you don't follow the law, you have a due process problem. The government has to follow fair legal procedures in depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. If it doesn't, you have a procedural due process problem, and that could figure into a lawsuit (then the courts will decide if your claim is correct). [Here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process) is a bit of a guide.\n\nThe facts as stated to not show that the required fundamental fairness was omitted or that the law was not followed. If the law obligates the board to accept the judgment of an external reviewer, then there has been a violation of due process \u2013 there is no chance that there is any such requirement. If the board is legally required to state a reason for denying an appeal and they fail to do so, then they have not followed the law.\n\nThere is also \"substantive due process\", which involves fundamental rights. The right to ply your trade is a fundamental right \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\", but the Commerce Clause (in your favorite state) also gives the government the right to regulate businesses, so there is a balancing act that has to be performed. In this case, a board cannot just say \"we don't want this guy working in our state because we don't like his face\", so they would have to have a reason to deny the person a license. It might take a lawsuit to get them to reveal that reason, and the lawsuit would resolve the question of whether the government followed the law.\n\n[This article](https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/2346/73994/13_7TexTechAdminLJ205%282006%29.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) touches on Due Process concerns w.r.t. occupational licensing in Texas, and [Patel v.

Turns out, cell phones and home computers affect interstate commerce. So the forbidden acts are delimited by expressions like \"having knowingly accessed a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access\", \"intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access\" or \"knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value\". Notice that the law is stated in terms of authorization to access, and not \"cracking passwords\". Similarly, [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2701](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2701) uses phrases like \"accesses without authorization\". Each state has its own laws: in Washington, [RCW 9A.52\\.110\\-130](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.52.110) identifies forbidden acts via phrases like \"without authorization, intentionally gains access\".\n\nThe closest I can find that comes to a law that might imaginably have some bearing on \"password cracking\" is [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1029](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1029) which prohibits uses of \"counterfeit access devices\". An \"access device\" is defined in para (e) as \"any ...means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money...\" (there is the usual attempt at an exhaustive listing behind the ellipses). A password cracker would then be an access device since it along with a user interface to a system allows one to access the system and thus the internet of things. A counterfeit password cracker would be e.g. one manufactured by BlackhatHackersoft which passes itself off as one manufactured by WhitehatHackersoft.\n\nHowever: 18 USC 1029 specifically says \"knowingly *and with intent to defraud* produces, uses, or traffics in one or more counterfeit access devices\", and the intent that you describe is *not* to defraud. If you want a paid analysis by a professional, you can hire an attorney. My view is that if the police were to come after you, that would be an abuse of law, because the law does not prohibit taking reasonable steps to select a safe password (something like \"CorrectHorseBatteryStaple\", which I hear is now just behind \"password\" in use as a password).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to US law, which of the following actions would most likely be considered illegal when interacting with a smartphone's Wi-Fi hotspot?\n\nA) Using a password cracker to test the strength of your own Wi-Fi hotspot password for security purposes\nB) Accessing your father's smartphone Wi-Fi hotspot without his permission\nC) Attempting to crack the Wi-Fi password of your neighbor's hotspot out of curiosity\nD) Using a counterfeit password cracking tool to test your own Wi-Fi security, with no intent to defraud\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) This is likely legal as you are testing your own device for security purposes with no malicious intent.\nB) This is the correct answer as it involves accessing a device without authorization, which is explicitly forbidden under US law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030).\nC) While this could be illegal, the question asks for the \"most likely\" illegal action. Since B involves a more direct violation of accessing without authorization, it's a stronger candidate.\nD) The law specifically mentions \"intent to defraud\" when discussing counterfeit access devices. Without this intent, using a counterfeit tool on your own device is less likely to be considered illegal than unauthorized access of another's device."}}
