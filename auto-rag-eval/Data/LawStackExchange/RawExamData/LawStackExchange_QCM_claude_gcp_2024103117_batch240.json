We have explicitly said we do not authorize anyone entering our apartment without one of us being present, but this caused me to re\\-read parts of our contract related to this.\n\nThe bit I found interesting is this (emphasis mine):\n\n> To allow the Property **to be viewed** by prior mutually acceptable\n>  appointment, at reasonable times, during normal working hours and at\n>  weekends, and upon the Tenant being given at least 24 hours\u2019 notice in\n>  writing, following a request by any person who is (or is acting on\n>  behalf of) the Landlord or the Agent and who is accompanying a\n>  prospective purchaser or tenant of the Property.\n\nThe reason I found this phrasing strange is the fact a clause just above it (related to conducting repairs) specifically uses the word \"enter\":\n\n> To allow the Landlord, the Agent, any Superior Landlord, his agent,\n>  professional advisers, or authorised contractors to **enter the Property**\n>  with or without workmen and with all necessary equipment. \\[...]\n\n* Is there any difference between \"view\\[ing the Property]\" and \"enter\\[ing] the Property\" in this case? Or, more directly, why would they use different wording in two adjacent clauses?\n* The only requirement for a viewing seems to be a \"prior mutually acceptable appointment\" and, unlike the clause about repairs, it includes no subclauses related to when we are *required* to allow someone to enter.

It would encompass all the normal things that this involves so it goes beyond merely looking at it \\- pest inspections, building inspections, valuations etc would all be involved.\n\nYes, you are missing something: you have an obligation under the contract to act reasonably \\- this is implicit in every contract, however, it *can* be explicitly excluded.

Option B is incorrect because the documentation does not suggest that \"viewing\" allows for more extensive inspections than \"entering\" - this is speculation without legal basis. Option C is too extreme, as the contract specifies viewings must be by \"mutually acceptable appointment.\" Option D is correct because, as stated in the answer, there is an implicit obligation in every contract for parties to act reasonably, unless explicitly excluded.

Your concern is not whether you are responsible, but are you liable? It depends on the details of your arrangement with the client. If you have a contract with them that specifies that you will keep their stuff secure against attacks and that you will make regular backups, then you probably are liable. If the contract says that the client is responsible for backups and security, they you probably aren't liable.

From your description it is doubtful that the contract truly expired at the end of the first year. It is valid for a contract to encompass multiple phases with different provisions specific to each phase.\n\nProviding that \"*\\[a]fter the first year the employee may continue working for the company, until terminated, as an at will employee*\" is different from expiration of the contract at the end of the first year. The contract simply outlined what happens before and after that point in time. The employer's allegation that the contract expired at the end of the first year is inconsistent with outlining in that same contract the nature of the parties' continued relation after the first year. Said nature of the employment relation should have been outlined in a separate contract in order to preempt an interpretation of there being one same/ongoing contract.\n\nThe employer's allegation is vague and untenable also in a scenario where the employer terminates the employee within the first year. The employer's allegation seemingly implies that the employee's deadline for arbitration proceedings expires at the end of the first year.

The fact that the contract specifies conditions for at-will employment after the initial term suggests that certain elements of the contract, including the termination protocol and potentially the arbitration clause, were intended to continue beyond the first year. The employer's claim that the entire contract expired after one year is inconsistent with the contract's own provisions for continued employment.

As explained in the passage, when a trust is created by a will and becomes effective only upon the testator's death, it is not possible to deduce any contract between the testator and the trustee.

For example, the police may only have evidence of a single incident of harassment but may think that if they wait and watch that they may get evidence of extortion or attempted murder.\n* There is a concern that prosecuting immediately would lead to community uproar that would undermine community safety or impair police operations generally. In the same vein, public opinion might produce a tainted or unfavorable jury if charges were pressed now, but the jury might be less likely to have pre\\-existing opinions or to consider the case a hot button issue once publicity around an incident has died off.\n* The police may intentionally be exercising discretion not to press charges because it seems unjust to do so, or the perpetrator had some justification, or otherwise deserves a second chance.\n* Pre\\-charge negotiations might be ongoing between prosecutors and defense counsel.\n* The perpetrator already faces more serious charges that are highly likely to result in his incarceration and the new charges would be served concurrently and not add to his sentence, so pressing charges is not a priority.\n* There are doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence or there is a belief that more evidence may be obtained soon (and nobody bothers to check back and try to press the case when that potential lead doesn't pan out).\n* A modest delay in pressing charges for any number of reasons causes a witness to become unavailable or evidence to be lost.\n\nGenerally speaking, law enforcement has wide discretion to decide which cases to focus on and try to have prosecuted, and which cases the leave be.

If you actually have to deal with this problem, skip to the end.)\n\nAmerican defamation law is extraordinarily weak (relative to Europe) thanks to [*New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan), which established the actual malice standard (you're only liable for defamation against a public figure if you knowingly published false information or wrote with \"reckless disregard for the truth,\" which basically means you didn't care whether it was true). American courts are loath to interfere with freedom of speech or of the press just to make some politician happy. This suggests to me that a libel\\-in\\-fiction claim would be a long shot to begin with. Interestingly, [we also have specific protection against foreign libel judgments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPEECH_Act), so I'll just be focusing on American law.\n\nOn the other hand, [it does happen](http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/law-order-faces-a-case-of-libel-in-fiction) (NB: In New York, the \"State Supreme Court\" is the *lowest* court in the state). For our purposes, here is the most relevant paragraph:\n\n> Mr. Batra filed his lawsuit under a doctrine known as libel\\-in\\-fiction. To win his case, he must demonstrate that the identities of the real and fictional characters \u201cmust be so complete that the defamatory material\u201d becomes a \u201cplausible aspect\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s real life, Justice Shafer wrote in her ruling, quoting case law.\n\nIt seems to me that a composite character could not pass that test. But it's less clear to me that this standard is in use across the entire US (what case is the judge quoting from?). And frankly, you don't really want to be in court arguing over this sort of thing unless you're very clearly in the right. In this case, NBC has already lost, because they now need to go through discovery and probably a full trial. That's expensive.

This would imply that all citizens are equally injured by the misconduct, so long as they were under the official\u2019s jurisdiction. In the case of the state Port Authority, this means every New Jersey citizen.\n\nIf, alternatively, the specific crimes underlying the misconduct is what's most important, then only a select few citizens would be substantially injured by it. The crime was mainly the extortion of United Airlines for a custom weekly flight in exchange for a new hangar at Newark International Airport; implying a very small percentage of NJ citizens were personally injured.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n* Does the official misconduct statute refer to the underlying criminal activities or simply \"the act of misconduct\"? (This is [somewhat answered](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/18604/4295) in the original question)\n* Given the context of a probable cause determination as brought forth by a citizen complaint.... Where in these two rules (or elsewhere) is \"proximity\" defined as a characteristic that should be a deciding factor for standing?\n\nNote that [Common Law was abolished](http://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2013/title-2c/section-2c-1-5/) in New Jersey [in 1979](http://www.hoffmandimuzio.com/blog/crime-and-punishment-how-new-jersey-defines-the-seriousness-of-crimes-and-their-penalties/).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your questions are premised on two assumptions:\n\n1. \"all citizens are equally injured by the misconduct, so long as they were under the official\u2019s jurisdiction\", and\n2. \"Common Law was abolished in New Jersey in 1979\"\n\n**These are both *false*!**\n\n**False assumption 1: equal damage**\n\nThe onus is on the plaintiff or complainant to prove to the court that they have standing to bring their claim. That is that they have (or will be) sufficiently damaged by the wrongful act that the court should spend its time hearing their claim.\n\nWe will use the referenced case as an example, as I understand it the official corruptly received a benefit in the form of the creation of a new air route in order to permit United Airlines to build a hanger at Newark Airport. \n\nIt should be obvious on the face of it that United Airlines and Newark Airport were both affected more than \"all citizens\". The Architects, Engineers and Construction workers who were delayed in working on the hanger were also more affected. All of these people word have a greater chance of having [standing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_(law)) then a generic citizen.\n\nNow, some citizens of New Jersey, specifically those who took advantage of the new air route (including but not limited to the corrupt official) *benefited* from the misconduct: they would not have standing as they were not damaged. \n\nThat is not to say that a broad class of people who are each individually affected slightly but as a group are substantially affected cannot have standing.

This common law crime can trace its roots back to the thirteenth century and even earlier into Anglo\\-Saxon law \\- the King didn't make it illegal, it just was, and the courts decided what the punishment should be (death usually). \n\nIn 1979, the New Jersey legislature decided to codify their crimes and *as a starting point* they abolished all the common law crimes (not just murder) and wrote down, nice and succinctly, what a murder is , what defenses there are for doing it and what the punishment should be. Now doubt this was informed by the 700 years of common law history about that crime and the current state of case law around it but it probably also simplified and streamlined the law (we hope).\n\n**The abolition of common law crimes has *zero* impact on the common law of standing.**", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In New Jersey, which of the following statements is true regarding common law and standing in legal cases?\n\nA) Common law was entirely abolished in New Jersey in 1979, including all aspects of torts, contracts, and standing.\n\nB) Common law crimes were abolished, but common law principles still apply to civil matters and concepts like standing.\n\nC) The abolition of common law crimes directly impacted the rules of standing, making it impossible for citizens to bring complaints against public officials.\n\nD) All citizens are equally injured by official misconduct and thus have equal standing to bring complaints, regardless of their proximity to the alleged crime.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

This is the same kind of ownership you have over a book you buy at the book store. Among other things, the first sale doctrine would apply to your copy of the software.

But you do not own the copy of the software, you merely have purchased a license to use it, which may be revocable under specified circumstances.\n\nThis is different from the law in the case of a book. Why you buy a book, you own a copy of the book, although you do **not** own the copyright to the book, and may not make additional copies.\n\nThe license model was adopted by commercial software distributors for several reasons, but largely to avoid the \"first sale doctrine\". When you buy a copy of a copyrighted work, you have the right (under US law at least) to lend, rent, sell, or give\\-away that copy. You do not need the permission of the copyright holder to do any of these. Those in the commercial software business did not want customers to be able to do those things legally. By making the software subject to a license, which is a contract, they could write that license to restrict or prohibit those rights. \n\nSellers also wanted to prohibit reverse engineering of the software, and to restrict use of the software. (For example, to limit the user to installing it on a single computer.)\n\nThere was at first much dispute over the enforcability of such license agreements.

For example, if they went to a movie together hand in hand and a cop saw them maybe in the theater lobby all cuddly, could he do anything about them like ask her age?\n\nSuppose they couldn't wait and \"cheated\" 1 day before they were married. Could the man go to prison for that but if he had waited until his wedding night he would be fine? Something doesn't seem quite right here. They might be saying a married minor CAN give consent but an unmarried one cannot. But what if they are engaged and only a short time away from marriage. Why is there no stipulation in the law for that? What if they find out later they are not sexually compatible then it is \"too late\". Allowing the \"test drive\" could help solve that problem.

The addition of the non-disclosure agreement in the settlement changes the nature of the offer, making it about more than just monetary compensation. Joe's refusal doesn't automatically indicate bad faith or a frivolous lawsuit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because refusing a settlement offer does not make a lawsuit frivolous by default.

Does it basically give the parties the \"optionality\" of later changing their minds with regard to the fairness and reasonableness of the restrictions laid out in section 13?\n\nNo. When a part or whole of a contract is found to be void, it means that the clauses in the contract have been contested in a court of law, and the court has found those clauses to be contrary to the law and that the parties will be restored as if the contract or clauses had never existed. Note that something being void is legally distinct from it being unenforceable, which means that the clauses will be considered to have existed, but that the courts will not provide a remedy for their violation. That decision will be made by the judge who oversees the proceedings, not by the parties to the contract.\n\n> Regarding the 2nd highlighted part. I simply cannot understand it. Could someone translate it in plain English, please?\n\nThe part that you emphasized needs to be read in the context of the whole second half of the clause, like this:\n\n> and **if** by deleting part of the wording or substituting a shorter period of time, different limits and/or a more restricted range of activities than those set out in this clause 13 it will not be void, **then** such restrictions will apply with such deletions or modifications as may be necessary to make them valid and effective.\n\nThe phrase beginning with \"if\" is conditional, meaning that the conditions specified, that being the existence of different restrictions which would not be void under the law, must be present in order for the second phrase, beginning with \"then\" to take effect. This second phrase would mean that the contract would then change to include restrictions that did not make the clauses void.\n\nThe clause could be written in plain English like this:\n\n> If the clauses in this contract are found to be void, and if the terms of those clauses can be changed so that they are no longer void, then they will be changed so that the clauses are no longer void.\n\nTake note that this clause would probably not be enforceable anyway, due to the fact that it would (1\\) force the courts to define the new terms and decide that they are fair, a decision which, even if you could force the court to do that (and you can't), can always be appealed to the next highest court up to the Supreme Court, potentially taking years of work and massive expense, and (2\\) you would be agreeing to a change in contract, the terms of which are completely unknowable to you, so how could you consent to them?", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a service agreement, a clause states that if any restrictions are found to be void as going beyond what is fair and reasonable, and if by modifying the wording or terms the clause would not be void, then such restrictions will apply with necessary modifications.

This type of clause, often called a \"blue pencil\" or \"severability\" clause, aims to preserve the intent of the restrictions even if a court finds them overly broad.

All the elements of a legally binding contract are met:\n\n1\\. Offer\n---------\n\nThe offer letter from the government body.\n\n2\\. Acceptance\n--------------\n\nSelf\\-evident in your question. The successful bidder communicated that it had accepted the offer from the government body.\n\n3\\. Consideration\n-----------------\n\nOrdinarily, this would be the deposit. In this case, since the deposit was never sent, the consideration is both the *promise* (from the bidder) to submit the deposit and the *counter promise* (from the government party) to give whatever the contract stipulates the bidder will get from the government party.\n\n4\\. Intent to create legal relations\n------------------------------------\n\nNot evidenced in the question, but we can generally assume this based on the evidence that both sides are commercial parties.\n\n> Therefore, can the government body 'rescind' the offer and argue that there was no contract to begin with because there was no 'acceptance'?\n\nNo. The offer was accepted by the bidder so there was 'acceptance', and all the other elements of the contract stand too (there was consideration, etc.).\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe bidder likely breached the terms of the contract. This could potentially be a repudiatory breach allowing the government body to choose to end the contract if they wanted (by \"withdrawing\"). At the very least, the government body would be entitled to sue the bidder for breaching the terms, but there is no legal position of \"the contract doesn't exist\" from my perspective.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A government agency issues an offer letter to the successful bidder of a contract, requiring a 50% deposit by a specified date.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal status of this situation?\n\nA) No contract was formed because the bidder's failure to pay the deposit means there was no valid acceptance.\n\nB) A contract was formed, but the government can rescind it without consequences due to the bidder's non-performance.\n\nC) A contract was formed, and the government's withdrawal constitutes a breach of contract.\n\nD) A contract was formed, and the bidder's failure to pay the deposit likely constitutes a breach, potentially allowing the government to terminate the contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because a valid contract was formed when the bidder communicated acceptance of the offer. The failure to pay the deposit does not negate the contract's existence but rather constitutes a likely breach of the contract terms by the bidder. This breach may give the government the right to terminate the contract, depending on the specific terms and the materiality of the breach. Options A and B are incorrect because they assume no contract was formed or that the government can unilaterally rescind without consequences, which is not accurate given the presence of all elements of a valid contract (offer, acceptance, consideration, and intent). Option C is incorrect because the government's withdrawal, if in response to the bidder's breach, would not necessarily constitute a breach on the government's part, but rather could be a justified termination of the contract."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/898/can-you-get-a-restraining-order-without-cause", "docs_id": 898, "title": "Can you get a restraining order without cause?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Do you have to have some type of justified reason to get a restraining order?

Absent that context \\& detail, it is impossible to come up with statutory or case law that addresses a concern so broad.\n\nThe excerpts of definitions included in your post do not lead to inconsistencies.

The \"electoral voting\" law regarding voting of presidential electors is [ARS 16\\-212](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/16/00212.htm). First,\n\n> On the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, 1956, and\n> quadrennially thereafter, there shall be elected a number of\n> presidential electors equal to the number of United States senators\n> and representatives in Congress from this state.\n\nSecond,\n\n> After the secretary of state issues the statewide canvass containing\n> the results of a presidential election, the presidential electors of\n> this state shall cast their electoral college votes for the candidate\n> for president and the candidate for vice president who jointly\n> received the highest number of votes in this state as prescribed in\n> the canvass.\n\nFinally,\n\n> A presidential elector who knowingly refuses to cast that elector's\n> electoral college vote as prescribed in subsection B of this section\n> is no longer eligible to hold the office of presidential elector and\n> that office is deemed and declared vacant by operation of law. The\n> chairperson of the state committee of the political party represented\n> by that elector shall appoint a person who is otherwise qualified to\n> be a presidential elector. The replacement presidential elector shall\n> cast the elector's electoral college vote as prescribed by this\n> section. Notwithstanding section [16\\-344](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/16/00344.htm) and any other statute, the\n> nomination paper and affidavit of qualification of the replacement\n> presidential elector may be completed and filed with the secretary of\n> state as soon as is practicable after the presidential elector's\n> appointment.\n\nThere is no provision for legislative \"certification\" and no authority to override the procedure set down in law.\nThe appointment statute (344\\) gives sole discretion to the state party chairmen to appoint that party's electors:\n\n> The chairman of the state committee of a political party that is\n> qualified for representation on an official party ballot at the\n> primary election and accorded a column on the general election ballot\n> shall appoint candidates for the office of presidential elector equal\n> to the number of United States senators and representatives in\n> Congress from this state and shall file for each candidate with the\n> secretary of state, not more than ten days after the primary election,\n> by 5:00 p.m. on the last day for filing:\n\nName, residence and postal address and an affadavit of residence in the state are needed. Again, there is no provision for \"certification\" by the state legislature. The certification that takes place is that the electors sign the presidential elector ballot certificate of vote, e.g. [Arizona 2016](https://www.archives.gov/files/electoral-college/2016/vote-arizona.pdf), which simply notes that the electors have been \"duly elected\". In general, Arizona law does not require \"certification\" of any election. Pennsylvania law on the election of electors ([25 PS 2878](https://govt.westlaw.com/pac/Document/NE7FF6540343011DA8A989F4EECDB8638?transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29#co_anchor_I5D4CE310796111EAB11AFBEDA38AC9EF)) similarly does not give the legislature any veto power over the electoral process. The law on the [voting of the electors](https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-25-ps-elections-electoral-districts/pa-st-sect-25-3191.html) also does not provide for any legislative intervention.\n\nThis does not mean that the legislatures cannot pass an act ceremonially \"de\\-certifying\" or invalidating the 2020 election in general, or the nominations of one or both parties.

The process is governed by existing state laws, which typically involve the secretary of state and party officials. For example, in Arizona, the law specifies that electors are appointed by the chairmen of state political parties, and the secretary of state issues the statewide canvass containing election results. The electors then cast their votes based on the candidate who received the highest number of votes in the state. There is no provision for legislative \"certification\" or veto power over the electoral process in the states mentioned (Arizona and Pennsylvania).

Is it a civil contract whose parties are allowed to agree (even retroactively) than an NDA is in place? Or could doing so (backdating such a document) be considered fraud, forgery, or anything illegal, or even for some reason ethically or morally wrong?\n\nIt seems to me that it might be legal (assuming that I as the employee were willing to sign it) because as an employee I'd assume that some NDA was in place even if haven't signed one (so it's as if the agreement or meeting of minds was in place even before it was documented).\n\nOn the other hand it also appears to be creating a false document, so, I don't know.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally you can back\\-date the effective date of a contract. Texas does not have any specific laws that prohibit it and in contracts law, this concept is called the \"relation back\" theory of contract effectiveness. *[See Grubb \\& Ellis Co. v. Bradley Real Est. Trust](http://www.leagle.com/decision/19901959909F2d1050_11777/GRUBB%20&%20ELLIS%20CO.%20v.%20BRADLEY%20REAL%20ESTATE%20TRUST)*, 909 F.2d 1050, 1054 (7th Cir. 1990\\) for an explanation that back dating violates no general contract law principles and is \"determined by the intent of the parties as deduced from the instrument itself.\"\n\nAside from the obvious issues where someone is back\\-dating a contract to commit some type of fraud, back\\-dating raises a whole host of unforeseen consequences with regards to a party's performance under the contract as well as the rights of third parties.\n\nThe best practice is to make it clear that the effective date and the execution date are different. This avoids confusion and ambiguity that could call the enforceability of the contract into question.\n\nSome of the issues that arise when back\\-dating a NDA are:\n\n* **Liability for disclosures** the employee made between the effective date and when the contract is executed/signed. This is particularly troublesome if the NDA provides for liquidated damages or imposes other penalties.\n* If the effective date and execution date are not clear, there **might not be a \u201cmeeting of the minds.\u201d** (The essential elements of a contract are offer, acceptance, consideration, and meeting of the minds.) This is a problem for the employer more than the employee.\n* **Liability to third parties**. Say an employer licensed some technology from a third party and everyone working on the project was required to sign NDAs. Employer could be on the hook here. Also, the employer and employee could both be in trouble if they were back\\-dating the contract to trick the third party into thinking it had been signed all along.

According to the information provided, backdating contracts, including NDAs, is generally legal under the \"relation back\" theory of contract effectiveness.

However, since the ToS explicitly say personal AND non\\-commercial use, I'm not 100% sure my use of a Lure Module for the purpose stated above would qualify as acceptable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is ample reason to conclude that \"non\\-commercial\" would include a church, as well as advocating a political cause or candidate. The hard part of \"personal\". In the context of (Canadian) bankruptcy law, it [can mean \"non\\-business use\"](http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/P/PersonalUse.aspx); in the context of \"[personal use property](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personaluseproperty.asp)\", it can be \"A type of property that an individual does not use for business purposes or hold as an investment. In other words, property that an individual owns for personal enjoyment\". US tax law takes \"personal purposes\" to refer to non\\-business purposes. But in the [context of copyright](http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1218&context=articles) (especially music downloading / copying), it is taken to refer to the use of or by an individual. Distributing free copies of a protected work does not get legally sanctioned due to the copying being non\\-commercial. \n\nThe alternative term \"private\" is much clearer, in identifying \"just you\", but is probably avoided in this kind of context so as to avoid the wrong inference that you can only play Pokemon in the privacy of your own home. So the slightly less clear term \"personal\" is used instead of \"private\" especially in copyright\\-related contexts. \"Personal\" and \"private\" are not exactly the same, but when it's about use, I don't see any difference, and I think there is no question that use to attract to a church or political candidate is not \"private\", it is public.\n\nSince the license does not define \"your own personal purposes\" and there is not an existing crystal\\-clear definition of \"personal purposes\", the phrase could be given its \"[ordinary (plain) meaning](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3867&context=flr)\". Of course, plain meaning has to give way to contractual intent, so we have to figure out what the parties intended. Except, you don't have a contract with Niantic, but still, plain meaning surely has some place in the law of licenses. At this point, in a lawsuit, both sides would hire an expert witness like a linguist or English teacher to make the case that a church or other non\\-commercial non\\-private use is / is not included in the meaning of \"personal purpose\". A silly argument could be made to the effect that if you personally have an interest in doing something then it is a personal purpose (if specifically commercial, it would be precluded by the term \"noncommercial\"). What makes this silly is that everybody does things for personal purposes (even acting in a way that benefits others, since you do so for the personal reason that you *should* do so), and thus \"personal\" would not mean anything. That is, \"personal purposes\" does not mean \"whatever motivation or interest you personally have\".\n\nYou can also gain a certain understanding of what \"personal purposes\" means by looking at similar licenses. In the context of academic publishing, authors are typically granted license to copy \"for personal, professional, or teaching purposes\". Professional purposes and teaching purposes are things that the person has an interest in, so by mentioning these things separately, we must conclude that \"teaching\" is not a \"personal purpose\". And so: I would conclude that a court could find that using a product to support a political campaign, philosophy, or religion, is a \"public\" purpose, not a \"personal\" purpose.\n\nAt the same time, at least as I understand it, a lure module is a thing that others besides yourself personally can see (I admit, I don't go), which implies that the purpose of the thing is not entirely private. In addition, there is a fair amount of buzz out there about how a lure could be good for business, which is (1\\) clearly in contradiction of the license terms and (2\\) clearly a golden opportunity for Niantic, perhaps in a few weeks after everybody gets hooked and then they will offer non\\-personal licenses. Their [license terms](https://www.nianticlabs.com/terms/pokemongo/en) also say that you will not \"use the Services or Content, or any portion thereof, for any commercial purpose or *for the benefit of any third party* or in a manner not permitted by these Terms\". I would say that that definitively says \"No don't do it\", and it also means that you can't be nice to a neighbor.

However, protection is not limited to businesses headquartered in the country of registration. Firms doing business internationally often register a trademark in multiple countries, sometimes very many countries. It is possible that \"Le Cordon Bleu\" was registered in Australia. (Indeed it turns out to be so registered, see below.)\n\nAlso, in some countries a trademark can be protected to a degree merely by use, without any registration. That is true in the US. I have not yet checked if it is true in Australia. If the plaintiff's mark was in actual use in Australia, that might be enough to get them a favorable trademark decision there. It will be Australian law that will be relevant here, not really international law.\n\nIt seems that the school \"Le Cordon Bleu\" objected to a restaurant called called \"Gordon Bleu\". That sounds to me similar enough that I think a US court might well award damages and/or issue an injunction, depending on the detailed facts, and the dates of usage (first usage usually wins).\n\nThe news story does not give the formal name of the case. Without the opinion or other case documents I cannot tell just what happened or on what legal basis in this specific case.

That seems like an uphill battle to avoid a hung jury. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is called prosecutorial discretion and in the U.S. Legal system, the Prosecutor can choose to present any case of any crime they wish. It is not Jury Nullification, in that it doesn't overturn a law, but rather, gives the prosecutor a way to not bring certain criminal charges to court. The general guiding system is that the prosecutor believes that they cannot secure a guilty verdict with the evidence on hand (and the Prosecutor is intentially dealt the weaker hand in U.S. jurisprudence. The Prosecutor must prove that it happened in exactly the one way that makes it criminal, while the defense merely has to prove it could have happened in a way that was not criminal, but need not offer a specific explanation (there was a famous child murder case in Florida in which the defendant had made numerous contradictory statements as to the nature of her actions up untill the child's body was found at various points in the lifecycle of the case (which was in the public eye for almost four years). When it went to the jury, the conclusion was that they basically, the defense likely had a significant role to play, but the prosecution's charges could not be proven with evidence presented. Scotland actually offers a third option for this situation where the jury can find \"Not Proven\" in addition to \"Guilty\" or \"Not Guilty\" which basically means they tend to agree with the prosecutor, but that they cannot convict because the evidence doesn't fully support. Or as one Scotsman describe's the intent of not prove, it means \"You didn't do it, and you better not do it again!\".).\n\nBecause the prosecutor is a taxpayer funded office and an elected office, they are answerable to local public opinion and as such, will face scrutiny for bring a shakey case both from the people who believe the guy didn't do it, and the people who think that the prosecutor shouldn't have taken this case as they knew it was not a slam dunk and thus they were wasting taxpayer money (trials cost money) and citizens time (a jury is drawn from local election registry... so anyone who is deciding a can vote on the prosecutor's future employment).\n\nAnother reason is that once a jury is empaneled, the Prosecution doesn't get a do over. The Constitution Bans double jeopardy for criminal cases, which effectively means that if new evidence is uncovered after a not guilty verdict, then the defense got away with the crime (essentially, it means only the Defense can initiate the appeals process in a criminal case. Given that no one would do that if new incriminating evidence is found, the Prosecution can't appeal the decision.). It's not a violation to not press the charges until more incriminating evidence is found, so long as it's under the statute of limitations for the crime, so they can play the long game.\n\nIt could also be entirely politically motivated, but if it's obviously political, then the it could backfire. Take a look at the Chicago prosecutor's office and the outrage from many people of many different political thoughts when she let off Jessie Smollett for falsely reporting a crime. It's really bad for a prosecutor when you lose the support of local police, who are essentially the guys who they represent in their cases.\n\nJury Nullification is a different event and not something the prosecution can do. Jury Nullification is when the jury comes to the conclusion that the defendant did in fact commit the crime but the law that was violated should not have existed in such a way that given this specific case they found guilt. In effect, it is not guilt by reason of a law we disagree with, and thus the state shouldn't have prosecuted in this case not because he didn't do it, but because it shouldn't have been a crime if he did. It doesn't necessarily mean the law is repealed or changed, but occasionally it can (for example, a man is on trial for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family. The jury concludes that yes, he did take bread without paying for it, but that it wasn't taken for profit purposes as he had no intent to resell it and only stole that which he needed to keep himself and his dependents alive and the prosecution shouldn't have gone after this guy like it they did. There could be some case law that now theft doesn't include stealing basic necessities, or the prosector will realize the jury won't convict and let it go as pressing the matter will waste resources). In other aspects it could be that the law really was egrigious (for example, Baltimore City has a law banning ownership of parrots as pets. No one really knows why and no one gets arrested on it, but if they did, the Jury could say \"this law is stupid\" and let the guy go because a parrot ban serves no specific purpose would likely render the law effectively repealed. Ironically, many a bizarre law in Common Law Jurisdictions are created in this manner. The U.S. can create laws through legal preciseness. For example, under Flordia Law, an alligator counts as a deadly weapon for the purposes of the law... but this came about because someone through a baby alligator at someone and Assault with Deadly Weapon was charged and a judge ruled that the alligator was used as a weapon and they are deadly. It wasn't written by the state legislature because they had nothing better to do then argue about alligators counting as weapons.).\n\nThis is one of the reasons why judges will not allow either side to make any mention of Jury nullification during the case. It's also why, in the United States, cases likely to result in a capital punishment sentance can not have a jurist empaneled who is opposed to the death penalty (because sentancing only comes after guilt is found, the jury rarely has any say in the matter beyond the verdict and in the interest of justice, the court does not want a not guilty verdict or a hung trial based on someone's political position, not the merits of the case. In the case that the jury does affect the outcome, the question is only posed after they find the man guilty. It is illegal for Captial sentences to be mandatory, but it is legal if the sentence is found to be warranted based on aggravating and mitigating factors specific to the events of a specific case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A prosecutor is considering whether to file charges against a motorist who ran a motorcycle off the road after the motorcyclist kicked the car's passenger door. Public opinion on social media is evenly divided between those who view it as self-defense and those who see it as assault with a deadly weapon. Which of the following best describes the concept that allows the prosecutor to consider public opinion and other factors when deciding whether to file charges?\n\nA) Jury nullification\nB) Double jeopardy\nC) Prosecutorial discretion\nD) Statute of limitations\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Prosecutorial discretion is the concept that allows prosecutors to decide whether to bring criminal charges, what charges to bring, and how to pursue a case. This discretion permits prosecutors to consider various factors, including the strength of evidence, likelihood of conviction, resource allocation, and public opinion. In this scenario, the prosecutor could weigh the divided public opinion and potential difficulty in securing a conviction when deciding whether to file charges.\n\nJury nullification (A) is incorrect because it refers to a jury's decision to acquit a defendant despite clear evidence of guilt, usually because they disagree with the law itself. This is a jury action, not a prosecutorial one.\n\nDouble jeopardy (B) is not relevant here, as it protects individuals from being tried twice for the same crime after an acquittal.\n\nStatute of limitations (D) relates to the time limit for bringing charges after a crime is committed, which is not the focus of this scenario."}}
