The \u201cdata controller\u201d of a processing activity is responsible for GDPR compliance. A hosting service is a processor but not a controller with respect to the hosted websites. A processor becomes GDPR\\-compliant by only processing personal data as instructed by the controller.\n\nMore specifically:\n\n* Controller is whoever participates in determining the purposes and means of processing. There can be more than one data controller for an activity.\n* Controllers can outsource processing activities to a \u201cdata processor\u201d. Per Art 28 GDPR, there must be a contract that requires the processor to only use the data as instructed by the controller, never for the processors' own purposes. The processor's duty is primarily to the controller, not to the data subjects.\n\nThe data processor cannot make decisions about the lawfulness of processing, and cannot respond to data subject requests unless instructed to do so by the controller.\n* Within the scope of such outsourcing, the data processor can determine some non\\-essential means of processing without becoming a controller as well.\n\nThe processor can also prepare a standardized service where a lot of decisions are made up front by the processor. But the client would still be the controller because the client made the decision to use that standardized service with all the features it entails. In this context, a standardized service could e.g. be a hosting contract that was not negotiated individually. This concept of a standardized service does not originate from the GDPR, but was used by the EDPB to explain responsibilities in a cloud computing context.\n\nA hosting provider would still be controller with respect to its own website and activities like billing, but will typically act only as a data processor with respect to the client's websites.\n\nRecommended further reading: [EDPB Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-072020-concepts-controller-and-processor-gdpr_en)\n\nA lot of services advertise that they are \u201cGDPR compliant\u201d. But data processors have drastically simplified compliance responsibilities. Thus, using a GDPR\\-compliant service does not imply that the use of this service would be GDPR\\-compliant as well.\n\nIf it helps to think about this, consider that the GDPR was not created to torpedo the EU IT industry. If a processor were to only accept GDPR\\-compliant clients, this would have prevented EU companies from serving many non\\-EU clients. This would not have been in the EU's interest. Instead, the GDPR attempts to simplify compliance for both EU and non\\-EU companies \u2013 the goal is simplified data flows. This was necessary because before the GDPR, every EU member state had its own set of data protection laws."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner in the United States uses GoDaddy to host their website, which collects personal data from EU visitors.

It is an invaluable tool, especially because it allows me to pick the type of court, offence type, and even the age of the defendant. The output would show defendants that have pleaded, or been found, guilty and their subsequent sentence. Unfortunately, this website is only for offences and sentences in the United Kingdom.\n\nAre there any websites similar to [TheLawPages](https://www.thelawpages.com/) for American criminal Law? Preferably, I would like to search by state and perhaps even at the Federal level.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The U.S. has no such website, at least at either the federal or the state level. It is possible that some local courts allow their records to be searched on that basis although I am not aware of any that do so.\n\nProbably the closest database to that in the U.S. accessible to the public is the non\\-governmental non\\-profit organization operated [Transactional Record Access Clearinghouse](https://trac.syr.edu/) for federal criminal justice records (and other federal government records). It has lots of data on federal government matters from a variety of sources but isn't quite as comprehensive or as easy to use as the website described in the question. The problem with that is that the federal courts handle only a small percentage of the criminal cases in the United States, and it is a highly skewed mix of cases (e.g. with lots of immigration cases but few ordinary \"blue collar crime\" cases outside Indian Reservations and federal parks).\n\nThe information necessary to build such a website is largely a matter of public record, but no one has taken on the task of making such a website.\n\nIn part, this is because the task is so daunting. While the federal courts have a comprehensive electronic database called PACER, each state has at least one separate court case data base system, and many states have trial court case databases only at the county level and not at the state level, or have different databases for different kinds of courts. Even in states that do have statewide databases, there are often some courts that aren't included. For example, Colorado's state courts are part of a single statewide database, but its municipal courts each have their own separate court by court databases. Some rural areas in the U.S. still keep trial court records in paper form only.\n\nThe data has been gathered from time to time of important subsets of this kind of data, but it isn't publicly available.\n\nFor example, a media consortia in Florida gathered information to examine the consistency of sentencing and the extent of racial discrimination in sentencing in Florida, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission in the United States gathers such information selectively to make sentencing decisions. Neither of those compilations, however, including making the raw data available to the public.\n\nSimilarly, there is a separate private academic database that tracks case level state general jurisdiction trial court data in 75 of the largest urban counties in the United States (including state law felony cases). But, that database is only available to members of the academic consortium that maintains it (basically, professors at affiliated universities and other professors granted privileges to use it from consortium member professors).\n\nThe Westlaw division of its parent company, and Lexis\\-Nexus collect some trial court level data on U.S. courts, state and federal, on a non\\-comprehensive, basically opportunistic basis, but don't have complete data from any jurisdiction (although Westlaw's federal data basis has a pretty significant share of reasoned federal trial court orders). Both of these services require paid subscriptions.\n\nIn contrast, comprehensive databases of precedent making appellate court decisions at the state and federal level are widely available on both a commercial basis (with better search tools, headnote analysis, and correlations of the data like records of cases citing other cases and statutes), and on a non\\-commercial basis (with just the bare bones text of the cases). This is because this information is necessary to almost every lawyer and judge to practice law on a day to day basis."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the availability of comprehensive criminal law databases in the United States compared to the United Kingdom?\n\nA) The U.S. has a federal database similar to TheLawPages that allows searching by state and at the federal level.\n\nB) Each state in the U.S. has its own comprehensive database that mirrors the functionality of TheLawPages for that state.\n\nC) The U.S. lacks a comprehensive nationwide database like TheLawPages, primarily due to the complexity and fragmentation of its court systems.\n\nD) The Transactional Record Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) provides a complete and user-friendly database of all criminal cases in the U.S., both at state and federal levels.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The answer states, \"The U.S. has no such website, at least at either the federal or the state level.\"\n2.

The fragmentation is further emphasized by the mention of different databases for different types of courts even within the same state.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no federal database similar to TheLawPages mentioned in the passage.

A will notarized at the time it is executed is sometimes called a \"self\\-proving will\". But notarization is not legally required for the will to be valid in New York State (or for that matter, in any other U.S. state).\n\nA will is not generally filed with the Surrogate's court until after the death of the person who wrote it, and then it is usually filed in the Surrogate's court for the county in which the person who died was domiciled at death. (There are exceptions to the rule about which county the probate case should be filed in that are beyond the scope of this question and answer.)\n\nThere are two main exceptions to the rules cited above:\n\n1. Members of the military, certain civilians attached to deployed military units, and mariners at sea, can make an oral will (called a \"nuncupative will\") to two witnesses, or can make a will entirely in his or her own handwriting (called a \"holographic will\") which is valid for one to three years after returning from that situation depending on the circumstances as set forth in [EPTL Section 3\\-2\\.2](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EPT/3-2.2). The requirements for a holographic will in New York State are more strict than in most other U.S. states.\n2. Secondly, a will which was validly executed in the place where it was executed may often be recognized as valid at the time of death, (even if it wouldn't be validly executed under the law in force in New York State at the time of death), particularly if the person who died wasn't domiciled in New York State at the time when the will was signed, because that person had no good reason to think that New York State law would apply to the execution of the will.

Probably the most relevant bit of legislation that applies here is The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a741\\-58\\) which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices and has been applied to online privacy and data security policies.

However, once you have made the users think that they have withdrawn your access (e.g. they \"deleted\" oAuth tokens), you are no longer authorized to read the *current* data (although the Terms may still allow you to use the old data you obtained when you had access).

I assume that the person had their name changed, and they are having mail forwarded from substitute address via an Address Confidentiality Program, where only the Sec'y of State knows the real address. However, in this situation, the landlord would also know the person's real address; and presumably the pet\\-check service knows the real address, as reported by the landlord (connected with the building's account). The problem is that, taking Washington's program as a representative, only Washington state and local governments are *required* to accept an ACP substitute address. The lawyer might, however, persuade the landlord to forego the pet\\-check registration. However, the landlord does not sound cooperative, and there is no general legal principle that would force him to relent.\n\nThere might be a jurisdiction\\-specific solution.\n[Reynolds v. Fraser](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5c3c5585342cca5eda9cdb79) 781 N.Y.S.2d 885\nwhere a woman was in a similar confidential\\-address arrangement and the parties who knew her real location refused to reveal the location without the interested party (an employer: NYC government) signing a confidentiality agreement, which they refused to do. The woman was fired for somewhat unclear reasons having to do with taking sick leave without the employer being able to check up on her. The court held that the employer's conduct was illegal discrimination against a victim of domestic violence, relying on an existing anti\\-discrimination law in NYC. This approach might work, depending on what laws exist in that city and state.\n\nThere can't be a universal court order prohibiting anyone from using the person's real name or actual address \u2013 people would have to know via a published court order \"It is hereby ordered that nobody ever reveal that Jane Doe lives at 123 Mockingbird Lane\", which would defeat the purpose of such an order."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A domestic violence survivor with a court-ordered confidential address is being required by their landlord to register with a third-party pet screening website that shares personal information internationally, despite having no pets.

Many biographies are \"unauthorized\", which simply means that the subject, or in some cases the subject's heirs or family, did not cooperate with the biographer. Sometimes this is even considered to be a point in favor of such a work, on the assumption that an \"authorized\" biography would tend to slant or even censor things to meet the approval of the subject or the subject's family.\n\nThere are some restrictions on an unauthorized biography.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the law of defamation. A biography that includes statements that are both false and defamatory about a living subject could be the subject of a winning lawsuit. Damages in such cases can sometimes be sizable. However, the person suing must show false facts in the work. In many cases damage to reputation must also be shown, although there are some categories of statement that are considered defamation *per se*, where injury to reputation is assumed and need not be proved. These include a false statement that a person committed a crime, and a statement that a person was guilty of professional misconduct. It used to be considered defamation per se to allege that a woman had had sex outside of marriage, but I doubt that a court would so hold today.\n\nBeyond that, in the US, if the subject is a public official or public figure, s/he must show *actual malice*, that is that the false statement was made knowing that it was false, or with reckless disregard for its possible falsity. This can be hard to prove.\n\nIn most jurisdictions only the person defamed can sue for defamation. Once that person is dead, no such suit can be brought.\n\nMoreover, in the very rare case where a person's reputation is so bad that a court finds that it can suffer no meaningful further injury for certain allegations, even if these were found to be false, the court may dismiss such a suit. See [*Dykstra v St. Martin's Press* New York Superior Court, New York County, Docket Number 153676](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2020/2020-ny-slip-op-31813-u.html) for an example. However this would only be relevant in the very unusual case of a \"libel\\-proof\" plaintiff, and even then if the conduct of the author or publisher was egregious, the court might hold that punitive damages were possible. The defenses of truth, lack of actual malice, and newsworthiness are far more common.\n\nIndeed defamation suits in general are hard to win and expensive to bring.\n\nIn some US states there is available the tort of publication of private facts. This is different from defamation in that it can still be brought when the facts published were true, while truth is a total defense against a defamation suit. However a private facts suit must establish that the facts were in fact private, or at least not widely known, and that they were published in a way that would be grossly offensive to a reasonable person. Facts that are considered of \"legitimate public interest\" or \"newsworthy\" are also not generally protected. Moreover, not every US state allows such suits at all. See *Diaz vs Oakland Tribune, Inc* 188 Cal Rpt 762 (1982\\) for a case in which a Private Facts case was sustained, and the steps taken by the subject to keep a sex transition private were a significant issue in the case. In *Hawkins vs Multimedia inc* 344 SE 2nd 145 (1986\\) a South Carolina court held that a news story identifying a teenage boy by name as the father of an \"illegitimate\" child was not newsworthy and a private facts judgement including punitive damages was upheld.\n\nIn the US, First Amendment protections have been taken to indicate that the courts will not suppress or punish speech or writing without good reason. This makes it harder to win suits over biographies.\n\nThere have been cases of magazine articles about a particular person who is in no way famous but who was considered \"typical\". Such stories have in several cases been upheld against challenges as of \"legitimate public interest\". See *Arrington vs New York Times Company* 434 N.E. 2nd 1319 (1982\\) In that case the objection was to the use of a person's photo on the cover of the *New York Times Magazine* who was not actually mentioned in the story, and who alleged that he was not similar to those who were mentioned.

Every city has 3 types of carpet cleaner available.\n\n1. Mr Cheap: Your $160 quote is from Mr Cheap. Mr cheap is a churn and burn operation. He quotes low prices to win work, then has to rush through 4, 5, or even 6, jobs in a day to make any profit. He mostly just goes \"through the motions\" of cleaning. He doesn't go slowly to ensure proper steam injection. he doesn't go back over the wet carpet 3 times to extract left over water to make the carpet dry faster. He doesn't treat different carpets in different ways depending on type and other factors. He might not do stain removal, he might not use the best or any chemicals. He certainly doesn't get lots of repeat business or good online reviews. Lastly, there's a high chance he'll be using a portable machine that comes into the house. These machines are WEAK compared to high powered truck mounted cleaning machines.\n2. Mr Middle: Mr middle can be a good option for many home owners and even more so for tenants. He is charging a around 50% more than mr Cheap. Because of this, he can make the same money in 3\\-4 jobs as the other guy makes in 6 jobs. Because of this, he takes a bit more time and care to do the job properly. He balances service with price and gets most little marks and stains as he goes. He should do the job properly without going to extremes in regards to customer service or fancy extras.\n3. Mr Premium: Your landlord being the owner of the property and the one who cares most is going to call Mr Premium. Mr Premium is amazing if you can afford him. His vans are well branded and in good condition. He lays on the extra special treatment to justify the price. He'll do all sorts of stuff like, pre\\-vacuum before cleaning, do extra treatments on high traffic areas, he will use commercial grade deodorizers to eliminate smells and other mess from pets, kids, and spills. He has a wide range of (sometimes) expensive chemicals to treat and get rid of every kind of stain. He is fully insured, properly trained, and WON'T damage the property by dragging hoses against walls.\n\nSo, as far as the price difference goes, I hope the above is enlightening...\n\nNow, for your specific situation. \n\nThe Dog: as sweet as he is and well trained and not shedding etc... it simply doesn't matter. if the dog has been hanging out on the carpet he has put into it all sorts of doggy oils, doggy sweat and doggy slobber. The second the steam from the cleaner hits the carpet all you're going to smell is WET DOG. The use of special chemicals to break down these organic compounds from the dog is a must if the property is changing hands.

We can at least say (somewhat) what the legal situation is, esp. what would constitute a violation of the law. To get to the bottom line, if there is any legal recourse, an aggrieved party would have to sue POTUS, and win the suit (compelling the president to do something different); or, the president could be impeached. \n\n[The War Powers Resolution of 1973](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-87/pdf/STATUTE-87-Pg555.pdf), statutorily encoded in [ch. 33 of Title 50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-33) limits the president's authority to engage in military action. First, Congress must be notified within 48 hours of the action, second, armed forces cannot remain more than 60 days (plus 30 days for withdrawal) without a declaration of war, or congressional authorization (such as took place in 2001, and currently exists). In one instance, Clinton continued bombing in Kosovo two weeks beyond the 60 day limit, but the administration maintained that because Congress approved funding for the operation, they had implicitly approved the operation. There was a [lawsuit](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2803714193388437750&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr) by Congress, but the court ruled that the complainants did not have standing. The court also found that\n\n> Congress certainly could have passed a law forbidding the use of U.S.\n>  forces in the Yugoslav campaign\n\nand indeed there was such a measure, but it was defeated. The opinion continues:\n\n> Congress always retains appropriations authority and could have cut\n>  off funds for the American role in the conflict\n\nand again, that was attempted, but failed. The court found that\n\n> Congress has a broad range of legislative authority it can use to stop\n>  a President's war making, see generally John C. Yoo, The Continuation\n>  of Politics by Other Means: The Original Understanding of War Powers,\n>  84 CAL. L. REV. 167 (1996\\)\n\nso *if* suitable veto\\-proof legislation is passed, then a military action could be stopped (by specifically prohibiting use of US funds for military action). \n\nOr, at least it seems that way. [31 USC 1341](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/1341) forbids an officer of the government from making or authorizing expenditures or obligations unless authorized by law. Consequently, when Congress fails to pass a budget, government operations must cease. This is related to Art. 1 Sect 9 Cl. 7 of the Constitution, which says\n\n> No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of\n>  appropriations made by law\n\nThe aforementioned statute does not allow an officer to create an obligation: it does not prohibit an officer from doing a thing, which would ordinarily imply an expenditure or obligation. Notice that while previous federal shutdowns did result in unpaid furloughs to civilian workers, it did not completely close down the military. The [military (accountants)](https://www.dfas.mil/pressroom/govtshutdown.html) explains\n\n> In case of a potential government shutdown, the Department of Defense\n>  has no legal authority to pay any personnel \\- military or civilian \\-\n>  for the days during which the government is shut down...\n>  Military members cannot be paid for duty performed after the\n>  expiration of the current CRA on September 30th. Once a CRA or an\n>  appropriations act is signed into law, normal disbursement of military\n>  pay will resume.\n\n(Congress could of course authorize back pay when it's all sorted out, and they did). If Congress were to specifically prohibit any expenditure of US funds for action against North Korea, that might simply mean that soldiers would be ordered to work without pay.\n\nIt is unquestionably within the power of the president to order soldiers into combat. I don't believe that there has been a case pertaining to the power of the president to compel soldiers to fight if they are not paid, but it is pretty much unimaginable that the courts would hold that the president lacks authority to order soldiers to work without pay. Also, you can't just quit the military: it's not at\\-will employment.

That is, it's not a custom that the flag is 50 starts and 13 stripes, it's the law. POTUS cannot unilaterally change the law. (4 USC 3 also specifies punishments for certain kinds of flag abuse, and this too is outside the scope of that the president can do by declaration). 4 USC 5 in fact states that \"The flag of the United States for the purpose of this chapter shall be defined according to sections 1 and 2 of this title\", and that\n\n> The following codification of existing rules and customs pertaining to\n>  the display and use of the flag of the United States of America is\n>  established for the use of such civilians or civilian groups or\n>  organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations\n>  promulgated by one or more executive departments of the Government of\n>  the United States.\n\n\u00a7\u00a76\\-9 specify standard flag etiquette (violation of which incurs no legal punishment), and those are the rules that the president can rewrite."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to 4 U.S.C. \u00a710, the President of the United States has the authority to alter certain rules regarding the U.S. flag.

The President's authority under 4 U.S.C. \u00a710 is limited to altering, modifying, or repealing rules or customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, as outlined in \u00a7\u00a76-9. These sections cover flag etiquette and display practices. The President cannot change the fundamental design of the flag (number of stars and stripes) as defined in \u00a71 and \u00a72, which are established by law and require an act of Congress to modify. The President also cannot alter punishments for flag abuse specified in \u00a73. Option A is incorrect because it overstates the President's authority. Option C is incorrect because it ignores the President's legitimate power to modify display rules. Option D is incorrect because the addition of stars for new states is automatically mandated by \u00a72 and doesn't require presidential action."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51152/what-happens-if-someone-simply-moves-homes-and-stops-responding-to-a-lawsuit", "docs_id": 51152, "title": "What happens if someone simply moves homes and stops responding to a lawsuit?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a civil proceeding what happens if a defendant changes addresses but does not provide a new one?

The law generally operates on the premise that people can understand statutes, regulations and contracts, and that if they don't understand a contract, they won't agree to it. Therefore, if they agreed, they understood: this is a fundamental premise of contract law. However, there are a couple of loopholes, \"unconscionability\" and \"public policy\", which could provide an escape. In the proposed scenario, we would assume that there is a huge difference in bargaining power between the customer and company, that some term is unfair (a highly subjective matter reduced to expressions like \"shocks the conscience\"), and the language of the contract is clearly confusing. \"Public policy\" generally involves a requirement in a contract that is statutorily prohibited: either the required action is itself illegal, or the law has banned any such clauses in a contract (very commonly, residential leases are statutorily prohibited from including clauses waiving statutory protections of rights).\n\nI think that if a contract for some internet thing (e.g. an ISP) had a clause that \"unahitaji kukulipa $1 kwa kila siku unayotumia huduma zetu\" (you must pay $1 for every day you use the service) that this is not a shocking price, so the contract would be enforceable, even if it ought to be a bit confusing."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A large tech company includes a clause in their user agreement that states: \"Mtumiaji atalipia dola moja kwa kila siku ya matumizi ya huduma hii.\" This clause is buried in the middle of a 50-page document written mostly in English.

Although that sounds reasonable, it also seems a bit meaningless to me. How could you ever prove what would or would not have happened in a hypothetical alternate reality?\n\nWhy don't police \"stings\" qualify as entrapment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Consider the the popular mid\\-00s \"To Catch a Predator\" segments on Dateline NBC, which allowed Chris Hansen to interview men caught in pedophile stings to provide better understanding of the mindset behind the people. Most entries into the series will have a very early on walk through of the basic sting operation: A citizen group would set up fake profiles of underage children (normally in their early or pre\\-teens) and would go into local area chat rooms... normally just to talk in public space or just lurk, they would be contacted privately by the suspect in the chat room, and would keep logs as the discussion turned lewd... at some point, the suspect and the decoy would arrange a face to face meeting (and the decoy would often ask for certain distinct gifts such as brand name alcoholic drinks or in some cases when the suspect would offer, that the suspect enter the decoy house naked).\n\nIt's important to note that, prior to even showing up, the lewd conversation with a minor over the internet was a criminal offense... showing up just shows that the criminal was intending to commit a more serious crime and the specified gift requests were further identifying the person didn't happen to be a case of wrong place wrong time. But it's always fun to seen them leave and get tackled and arrested on camera.\n\nThis is a sting and not entrapment and what makes it a sting is that the decoy actors never once initiated contact with the suspect. In every case, the suspect first reached out to the decoy child and made their intentions known. In many longs, the suspect would admit it that they know what they are doing is even illegal but they didn't care... and at least one even references the show to the decoy, which the decoy actor was amused by.\n\nEntrapment would have happened if the decoy actor initiated the conversation with a \"suspect\" and continued on the conversation's topics until the suspect broke the law at which point they were now arrestable. By seeding the idea in the criminal's mind, the police are now actively encouraging the lawlessness, rather than the other way around... The guilty mind existed prior to any knowledge of the suspect by the cop and the crime only occured because the cop told the suspect to commit the crime.\n\nOnce the intent to offend is established by undercover police, however, they can remain \"in character\" in so far as they can appear only to facilitate the crime, not influence it (i.e. they can provide \"explosives\" or bomb making skills to an unsuspecting terrorist in so long as they aren't helping pick the target or encouraging a bomb attack. Or they can make purchases from a drug dealer so long as they aren't selling the drugs for them.). The reason behind this is that the criminal is already committed to the illegal action (bombing something, selling illegal drugs) and that in the event the cops cannot arrest by the time the suspect completes the goal, they at least are preventing the bad thing happening by removing the threat (the bomb won't work... had they not facilitated help, the terrorist would find a legit bomb maker and that's a big problem. SImilarly, had the dealer not sold, that substance would just be sold to someone else. And in the example from the Sting, had the offender not talked to the decoy, they would have found a real child... in fact, there were a few examples where Dateline had repeat offenders, the first being an early segment (at the time they were handing over the evidence after the shooting of the segment wrapped) where the suspect was let go and went back into the same chat room and hit on a second decoy. A later example would have a suspect show up who turned out to have been awaiting trial for appearing on a Dateline sting prior to the current appearance.)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of entrapment and police sting operations, which of the following scenarios would most likely constitute entrapment?\n\nA) An undercover officer poses as a drug dealer and sells drugs to a suspect who approached them seeking to buy illegal substances.\n\nB) A police officer creates an online profile of an underage person and waits for potential predators to initiate contact and engage in inappropriate conversations.\n\nC) An undercover agent infiltrates a terrorist group and provides them with fake explosives after the group has already planned an attack.\n\nD) A police officer approaches a random individual at a bar, repeatedly encourages them to drive home despite their intoxication, and then arrests them for DUI when they comply.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\nA) This is not entrapment because the suspect initiated the illegal activity by seeking to buy drugs.

You need to talk to your accountant about how to treat these for consumption and income taxes.\n\nLegally, these people are now creditors of your business \\- just like all of your suppliers and employees.

Basically, if your business goes bust they will lose their money.\n\nThis is something that you should have dealt with in your contract with your customers \\- if you are running an online business then you should get a lawyer to revise your terms of service to cover things like how they can ask for a refund (and how long you have to get it to them) and how long (or if) they forfeit the funds.

The primary or \"senior\" lien is typically a mortgage lender. Subordinate liens may have attached to a property through loans or judgments awarded to other parties unrelated to the primary lienholder.\n\nForeclosure is a move by a lienholder to recoup its equity by compelling the sale of the property. My understanding is that once approved by a court, foreclosed property is typically sold at auction, and the proceeds awarded to the lienholders in order of lien seniority.

If the mortgage company forecloses it is only looking to recoup $400k.

The US State Department and Treasury Department both provide information on Iran sanctions, including relevant statutes and executive orders. The mention of \"US law\" and \"EU law\" in the original question also suggests multiple sources of sanctions.

It is also known in German as \"Menetekel\" or in English as the \"Writing on the wall\". It stems from the biblical episode of [Belshazzar's feast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belshazzar%27s_feast). Literally, the text would be read as \"counted, counted, weighed, distributed\". Its meaning elaborated in *Daniel 5* is generally understood as \"Your days are numbered; Your days are numbered; You have been measured and found wanting; Your kingdom will fall and be divided\".

This is similar to the ruling in Cohen v.

It might not really be mandatory for everybody, however there will certainly be some citizens that will be required to have the app installed on their phones.\n* **The security.** The app relies on bluetooth connections to be able to detect another person when a citizen is close to them. A lot of people own smartphones that are insecure because they are not up\\-to\\-date. In many cases they cannot even be updated because the vendor doesn't release the security patches on time, or the vendor only provides support for a few months after the purchase. Bluetooth is known to have had vulnerabilities in the past, and the latest one was fixed a couple of months ago. Examples: [December 2017, billions of devices imperiled by new clickless bluetooth attack](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/bluetooth-bugs-open-billions-of-devices-to-attacks-no-clicking-required/), and [February 2020, Google fixes no\\-user\\-interaction bug in Android's Bluetooth component](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-fixes-no-user-interaction-bug-in-androids-bluetooth-component/). They can be pretty serious, and citing the last article, \"if left unpatched, the vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction and can even be used to create self\\-spreading Bluetooth worms, experts said.\" Yes, it is very ironic: an app developed to control the spread of a biological virus might lead to the spread of a software virus, by proximity! Very ironic.\n* **The precautions.** The goverment and the app developers take no precautions to avoid the above\\-mentioned risks. The app will install and run without any warnings if the device is not up\\-to\\-date. The government doesn't warn the citizens that such application must only be installed if the device is up\\-to\\-date, and doesn't require citizens to buy a new smartphone if the current one cannot be considered secure. So unless a citizen is particularly tech\\-savvy, they won't have a clue they are exposing their personal data to a risk when they turn bluetooth on. On the other hand, a lot of people are clueless anyway and probably already have bluetooth on right now.\n\nThe question is: is this legal? I'm not sure how much the GDPR is relevant here, because the app might not process much personal data. These kinds of apps might just exchange pseudonymous IDs, and might not record much data other than that. However the app will be installed in a system that is full of personal data (the smartphone), even sensitive personal data (think of emails, messages, social media), so it definitely has an impact on the overall security.\n\nJurisdictions: EU (but I'm also curious about the US, for comparison).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If and when some sort of contract tracing app becomes a key public health tool and is made mandatory in an EU member state, it would almost certainly be through some *ad hoc* law, possibly using emergency powers that parliaments have granted to the executive in several countries. That would set aside most existing legal hurdles and makes it difficult to think about the legality of such an app in advance.\n\nOf course, even a very broad national mandate would still formally need to comply with EU law and possibly be open to some constitutional or ECHR challenge. But it's difficult to see how these could be invoked based on a theoretical impact on a limited number of phones. It should also be possible to dispose of many human rights objections with a proportionality argument and I suspect most courts would be happy to accept it.\n\nInterestingly, article 23(1\\)(e) of the GDPR empowers national governments to set aside many obligations in the name of, *inter alia*, public health so the possibility to redefine what's legal or not at the national level is baked in. These restrictions are not absolute however and, in particular, do not cover articles 24, 25, 32 and 33 (which all have to do with data protection and security).

According to the information provided, Article 23(1)(e) of the GDPR allows national governments to set aside many obligations for reasons including public health. However, this power does not extend to Articles 24, 25, 32, and 33, which relate to data protection and security.

Option B is false, as the information clearly states that governments can override some GDPR regulations for public health emergencies.

Can I use something like a poem from [Anton Chekhov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov) for example? He wrote his poems before any copyright laws, so logic would dictate it's safe to use (although law and logic don't always mix).\n\nIt's not actually a poem from Chekhov, but I'm using him as an example because of the fact he didn't write in English, which gets me to my second item.\n\n2.

Any work from prior to 1924 isn't necessarily safe to use (it depends on when the author died). It is in the US but will complicate things if you publish internationally.\n\nUnless you translate with something like Google translate, translation is definitely a creative process.

Option A is incorrect because copyright laws existed before Chekhov's time, with the first one dating back to 1710.

The legal root of the matter is the [Therapeutic Goods Administration](https://www.tga.gov.au/).

In [Queensland](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/published.exp/sl-2013-0266), there is an amendment to the\n\n> Drugs Misuse Regulation 1987 to ensure that the substance 5\\-Hydroxy\n> tryptophan (5\\-HTP) is captured in Schedule 2 with the exception of\n> preparations that contain 100mg or less of 5\\-HTP per dosage unit\n\nSchedule 2 is \"Substances, the safe use of which may require advice from a pharmacist and which should be available from a pharmacy or, where a pharmacy service is not available, from a licensed person\".

The information indicates that Australia has a complex regulatory framework for 5-HTP, involving both federal and state regulations. At the federal level, the Therapeutic Goods Administration regulates 5-HTP, with dosages above 100 mg requiring a prescription. Additionally, there are state-level regulations, as exemplified by Queensland's amendment to the Drugs Misuse Regulation 1987. This complexity and variation in regulations likely contribute to the \"friction\" experienced when attempting to purchase 5-HTP online for delivery to Australia.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the FDA's actions are mentioned, they are not cited as the primary cause of the current situation in Australia.

It is possible that some person may illegally copy copyright\\-protected material then use a website to modify that material, in which case the question of vicarious liability for copyright infringement could arise, so we appeal to the DMCA safe harbor provisions to see what the website must do. First, the owner of copyright must submit a properly constructed takedown notice to the website. Crucially, the notice must contain sufficient information that the website operator can find and take down the item(s) in question. Assuming that the complainant can supply the \"where is it\" information, then there is a notice and counter\\-notice routine where the uploader is informed and can deny the accusation \u2013 the website operator doesn't evaluate the merits of the claim, he only sees that the formalities were observed. If the operator follows the rules, he cannot be held vicariously liable.\n\nIf the link does not expire and if it is somehow promulgated, the technical potential for being a contributor to copyright infringement becomes very real, but it puts the operator in no worse a legal position than Youtube. So the question is not just related to OCILLA, it is entirely covered by that law. Questions of how users or website owners are \"supposed to\" act don't figure into this. If the website owner does not comply with those provisions, they have no access to the safe harbor provisions, and they can be sued.

The success of her case largely depends on whether the court would consider knowledge about bridges freezing first to be a reasonable expectation for drivers in that area. This relates directly to the second element of negligence: whether Bob breached his duty of care by failing to meet the standard of a reasonable person.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a Written Traffic Warning is not admissible evidence and does not prove negligence in civil cases. \n\nOption B, while touching on Bob's precautions, oversimplifies the situation and doesn't account for the specific issue of knowledge about bridge conditions.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests an absolute duty, which is not the standard in negligence cases. The duty is to act as a reasonable person would, not to ensure safety absolutely.\n\nOption D correctly identifies that the crux of the case lies in determining whether Bob's lack of knowledge about bridge freezing constitutes a failure to meet the standard of care expected of a reasonable driver in those circumstances."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/34362/which-crime-is-done-or-law-violated-when-a-person-pushes-other-to-commit-suicide", "docs_id": 34362, "title": "Which crime is done or law violated when a person pushes other to commit suicide?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Argentina there is a crime that's called \"suicidio inducido\" (induced suicide) that's when a person physically or psychologically pushes another to commit suicide.

(Congress and its committees have power to require both members and witnesses to abide by its rules of decorum, which forbid such insults, but as far as I know the remedy is merely to remove the disorderly person.) \n\nContempt of congress is defined by [2 USC 192](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/192), which provides that:\n\n> Every person who having been summoned as a witness by the authority of either House of Congress to give testimony or to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before either House, or any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, or any committee of either House of Congress, willfully makes default, or who, having appeared, refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 nor less than $100 and imprisonment in a common jail for not less than one month nor more than twelve months.\n\nNote that this is a Federal criminal statute like any other, and Congress does not normally \"declare\" a person guilty, much less \"apply the imprisonment penalty\". Charges would have to be brought before a federal court, and the person convicted by a jury, or by a judge if a jury trial was waived. \n\nCongress does have the \"inherent power\" to hold trials for contempt itself, but this has not been done since 1934\\. This power was upheld by the Supreme Cout in [*Anderson v. Dunn* 19 U.S. 204 (1821\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/19/204/)\n\nA conviction under 2 USC 192 for refusal to answer questions on the part of a witness under subpoena was upheld against a First Amendment challenge in *Wilkinson v.

The moves that were made are facts. Facts are not protected by copyright, although particular words used to describe facts may be protected.\n\nWhat books, databases, or other sources report a given game is a fact, and not protected unless the source constitutes a single selected list. If the book is *50 Best Chess Games selected by Joe Expert*, then listing which games are included amounts to copying that selected list of games.\n\nAnnotations to or comments on a particular game would be protected by copyright, and may not be reproduced without permission unless they are old enough for copyright to have expired, or fit an exception to copyright. The fair use exception might or might not apply in the US, depending on the details and the use made, but would not apply elsewhere. The news reporting exception would not apply, I think.\n\nThe selection of a particular set of games as \"notable\" or \"best\" would be protected by copyright. Selecting such games as a set, or indicting which games belonged to such a list would be infringement. Including some such games along with many others, and in no way indicating which belonged to such a list would probably not be infringement of the copyright on the list.\n\nA website or open database that provides data on such games may well have a TOS limiting how a user can access or use the data. For instance data scraping may be prohibited. Commercial use may be prohibited or restricted. Such a TOS probably forms a contract with each user, and any user is bound to its terms. Use of the site contrary to the TOS may be a breech of contract, and thus grounds for a lawsuit. What damages might be available would depend on the terms of the TOS, and the laws of the country where such a suit might be brought. That could include the country where the site is hosted, the country where the site owner does business, or where the user lives or works. In some countries, such as the US, Canada, or India, state or provincial laws might apply.\n\nIn some countries there is a \"database right\" similar to a copyright, that protects the data in a database as a collection.

Should car sharing company explicitly notify about liability before booking?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How Are Liability And Insurance Matters Usually Disclosed?\n==========================================================\n\nNormally, in a car sharing arrangement, you must establish a membership or account with the car sharing firm that includes all of the terms and conditions of the agreement between the parties (at least by reference to a document that you acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to read), often in connection with downloading an app necessary to use the service.\n\nI also strongly suspect (as a comment below indicates) that if you dug around enough on the firm's webpage that a link to the relevant terms and conditions could be found, even if it wasn't in the most obvious place. But, this information will often not be on the firm's main landing page of their website, and can instead often only be reached with multiple clicks and/or drop down menus.\n\nSometimes this is called a \"terms of service\", sometimes this is called a \"master agreement\", sometimes it is called a \"membership agreement\" or \"account agreement\". My list of names for this agreement is not exhaustive. Often these terms are also described elsewhere in simplified form, such as a \"how to\" brochure, or information that is posted on the interior of the vehicle itself or in a sleeve of documents in the car.\n\nUsually, in the course of the sign up process there would typically be a box to click and a link or scrollable portion of the screen at which you can review all of those terms and conditions which are the terms of the contract.\n\nWhat Must Advertising Say And Why?\n==================================\n\nIt is not generally necessary for the advertising itself to disclose every term and condition and detail of the arrangement. Generally speaking, an advertisement is considered merely an \"invitation to make an offer\" to enter into a contract, rather than an offer which can be accepted directly and form a contract. Of course, a particular jurisdiction's legislature certainly has the power to require that a car sharing company disclose liability and insurance information in a particular fashion set forth in a statute or regulation, if that jurisdiction's legislative body chooses to do so.\n\nEven when these issues are mentioned in advertising (even when some disclosure is required by law in adverising), usually this would be in the form of a sentence that incorporates another document by reference like \"Additional terms and conditions, including terms and conditions related to liability and insurance, that can be found at . . . . apply.\"\n\nThis is due to the practical reality that TV and radio ads are usually just 15\\-60 seconds allowing about 25\\-100 words or perhaps a few more if the announcer speaks quickly, and that ads in print or on a screen also typically have room for only a very small amount of text.\n\nWebsites, in principle, provide an effectively infinite amount of capacity to host content, but considerations of ease of website use and the need to make the landing page striking for marketing purposes (as well as the need to make websites mobile user friendly when that is the only way that many Internet users can access the web) usually relegates the legal terms of the agreement to less attention grabbing locations.\n\nOften, these terms are disclosed more conspicuously when the terms and conditions change materially, something that often has its own little PR campaign accompanying it.\n\nUnilaterally Imposed Contracts of Adhesion\n==========================================\n\nOne reason that disclosure isn't such a huge issue is that car share agreements are almost always mass produced, not up for negotiation, \"contracts of adhesion\" that only senior management of the firm has the authority to modify. In the case of these intangible contractually agreed services, the terms of the agreement are more akin to a non\\-negotiable product design than to the paradigmatic haggled legal agreement between parties.\n\nThus, a customer has only two choices. Use the service according to the standard terms, or don't use the service.\n\nGiven this reality, the average buyer of the services relies upon the market place rejecting contracts of adhesion with bad terms, upon testimonials (good and bad) from prior users of the service, and upon media publicity for notorious terms or incidents that makes it look like the business doesn't treat it customers well, to keep the agreements reasonable, rather than upon individualized decisions to use or not use the service based upon a detailed review of the contract terms.\n\nThere are legal doctrines pertaining to contracts of adhesion that invalidate terms that are unconscionable or not within the reasonable expectation of a consumer unless those terms of conspicuously disclosed.\n\nA classic example, for example, would be that a car share agreement that imposed extraction of a kidney as a fine for being one days late in paying an invoice would be void as a matter of law, even if the referenced document said so in bold large face type and the customer clicked a box acknowledging having read the agreement.\n\nWhat Happens If There Is No Agreement Or Disclosure?\n====================================================\n\nIf there was never a step at which the terms and conditions were disclosed or accepted, then the default rules of law pertaining to personal property leasing, together with the laws pertaining to automobile accidents and insurance (both statutory and case law) in the jurisdiction in question.\n\nIn almost all cases, liability to third parties for accidents is generally a matter of tort law or statute imposed by the government, rather than being something that can be modified by agreement. Also, usually the government imposes minimum insurance requirements and the owner of the car also has an incentive (and often a legal requirement) to have car insurance in force.\n\nIn the United States, the default rules of law pertaining to personal property leasing, are set forth in Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted in every U.S. State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and each self\\-governing U.S. territory with its own internal laws.\n\nIn countries Europe or Latin American or Asia known as \"civil law\" countries (i.e. in those countries outside the British common law tradition, the Islamic law legal tradition, tribal or clan or caste law, or legal systems with communist regime roots established in the 20th century), the equivalent default rules of law (governing personal property leases, contracts to provide services, leases and insurance) would be contained in either a civil code or a commercial code of that country in most cases.\n\nIn common law countries, the contractual agreements tend to be longer than the default provisions of law are skinnier. In civil law countries, the reverse is true.\n\nA hybrid of these two approaches which also limits the need of customers to monitor contract terms is the regulatory model commonly used in the insurance industry in the United States takes the reality that contracts of adhesion are the norm and gives it a regulatory twist. In this hybrid model, all of the boilerplate language of every insurance contract down to the last word of non\\-customized or only semi\\-customized language, and often fee schedules as well, must be substantively improved by a state agency that regulates insurance. In these models, a public official negotiates the terms of the contracts with the firms, subject to intervention in and participation in the process by industry associations and non\\-profits or interested individuals on behalf of consumers or other interested parties. In these hybrid systems, the approved contract language which can't be modified in the boilerplate language by either the firms or the customers, is on file with the regulatory agency and provides constructive notice to all parties in much the same way as a statute or government regulation.\n\nIf not enough material terms of the agreement (e.g. the rental rate) were disclosed to form a contract, then there would be no enforcement contractual arrangement involved in the car share and the car share company would have to rely on the law of unjust enrichment to recover the fair market value of the services provided in each case, which as a practical matter, wouldn't be viable as a business model.\n\nDistinctions Between The Two Kinds Of Car Sharing Arrangements\n==============================================================\n\nThere is some ambiguity in the question because there are a couple main types of car sharing arrangements.\n\nOne is more like a rental car and you drive the vehicle yourself (Car2Go is one of them). In this case, the firm typically provides car insurance and does a limited background of a prospective account holders driving record before allowing someone to use the service. But, the user of the service, who drives the car, would be primarily liable for any accident that the car gets into.\n\nThe other kind, sometimes called a \"car share\" and sometimes called a \"ride share\" is more like an Uber or Lyft, which is a glorified, on demand taxi service, in which a driver provides the services of the driver and the vehicle and takes car of insurance and will be primarily liable for any accident the car gets into as a driver and owner of the car."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A car-sharing company advertises its service on its website, highlighting only the benefits without explicitly mentioning insurance and liability details.

City of Hialeah](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/508/520), 508 U.S. 520 a law specifically designed to restrict Santeria animal sacrifices *is* an undue burden on religion. The Employment Division court cites [Cantwell v. Connecticut](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/310/296), 310 U.S. 296 and [Wisconsin v. Yoder](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/406/205), 406 U.S. 205 as the only cases where the First Amendment prevents a generally applicable law from applying in a religious context, which the court notes \"are distinguished on the ground that they involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but that Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections\".

The set of exceptions is large enough that one might conclude that this *is* an undue burden on the exercise of religion.

Since the details is stored in a cookie, only way for me to revoke consent would be to somehow \"ban\" that cookie from being activated later on from the server side, requiring me to store personal details of users (either IP\\-adresses of computers which the cookies should not be respected from and immidiately deleted, or users email adress to \"ban\" the content of the cookie to be used, and immidiately delete all cookies containing that email adress)\n\nAnother thing is that since the function is locally controlled, it means that I don't know or store which users have consented, meaning I do not have any records of consent from users. HOWEVER, since the function is built in such a way that it will only place the cookie if consent is received, it would be sufficent as \"consent proof\" right?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR doesn't impose specific requirements on how consent may be revoked, other than that withdrawing consent must be as easy as giving it. If the original consent is given via a checkbox, and if that checkbox is compliant, then withdrawing consent through the same checkbox should also be compliant. It might be appropriate to regularly remind the user that they can withdraw consent, e.g. by expiring the cookie after 12 months. It could also be a good idea to indicate that the user enabled this themselves, e.g. by showing the timestamp when consent was given.\n\nHowever, I am not convinced that consent is required in this scenario. While the definition of consent comes from GDPR, the cookie consent requirement comes from the ePrivacy directive which is then implemented in national laws. The ePD talks more generally about information stored on a terminal device of the \"subscriber or user\". Accessing such information (including but not limited to cookies) usually requires consent of the subscriber or user, but there is an exception for access that is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user to work. There are some consequences from this:\n\n* You might not need consent for setting the cookie if such storage is strictly necessary for your website to work. If your site features a log\\-in you could in theory also store the information server\\-side, but client\\-side storage might actually be more privacy\\-friendly.\n* At least, checking whether a consent cookie is set does not require consent since such access is strictly necessary for a consent mechanism to work.\n* It is not a problem if multiple people share a browser profile. Since this is an ePrivacy issue, you do not need the consent of the data subject but the consent of the subscriber or user.\n\nCookie consent is typically managed purely client\\-side, and I have *never* heard of functionality for a website operator to withraw consent on behalf of the user. If a website operator is concerned about this, they could offer a link that goes directly to a consent management panel.\n\nHowever, information about consent and withrawal events might be stored server\\-side. The GDPR requires that you can \"demonstrate\" that consent was given validly. For example, you should be able to show that the request for consent had enough information for the consent to be freely given, specific, and informed. Most cookie consent solutions also store a server\\-side timestamp for consent/withrawal events in order to have an auditable history that proves when consent was given or withdrawn. But unless there are user accounts, it's of course difficult to tie such events to a browser session."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to GDPR and ePrivacy regulations, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of pre-ticked checkboxes for managing cookie consent on a website?\n\nA) Pre-ticked checkboxes can never be used for obtaining or revoking consent, as they violate GDPR principles.\n\nB) Pre-ticked checkboxes can be used to revoke previously given consent, as long as the initial consent was obtained through an unticked checkbox.\n\nC) Pre-ticked checkboxes are permissible for both obtaining and revoking consent, provided the user is regularly reminded of their consent status.\n\nD) Pre-ticked checkboxes may not require consent at all if the cookie is strictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

While the question mentions being in California, trademarks are typically filed at the federal level with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), not at the state level. This provides broader protection across the entire United States. \n\nOption A is incorrect because federal registration is generally more comprehensive than state-level registration. \n\nOption B is incorrect because whether to file for a trademark or service mark depends on whether the mark is used for goods or services, not on whether it's a business name or slogan. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the business name and slogan would typically require separate trademark applications.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that before filing, the business owner should conduct a thorough search to ensure their proposed marks don't conflict with existing trademarks, as mentioned in the original answer."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8182/can-i-make-a-derivative-work-from-a-book-that-was-written-150-years-ago", "docs_id": 8182, "title": "Can I make a derivative work from a book that was written 150 years ago", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I read an article that says that copyrights last life of author plus 70 years. \n\nCan I make a derivative work from a book that was written 150 years ago without making a copyright infringement?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume you are talking about United States federal copyright law.\n\nYou can freely use any:\n\n* material published before 1923\n* material published between 1923 and 1963 for which the copyright was not renewed\n* material explicitly placed in the public domain\n* material not copyrightable (such as any US government publication)\n* material whose copyright has been abandoned (for example the author died with no heir)"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided copyright information:\n\nQuestion: An aspiring filmmaker wants to adapt a novel into a movie.

Under which circumstance would the filmmaker most likely be able to adapt this novel without obtaining permission or risking copyright infringement?\n\nA) The novel was published before 1923, so it's automatically in the public domain.\nB) The author died more than 50 years ago, so the copyright has expired.\nC) The copyright was likely not renewed, so the work entered the public domain in 1968.\nD) The author died with no heirs, so the copyright was automatically abandoned.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because the novel was published in 1940, not before 1923.\nB) is incorrect because the \"life plus 70 years\" rule applies to works created after 1978. This work falls under older copyright laws.\nC) is correct. For works published between 1923 and 1963, copyright had to be renewed after 28 years to maintain protection.

While there are some interesting and less common aspects of what this particular business is hiring, there is nothing particularly unique about it, and this information is publicly advertised. Also I have knowledge of the age and wear\\-and\\-tear of the items being leased (but not how much they re being leased for.). Again, If I were to go into competition I would be seeking machinery that is a lot older or a lot newer then what is being sold.\n\nThere are some minor pieces of information I can't unlearn which may or may not be relevant \\- mainly I know how much the lease is, and this colors my judgment \\- even though I would not be seeking premises in the immediate area.\n\n**After signing an NDA**, I then received an Information Memorandum and had an initial meeting with the seller and agent. The information I received was such that I decided not to proceed with the purchase of the business (because much of the information provided was clearly false). I did not put in an offer on the business or do due diligence.\n\nI am now considering starting up a business which could be seen as being in competition with this business. \n\n* A clause in the NDA says The Parties above herein agree that in consideration of the sum of $1\\.00 to be paid by the Interested Party to (AGENT) that (AGENT) will disclose and supply to it such records, documents, representations, and financial information that (AGENT) may have in its possession, may obtain, or may have prepared.) **Does the information being disclosed without payment or, or further discussion about the $1\\.00 invalidate the NDA?**\n* The Interested Party will thereafter maintain the confidentiality of such confidential information and not use the same for any further purpose whatsoever.\n* For the purpose of this Agreement, \u201cconfidential information \u201c shall mean:\n\nAll information disclosed by (AGENCY) relating to the business and financial affairs of (BUSINESS REF/NAME DETAILS) whether by way of records, documents, representations, financial information, and books of accounts, connected with the business affairs and financial details of the Business.\nAny information which the Interested Party acquires during negotiations in relation to any dealings, transactions or affairs of the Business.\n\n**Is there anything stopping me from setting up in competition with this business based on the above.** If I do proceed I would rely on my skills and knowledge from people who work in similar businesses and who likely don't even know of this businesses existence.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> can I start in competition\n\nYes. First, non\\-disclosure and non\\-compete are two different things. The focus of the clauses you reproduce has to do with non\\-disclosure.\n\nSecond, information that was objectively and materially false may void the NDA, since it violates the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Some \"purists\" like to argue that contract law in some jurisdictions (example: UK law) does not require that covenant. However, they confuse between being parties' altruistic approach and a non\\-fraudulent one. The latter is requisite regardless of the jurisdiction.\n\nThird, the language in your NDA uses *future* tense (see \"*(AGENT) **will** disclose and supply \\[...] records, documents, representations*\"). The clause does not cover information that was disclosed to you *prior* to entering the NDA. The prohibition to use \"*for any further purpose whatsoever*\" only encompasses \"*such confidential information*\" that was referred to in the previous clause.\n\nFourth, being able to prove that you rely on skills and knowledge acquired from elsewhere would defeat any allegation that you took advantage of agent's disclosures."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the individual's ability to start a competing business after signing the NDA?\n\nA) The individual is completely prohibited from starting any competing business due to the NDA.\n\nB) The individual can start a competing business, but only if they pay the $1.00 mentioned in the NDA.\n\nC) The individual can start a competing business, as long as they don't use any confidential information disclosed after signing the NDA.\n\nD) The individual cannot start a competing business because they received an Information Memorandum after signing the NDA.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The NDA primarily focuses on non-disclosure rather than non-compete clauses. The individual can start a competing business as long as they don't use confidential information disclosed after signing the NDA. The NDA only covers information disclosed after its signing, not prior knowledge. Additionally, if the individual relies on skills and knowledge acquired elsewhere, it would defeat allegations of using confidential information from the NDA. The $1.00 payment is not a determining factor, and receiving the Information Memorandum doesn't automatically prohibit starting a competing business."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73014/paying-back-money-from-purchase-in-an-agreement-that-does-not-mention-a-timeline", "docs_id": 73014, "title": "Paying back money from purchase in an agreement that does not mention a timeline for the condition of the money given", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My sister bought her home a little over a year ago.

Similarly, if your sister is in breach of the agreement, the vendor would probably only be entitled to damages for what they have lost; they would not normally be entitled to terminate the contract.
