She had a life insurance policy worth $500,000. Sarah's two children from a previous marriage, Amy and Brian, believe they are entitled to some of the insurance money. The beneficiary designation form for the policy states: \"Primary Beneficiary: John (husband) - 80%, Amy (daughter) - 10%, Brian (son) - 10%\". What is the correct distribution of the insurance proceeds?\n\nA) John receives $400,000, Amy receives $50,000, and Brian receives $50,000\nB) John receives $500,000, and is morally obligated to share with Amy and Brian\nC) The money is split equally among John, Amy, and Brian: $166,666.67 each\nD) The insurance company must divide the money equally between Amy and Brian, as they are Sarah's biological children\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The beneficiary designation form is the binding document that determines how life insurance proceeds are distributed. In this case, the form clearly states that John is to receive 80% of the proceeds, while Amy and Brian are each to receive 10%. This means John will get $400,000 (80% of $500,000), and Amy and Brian will each get $50,000 (10% of $500,000). The length of the marriage, the relationship between the beneficiaries, or any moral considerations do not override the legally binding beneficiary designation. Option B is incorrect because John is not obligated to share his portion. Option C is wrong because the distribution is not equal.

When you co\\-sign a loan with someone else both you and the other person are equal parties in the loan, both jointly responsible in fully paying off the principle and interest. If loan is defaulted on, the bank can pursue legal remedies to try to recover its money against either or both of you.\n\nIf you end up having to pay part or all of the loan, then whether or not you can recover any of that money will depend on whatever agreement you made with the other person. Given that you probably wouldn't a have a signed written agreement with the other signer in case like this, it'll probably come down to whether or not you can prove (on the balance of probabilities) that the other party promised to you to pay off the full amount of the loan. It will help if the loan is specifically tied to a car, a house or other property that the other party benefits from but you don't. \n\nNote that you'd have to give serious consideration to whether the other party can actually pay the amount owed. There's no point going to court to obtain an unenforceable judgement.\n\nI also should say that from a financial perspective it does make some sense to think of it as if you were loaning out the money yourself. While there's a big and significant difference between the two, in that your bank account isn't affected unless the other person defaults, if they do the result is going to be pretty much the same. Indeed in that case it's not much different than just giving the other person the money.

While John can potentially sue Sarah to recover the money he paid, his success is not guaranteed. He would need to prove that there was an agreement or understanding that Sarah would be responsible for repaying the loan. Additionally, even if John wins the case, collecting the money depends on Sarah's ability to pay. The answer also reflects the complexity and uncertainty of such situations, as mentioned in the original text.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the legal process and wrongly assumes an automatic favorable ruling.\n\nOption B is incorrect because co-signing doesn't eliminate all legal recourse, though it does carry significant risk.\n\nOption D is incorrect because as co-signers, both parties are fully responsible for the entire loan amount, not just half."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7875/airline-should-refund-ticket-in-event-of-security-risk", "docs_id": 7875, "title": "Airline should refund ticket in event of security risk?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a physics student and researcher who travels a fair amount to communicate with scientists in my field, and I recently booked a non\\-refundable ticket through Turkish Airlines to get from Boston to Geneva next week.\n\nI was aware that Turkey was not the most stable region, but all travel warnings at that time regarded southeastern Turkey; my flight has a 16 hour layover in Istanbul, which is on the western side of the country. I was told recent events would not be a problem, both by Turkish acquaintances and service representatives of Turkish Airlines. However, that was when I booked the March 25th flight at the beginning of the month.\n\nWhen the bombings in Ankara (central Turkey) occurred last weekend, I called Turkish Airlines to cancel my flight, suspicious that violence was moving westward.

Their response was that they had no evidence of danger in Istanbul or Ataturk airport, and that I would be safe during my 16\\-hour layover. However, I was suspicious, and felt that this was not exactly a statement the Airline could guarantee.\n\nLast night, I called again because the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul issued a [travel warning](http://istanbul.usconsulate.gov/citizen_messages.html) yesterday (March 17\\), saying that U.S. Government buildings and tourist areas might be targets for acts of terrorism. I called Turkish Airlines again and complained; they redirected me to a Customer Care Relations form which I could fill out to request a full refund. I did so. The airline usually takes 48 hours to respond.\n\nThis morning, Istanbul was victim to a suicide bombing in a populated tourist area. At least 36 were injured, and five were reported dead. I am concerned that after hours of effort, I will not be able to obtain a full refund, even though there is now evidence of a clear and present danger in Istanbul. Given that I have had to book another last\\-minute flight through a safer region (Canada to Geneva), I would expect Turkish to at least refund the cost of my ticket, or provide me with a credit for future travel (although I am so concerned with the way they do business that I do not think the latter is acceptable anymore).\n\nIf they do not provide me with a full refund, my next step will be to go to small claims court.

This sounds reasonable, because you trust the business owner to provide you with a product which is, at the very least, safely comestible. However, when you stop by a week later to pick up the cake, the baker tells you that there is a reasonable chance the cake has cyanide in it, and that you would endanger yourself in the act of consumption.

Last year I thought the most powerful tools available to anyone that had the potential to break the GDPR were [bellingcat's](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/09/19/identifying-suspicious-businesses-reddit-analysis-and-tracking-russian-propaganda-here-are-the-results-of-bellingcats-first-ever-hackathon/) [tools](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/10/06/automated-map-searches-scam-busting-tools-and-twitter-search-translations-here-are-the-results-of-bellingcats-second-hackathon/) for building personal network graphs from public information such as social media and Companies House. However in the last month open source tools derived from [Meta\u2019s LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) Large Language Model have improved to the point that they are competitive with the best in the world and [Google expects them to eclipse this performance in coming months](https://natural20.com/google-ai-documents-leak/).\n\nFor example [Vicuna\\-13B](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/) runs on a reasonable gaming computer and when asked \"tell me about \\[FIRST SURNAME] from \\[INSTITUTION]\" will provide a mostly inaccurate paragraph that includes some true personally identifiable information. This works for me and some others who have a web presence such as have published peer reviewed literature but are not in any way famous. [They have an online demo that requires no registration, you can try it yourself here](https://chat.lmsys.org/).\n\nIt seems at the very least it would be challenging to justify the use of such a tool under the GDPR. As I understand it all the information within the network is used to answer every question, even if just as far as \"do not use this bit of the network\". Therefore any use could be classed as the processing of personal data. Therefore if one wanted to download and experiment with such a model the easiest way would be to rely on the Household Activities exception. However it is not totally clear what would and would not be counted. What information could we use to try and determine if such a use was legal, and what the limits would be?\n\nPrevious Reaserch\n\n[The ICO has a page on the exceptions](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions/) but that explicitly does not cover domestic purposes: \"This is simply because they are not covered by the UK GDPR\". It gives the topic two sentences, the first repeats the law and the second give a couple of examples that are not relevant here.\n\n[There is a denied FOI request](https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2019/2615778/fs50807165-1.pdf) for \"any policy, guidance, lines\\-to\\-take or other material you hold on the scope of the exemption contained in GDPR art 2(2\\)(c) and/ or recital 18\" with the denial based on this information appearing in guidance including \"a final published version\". However I cannot find this guidance with either Google or the ICO website search.\n\n[There is a case from the Netherlands](https://www.fff-legal.com/the-household-exemption-in-gdpr/) that excludes posting photos of one's child on social media from the household use exception. While this may not directly relate to my question, it does illustrate the the exception can be interpreted quite narrowly. It rather surprised me as posting photos of one's children seems to be quite a big bit of social media.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The household exemption is part of Art 2 GDPR, which lays out the subject matter scope. Clearly, the use of LLMs and other technologies can be GDPR\\-covered processing of personal data, unless this is done \u201cby a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity\u201d. You cited Recital 18, which provides a bit more background, and gives correspondence, keeping addresses, and some social media use as examples of personal or household activities.\n\nThere is some CJEU case law on the GDPR household exemption.\n\nIn *Lindqvist* (C\\-101/01\\), the court noted:\n\n> 47\\. That exception must therefore be interpreted as relating only to activities which are carried out in the course of private or family life of individuals, which is clearly not the case with the processing of personal data consisting in publication on the internet so that those data are made accessible to an indefinite number of people.\n\nThat case was about a personal blog about the lives of coworkers. It would likely have been fine for that person to keep a personal diary of those matters, but here the problem was publication to the internet. Since *anyone* could read it, the blog was not purely personal.\n\nA decade later in *Rynes* (C\u2011212/13\\), the court noted that the legislators' use of the word \"purely\" requires this exception to be interpreted narrowly:\n\n> 30\\. The fact that Article 3(2\\) of Directive 95/46 falls to be narrowly construed has its basis also in the very wording of that provision, under which the directive does not cover the processing of data where the activity in the course of which that processing is carried out is a \u2018purely\u2019 personal or household activity, that is to say, not simply a personal or household activity.\n\nSuch a narrow interpretation is also necessary to maintain the data subject's fundamental rights.\n\nNote that Directive 95/46 is the old Data Protection Directive which was replaced by the GDPR. It contains a household exception that is worded virtually identically to the one in the GDPR, so these old CJEU judgments remain directly applicable. They also remain relevant in the UK, as all of this predates Exit Day.\n\nTo my knowledge there has not been any further guidance on the household exception, neither by the ICO nor by the EDPB. This is also because these data protection agencies do not make law or policy, but merely apply it. It is up to courts to correctly interpret the household exception. In the Dutch case you mention (for [GDPRHub has more details](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=Rb._Gelderland_-_C/05/368427) and the [original judgement is here](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/#!/details?id=ECLI:NL:RBGEL:2020:2521)), the court does not explain why exactly the household exemption wouldn't apply, but the narrow interpretation seems in line with the CJEU case law. I want to highlight in particular that the defendant in that case failed to demonstrate that the personal data in question wasn't accessible to an \"indefinite number of people\", to borrow the expression from the Lindqvist case.\n\nMy personal opinion is that this \"indefinite number of people\" aspect provides the clearest criterion for whether the household exception might apply. If processing activities are not shared at all, or only made available to close friends and family, there's a good chance the exception might apply. In the LLM context, to the degree that their use constitutes processing of personal data, running such models for personal amusement or out of personal curiosity is probably fine. It might also be OK to share such outputs in a closed chat group. But creating them for non\\-personal purposes (e.g. employment purposes) or disseminating them to the public could cause GDPR to apply. LLMs are far from the only scenario where such difficult questions arise. Another fun topic is the degree to which the use of LinkedIn is GDPR compliant (since no one uses that platform for purely personal purposes), or how large a friend group's Discord server can grow while still counting as \"purely personal\".\n\nIf the household exception doesn't apply, this means that data processing activities have to be performed in compliance with the GDPR. This doesn't generally means that they would be illegal. However, the use of AI models does pose some potential challenges:\n\n* What is the legal basis for *training* the models? Perhaps there is a *legitimate interest* for using publicly available data, maybe not. Can an unlawfully trained model still be used lawfully?\n* What is the legal basis for using the models for *inference*? This will depend massively on the *purpose* for which the models are used.\n* How does the use of (potentially wrong) AI output interact with the Art 5(1\\)(d) accuracy principle and the Art 22 restrictions on automated individual decision\\-making?\n* To which degree are *prompts* other people's personal data? How does this interact with the legal basis used for inference? Whose personal data is the output?", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A data enthusiast, Alice, has downloaded an open-source large language model (LLM) to her personal computer. She uses it to generate information about her colleagues and shares the outputs with her close friends via a private messaging app. Under the GDPR's household exemption, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Alice's use of the LLM is definitely covered by the household exemption because she's using it on her personal computer.\n\nB) Alice's use of the LLM is not covered by the household exemption because LLMs always process personal data of many individuals.\n\nC) Alice's use of the LLM is likely covered by the household exemption as long as she doesn't share the outputs publicly or use them for professional purposes.\n\nD) Alice's use of the LLM is not covered by the household exemption because she's sharing information about her colleagues, which isn't a purely personal activity.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The household exemption applies to \"purely personal or household activities\" with no connection to professional or commercial activities. Alice's use of the LLM on her personal computer for curiosity and sharing with close friends via private messaging likely falls within this exemption. The key factors are:\n1) She's using it for personal purposes, not professional or commercial ones.\n2) She's sharing the outputs only with a limited group (close friends) rather than an \"indefinite number of people.\"\n3) The activity appears to be purely personal in nature.\n\nHowever, if Alice were to share this information publicly or use it for work-related purposes, the exemption would likely no longer apply. The narrow interpretation of the \"purely\" personal aspect, as highlighted in the Rynes case, supports this conclusion. Options A and B are too absolute in their statements, while D is incorrect because sharing information about colleagues with close friends can still be considered a personal activity in this context."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49301/trouble-interpreting-this-wording", "docs_id": 49301, "title": "Trouble interpreting this wording", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> Expired temporary certificates.

According to legal principles, if a police officer acts unlawfully, the affected individual (in this case, the aunt who was driving) may have the right to pursue legal action through proper channels. This could involve filing a complaint or potentially a lawsuit, but it must be done by the person directly involved (the aunt) and would require evidence of intentional wrongdoing.\n\nOption A is incorrect and illegal, as seeking personal revenge against a police officer is not allowed in any country. Option B is also incorrect, as immediate personal lawsuits against officers without investigation are not typically permitted. Option D is too extreme, as police officers do not have absolute immunity, though they do have certain protections when performing their duties.\n\nIt's important to note that based on the limited information provided, it's unlikely the officer acted improperly if the aunt was indeed driving without a license.

However, after reading the rather lengthy details of this Charter, it appears as if there are too many areas which leave the government \\- therefore, the healthcare workers \\- loopholes to make the decision for the family. However, this Charter does make it clear that the patient has many more rights than what were apparently available to them before this time. Example, one bullet points out that \"As per Supreme Court, all hospitals both governmental and private, are duty\\-bound to provide basic emergency medical care, and injured patients have the right to get emergency medical care.\" I would be extremely cautious, about the entire Charter. As one is able to discern by reading this simple example, they leave plenty of room for their own discretion as well. What I mean is this: though these hospitals are duty\\-bound to provide emergency medical care, this Charter does not provide for the level of care that these caregivers are duty\\-bound to give to these patients. A good provision is \"Such care must be initiated without demand for payment in advance, and the basic care should be given to the patient regardless of the ability to pay.\" Another point to pay attention to: Care must be \"initiated\" without demand in advance.\" No provision says they cannot stop the care and demand payment in full before continuing. Next, this provision states that \"the basic care should be given....\" So, when I am in an emergent situation, I expect the best care, not the basic care. However, in a few places I shall not name, basic is the best they provide.\nFurther into the Charter, one finds what you may be up against, \"Right to Confidentiality, Human Dignity, and Privacy.\" That is the 5th point, in succession. I'm of the opinion that the family may be facing quite the difficulty, as this provision states in the first bullet point: \"All patients have the right to privacy and doctors have a duty to hold information about their health conditions and treatment plans in the strictest confidence.\" The 15th condition in the Charter provides this: \"Right to Take Discharge of Patient....\" The bullet point, \"A patient has the right to take the discharge and cannot be detained in a hospital, on procedural grounds such as a dispute in payment of hospital charges.\"\nApparently, as I was prepossessed on this matter, the patient has all of these rights \\- the patient's family does not seem to possess any particular right to the patient in India even, in the hospital.\nResource:\nDo you know your rights as a patient?

The property and interests in property of an\n> entity that is 50 percent or more directly or indirectly owned,\n> whether individually or in the aggregate, by one or more persons on\n> the SDN List are also blocked, regardless of whether the entity itself\n> is listed.\n\nIn the case of Iran, the sanctions are much broader, but not universal. Bear in mind that a service provider may take an action which is not absolutely mandated by US law, out of an abundance of caution and fear of misinterpreting the law.

The impact of sanctions can vary greatly depending on their specific nature and scope. As seen with examples like Iran, sanctions don't always result in a complete cutoff of services. There are often exceptions for personal communications and data, and companies may obtain licenses to continue certain operations. While access might be restricted, provisions are often made for users to retrieve their personal data. The example of GitHub eventually obtaining a license to operate in Iran, after initial restrictions, demonstrates that the situation can evolve and that total loss of access is not inevitable.

Without affirmative legislation, each budget cycle, it doesn't happen.\n\nThe distinction is important because the U.S. federal legislative process is frequently gridlocked with divided control with the President's political party (which has veto power), or with a division of partisan control between the two houses of Congress, each of which have veto power over the legislative process.\n\nIt takes the approval of both houses of Congress and the President to pass legislation except in the case of a rare veto override or a Senate and President approved treaty, which requires a two\\-thirds majority, and appropriations bills have to start in the U.S. House.

Original jurisdiction of the US Supreme Court cannot be limited (nor expanded) by the US Congress, but the appellate jurisdiction can.\n\nMy understanding is as follows: the US Supreme Court's original jurisdiction is not necessarily exclusive, and thus other courts can also have original jurisdiction over these cases, which is known as concurrent jurisdiction. The plaintiff can thus choose the court in which he files the lawsuit. If the plaintiff chose to start the case not in the US Supreme Court, but rather in another court having original jurisdiction, then the US Supreme Court could have only appellate jurisdiction over such case.\n\nIs it correct?\n\nIf so, could the US Congress strip the US Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction over cases over which the US Supreme Court has original jurisdiction?\n\n*Edit: In an already deleted answer, It was argued that SCOTUS' original and appellate jurisdiction is mutually\\-exclusive, according to [Marbury v.

The reasoning behind this rule is that if there is concurrent jurisdiction, there is no legally cognizable harm in doing so in the judgment of Congress, and if the state court lacks jurisdiction, then the lack of jurisdiction can be appealed in the state court action and a new federal case can be commenced in a court with jurisdiction over the case.\n\nIf SCOTUS decided that a limitation on its appellate jurisdiction in this case was unconstitutional, as a practical matter, no one else could overrule its decision, so, effectively, it would have to consent to the limitation.\n\nA closely related unresolved question of constitutional law is whether Congress has the power to deprive all courts of jurisdiction over some particular otherwise justiciable legal right necessarily established by the U.S. Constitution as an end run around amending the U.S. Constitution.

Option B is also incorrect as it contradicts the court's ability to grant extensions or additional opportunities in the interest of fairness and justice.\n\nIt's important to note that if there's a pattern of missing deadlines that appears capricious, malicious, or tactical, the court might take a different approach. However, based on the information provided, the judge's order appears to be a reasonable application of legal principles aimed at ensuring a fair process for both parties."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87074/does-8-usc-1409a-grant-citizenship-or-take-away-citizenship", "docs_id": 87074, "title": "Does 8 USC &#167;1409(a) grant citizenship or take away citizenship?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a person is born outside the US to a US citizen father and a non\\-US national mother, and the parents are not married to each other, then there are certain special requirements in order for the child to be a US citizen. Under [8 USC \u00a71409(a)(3\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1409#a_3), one of the requirements is that the father must agree in writing to provide financial support for the child until they reach the age of 18\\. If all the conditions of [8 USC \u00a71409(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1409#a) are met, then [8 USC \u00a71401(g)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1401#g) applies \"as of the date of birth\" of the person, i.e., they are considered a US citizen from birth.\n\nThus, the person's citizenship is conditional upon a particular act that must be performed before they reach the age of 18\\. As long as the father has written down somewhere, prior to the child's 18th birthday, that they agree to support the child financially until the age of 18 (or even just signed such an agreement written by someone else), this condition is fulfilled and the child is a citizen if all other conditions are met. If the child is over the age of 18 but has such a document in their possession that is dated before their 18th birthday, they can use it to prove that the condition was met and that they are a US citizen. However, if by the time the child turns 18 the father is still alive but has never made such a written agreement, then the child is not a US citizen.\n\nThere are two ways to interpret the law:\n\n1. It grants citizenship. If, at some point between the child's birth and the child's 18th birthday, all the conditions of 8 USC \u00a71409(a) are fulfilled, then the law grants citizenship to such child, and this grant is retroactive to their birth. (This interpretation raises the constitutional question of whether such a citizen would be eligible for the presidency.)\n2. It takes away citizenship. The child is born a citizen, but if the child reaches the age of 18 and the conditions have not been met, their citizenship is taken away by operation of law. It is constitutional for Congress to provide for the loss of citizenship of individuals who were born outside the US and not naturalized in the US. See [*Rogers v. Bellei*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_v._Bellei). However, this interpretation seems less likely to me. I would normally think that if Congress had intended to write a law that takes away citizenship, they would be a bit more explicit about it. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that a person who is still under the age of 18 and for whom the condition still *could* be met in the future could claim current US citizenship in e.g. removal proceedings.\n\nWhich interpretation is correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Constitutionally, a person is only required to be granted U.S. citizenship if they are born in the United States. Any other form of citizenship is as provided by statute. So, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409 makes some people citizens who would not otherwise be citizens in its absence. In that sense, it grants citizenship.\n\nMeanwhile, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409(g) supports the proposition, which is a legal fiction in some cases, that someone is a \"natural born citizen\" of the United States, and hence eligible to run for President someday, and is retroactively considered to have been a citizen in the meantime for myriad other purposes, despite the fact that in the case of an unmarried non\\-citizen mother and a citizen father, this right is not vested and could never come into being if the required actions aren't taken after the fact.\n\nIncidentally, this statute has been upheld against constitutional challenges. *[Miller v. Albright](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/523/420/case.pdf)*, 520 U.S. 420 (1997\\).\n\nSo, while you would like to clearly distinguish between someone having citizenship granted and having citizenship revoked, Congress, in its wisdom, has not been so accommodating and has declined to clearly distinguish between the two interpretations.\n\nThis statute is a bit like the question of [Schr\u00f6dinger's cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat), who is indeterminately alive and dead at the same time until there is a measurement of its state, in quantum physics.\n\nA person with an unmarried non\\-citizen mother and a citizen father is both a U.S. citizen from birth and always has been, and has never been a citizen of the U.S., until the situation is resolved with an actual determination of the question in accordance with the requirements of the statute.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A child is born abroad to an unmarried U.S. citizen father and a non-U.S. citizen mother.

According to 8 USC \u00a71409(a), a child born abroad to an unmarried U.S. citizen father and a non-U.S. citizen mother has conditional citizenship. One of the key requirements is that the father must agree in writing to provide financial support for the child until they reach the age of 18.

If I add \"this is my opinion, you can come to your own conclusions\", does this still leave me vulnerable to a defamation lawsuit? How so? If I am not expression a statement of fact, and I deliberately say it's my own opinion, how can I still be?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As others have said, this is jurisdiction dependent. The following is from a US perspective.\n\nIn short, you can't say \" a developer is bad\" (which a reasonable person would interpret as referring to the developer's skills, professionalism or character), and not risk a lawsuit.\n\nMerely labeling something as your opinion, does not make it statement of opinion. The difference between fact and opinion is that a statement of fact is falsifiable according, while an statement of opinion is not. This is especially relevant because under US law, proving falseness of the offending statement is a required portion of the plaintiff's case.\n\nNote that the above statement is not only potentially defamatory, but (in my non\\-lawyer opinion) seems likely defamation *per se* (which means that the plaintiff does not need to prove actual damage from the statement).\n\nFor example, in TRONFELD v. NATIONWIDE MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY ([https://caselaw.findlaw.com/va\\-supreme\\-court/1194415\\.html](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/va-supreme-court/1194415.html)), the statement that a lawyer \"just takes peoples' money\" was found to be inherently defamatory *per se*.\n\nThat's not necessarily to say that a lawsuit would necessarily prevail (the developer would have to prove the statement, that they (and/or presumably their work and/or skills) are not \"bad\", on the balance of probabilities), but it would clear the bar that the statement was not an opinion, and so could not be dismissed on those grounds.\n\nOne might be legally safer, if one very much wants to complain about a developer, to mention easier to verify **true** statements (e.g. if work was not completed to specification, or to contracted schedule), or genuine unverifiable opinions (e.g. \"I was not satisfied with the work; I thought the graphic was ugly\", because ugly is subjective).\n\nNote that there are not \"magic words\"; context matters.

Even though the statement is labeled as an opinion and invites others to form their own conclusions, it could still be considered potentially defamatory. This is because:\n\n1.

The statement \"developer John Doe is bad at his job\" could be interpreted as referring to his professional skills, which may be considered a statement of fact rather than opinion.\n3. In US law, the distinction between fact and opinion is based on whether the statement is falsifiable, not on how it's labeled.\n4. The statement could potentially be considered defamation per se, as it relates to the developer's professional competence.\n5.

Given that, if someone confessed a crime (major or minor) the priest could not report that individual to the police (i.e. act on his own will). \n\nI understand that a defendant's attorney could not be forced by a judge to sit in front of a grand jury and disclose what was exchanged between the defendant and even if the attorney accidentally revealed that the defendant did commit the crime, it would have to be removed from record because that is privileged information. \n\nMy question is: Are priests held to the same standard? Can a judge (federal, state, etc.) order a priest to sit in front of a grand jury and disclose what was said in confession? And if the judge did and the priest refused, would the priest be held in contempt? Does this apply to all states in the US? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Confidential statements made in confession to a religious advisor are privileged in every U.S. state and in federal court. \n\nThere is a body of law that surrounds each kind of privilege (attorney\\-client, psychotherapist\\-patient, doctor\\-patient, priest\\-parishioner, accountant\\-client, husband\\-wife) that covers exceptions to the general rule. At least a couple of privileges (attorney\\-client and husband\\-wife) actually involve more than one distinct privilege: attorney\\-client privilege has a confidential communications component and a work product component that have different rules; a husband\\-wife privilege has a confidential communications component and a 5th Amendment like component that allows one spouse to refuse to permit the other current spouse to testify against him or her.\n\nThe privilege for confessions made to priests is generally speaking, broader than the attorney\\-client privilege. Both attorney\\-client privileges have crime\\-fraud and prevention of imminent harm exceptions that do not apply to priests. The work product component of the attorney\\-client privilege also has an exception when work product is the sole available source of critical information available by no other means (e.g. due to the fact that destructive testing was conducted on evidence).\n\nA judge cannot order a priest to disclose to a grand jury or any other tribunal or official, what was said in confession, and the priest could not be held in contempt for not testifying in this manner. Indeed, even if, for example, a secret microphone had been placed on a suspect and captured his confession to a priest, the recording of that conversation would not be admissible as evidence in any legal forum due to the privilege.\n\nOften, as in the case of a seal of confessional for a Roman Catholic priest, a privilege is also accompanied by a duty on the part of the person receiving the confidential information to keep the information disclosed confidential. But, the duty to keep privileged communications confidential does not always exactly match the scope of the privilege. \n\nFor example, a Mormon minister's religious obligation to keep confessions confidential might not be precisely the same as those of a Roman Catholic priest, even though confessions to either one would be privileged from compulsory disclosure in a court or other tribunal. Similarly, confidential communications to an attorney can be disclosed by an attorney in furtherance of the representation in a way that a confidential communication to a priest usually could not be disclosed.\n\nIn at least some jurisdictions, the priest could probably be compelled to testify regarding whether an individual came to a place at a given time to confess (which would establish alibi or lack thereof, and proximity to the time scene at a particular time) since that itself wouldn't be a confidential matter shared with the priest and could have been witnesses by anyone else in the church building who was not a part of the confession whether it not it actually was witnessed by anyone else. In such a jurisdiction, if the priest refused to testify regarding that matter, the priest could be held in contempt of court just like any other witness under a subpoena who refused to testify.\n\nThe law is not entirely clear over the extent that the priest\\-parishioner privilege is mandated solely by a statute, common law rule, or court rule (as the case may be from state to state, this varies considerably), and to which extent the statute, common law rule, or court rule providing for the privilege is constitutionally mandated by the free exercise clause of the 1st Amendment to the United States Constitution (incorporated to apply to the states through the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution), and by parallel state constitutional provisions.\n\nThe question of whether the priest\\-parishioner privilege is constitutionally mandated matters because some states, in the wake of scandals involving sexual abuse of children by clergy, have sought to extend the requirement that a designated person knowing of instances of child abuse must report their suspicions to authorities, that applies to many kinds of licensed professionals who deal with children in most states, to religious officials who deal with children and their supervisors and colleagues in their churches or denominations.\n\nIf the question is constitutional, it might be the case that these laws would be unconstitutional. Middle ground might find that there might be a duty of someone taking a confession from a priest to report child abuse (because this is an abuse by the priest of the privilege of receiving privileged confessions), but not a duty to report child abuse disclosed in confession by anyone else. Of course, if there is no constitutional dimension to the privilege, the legislature is free to modify it with legislation as they see fit.\n\nThere is also an issue in every particular privilege regarding whom the privilege belongs to, and hence, who has a right to legally waive a privilege and allow testimony concerning the confidential communications to be provided. It might belong to the person making the confession, it might belong to the priest, or it might belong to both (hence requiring mutual consent for a waiver of privilege and not just consent by one individual who holds the privilege).

This privilege is generally broader than other forms of privilege, such as attorney-client privilege. A judge cannot order a priest to disclose what was said in confession to any tribunal or official, including a grand jury. The priest cannot be held in contempt for refusing to testify about the contents of a confession. While some jurisdictions might compel a priest to testify about non-confidential matters (such as whether someone came to confess at a certain time), the actual content of the confession remains privileged and protected from disclosure."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4510/can-you-sue-yourself-for-wrongful-death-without-admitting-manslaughter", "docs_id": 4510, "title": "Can you sue yourself for wrongful-death without admitting manslaughter?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Prompted by [a comment in another question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4476/can-you-sue-minors-only-in-america#comment8061_4476), the story of a woman suing herself came to my attention.\n\n[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/02/19/utah\\-appeals\\-court\\-allows\\-woman\\-to\\-sue\\-herself\\-over\\-fatal\\-car\\-crash/](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/02/19/utah-appeals-court-allows-woman-to-sue-herself-over-fatal-car-crash/)\n\n> **Suit yourself: Utah court lets woman sue herself over fatal wreck**\n> \n> \n> A Utah woman will be the plaintiff and the defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit that has legal experts scratching their heads.\n> \n> \n> Barbara Bagley was driving her family's Range Rover Dec. 27, 2011 on Interstate 80 near Battle Mountain, Nev., when it slid on sagebrush on Interstate 80, and flipped.

It is not really a textbook, however, so much as a resource used by both law students and practicing lawyers and judges.\n\nThe editor of all editions of it since 1996 is Bryan A. Garner, who is also the leading authority on what constitutes good modern legal writing (which in some cases violate outdated elementary school usage rules like never starting a sentence with a conjunction).\n\nLaw textbooks are subject\\-matter specific, and there is no one class in which legal terms are taught. In contacts class, law students learn contracts related terms. In property class, law students learn property related terms. In torts class, law students learn torts related terms.\n\n> I am sure in law classes, legal terms are defined.\n\nNot really. Your assumption is more false than true.\n\nU.S. legal instruction is typically conducted using the Socratic method and with a review of the leading appellate court cases and the key statutory language in each subject.\n\nRather than having the textbook define a term, it is far more common for students in a class to read four appellate court cases addressing a subject, none of which define a term, and for the professor to ask a student chosen at random what that term means, often probing the student with follow up questions for fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\nUsually, the final conclusion is not stated outright either by the professor or the textbook in textbook author provided text, although the cases referenced and statutes referenced will often provide one or more than one definition for a term, not necessarily consistent ones.\n\nLaw professors in the U.S., collectively, take the attitude that there is no absolute meaning for anything and that it is a waste of time to teach specific legal rules or doctrines which may change over the course of a student's career. Instead, they focus on teaching how to argue over close call gray areas in the law and how to identify legal issues, with the idea that the clear black and white rules of law are easy to learn after you graduate from law school when and if you need to do so.\n\nThere are books called \"legal outlines\" and \"treatises\" which are more direct than law professors and textbooks in providing answers in a particular subject, as are bar exam review materials. But, again, it is important to understand the nature of the beast before you use them.\n\n> I am a mathematician who likes terms to be defined precisely. I am\n> sure in law classes, legal terms are defined. If it turns out that\n> pretty much every law textbook defines terms precisely, then I will\n> simply check Google.\n\nThis is a fool's errand (I was an undergraduate math major myself before becoming a lawyer).\n\nThis is because legal terms don't have a single consistent meaning. The same word or phrase can and often does mean different things in different contexts.\n\nMany legal terms defined in Black's Law dictionary have multiple meanings stated and it is not at all uncommon for a statute or contract to define a word in a new and unconventional way.\n\nI probably draft contacts with novel definitions for words at least a few times every year. There are a million or so U.S. lawyers, and tens of thousands of federal, state and local legislators out there further complicating affairs each year, in addition to thousands of judges whose decisions may coin new legal terms or new meanings for existing legal terms. This is why these resources need to be updated regularly.\n\nFor example, there is no one consistent definition of the word \"person\" which is widely used in a variety of statutes and regulations and contracts.\n\nAs another example, the term \"security\" means something very different in the law of securities regulation, where it refers to investments made by passive investors and traded in secondary markets, than it does in the law of secured transactions, where it means collateral for an obligation. Likewise, in bankruptcy law, national defense law, criminal law or tort law, the term security means something entirely different in each separate context.\n\nAs a third example, the term \"equity\" can have very different meanings depending upon context. It can mean the value of something net of debt to which it is subject. It can refer the the jurisprudence of courts of chancery before equity jurisprudence and law jurisprudence were merged in the 19th century which is relevant to the constitutional right to a jury trial in federal court and to the kinds of defenses that can be asserted in response to a claim. Or, it can refer to ownership interests in entities as distinct from debt interests in entities, as a third and not comprehensive list of meanings.\n\nCommon law countries, in particular (i.e. those countries with legal systems derived from those of England) are notorious for their inconsistent use of terminology, which is rather more consistent in civil law countries due to the way that civil codes are drafted.\n\nAlso keep in mind the famous quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.:\n\n> The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.\n\nIn law, the fact that A implies B and that B implies C does not necessarily mean that A implies C. The law simply isn't that consistent and logical. You can't follow long chains of logical reasoning in the law with any confidence. Generally, only fact specific applications of the law that involve fact patterns similar to your own are reliable, and the law is also sometimes just plain inconsistent even when applied to the same set of facts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes how legal terms are typically taught and defined in U.S. law schools?\n\nA) Legal terms are precisely defined in textbooks for each subject area, similar to mathematics textbooks.\n\nB) There is a single comprehensive course that teaches all important legal terms and their definitions.\n\nC) Legal terms are primarily learned through reading appellate court cases and engaging in Socratic discussions, often without explicit definitions.\n\nD) Professors provide students with a standardized legal dictionary that contains consistent definitions for all terms across different areas of law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The passage indicates that U.S. legal instruction typically uses the Socratic method and review of appellate court cases.

I always thought that impersonating a police officer was a very serious crime under English law, but they don't seem to get arrested or punished, despite widely publicising their pranks in videos seen by millions of people. They also seem to commit the separate crime of wasting police time, for example by approaching cops in the street and falsely confessing to crimes.\n\nMy question is, is impersonating a police officer only illegal in some circumstances? (They notably aren't using the costume to get any kind of benefit or con anyone) Are they just lucky not to get arrested? Or is it simply that the police don't charge them because the negative PR of arresting beloved YouTube personalities who are very popular with young people wouldn't be worth it?\n\nI guess I'm just amazed this is legal.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=yL8WUHewGM0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL8WUHewGM0)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's illegal *if* the intent is to deceive. Under [S50(1\\) of the Police Act 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/90):\n\n> Any person who with intent to deceive impersonates a member of a police force or special constable, or makes any statement or does any act calculated falsely to suggest that he is such a member or constable, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.\n\nTheir intent would need to be proven. It will be fact\\-specific; in some cases far easier to prove than in others. The criminal justice system is overburdened and underfunded so it is no surprise that these trolling videos are given no priority whatsoever.\n\nFurther complicating the matter is the need to correctly identify the individual to prosecute. Doing so would require a fair amount of police time, time that could perhaps be spent on more urgent priorities given the relative lack of harm these videos are doing compared to more serious crimes.\n\nHowever, in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM-OA9sXzLQ) (Would You Help a Police Officer Having An Asthma Attack?) an S50(2\\) offence would seem to have been committed by the actor wearing the police clothing:\n\n> Any person who, not being a constable, wears any article of police uniform in circumstances where it gives him an appearance so nearly resembling that of a member of a police force as to be calculated to deceive shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.\n\nIt does appear that both offences are being committed in these various videos, and the only reason people aren't being prosecuted is practical: there are more serious crimes to focus on, and the police would need to identify who exactly committed this crime\\-\\-given these all happened at least two years ago, it would be challenging to say the least.\n\n> They also seem to commit the separate crime of wasting police time, for example by approaching cops in the street and falsely confessing to crimes.\n\nUnder [S5(2\\) of the Criminal Law Act 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/section/5), wasting police time is a criminal offence. Bringing proceedings in court requires the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) since those proceedings could have a chilling effect on the propensity of the public to report genuine matters to the police in the future.\n\nIt is likely that while \"wasteful employment\" of police time was caused by these people, so committing the offence, it is likely viewed simply as \"part and parcel\" of the job and the officer likely didn't spend any time at all investigating the confessions (depending on their nature).\n\nOf course, even if the officer *did* spend time investigating the false confessions, the DPP would need to give their consent so unless the person has a demonstrated history of doing this (that would stand up in court) *or* the time wasted was of a particularly serious nature (e.g. the man who falsely claimed to be the Yorkshire Ripper), it seems unlikely consent would be granted.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the Police Act 1996, which of the following scenarios would most likely result in a successful prosecution for impersonating a police officer?\n\nA) A person wears a realistic police uniform to a costume party, but does not interact with anyone as if they were a real officer.\n\nB) A YouTuber films a prank video wearing a police uniform, clearly stating at the beginning that it's a prank and not involving real members of the public.\n\nC) An individual wears a police uniform and attempts to gain free entry to a nightclub by claiming to be an off-duty officer.\n\nD) A person wears a partial police uniform (just the hat) while performing a comedic skit on stage.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key element in successfully prosecuting someone for impersonating a police officer under S50(1) of the Police Act 1996 is proving the \"intent to deceive.\" Option C presents a clear case where the individual is using the police uniform with the intent to deceive others for personal gain (free entry to a nightclub). This scenario demonstrates both the wearing of the uniform and an act \"calculated falsely to suggest that he is such a member or constable.\"\n\nOption A lacks the intent to deceive, as the person is merely attending a costume party. Option B, while involving wearing a police uniform, explicitly states it's a prank and doesn't involve deceiving the public. Option D involves only partial use of a police uniform in a clearly theatrical context, which is unlikely to be seen as an attempt to deceive.\n\nThe nightclub scenario in Option C is the most likely to result in prosecution as it clearly demonstrates the intent to deceive for personal benefit, fulfilling the requirements of the law."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28839/can-a-data-controller-change-their-privacy-policy-without-explicit-consent", "docs_id": 28839, "title": "Can a data controller change their privacy policy without explicit consent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: While I read one of the updated privacy policies (PP) this week, the following [section of a privacy policy seemed\u2026 off](https://www.humblebundle.com/privacy#policy-changes):\n\n> We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and all changes will be effective at the time we post them.

The GDPR requires concent to be explicit, specific, freely given, and informed. This particular privacy policy does not measure up to *any* of these requirements.\n\nThe GDPR goes to great lengths to regulate consent. For instance, in Article 7 (2\\) is says:\n\n> Any part of such a declaration \\[of consent] which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.\n\nSo if the consent obtained is *not* explicit, specific, freely given, and informed, and the company relies on *consent* to ensure lawfulness of processing, it is breaking the law (and may be fined under the GDPR).\n\nThe big problem with this privacy policy is this sentence:\n\n> Your continued access to or use of any of the Services shall be deemed your acceptance of the Privacy Policy.\n\nAs you've noted, the GDPR requires consent to be *explicit*. What \"explicit\" means is spelled out in Recital 32, which (among other things) says:\n\n> Silence, pre\\-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent.\n\nAnd Recital 32 goes on state that consent must be *specific*:\n\n> When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them.\n\nThe full privacy policy lists 16 different purposes for which personal data is collected, but do not seek specific consent for *any* of them.\n\nConsent under GDPR must also be *freely given*. Recital 42 says (among other things):\n\n> Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\n\nHere the company states that continued use of the service \"shall be deemed your acceptance\". The only way the data subject can refuse consent is to *not* use the service, which is to the detriment of the data subject. This also makes the consent invalid.\n\nFinally, the GDPR also requires consent to be *informed*. What this means is spelled out in Recital 42, which (among other things say):\n\n> For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least \\[...] the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended.\n\nHere the data subject is supposed to consent to some unknown, future change which may be to allow different purposes of the processing.

That seems absurd but I am not a tax attorney). \n\n* Has anyone in this forum encountered such a far reaching statute?\n* Do you have any suggestions as to what to state in our appeal to the WI Commission?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I wouldn't be surprised to see other states and jurisdictions with similar statutes.\n\nFortunately, in the United States, there is a *safe harbor* against demands for state income taxes: For every dollar of taxable income, you can only be taxed by one state. (This was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2015 in [Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller_of_the_Treasury_of_Maryland_v._Wynne).) Therefore, if you show that the LLC (or its members if it's a pass\\-through) paid taxes to another state on the income in question (e.g., by sending a copy of the tax return), that's legally the end of the matter.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A Utah-based LLC providing cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) to customers across the United States is assessed for partnership income tax by the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. The assessment is based on the claim that the company has nexus for income tax in Wisconsin due to providing services that benefit Wisconsin-based companies. Which of the following statements is the most effective legal argument for the LLC to contest this tax assessment?\n\nA) The LLC is not physically present in Wisconsin and therefore cannot be subject to Wisconsin's income tax.\n\nB) Cloud-based services are not covered under Wisconsin's tax laws, so the LLC is exempt from Wisconsin income tax.\n\nC) The LLC can demonstrate that it has already paid taxes on the income in question to Utah, invoking the safe harbor principle affirmed in Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne.\n\nD) The LLC should argue that its services are provided from Utah, and Wisconsin customers are purchasing from Utah, not within Wisconsin.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most effective legal argument is option C. The safe harbor principle, affirmed by the Supreme Court in Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne (2015), states that for every dollar of taxable income, a business can only be taxed by one state. If the LLC can prove it has already paid taxes on the income in question to Utah (its home state), this would legally end Wisconsin's claim to tax the same income. This argument directly addresses the constitutional protection against double taxation and provides a strong legal basis to contest Wisconsin's tax assessment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because physical presence is not the only factor determining tax nexus, especially for digital services. Option B is speculative and likely incorrect, as many states have updated their tax laws to include digital and cloud-based services. Option D, while a reasonable argument, may not be sufficient given Wisconsin's broad interpretation of \"doing business\" in the state, which includes providing services that benefit Wisconsin-based companies."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67499/is-it-possible-to-create-a-non-profit-business-on-f-2-visa-status", "docs_id": 67499, "title": "Is it possible to create a non-profit business on F-2 visa status?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Consider a person comes to the US with an F\\-2 visa status and has a plan to get his/her green card in the next year, but at the moment he/she likes to start a commercial website or mobile app but for free, up to he/she could get his/her green card.\n\nIs it legal for him/her and won't cause a problem for him/his green card in the future?\n\nPS: By a free commercial website/mobile app I mean something like websites/applications those offer a free access for a period of time(Free trial), or offer a free access to some basic utilities(and charge users for money for premium access).

F-2 visa holders are not allowed to work, even for themselves, which rules out options A and C where Sarah would be developing the app herself. However, F-2 holders are allowed to act as investors, providing funds for others to create content or products, as long as the visa holder does not engage in any work-related activities. Option D is too restrictive, as F-2 holders are allowed to invest in projects.

Both are nomadic Sunni Muslim people with very traditional worldviews. Their *de facto* control of the region makes them the arbiters of justice there.\n\nRather than pursuing this murder through the courts of a nearby country (each of which is likely to ignore the murder), as a practical matter, the people present in Bir Tawil are very likely to treat the matter as one governed by Sunni Islamic law (which they view as universal in application) and to take justice into their own hands in accordance with the means prescribed by Islamic law (i.e. tribal leaders are likely to capture and behead him after a summary Islamic law proceeding).\n\nIn the alternative, to the extent that our stateless person's victim has come within the protection of a local clan, that clan may seek vengeance upon the murderer in order to protect the clan's honor.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the hypothetical scenario of a stateless person committing murder in Bir Tawil, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the likely outcome according to the information provided?\n\nA) The Egyptian government would arrest and prosecute the murderer under Egyptian law.\n\nB) The United Nations would intervene and establish a special tribunal to try the case.\n\nC) Local tribal leaders would likely capture the murderer and administer justice according to their interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nD) The case would remain unresolved due to lack of jurisdiction by any recognized authority.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, Bir Tawil is controlled de facto by nomadic Sunni Muslim tribes (Ababda and Bishari). These tribes are likely to view the matter through the lens of Islamic law, which they consider universally applicable. The passage states that \"as a practical matter, the people present in Bir Tawil are very likely to treat the matter as one governed by Sunni Islamic law and to take justice into their own hands.\" This would likely involve tribal leaders capturing the murderer and administering justice through a summary Islamic law proceeding, potentially resulting in beheading.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Egypt does not claim jurisdiction over Bir Tawil and is unlikely to intervene. Option B is unrealistic as the UN typically doesn't establish tribunals for individual murder cases, especially in unclaimed territories. Option D is incorrect because, while there's no recognized national authority, the local tribal structure would likely address the crime rather than leaving it unresolved."}}
