Stipa](https://casetext.com/case/partello-v-stipa), 115 Idaho 522, where it is concluded that with respect to an agricultural exception to workman's comp, raising and sale of hunting dogs is not within the traditional definition of agriculture. Partello relies on legislative intent, which seems to run afoul of the Park district court thinking that it is unambiguous. The court notes this, saying\n\n> But it is equally clear that the legislature did not use the term in\n>  its generic sense, so as to include the raising of all domestic\n>  animals,. . . .\"). The Government's citation to Idaho case law and\n>  Idaho statutes referencing livestock and similar regulations, which do\n>  not appear to include domestic dogs, further yield support for its\n>  interpretation. *The Parks argument that these cases and statutes are\n>  limited to their particular legislative schemes or area of regulation\n>  ignores the last words of Clause 2(c) which references \"applicable\n>  State and local regulations\"*.\n\nSo since there is some statutory basis for concluding that dog raising is not livestock raising, and because of the end of clause 2(c), \"the Court concludes that they provide persuasive support for the Government's interpretation of the easement\" (but that support is not dispositive).\n\nIn the appeal, the court cited a case of an easement for \"swimming and boating\", which are not defined in the easement, which the Idaho Supreme Court found to be ambiguous ([Mountainview Landowners Coop](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2575574/mountainview-landowners-co-op-association-inc-v-cool/). Ass'n, 86 P.3d), relying on dictionary comparisons. The Park court then found similar uncertainty in the definition of \"livestock\", and indeed case law [Levine v. Conner](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1611717/levine-v-conner/), 540 F.Supp.2d 1113 stating that\n\n> the scope of domestic animals used or raised on a farm can potentially\n>  extend to guinea pigs, cats, dogs, fish, ants, and bees.\n\nAnd yet, \"we recognize that \u201clivestock\u201d has been used to describe a more limited set of animals such as cattle, horses, and pigs\". Various competing statutory definitions of \"livestock\" are cited. The court also finds that \"\\[t]he language in the easement does not provide us with any more clarity on the meaning of the term\". Idaho statutory definitions are beside the point:\n\n> But, even though we apply Idaho law to interpret an instrument of\n>  conveyance, see Benninger, 129 P.3d at 1238, it does not follow that\n>  the definitions of the terms of the easement will be the same as the\n>  definitions given in the Idaho Code.\n\nAnd thus the court concludes that \"livestock\" is ambiguous, and summary judgment was premature.\n\nThere is no general solution to the problem of ambiguity of \"livestock\" under contractual interpretation; a court could rule that the term is unambiguous, or that it is ambiguous. \n\nThe Idaho shooting statute [25\\-2806](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title25/t25ch28/sect25-2806/) does not say whether dogs are livestock, though the government in the Park case presumed that dogs are *excluded* from the class \"livestock\" (though I don't see that: the statute is vague). The cases cited w.r.t. dogs as livestock are in different parts of the Idaho statutes, and there does not seem to be any case law that has discovered legislative intent behind this particular law. The only way to know for sure is assume that dogs are livestock, rely on 25\\-2806, and take your chances at trial (if it's not clear, that would be a bad thing to do)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A rancher in Idaho keeps several large breed dogs on their property for the purpose of guarding livestock.

As the documentation shows, the definition of \"livestock\" can vary depending on context and has been subject to different interpretations in various cases. The Idaho shooting statute (25-2806) does not explicitly define whether dogs are considered livestock. Some cases have suggested a broader interpretation of livestock that could potentially include dogs, while others have used a narrower definition. Given this ambiguity, a court would likely need to interpret whether guard dogs can be considered \"livestock\" in the context of this statute, making the legality of the rancher's actions uncertain without a specific court ruling on this issue."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33390/do-short-quiz-questions-on-copyrighed-material-need-permission", "docs_id": 33390, "title": "Do short quiz questions on copyrighed material need permission?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I make a question and answer game based on a mix of popular licences such as *Harry Potter*, Marvel, *Lord Of The Rings* and so on, do I need rightsholder permission?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the United States, you almost certainly do. \n\nThe most on\\-point case is [*Castle Rock Entertainment Inc. v.

The publisher argued that the questions and answers were simply unprotected facts about the show, not copyrightable expression, but the court concluded that the facts were merely restatements of the expressive works of the show's creators. Although the book was in some senses transformative, the court found that the transformation was \"slight to non\\-existent\":\n\n> \\[T]he fact that The SAT so minimally alters *Seinfeld*'s original expression in this case is further evidence of The SAT's lack of transformative purpose.

It is commonly known as \"mail fraud\".\n\n[18 U.S. Code CHAPTER 47](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-47) is a US Federal law that prohibits a variety of false statements and false documents.\n\n[Section 1001 of this chapter](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001) prohibits false statements and documents \"in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States\" but I am not clear if this would apply in the case described in the question.\n\nOther sections of chapter 47 deal mostly with false statements made to the US Government, or to obtain money or benefits from the government, Or in connection with various particular regulated activities, and do not seem to apply to the case in the question.\n\nAccording to [the Justia article on *Fraud*](https://www.justia.com/criminal/offenses/white-collar-crimes/fraud/):\n\n> Federal fraud statutes, along with most state laws, require proof of a \u201cscheme or artifice\u201d to defraud.

The entire opinion, and the dissents, are well worth reading, if you wish to get a clearer understanding of how the Court has most recently interpreted the Second Amendment. \n\nA few specific comments:\n\n* \"The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a\nfirearm **unconnected with service in a militia**\" (p. 1\\).\n* The Court does not agree that \"militia\" should be understood as synonymous with \"National Guard\": \n\n> The \u201cmilitia\u201d comprised all males physically\n>  capable of acting in concert for the common defense.

(p. 2\\)\n* The Court, citing [*U.S. v. Miller*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/307/174), 307 U.S. 174, holds that the weapons protected are \"those in common use for lawful purposes\". There is some discussion on pages 55\\-56, in which the majority seems to explicitly deny that the Second Amendment grants a specific right to possess military weapons. Instead, they reason that historically \"the militia\" would have reported for duty with the sort of firearms they normally had at home, whether or not those were the preferred weapons for fighting a war, and so therefore the Second Amendment protects the right to bear \"household\" weapons, not military weapons. They seem to agree that laws banning \"dangerous and unusual weapons\" are constitutional, even if those weapons are in military use.

Heller held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess firearms unconnected with service in a militia. However, they also stated that this right is not unlimited. The Court indicated that the Second Amendment protects weapons \"in common use for lawful purposes,\" but does not necessarily extend to all military weapons. They specifically mentioned that bans on \"dangerous and unusual weapons\" can be constitutional, even citing M-16 rifles as an example of weapons that could be banned. The Court rejected the notion that \"militia\" only refers to organized state forces like the National Guard, and also did not establish any requirement for military training to own firearms.

The term \"premise\" is not defined in a general manner in title 7, though in the definition of \"dangerous dog\" and \"nuisance dog\", it is defined as \"the residence or residences, including buildings and land and motor vehicles, belonging to the owner or keeper of the dog or wolf hybrid\" (the primary question being whether \"the land\" is part of \"the premise\"). In light of the mixed definition of \"premise\" in Maine law and given the extant evidence of legislative intent in title 7, the courts would conclude that \"in the yard\" is being \"on the premise\". In other words, the dog is not \"at large\". [Chapter 727](https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/7/title7ch727sec0.html) contains separate provisions for a court determination that a dog is \"dangerous\" or \"a nuisance\", which is triggered by assault or threaten of bodily injury by a dog."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Maine, a landlord owns a multi-unit property where one tenant has a pit bull that is often off-leash in common areas.

The term \"premises\" is not clearly defined for this purpose, but based on the information provided, courts would likely interpret common areas of the rental property (such as the yard, foyer, and porch) as part of the \"premises\". Therefore, the dog can legally be off-leash in these areas. The situation could potentially change if the dog were to be declared \"dangerous\" or \"a nuisance\" by a court, but this requires specific incidents of assault or threats of bodily injury.

(The main exceptions are employees with written employment contracts usually in senior management, unionized employees and civil servants, which sometimes also limit schedule changes.)\n\nIf you are fired for cause, or quit, you are not entitled to unemployment benefits. But, if you are fired without cause, or you are \"constructively discharged\" then you are entitled to unemployment benefits. A \"constructive discharge\" colloquially speaking, means that conditions were made so bad for you that you were forced to quit.\n\nThere are also no rules limiting changes in schedules, assuming that each schedule allocates you the break time mandated by the Fair Labor Standards Act, and that you get paid overtime is you work sufficient hours to qualify for it under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nIt is conceivable that frequent changes in schedules could cause a \"constructive discharge\" although I've never encountered a case (personally or in reported case law) where that has happened because it is quite unusual behavior for an employer.\n\nUltimately, the logic of employment at will is that if your employer is not good to work for, that you should seek employment with another employer who is more tolerable.

There are no specific laws mentioned that restrict schedule changes or require advance notice. While the employer's behavior may be considered poor management practice, it is not explicitly illegal. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no indication that these actions violate any specific labor laws. Option B is false as there's no mention of a 24-hour notice requirement in Colorado law.

A natural person can have multiple nationalities, but the \"person\" is always the same, irrespective of the country where this person may have acquired citizenship. For example, I guess that in the absolute majority of cases a natural person needs to provide at least a birth certificate in order to obtain nationality in other countries, therefore proving that they are, indeed, the same \"natural person\" that is also registered in their birth country.\n\nHowever, does the same also apply to a legal person? I have the impression that, while the same company can open subsidiaries into different countries, they are regarded as different entities (each existing into each country that the main company has registered their subsidiaries).\n\nDo countries actually recognize that a local subsidiary (i.e. Google Ireland) is the same company as Google LLC in the US? Or they are, most of the time, treated as separate entities?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To the extent that a company does have subsidiaries and they are located in other countries, then yes, those should be treated as different companies because they are structured in that manner. This is fairly common for tax reasons, structural subordination, valuation, liability (legal) reasons, etc.\n\nTo the extent that it is one company with no subsidiaries or other related entities, operating in more than one country, then it comes down to the laws of each respective country. In international law, there is really no set in stone law but rather a bunch of vague treaties and understandings that countries are really not necessarily obligated to follow. There is no international army or police force so there isn't really any teeth to enforce much. Therefore, two countries could in theory say one company is a native of each of them \\- and the company could say they are native of a third country altogether. What matters more for these countries is the appearance of uniformity and the appearance that they are on the up and up and that they are reasonable and make sense. They also want to attract other companies to do business there and receive their tax revenues etc. This also means that the company must agree to pay those tax revenues. So what occurs is an gradual reversion to an acceptable mean, which we all view as the international law or standard and over time this has become more and more uniform for and amongst countries in the aggregate taking into account what businesses ultimately want too taking into account taxes etc.\n\nThe way it works from a liability standpoint etc. is that a parent company owns stock or shares or interest in the subordinate company so if the subordinate company makes money and this money is distributed to the parent there will be taxes accordingly. Also, if the subordinate owes something and can't pay the parent will lose its ownership if they do not transfer in money (bankruptcy means the creditors win not the stock/share/interest holders).\n\nSo, in short, they are recognized and treated as separate legal entities because they are only if they are. A single company can still do operations in multiple locations, but the advantages of structuring separate entities may be more important and more profitable (tax reasons etc.) Whether others will recognize entity relationships depends on the names for each etc. (or research conducted to find owners). A lot depends on the structure that the company sets up for itself which is governed by a host of issues as mentioned above."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A multinational corporation, XYZ Inc., has its parent company in the United States and a subsidiary, XYZ Ireland Ltd., in Ireland.

While XYZ Inc. and XYZ Ireland Ltd. are treated as separate legal entities (which is common for tax, liability, and structural reasons), their relationship is still recognized in important ways. The parent company (XYZ Inc.) owns stock or shares in the subsidiary (XYZ Ireland Ltd.), which has implications for taxation when profits are distributed and for liability if the subsidiary faces financial troubles. This structure allows for separate treatment in many legal and financial matters while still acknowledging the connection between the entities. Options A and B are incorrect because they represent extreme positions that don't reflect the nuanced reality of corporate structures across borders.

And also based on that:\n\nThere was a prior case (Romania v Ukraine on the Serpent Island in the Black Sea) in which the parties argued extensively around the article 121 definition, but the ICJ ignored those arguments *entirely*, and ruled instead that the island/rock in question could not be used to alter the provisional equidistance line between the two countries.\n\nAnd for some details on the Philippines\\-China case, the thesis has a pretty extensive analysis. The most relevant bits seem to be:\n\n> The Tribunal was of the view that \u201chabitation\u201d also implies that the insular feature must\n>  be inhabited by a group or community. Although Article 121(3\\) does not specify any specific\n>  number of people, the habitation of an insular feature by a sole person would not typically be\n>  considered human habitation in the ordinary sense.\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> The Tribunal was of the view\n>  that in order for an economic activity to be classified as the economic life of an insular feature,\n>  the resources on which the economic activity centres must be local as opposed to imported and\n>  must also be to the benefit of the economic activity in question.

This is a [frequent scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2017/03/dont-bank-check), where a forged check is presented and the victim is asked to buy something of value, and sent it to the scammers. (This is called the \"[secret shopper scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0053-mystery-shopper-scams)\"). The bank making money available is not a guarantee that the check is legitimate.\n\nThe problem with suing the bank in small claims court is that there will be an important question of fact, namely exactly what the bank's agent said to you. It is unlikely that they actually said \"The other bank has promised that this is a legitimate check which they will honor, so you can safely spend the money\". More likely, they implied that there is such an account, that there are funds to cover the check, an so on. It's only weeks later after the dust has settled (the account\\-holder has notified their bank that the check was forged) that the bank can apply the higher\\-level forensic tools needed to determine that the check was bogus. It is not particularly reasonable that people have to know how long it can take to be sure that a check is legit, but that's the way it is.

There is no clear line between airspace and space but 60,000 feet is clearly in the former.\n\nThe US, like all other nations except Lichtenstein for some reason, is a signatory to the [Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation) which, among other things, makes it an act of war to use force against a civilian aircraft. Now, acts of war are not, per see, illegal \\- there are international laws about armed conflict and there are philosophical arguments about just and unjust wars but war itself is a political rather than a legal construct.\n\nArticle 5 of the convention gives the right to all other states the right to operate *civil* aircraft within US airspace (and vice\\-versa) without prior permission (apart from regularly scheduled flights which do require permission) subject to compliance with the convention. Relevantly, unmanned balloons are dealt with in Annex 4 \\- it states that permission is not needed for light meteorological balloons but is needed for any other balloon which might enter foreign airspace.\n\nThe Chinese claim that the balloon was \u201cmainly\u201d meteorological but the convention requires it to be \u201cexclusively\u201d meteorological. It also requires it to be \u201clight\u201d meaning having a payload weighing less than 4kg \\- unless the payload of this ballon was made of unobtainum, it weighed more than 4kg.\n\nThey also argue that it drifted off course and entered US airspace inadvertently. This would be a legitimate claim if the entry of US airspace was unlikely at the planning and launch stages of the operation. We simply do not have the information to assess this claim.\n\nThe US claim that this was a surveillance aircraft. If this is so, then the aircraft is not a civil aircraft and the Chicago Convention does not apply which brings us back to pure sovereignty \\- the US can do what it likes with things in its own airspace.\n\nThere is a treaty between NATO members and former Warsaw Pact members dating from the 1990s that allow surveillance overflights of each other\u2019s territories. However, there are two problems with this: China was never a signatory, and the US withdrew during the Trump Presidency.\n\nSo, if this wasn\u2019t a balloon that inadvertently and unexpectedly drifted off course, the US was allowed to shoot it down."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to international aviation law and the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, under which of the following circumstances would the United States be most clearly justified in shooting down a foreign balloon in its airspace?\n\nA) The balloon is a light meteorological balloon weighing less than 4kg that accidentally drifted into US airspace.\n\nB) The balloon is a civilian aircraft that entered US airspace without prior permission but is not conducting surveillance.\n\nC) The balloon is confirmed to be a surveillance aircraft operated by a foreign government.\n\nD) The balloon is an unmanned civilian aircraft that entered US airspace with prior permission from the US government.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because light meteorological balloons (under 4kg) don't require prior permission and are protected under the Chicago Convention.\nB is incorrect because the Chicago Convention prohibits the use of force against civilian aircraft, even if they enter without permission.\nC is correct because if the balloon is confirmed to be a surveillance aircraft, it's not considered a civil aircraft under the Chicago Convention.

This is an incredibly safe bet because of the way the algorithm is implemented \\- if you change one byte in the input then the output changes to an (apparently) random number without any way to predict what it could be in advance.\n\nPeople can 'mine' for new bitcoin by taking existing blocks and trying to 'solve' them by looking for a particularly low hash value. Currently this is done by simply trying lots of input values until a low enough output is hit by chance. Huge 'farms' and pools of computing power and specialised hardware exist to mine the new bitcoin and by all accounts only just manage to turn a profit after the cost of powering them.\n\nSo suppose someone somewhere discovers the hashing algorithm the Bitcoin network uses is not as random as the world thinks and comes up with a new unlocking algorithm that can reliably produce low hash values and 'solve a block' in seconds on his beat up pentium III computer at home (I realise that this is almost certainly impossible but it's a hypothetical).\n\nHe, and only he, then knows the secret and has the power to create new bitcoin quickly.

It is not an insider trading case since everybody has the possibility to acquire the same math knowledge for free and use the same super algorithm (and maybe is using it already). Insider trading covers only situations when an insider has an information earlier than the market due his proximity to the information, being e.g. employee of the relevant company whose shares are traded, etc. Insider trading presumes that the insider is an \"insider\", i.e. has the information earlier only due to his position. On the other hand, having an information earlier due to his math skills which are available to everybody does not constitute insider trading.\n\nUsing the new discovered super algorithm for shorting the bitcoin price is not illegal since the super algorithm is not illegal either, but proprietary to the mathematics.

Unless you are certain that you can do this in your relevant jurisdictions, without their consent, this sounds like a very bad idea.\n\nAt least under GDPR, \u201cbut they made it public\u201d is not an excuse. Personal data is personal data regardless of how you acquire it. The GDPR also has a very broad concept of identifiability that goes beyond direct identifiers or PII. If you want to use other people's personal data, you need a legal basis, and must provide them notice about your processing. Consent (informed opt\\-in) is one legal basis, legitimate interest (opt\\-out) another. You are suggesting to avoid this by blurring PII, but you may also have to blur other content that is indirectly identifiable. Real anonymization that meets the GDPR's definition is a *really hard* problem.\n\nIn some cases, a legitimate interest is able to avoid such problems. E.g. if I make a video with commentary about a Tweet, it would likely be OK to show surrounding personal data like the responses including the identities of the various accounts, to the degree that this is relevant to the commentary and/or necessary for proper attribution. However, that commentary likely has strong protections under freedom of expression. At least from an European viewpoint, a tutorial, demo, or advertisement would not have a freedom of expression argument that would shift a GDPR legitimate interest balancing test in your favour.\n\nInstead of blurring almost everything in your video or working on GDPR compliance, content licenses, and release forms, you should consider a different solution: create dummy content just for your videos.

[This memo](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2000/rpt/2000-R-0282.htm) does a good job of summarizing a few states' laws.

Schools have leeway to question students to maintain discipline and safety. There is no federal or state law requiring the interview to stop when a student requests a parent.

In Wisconsin, according to the 1993 case [State v. Neumann](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1856146004085540361&q=179%20Wis.%202d%20687&hl=en&as_sdt=4,50&as_vis=1):\n\n> the offense of second\\-degree sexual assault by sexual intercourse does not require proof of intent\n\nand therefore someone who claimed to be too drunk to know what he was doing was still guilty. Although that was a case involving adults and therefore a different statute, I think the statutes are similar enough to produce a similar result in a case involving a minor.\n\nBut even though intent isn't required, according to the 2007 case [State v. Lackershire](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7292968643997194864&q=2007%20WI%2074&hl=en&as_sdt=4,50&as_vis=1) she's still be not guilty in Wisconsin. It flat out says that:\n\n> If the defendant was raped, the act of having sexual intercourse with a child does not constitute a crime.\n\nAdditionally, in your case, there was a gun to her head. Under Wisconsin law, the woman could not be guilty of statutory rape, because of [this law](http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/939.46):\n\n> 939\\.46\u2003 Coercion.  \n> \n>  (1\\)\u2002A threat by a person other than the actor's coconspirator which causes the actor reasonably to believe that his or her act is the only means of preventing imminent death or great bodily harm to the actor or another and which causes him or her so to act is a defense to a prosecution for any crime based on that act, except that if the prosecution is for first\\-degree intentional homicide, the degree of the crime is reduced to 2nd\\-degree intentional homicide.\n\nThe paper you link to mentions several possible defenses like coercion, and how each defense is not applicable in some states. I don't think it ever clearly establishes that there is a state where there is *no* defense. The example you (and the paper) give occurred in Florida. I couldn't find an applicable statute in Florida law, but that appears to be because it's in common law instead of a statute. According to the 1981 Florida case [Wright v. State](https://www.leagle.com/decision/1981895402so2d4931779):\n\n> Florida has recognized the common law defense of duress as a defense to crimes other than homicide\n\nso I don't think the woman would have been guilty under Florida law, either. The paper states that she was in fear for her life and that of her daughters, and it is extremely apparent in hindsight that her fear was reasonable.\n\nI imagine that if the author was able to find an actual case where a victim was prosecuted under similar circumstances (or even one where the victim clearly *could* have been prosecuted under the law of that state) he would have used that case as his example instead. It seems that he couldn't... and that might tell you something. He probably used this example because it was sensational, but it doesn't seem that the woman was guilty under applicable law."}, "answer": "Here is a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where a 15-year-old male uses a gun to force a 21-year-old woman to have sex with him, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential statutory rape charges against the woman?\n\nA) The woman would automatically be guilty of statutory rape in all U.S. states, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nB) The woman could not be charged with statutory rape in any U.S. state due to the presence of coercion.\n\nC) The woman's culpability for statutory rape would depend on the specific laws and defenses available in the state where the incident occurred.\n\nD) The woman would only be charged with statutory rape if she failed to report the incident to authorities.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The woman's potential culpability for statutory rape in this scenario would vary depending on the specific laws and available defenses in the state where the incident occurred.

However, laws and defenses can differ significantly between states. While many states would likely have some form of defense available, the exact legal situation would depend on the jurisdiction. It's important to note that options A and B are too absolute in their claims, as laws do vary by state.

Otherwise, the court returns the bail.\""}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of bail and legal proceedings, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Bail is primarily used as an incentive to ensure a defendant appears in court and is always returned immediately after the trial concludes.\n\nB) The Czech Republic's bail system allows for bail to be held only until the verdict is reached, regardless of the outcome.\n\nC) Bail is a condition for temporary release, and in some jurisdictions, it can be held beyond the trial period, potentially until after probation or to cover damages.\n\nD) The Habeas Corpus Act of 1679 prohibits the holding of bail money once a defendant has been placed on probation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided.

It also mentions that in jurisdictions like the Czech Republic, bail can be held for extended periods, even after conviction, to cover various costs or until probation is completed.

For example, the statistics on criminal cases filed by offenses through December 31, 2021 can be found [here](https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics/table/d-2/statistical-tables-federal-judiciary/2021/12/31). And the statistics on criminal cases terminated by offense and type of disposition can be found [here](https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics/table/d-4/statistical-tables-federal-judiciary/2021/12/31). These tables break the offenses handled in the federal court system down into about 100 categories and are available for geographic subregions of the U.S. (particular district courts and particular court of appeals circuits). This is reasonably specific in a system than handles about 57,000 criminal defendants in a typical year.\n\nThe [federal bureau of prisons](https://www.bop.gov/resources/research_and_reports.jsp) likewise published regular statistics on who is detained for which offenses.\n\nThe [U.S. Sentencing Commission](https://www.ussc.gov/research) also issues some relevant and useful reports with information not available elsewhere. For example, there is a [report summarizing sentencing data](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/federal-sentencing-statistics/state-district-circuit/2021/10c21.pdf) in the 10th Circuit of the U.S. Courts of Appeals for 2021 that breaks offenses down into 30 categories with data on the number of offenders charged, the number of plea or go to trial for each of these 30 categories, the type of sentence imposed (e.g. probation, fine, prison), mean and median sentence lengths, and other data.\n\nMany state court systems likewise published annual reports regarding their case loads, and many state corrections departments likewise publish regular reports regarding inmates serving sentences for crimes.\n\nThe information that is available is not generally as granular as a specific criminal statute. At the federal court level, offenses charged and tried are broken down into about 100 categories, with selective more finely detailed break out detail in some reports, and the federal bureau of prisons data is less fine grained than that. Some U.S. Sentencing Commission data is more specific, some is less specific.\n\nEvery once and while, usually for purposes of estimating the budget impact of proposed legislation, researchers, especially in the Congressional Research Service, the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the relevant appropriations committees of each house of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, or the Office of Management and Budget in the White House office, will contact administrators in the relevant federal agencies and get more fine grained data which is necessary for more accurate estimates for legislative purposes and is released in reports that they issue related to that legislation. But that is piecemeal and is not available comprehensively.\n\nSometimes academics and journalists and political action oriented interest groups and think tanks also estimate these numbers in academic journal articles, either with this kind of insider data or with a representative sample of cases (sometimes obtained with a Freedom of Information Act request).

According to the documentation, federal court statistics typically break down offenses into about 100 categories, and some reports (like those from the U.S. Sentencing Commission) may offer more detailed breakdowns for certain offenses.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the U.S. Sentencing Commission does provide detailed reports, they don't typically break down data by specific federal code violations for all cases.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Federal Bureau of Prisons data is described as less granular than the court statistics, not more detailed by individual statute.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation doesn't suggest that state court systems consistently provide more granular data than federal sources.

In the US, nobody is ever forced to plead anything, much less guilty. If you refuse to enter a plea, the court will enter a plea of \"not guilty\" on your behalf. Your description of the events doesn't match what is possible under US law.\n\nWhen you are charged with a crime, the prosecution might negotiate an agreement (plea bargain) with you to the effect that you will plead guilty to X in exchange for Y.

Once the deal is accepted and you enter a guilty plea, there is no changing the charges, but that does not mean that you couldn't be charged with some other crime. Your attorney would (should) make the prosecution promise to not file other charges later, and if that promise is in writing, then it would be binding on the prosecution.

This typically involves the judge questioning the defendant in court.\n\nOption A is incorrect because once a plea is entered and accepted by the court, the charges cannot be unilaterally changed by the judge.\n\nOption B is wrong because if a defendant refuses to enter a plea, the court will enter a plea of \"not guilty\" on their behalf, not automatically find them guilty.\n\nOption C is incorrect because verbal promises from the prosecution are not legally binding.

The [rights section of the Russian Constitution](http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-03.htm) enumerates rights to life, human dignity, freedom and personal immunity, inviolability of private life, personal and family secrets, the protection of honour and good name, right to determine and indicate nationality, free travel, choice of place of residence, freedom of conscience, the freedom of religion, including the right to profess individually or together with other any religion or to profess no religion at all, to freely choose, possess and disseminate religious and other views and act according to them, freedom of ideas and speech, etc. etc. including a right to education. I should also point out article 60:\n\n> A citizen of the Russian Federation may exercise his or her rights and\n> duties in full from the age of 18\n\nThere are also protection requirements: Intellectual property shall be protected by law, dignity shall be protected, idem honour, the \"right to protection against unemployment\", maternity and childhood, and the family, and so on. There is a potential contradiction between the liberty\\-type rights and the protections guaranteed in the constitution. Nations differ in how they resolve these contradictions. Sometimes, a nation submits to the authority of a transnational court. Usually, they are resolved on a system\\-internal basis, by the Supreme Court of the nation, according to principles of legal interpretation adopted by that nation.\n\nIn the US, no individual right is absolute: every right can in principle be subordinated to some government interest. We have a concept of [strict scrutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny), which limits how governments can infringe on protected rights. Thus you have the right to free speech, but it is limited so that you cannot make death threats because it is a compelling government interest to prevent death threats.\n\nIf you were to sue the government for violating your right to life by compelling you to attend school in the age of covid, there are various defenses that the government could offer to justify the education requirement. One is, simply, that those under 18 don't enjoy full rights enumerated for adults, therefore you can be compelled to go to school, in contradiction to the right to freedom of action. School attendance is a \"compelling government interest\", which can be used to justify infringement of rights. School attendance in the face of covid is not a guaranteed death sentence, but it increases risk of harm somewhat. Serving in the military, which is obligatory (Art. 59\\) also increases the risk of harm \u2013 much more substantially compared to going to school.

The protection against retaliatory rent increases typically applies to specific legal rights like reporting code violations, not to general business activities."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/94683/question-concerning-responding-to-employer-of-minor-daughter-paid-under-minimum", "docs_id": 94683, "title": "Question Concerning Responding to Employer of Minor Daughter Paid Under Minimum Wage", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My high school daughter worked for about a year for an employer who owns a tutoring company in our town. Due to friction between my daughter and the employer, my daughter recently quit but she realized that she was being underpaid for much of this year (2023\\) because the minimum wage here in California is currently $15\\.50 for 2023 but she was still getting paid $14\\.00, the California minimum wage for 2022, when she recently quit (in August 2023\\). Now according to my daughter there is a provision in California law which allows employers to pay only 85% of minimum wage for new workers with no prior experience for their first 160 hours of work. For 2023, that \"new worker\" wage level would work out to $13\\.17 per hour, but my daughter said that she exceeded her first 160 hours of work for the employer back in March 2023\\. So, basically, my daughter was being paid under the proper CA 2023 minimum wage for over the past 4 months.\n\nWhen my daughter contacted her former employer about this problem, the employer was apologetic and emailed back saying that a financial transaction to her to correct for the underpayment would be sent as soon as my daughter emailed back an enclosed payment settlement form. The settlement form basically says \"I hereby agree that the net payment of $XXX represents the full and final settlement of my account with Company XXX\", and there are signature lines at the bottom of the form for my daughter's signature as well as my signature as her parent.\n\nI'm currently thinking \"Why should I, the parent, need to sign anything here?\". The employer underpaid my daughter and she acknowledges that she underpaid my daughter, so it seems that she is responsible for paying my daughter the money she already owes her for the work that my daughter already did, regardless of whether I sign any form or not. Any thoughts on all of this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Read the terms\n--------------\n\nIt\u2019s quite likely that, if you took this to court, the employer would be liable to pay your daughter interest on the underpayment and possibly be fined by the state for failing to follow the law.\n\nThe terms probably are offering to pay the back pay with no interest and your daughter agreeing to confidentiality about the breach. Probably \\- I haven\u2019t read them.\n\nIn other words, they\u2019re asking her to sign a contract saying she gets $XXX now, and can\u2019t make any further claims against them. Such releases are commonplace when setting a dispute and there\u2019s probably nothing underhanded going on. Probably \\- I haven\u2019t read them.\n\nBecause minors can void contracts if they are not in their interest, they want you, as her legal guardian, to also sign so that can\u2019t happen. A relatively prudent precaution on their part.\n\nThe alternative is to not sign the document and they presumably won\u2019t pay. It will then be up to you whether to sue them which will cost you money, possibly more than you will get if you win.\n\nAs to whether there is a dispute: they want your signature, you don\u2019t want to sign \\- that\u2019s a dispute. Any admissions they have made in their settlement offer are almost surely without prejudice, meaning they are inadmissible in court. If you want to sue, you would have to prove the underpayment without relying on their admissions. As stated above, maybe there is no underpayment.\n\nOnly you and your daughter can decide if this is a good deal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a minor employee being underpaid by their employer in California, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the settlement process?\n\nA) The employer is legally obligated to pay the underpaid wages without requiring any signed agreement from the minor or their guardian.\n\nB) The minor employee can sign a settlement agreement without parental consent, and it will be fully binding.\n\nC) The employer may request both the minor and their guardian to sign a settlement agreement to prevent the minor from voiding the contract later.\n\nD) The employer's admission of underpayment in settlement negotiations is always admissible as evidence in court if the case proceeds to litigation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In this situation, the employer is requesting signatures from both the minor employee and their guardian on the settlement agreement. This is a prudent measure because minors have the ability to void contracts that are not in their best interest. By having the guardian sign as well, the employer is attempting to make the agreement more binding and prevent the possibility of the minor voiding it later. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the employer does owe the unpaid wages, they can legally request a settlement agreement before payment. \n\nOption B is incorrect because contracts signed by minors alone can be voidable, which is why the employer is seeking the guardian's signature as well. \n\nOption D is incorrect because admissions made during settlement negotiations are typically considered \"without prejudice\" and are not admissible in court if the case proceeds to litigation."}}
