Bob was born in Vancouver, British Columbia on March 7th at 11 p.m. local time. Alice was born the next day, March 8th, in Halifax, Nova Scotia at 1 a.m. local time, which is 2 hours before Bob was born, due to the time zone difference. Who inherits Charlie's estate?\n\nI'm interested in the answer for Canada, but other countries would also be of interest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As you have stated, Alice was born two hours prior to Bob. In a will, \"eldest\" or \"oldest\" typically is equated with \"first\\-born\" (see Daniel N. Mattarlin, \"[A Simple Legacy: 'To My Children'](https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/doc/1967CanLIIDocs112)\" (1967\\) 12:3 McGill L.J. 240; Frederick Read, \"[The Legal Position of the Child of Unmarried Parents](https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/doc/1931CanLIIDocs20)\" (1931\\) 9:9 Can. Bar Rev. 609; *An Act Relating to Wills, Legacies and Executors, and for the Distribution of the Estates of Intestates*, S.N.S. 1758, c. 11, s. XII). It often is a reflection of an intention to borrow from the ancient law of primogeniture (which is all about literal order of birth), rather than to refer to a person's legal age as defined by statutes and anniversaries. Between Alice and Bob, Alice is the first\\-born and therefore the oldest under that understanding.\n\nBut the question of *who inherits* depends on much more than the interpretation of this one word. For example, most (or all) provincial succession statutes give courts the power to rectify a will if the court determines that the will fails to carry out the will\\-maker's intentions. Evidence could be presented **about how the birthdays of the two were celebrated in relation to each other, who the will\\-maker understood to be the oldest (if they both existed when the will was made), etc**.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Charlie's will leaves his estate to his \"oldest living grandchild.\" He has four grandchildren:\n\n1. Alice, born March 8th at 1:00 AM in Halifax (Atlantic Time)\n2. Bob, born March 7th at 11:00 PM in Vancouver (Pacific Time)\n3. Carol, born March 8th at 3:00 PM in Toronto (Eastern Time)\n4. David, born March 7th at 10:00 PM in Los Angeles (Pacific Time)\n\nCharlie always celebrated Alice and Bob's birthdays on the same day, considering them \"twins\". He often referred to David as his \"oldest grandchild\" because David was born first in Pacific Time. \n\nGiven this information and Canadian legal principles, who is most likely to inherit Charlie's estate?\n\nA) Alice, because she was technically born first when accounting for time zones\nB) Bob, because his birth date is a calendar day earlier than Alice's\nC) Carol, because she was born latest and is therefore the \"oldest\" in terms of age\nD) David, because Charlie considered him the oldest and courts may consider the testator's intentions\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While Alice was technically born first when accounting for time zones, the question introduces complexity by mentioning Charlie's understanding and celebrations of his grandchildren's births. The documentation emphasizes that courts have the power to rectify a will if it fails to carry out the will-maker's intentions. Evidence about how birthdays were celebrated and who the will-maker understood to be the oldest can be considered. Since Charlie referred to David as his \"oldest grandchild\" and celebrated Alice and Bob's birthdays together as \"twins\", a court might interpret Charlie's intention as leaving the estate to David. This aligns with the principle that the testator's intentions are paramount in will interpretation."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59171/injunction-petition-or-other", "docs_id": 59171, "title": "Injunction, petition or other?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A Florida homeowner association is violating its bylaws and statutes by performing action X.

An emergency injunction is the most appropriate action in this time-sensitive situation. It can potentially prevent the HOA from making the non-refundable purchase while the arbitration is pending. However, the homeowners would need to demonstrate that they meet the four criteria for an injunction: irreparable harm, no adequate remedy at law, substantial likelihood of success on the merits, and that the injunction would serve the public interest.\n\nC) While a cease and desist order might be helpful, it typically doesn't have the immediate legal force of an injunction and may not be processed quickly enough by the state authority.\n\nD) A writ of mandamus is generally used to compel a government official or body to perform a legally required duty.

In legal proceedings, witnesses are allowed to testify even if they show signs of bias or prejudice. It's the responsibility of the trier of fact (usually the jury in a criminal case) to assess the credibility of each witness and decide how much weight to give their testimony. This approach recognizes that all witnesses may have some degree of bias, and that those who openly acknowledge their biases might even be considered more credible than those who attempt to hide them. The legal system trusts the trier of fact to consider these factors when evaluating the overall evidence. Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest excluding potentially valuable testimony, which goes against the principle of allowing all relevant evidence. Option C is incorrect because while judges may provide general instructions about evaluating witness credibility, they typically don't instruct juries to completely disregard signs of bias, as this is part of the jury's role in assessing witness credibility."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1573/how-is-an-area-deemed-unsafe-and-needing-to-be-cordoned-off", "docs_id": 1573, "title": "How is an area deemed unsafe and needing to be cordoned off?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How is an area deemed unsafe and needing to be cordoned off?\n\nWould it be the person at the top of the law enforcement agency (police chief or sheriff) who would make the decision that a particular area is unsafe and needs to be cordoned off with police tape, would it be the elected official at the top (mayor, town supervisor, county administrator), or a judge or magistrate?\n\nWhat I'm imagining is that after the police tape is put up, and personnel is stationed at the tape to explain to people, if needed, that anyone crossing the tape will be subject to arrest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The powers given to law enforcement professionals will be detailed in the relevant law that establishes them.\n\nI would suspect that the decision to cordon off an area would fall within the purview of the officer on the scene; the idea that a police officer would need to seek permission before cordoning off a motor vehicle accident or chemical spill is unworkable.

The list of banks representing the loans to be consolidated on the second note are in conflict with the list on the first note. I am not sure which list is accurate.\n\nIs either note valid and/or enforceable? The information is in conflict. Also, my signature is crossed out on the second, initialed and signed differently. I don't remember doing that and it's not on the copy I have. And lastly, both notes were printed years before the 1992 amendments so not all options for repayment are listed and the disclosure \"this is a loan which must be repaid\" is not present anywhere. I had read in the Colorado Student Loan Training Manual that duplicate notes are not enforceable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Without reading the exact language of the documents it is hard to tell. Two possible interpretations of these documents are most plausible.\n\nOne interpretation is that the first note is the true promissory note and the second note is a written reaffirmation of the original promissory note which would extend the statute of limitations for enforcing it if there had not been regular payments, but does not create a new obligation or supersede the original note. But, it probably could be enforced if push came to shove, on some legal theory if the original first note was unavailable.\n\nA second interpretation is that the second note is a novation of the original note that replaces and supersedes the original note. Given the differences in the parties to the second note, I would be inclined to give this interpretation a greatly likelihood of being correct, but again, it would come down to the exact language of the documents.\n\nPromissory notes are tricky because they are \"negotiable instruments\" which means that the right to receive payment and enforce the note can be transferred to a new \"Note Holder\" by transferring the physical original note and endorsing the back.\n\nThe concern in the case of a promissory note is that someone with a photocopy could claim to be the Note Holder when in fact, the physical original has been negotiated to another person who is the true Note Holder to whom the obligation is now currently owed. If judgment were entered against the former Note Holder that might not prevent the true Note Holder from also getting a judgment against you, leaving you to try to vacate the judgment in favor of the former Note Holder and to seek restitution of any funds paid to the former Note Holder.\n\nThis could be prevented by insisting on an original note or by requiring the party bringing suit without an original note to post a bond to protect you in the event that the note was actually physically negotiated to someone else. The risk could be mitigated, but not entirely eliminated, if you were sued in a collection action, by joining all of the note holders listed on either note and their successors in interest, as third\\-party defendants.\n\nWhile I'm not aware of any significant litigation concerning who the Note Holder is in the case of student loans, there was quite a bit of litigation concerning the true Note Holder in the subprime mortgage loan context around the time of the Financial Crisis of 2008\\.\n\nThe modification of the signature, apparently without your authorization, is deeply problematic and might amount to fraud, but could be found by a court to be harmless because you admit to signing the original. Fraud in a matter that is immaterial is usually not actionable, although it could still constitute grounds to disbar an attorney if this action was authorized by an attorney.\n\nThe fact that neither of the notes complies with subsequently enacted legislation is irrelevant as you can't have an *ex post facto* law that *impairs obligations of contracts* under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn the meantime, don't throw out anything related to this loan or delete any files related to it.

At that time, not only have the electors already voted since at least a month, but Congress supposedly has certified the election of the dead guy and his running mate 14 days prior. That's the time when someone is or isn't president\\-elect in regards to this amendment.\n\nThat's for your first sentence. Now for the rest, and taking your example of the 2020 election, if Biden had died between November and December, the options available to the Electors in each state are different. Some will be able to vote for someone else than Biden for president, possibly someone named by the DCCC, but many Electors in different states will not have that option.\n\nThe way I see it, there's two options. Either there are no (or almost no) faithless Electors, then the Biden/Harris ticket gets certified on January 6th (what could possibly go wrong \ud83d\udc40), then pursuant to the 20th amendment Harris gets sworn in as the President on January 20th.\nOr, a lot of the Electors who can legally be faithless, get faithless, then the democratic electoral votes are split, no ticket gets to 270, which triggers a [contingent election](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-2/section-1/clause-3/) by the House of Reps (and the Senate selects the VP).

In states without faithless elector laws, electors would have the freedom to vote for an alternative candidate, likely one suggested by the party. However, in states with laws against faithless electors, the electors would still be bound to vote for the deceased candidate. This situation could lead to a split in electoral votes within the party.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no provision for automatically nullifying Electoral College votes or holding a new general election in this scenario. Option B is incorrect because the vice presidential candidate doesn't automatically become the new presidential candidate; the electors would still need to vote.

Indeed, the [complaint form](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/article_attachments/360090262251/complaint_form.pdf) asks for \"Company Name (if applicable)\". There are no subject\\-matter restrictions on complaints though it is pointless to complain about something that isn't about a violation of FCC regulations. It *is* pointless to complain about internet service rates, because the FCC does not regulate those rates. I cannot determine if there is any FCC requirement that a provider must tell you how to port your number from one provider to another. However, you could file a complains, which the provider must reply to, and they would tell you something like \"We don't provide that information\". You could then escalate the matter to the status of a formal complaint (which costs money), and eventually you might get a full formal explanation that they are not required to tell you how to do it (unless they *are* required to, then they presumably will have told you before you got to this stage).

Or is this basically a lost cause?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Did you get a copy of the accident report from an officer on scene (the one time I've been a crash, I was given a slip of paper similar to a ticket with some basic info and the full report was available for request a few days later when in the system). For the insurance company it was enough just to get the case number on the ticket and they did the leg work. Consider yourself lucky it was only cosmetic. You can also reach out to the officer in the report OR the prosecutor's office. Although they might reach out to you, don't expect it, as they only need you to testify in court if a plea agreement isn't struck (90% of all criminal cases in the U.S. end in a plea bargin of some sorts.).\n\nEither way, it's prudent for your own records to get copies of the reports as well as the estimation for the repairs. As you said, it is cosmetic, so it's not like the repairs are necessary to the safe operation of the car (However, if you can clarify what the truck is used for, it might make a difference. It's one thing if it's your own pickup truck used for hauling stuff for weekend projects you have to fix up the house... it's another thing if it's a pickup truck you use to carry your equipment for your landscaping company, as the \"cosmetic\" damage impacts your proffessional image in that people will be less likely to contract with you, in addition to any custom paint job with contact information needing specialty repairs.\n\nSuing for damages will likely put this in small claims court, which is helpful as it's more friendly to pro se litigants and if you have all your above information in order, it should be sufficient to win (Civil courts do not need to meet \"Beyond Reasonable Doubt\" standards of evidence, but Preponderance of evidence (i.e. it's more likely that it happened one way vs. the other) which this should cover.). The down side is a lot of people who drink and drive are often not financially well off... and a lot of people who don't have insurance do so because they can't afford it... I'm not saying this is 100% of the case, but if she can't afford auto insurance, well, she's not likely to afford a $1800 repair job, oh, and she's likely going to do some jail time, as DUI with a collision normally carries jail time, and that's before the fact that she was driving without insurance (usually a fine). So she's going to be out a good chunk of cash from criminal cases. You don't have to wait for criminal proceedings to occur, but having the conviction as evidence helps a lot... but this means you have to wait for her to get out of jail to really begin to start the legal process of trying to collect.\n\nSure you can sue, but you still can't get blood from a stone (As Lawyers say, there may be a case, but it's not worth it if they can't even pay).\n\nAt the end of the day, no matter what you do, try and keep some perspective. As unlucky as it is that this happened to you, there are lots of DUI victims out there who would gladly give their first born son (or any child of your choosing, it's 2020\\) to come out of their experiene with only cosmetic damage that did not total a 14 year old vehicle.

For example, this obligation is expressed in Art 24 GDPR:\n\n> Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation. \\[\u2026]\n\nWhat risks exist for what activities is extremely contextual. Leaking information through metadata is a *potential* risk, but it's not a risk in every context. Thus, data controllers *should* consider whether metadata could pose a privacy problem in their workflows, but they are not necessarily required to redact such metadata.\n\nThis provision of the UK GDPR is already enforceable, but it would need a case by case analysis to determine whether the risk analysis and selection of technical and organizational measures have been conducted incorrectly.\n\nThe documents you linked are a HMRC internal manual. These are not normative \u2013 they do not bind other organizations.

UK data protection law, based on the GDPR, takes a principle-based approach rather than providing a strict checklist of compliance measures. The law requires data controllers to implement \"appropriate technical and organisational measures\" based on the specific context, nature, and risks of their data processing activities. This means that while the ICO's guidance should be considered, it's not mandatory in all cases. Instead, companies should assess the risks associated with metadata in their particular context and implement measures that are appropriate for their situation. This approach aligns with the GDPR's risk-based and context-specific requirements.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it overstates the binding nature of the ICO's guidance.

Which of the following statements best describes the legal considerations and responsibilities of the website operator?\n\nA) The website operator has no legal obligations regarding copyright infringement as long as they remove infringing content upon receiving a takedown notice.\n\nB) The website is inherently illegal because it facilitates the potential sale of copyrighted material without the original copyright holders' permission.\n\nC) The website operator must actively monitor and pre-screen all uploaded content to ensure no copyright infringement occurs.\n\nD) The website can operate legally if it implements measures to prevent copyright infringement, responds promptly to takedown notices, and has a system for compensating content creators.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate representation of the legal considerations for such a website. While the basic model of users uploading and selling content is legal (similar to traditional publishing), the website operator has responsibilities regarding copyright protection. They should implement preventative measures against copyright infringement, respond promptly to takedown notices, and ensure a fair system for compensating content creators.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely removing content upon notice is not sufficient; proactive measures should be taken. Option B is overly broad and incorrect; such websites can operate legally with proper safeguards.

But their website not being completely correct doesn't mean their service isn't, that's why I'm asking the question\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Mailchimp as a company is probably mostly GDPR\\-compliant. But this doesn't mean that *using* the Mailchimp service would be compliant as well.\n\nThis is because the GDPR has different compliance obligations for \u201cdata controllers\u201d and \u201cdata processors\u201d. The data controller is responsible for the compliance of all processing activities they determine the purposes and means for, regardless of whether those activities are actually outsourced. In contrast, the primary responsibility of a data processor is to only use the data as instructed by the controller, but not for the processor's own purposes.\n\nSo Mailchimp probably doesn't abuse its customer's data, and offers an Art 28 GDPR conformant data processing agreement as part of its contracts. Mailchimp also offers features that assist with related privacy laws, such as collecting proper consent as required by the EU ePrivacy Directive.\n\nAnd Mailchimp has a page about [European data transfers](https://mailchimp.com/help/mailchimp-european-data-transfers/). This is where it gets tricky. Not the Mailchimp service, but the customer is the data exporter / data controller and is responsible for compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR. The data controller must decide *themselves* whether the international transfer into the US is legal. Briefly, the GDPR allows the following grounds for an international transfer of personal data:\n\n* target country has an adequacy decision from the EU \u2013 no, because the EU\u2013US Privacy Shield was invalidated in the *Schrems II* ruling\n* Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) \u2013 maybe, see below discussion\n* Binding Corporate Rules \u2013 not applicable\n* exceptions, including explicit consent or only occasional transfers \u2013 not applicable\n\nThe Mailchimp guide about EU data transfers correctly states that the *Schrems II* decision only invalidated the Privacy Shield, and did not invalidate the concept of SCCs. That means it is still legal to use SCCs as a basis to transfer personal data in non\\-EU countries. But this doesn't imply that SCCs can serve as a basis for transferring personal data specifically to Mailchimp in the US \u2013 a case by case analysis is necessary that determines whether security of processing is guaranteed and whether data subjects would have effective legal remedies if their rights were breached.\n\nIt now happens that exactly the same reasons that caused the Privacy Shield to be invalid must also make us doubt whether SCCs can be valid in their place. The problem with transfers to the US never was the risk that the recipient would sell the personal data to the highest bidder, but that the US\\-based company is subject to US spy laws like FISA 702 and EO 12333 that do not provide effective legal remedies for foreign affected persons. (Mailchimp explicitly confirms that it is subject to those spy laws as an \u201celectronic communication service\u201d.)\n\nIn the wake of the *Schrems II* ruling the EDPB has published a document with recommendations for supplemental safeguards that could make SCCs permissible, but these recommendations (like end to end encryption, or only transferring pseudoymized data) cannot work for US\\-based cloud services such as Mailchimp. Some (such as the US government) have argued that *Schrems II* was based on outdated information, but this standpoint is not shared by European regulators.\n\nSo, the data controller \u2013 the Mailchimp customer \u2013 has to make their own judgement about this international transfer.\n\n* If SCCs combined with Mailchimp's supplemental measures provide sufficient safeguards, then the international transfer is legal and GDPR\\-compliant. Mailchimp offers all the necessary paperwork such as DPAs, SCCs, and so on.\n* If there are no sufficient safeguards, then the transfer is clearly illegal.\n\nMy personal opinion is that Mailchimp's supplemental measure fall far short of what would be required per the EDPB recommendations. Lower courts in the EU now routinely consider all transfers to the US as illegal. A company using Mailchimp was also an early target of a post\\-*Schrems II* enforcement action, though it wasn't fined since it immediately stopped using the service.\n\nSo while it's not possible to *definitely* say that using Mailchimp would be a GDPR\\-violation, it's very difficult to argue that such use could be compliant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A European company is considering using Mailchimp, a US-based email marketing service, for its newsletter.

I'm not a native English speaker, and thought 'derivative' means 'inspired or motivated by something'...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Derivative Works under US law and the Berne Convention\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nUS Copyright law defines \"derivative work\" in [17 USC 101](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#101) as:\n\n> A \u201cderivative work\u201d is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a \u201cderivative work\u201d.\n\nArticle 2 of the [Berne Copyright Convention](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698) reads, in relevant part:\n\n> (3\\) Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work shall be protected as original works without prejudice to the copyright in the original work.\n\nUnder [17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106) one of the things that a copyright owner has the exclusive right to do or authorize is:\n\n> (2\\) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;\n\nNote that under the US definition, a derivative work is one **based on** an earlier work, not one that merely **refers to** a derivative work. Merely mentioning or citing a previous work is not enough to make the later work derivative. It must, in some substantial way, **use** and be developed out of the previous work.\n\nThe classic examples of a derivative work are: a translation into another language; an adaptation into another medium or form (such as making a novel into a play or film); and making a sequel. But derivative works can be derivative in various other ways.\n\nExamples from the Question\n--------------------------\n\nLet us look at the examples mentioned in the question:\n\n> * an academic paper that cites or refers to other papers\n\nThis is a mere reference and is not at all derivative. However a paper that contained little or no original content, but consisted almost entirely of such citations might be considered derivative.\n\n> * a discussion thread on Internet (or each comment or reply on it) about a work\n\nDiscussion or criticism of a work, or a reply to it, is not normally considered derivative. Such comments are not derivative of the work under discussion, nor of the previous comments. Quotations of either are likely to be permitted fair use, and so not infringing, although that will depend on the exact details of each case.\n\n> * a fanart or a fanfiction\n\nThis is likely to be a derivative work, depending on how much of the source work is used, and whether distinctive details are reproduced. Note that **ideas** cannot be protected by copyright. (See 17 USC 102(b) for this.) So the idea of a person who turns into an animal of a particular type, or has some special power or ability or characteristic is not protected by copyright. But the details expressed in the source work, such as the mannerisms or appearance of a character, or the specific nature of a setting, can be protected, and to draw on them may be infringement, unless fair use applies.\n\n> * metadata\n\n\"Metadata\" is a very general idea. Typically the kind of information included in metadata is not protected by copyright, but in some cases it may be.\n\n> * a review or a criticism\n\nA review, criticism of, or comment on an existing work is not normally considered a derivative work. Quotes used in a review or criticism are often protected by fair use under US law, but if the quotation is excessive, and particularly if it allows the review to serve as a replacement for the original and to harm the market for the original, it may be infringement.\n\n> * a work inspired by other works\n\nAgain, this depends. If only the general idea is imitated, then the later work is not derivative If detailed, distinctive, and specific characters, settings or plot lines are imitated, then the later work may be considered derivative, and infringing if permission is not obtained.\n\nThe *Nichols* Case\n------------------\n\nIn the case [*Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation*, 45 F. 2d 119 \\- Circuit Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit (1930\\)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14991934121439658064&q=Nichols+v.+Universal+Pictures+Corp.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33) Judge Learned Hand, a famous judge, wrote a very influential and often cited opinion describing when two similar plays are, and when they are not, infringements of one another. It is worth reading to better understand this issue, even though it is over 90 years old.\n\nWhat makes a Work Derivative\n----------------------------\n\nSo in general a work is derivative when it uses significant, distinctive, and detailed elements of a previous work, or is a revised or altered version of the previous work.\n\nCopyright in a Derivative Work\n------------------------------\n\nIf a derivative work is made with proper permission, or the source work is out of copyright, the author of the derivative work has copyright in all the original parts of the derivative work. However if the derivative work is infringing, and was created without permission, the author has no valid copyright in it at all.\n\nFair Use and True Parody\n------------------------\n\nIf a work is held to be a ***fair use*** of the original, it is not infringing even if it is a derivative work, this is an ***exception to copyright*** in US law. It may still be important to note that the work is derivative, because the author has copyright only in the original aspects.\n\nIf a work is a ***parody***, it is likely to be held to be a fair use. Note that in copyright law a **true** parody is a work that comments on the source work by imitating or mocking it. A work that imitates a source work merely to be funny, or to comment on general social conditions, or to make some other point, but **not** to comment on the original, is not a parody in US copyright law. Courts often refer to such a work as a \"satire\", even though this is not the standard literary definition of \"satire\". A Satire will usually not be a fair use of the source, or if it is, it will be for other reasons.\n\n**Addition** (in response to an addition to the question)\n\n> * original work : poem \"Eloisa to Abelard\" by Alexander Pope(1688\\-1744\\)\n> * (potential) derivative work : film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" directed by Michel Gondry\n> \n> \n> The film's title is a quotation from the poem, and the quoted part is cited within the film. Does it make the film a \"derivative work\" of the poem?\n\nNo. First of all, any copyright on the poem has long expired, it is in the public domain.\n\nSecondly, merely referring to a previous work in the title and citing it in the body does not make the later work derivative, it is merely a ***literary reference***. A significant part of the earlier work would need to be used to make the film derivative. Unless much more was used than is mentioned above, this would not qualify even if the poem were still in copyright.\n\n### Meaning of \"Derivative\"\n\nLike many other words of the English language, the word \"derivative\" has several different senses. The sense leading to the definitions:\n\n> * imitative of the work of another person\n> * inspired or motivated by something\n\nis mostly used in the context of criticism and review of works of art or literature. In copyright law, \"derivative\" is a technical term, defined by the definition section of the law, and by previous court cases. It is not unrelated to the meaning from literary or art criticism, but it is specific and by no means the same.

The money was intended for a business. They are aware that this must be an error but spend the money anyway. The bank wants the money back. The couple quits talking to the bank. The couple is charged with theft and receiving stolen property.\n\nI am very confused how they can be charged with either of these things. In the case of theft, I think it is fairly plain the couple did nothing to receive the money. No act on their part caused the money to enter their account. I think most reasonable people would agree that at that point, they \"have\" the money, and what they do with it after that is irrelevant to whether it was stolen. *If this is not the case, and the act of spending the money is the theft, then it implies that any money in anyone's account is not theirs, which I seriously doubt a jury would agree with.*\n\nWith regards to receiving stolen property, there are two options.\n\n1. My claim above is true, and the couple did not steal the money. If the property then is \"stolen,\" the uncomfortable implication is that the bank stole the money. (Teller Error, I don't think, counts as theft).\n2. My claim above is untrue, in which case, it's hard to argue they received it at all, since they are the thieves (the reception becomes trivial).\n\nIt seems to me that the prosecution is doomed if the couple decides to go to trial.\n\n**What's going to give the prosecution a chance to succeed?

It seems like that would be reserved to the states under the 10th Amendment.\n\nIs the interstate commerce clause? That seems iffy to me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's the interstate commerce clause. Because of how the modern economy works. there's really pretty much nothing that's confined to a single state in its effects and doesn't affect other states. Almost any law can be justified as a regulation of interstate commerce these days, especially if that law is actually directly about commercial activity.\n\nThe big case to cite here is *United States v. Darby* ([312 US 100](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1183543472021488573)). This case tested a federal minimum wage law which banned shipping goods in interstate commerce where they were produced by people paid less than minimum wage, and also banned the employment of those people at less than minimum wage in that context. The Supreme Court found this law constitutional, even though the manufacturing employees weren't personally engaged in interstate commerce, because the employer *was* engaged in interstate commerce and regulating production was a permissible way to regulate that commerce.\n\nNow, after that decision, there was a major broadening of what was allowed to be regulated under the interstate commerce clause. In *Wickard v. Filburn* ([317 US 111](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17396018701671434685)), the Supreme Court ruled that the appropriate test to see whether something could be regulated as interstate commerce was whether it had a \"substantial economic effect\" on interstate commerce. Under this rule, federal regulation under the commerce clause is very far\\-reaching. It supports extending a minimum wage to domestic service workers ([*Marshall v. Rose*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6853240429044189885), a Fourth Circuit case from 1980\\); it supports extending EEOC rules to state employers ([*EEOC v.

Darby and subsequent cases\nC) The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment\nD) The General Welfare Clause of the Constitution\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The federal government's authority to set a national minimum wage is primarily based on the Interstate Commerce Clause, as interpreted in key Supreme Court cases such as United States v. Darby (1941) and Wickard v. Filburn (1942).\n\nA is incorrect because the 10th Amendment actually limits federal power, rather than granting it the authority to set a minimum wage.\n\nB is correct. United States v. Darby established that Congress could use its power to regulate interstate commerce to set labor standards, including minimum wage. Wickard v. Filburn further broadened the interpretation of the Commerce Clause to include activities that have a \"substantial economic effect\" on interstate commerce, even if they are local in nature.\n\nC is incorrect. While the Equal Protection Clause is important for many labor laws, it is not the primary basis for the federal minimum wage.\n\nD is incorrect.

Is\n> this correct?\n\nYes. This is an annualized interest rate of 715,586,124,880,210%, which is far, far in excess of the maximum interest rate allowed by law.\n\nThe maximum legally allowed interest rate in British Columbia is 60% per annum. So, an interest rate of 65 cents or more in a five day period on a loan of $100\\.00 is illegal.\n\n> I don't know his current address.\n\nLending money without collateral to people without knowing their current address is just plain stupid when it comes to lending practices. Nobody does that without a primarily donative intent.\n\n> Would have holding collateral been a legal solution?\n\nPotentially. This is essentially the business model of a pawn shop.\n\nIn the case of a pawn shop, the borrower delivers tangible personal property to the pawn shop owner who takes custody of it, which serves as collateral for a small loan with a set, legal interest rate, for a fixed period of time much greater than five days (typically several weeks or to several months). If the loan is not repaid, the collateral becomes the property of the lender in full payment of the loan, and the parties haggle in advance over the fair market value of the collateral against which the customer may borrow the full amount.\n\nA pawn is essentially equivalent to an outright sale of tangible personal property (almost always used) in exchange for cash, with a right to rescind the deal for a modest interest charge within X number of days after the sale.\n\nSince the pawn shop owner has some asset of the borrower to collect from in the event of non\\-payment, and the loan is \"non\\-recourse\" (i.e. collection rights are limited to taking ownership of the collateral), it isn't important to even know the address of the borrower, and no lawsuits are necessary for the lending pawn shop owner to be made whole if the loan is not repaid.\n\nThe down side of running a pawn shop is that the owner needs to have considerable skill to value the collateral at a price sufficient to repay the loan together with a fair share of the administrative expenses of the operation on a case by case basis, for the very modest profit margin associated with a typical pawn shop.\n\nMost people who are skilled enough to value tangible personal property accurately enough to make money running a pawn ship are also skilled enough to do other things that pay better.\n\n> Late Charge: Any payment not remunerated within 10 days of its due\n> date shall be subject to a belatedly charge of 5 percent (%) of the\n> payment, not to exceed $500 for any such late installment.\n\nLate charges are considered in the maximum interest rate calculation, so you need a much longer term loan and a much lower interest rate for this to be legally permissible.\n\n> Collection fees: If this note is placed with a legal representative\n> for collection, then Borrower agrees to pay an attorney's fee of ten\n> percent (10%) of the voluntary balance. This fee will be added to the\n> unpaid balance of the loan.\n\nNot sure what is meant by the \"voluntary balance.\" It isn't inherently improper to include the costs of collection in a loan agreement, and indeed, I think that this may be the default rule of law in British Columbia without any contractual term under loser pays rules of civil procedure.\n\nBut, a court can decline to award more than the \"reasonable\" legal fees incurred to collect a debt, and it is not at all clear that even the minimal amount of legal fees one could incur to collect a debt would be reasonable to collect a loan of $100 and interest.\n\nLikewise, while there are \"hard money loans\" (i.e. loans secured only by collateral and no personal obligation to pay that can be enforced against an individual's assets in court), where it is customary for the legal costs of drafting the loan documents to be paid by the borrower rather than the lender, for the most part, this simply makes no sense, because even 12 minutes of legal time (0\\.2 hours in the typical legal billing format) is an excessive amount to charge for a $100 loan for a five day period of time. This would typically be $50\\-$60 or more. It would probably be treated as an interest charge and hence would be illegal in British Columbia.\n\n> Would a term like \"if the lender needs to resort to legal action to\n> enforce a term of this agreement, the borrow will reimburse him for\n> all related expenses and his time\" be enforceable?\n\nReimbursement for out of pocket court filing fees and any photocopying costs and process server costs is likely to be enforceable. Reimbursement for the lenders own time to enforce the loan in the event of a default is probably not enforceable in the case of a $100 loan, even at minimum wage.\n\nMaking small loans has historically been a marginal economic sector for precisely this reason. Even if the default rate is low, the administrative costs associated with making and enforcing (in the event of defaults) a small loan and the administrative costs associated with making and enforcing these promise for a much larger loan are similar. But the dollar amount of interest generated by a small loan is much smaller relative to the administrative costs involved than the interest on a large loan.\n\nCredit card companies and similar lenders make small loans affordable by automating the lending process, screening borrowers based upon credit ratings, making many loans each month to the same borrower, and making loans to many, many borrowers to spread the risk out. But making small loans on a one\\-off basis is not a profitable venture.\n\nBusiness models that charge enough to be profitable with small loans, like payday lenders and car title lenders in the United States, usually have some sort of collateral or *de facto* collateral (like a post\\-dated check), and tend to be shut down by regulators because their interest rates typically need to be on the order of 150%\\-400% per annum to make a profit, due to high administrative costs involved in making small loans relative to the amount of the loan. But interest rates this high are considered exploitive and are illegal.\n\nAnother business model, which essentially describes the business model in the question except for the enforcement method, is called \"loan sharking\". The main difference between legitimate or almost legitimate small loan lending and loan sharking, is that loan sharks enforce their loans by having organized crime enforcers beat up people who don't pay, rather than using lawsuits to deal with loan defaults. This is, of course, completely illegal and a serious crime.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John lends his friend Sarah $200 for a week, with Sarah promising to pay back $250.

While it's courteous and often practiced to ask for permission or blur faces, it's not a legal requirement. Sarah's initial consent and subsequent change of mind don't affect John's legal right to use the footage captured in a public space.

On the facts in your question, it is clear that no such Final Charging Order was issued before the bankruptcy commenced.\n\nAn Interim Charging Order will by necessity end unless a Final Charging Order is made. Since no such Order was made, it would seem that the Interim Charging Order has ended: the interim order is designed to stop someone from disposing of assets until the court can decide whether a final order is necessary. If no final order is made, the interim order dies with it.\n\nA check on the Land Registry against the property would be needed to ensure that any notices or restrictions have been removed.

An Interim Charging Order ends if no Final Charging Order is made. Additionally, the Limitation Act 1980 provides time limits for enforcing judgments (6 years) or recovering money secured by a charge (12 years).

The Department of Justice's Criminal Resource Manual has a [section on misdemeanor offenses that apply to postal crime:](https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1468-misdemeanor-postal-crimes)\n\n> Among the misdemeanor dispositions available are: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 (obstruction of mails generally); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(b) (opening,destroying, or detaining mail without authority); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1707 (theft of property used by postal service); and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711 (misappropriation of postal funds). **When the charge might best lie under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705 (destruction of letter boxes or mail) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1706 (injury to mail bags) and in other appropriate circumstances, an applicable misdemeanor may be found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (theft of government property); or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (destruction of government property).**\n\nThat suggests (at least to me) that federal prosecutors are supposed to at least consider misdemeanor instead of felony charges for minor cases of mailbox destruction. [Under normal circumstances,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1361) destruction of federal property only becomes a felony if the damage (or attempted damage) is more than $1,000\\.\n\nThis is a pretty good example of how US laws are written with prosecutorial discretion in mind. In other systems, the law about destruction of mail or mailboxes would lay out when it's a serious crime and when it's minor. In the US, it's always considered a serious crime because the assumption is that prosecutors won't charge it in minor cases (in fact, official guidance to prosecutors lays out ways they can charge it without charging the felony).\n\nIt's also possible to be prosecuted at the state level for this, and if you're actually a juvenile that's much more likely than federal prosecution. The feds don't really like handling juvenile cases; they normally leave those up to the states unless there's some good reason not to. Even if you're an adult, the feds may well leave the issue up to the state for prosecution. At the state level, the threshold for felony vs. misdemeanor vandalism would depend on the state.

The fee calculation is explained [here](https://copyright.gov/title37/201/37cfr201-3.html). They say \"The current fee is $75 per NOI plus $10 per group of 1\\-100 additional titles\".\n\n[Part of the law (17 USC 115(c)(1\\)(D))](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=01263e59a7e0015e1a219c1a7daacc31&mc=true&node=se37.1.201_13&rgn=div8) also says\n\n> Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, any copyright\n> owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain\n> a compulsory license under subsection (a) may negotiate and agree upon\n> the terms and rates of royalty payments under this section and the\n> proportionate division of fees paid among copyright owners, and may\n> designate common agents on a nonexclusive basis to negotiate, agree\n> to, pay or receive such royalty payments.

As the \"recipient\" of compulsory literary license royalties, I can attest that it is pennies on the dollar: most of the user charge is agency fees.\n\nYou could, alternatively, hire an attorney specializing in copyright law to research the possibility of mailing the copyright owner some small amount (perhaps a dime, rounding up) plus the NOI, but there is a non\\-trivial chance that the attorney fees would be more than $16\\. Another alternative is that you hire an attorney to research the matter and say how likely it is that you could run into legal problems if you serve notice *pro se* and mess up on the NOI or the fees. This aspect of copyright law is unquestionably confusing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under current U.S. copyright law, what is the correct process for obtaining a compulsory license to record and distribute a cover of a copyrighted song?\n\nA) Pay a flat fee of $0.10 per copy to the copyright holder and start distributing immediately\nB) Submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to the copyright owner, pay the statutory mechanical royalty rate set by the Copyright Royalty Board, and follow Copyright Office regulations\nC) Contact the Harry Fox Agency and pay their minimum fee of $16 for up to 25 copies\nD) Negotiate directly with the copyright owner for any fee amount, bypassing all regulatory requirements\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct process involves submitting a Notice of Intent (NOI) to the copyright owner, paying the statutory mechanical royalty rate set by the Copyright Royalty Board, and following Copyright Office regulations. This answer reflects the current law, which requires proper notice and adherence to rates determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Option A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the process and doesn't account for the NOI requirement. Option C is not universally applicable, as the Harry Fox Agency is just one possible intermediary and their fees aren't legally mandated. Option D is incorrect because while negotiation is possible, it doesn't bypass the regulatory requirements for compulsory licensing."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85723/when-does-a-judge-decide-to-address-issues-outside-the-scope-of-a-specific-case", "docs_id": 85723, "title": "When does a judge decide to address issues outside the scope of a specific case?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a 2012 case, Associate Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (now King's Bench) of Alberta, J.D. Rooke, wrote a decision which ran to 176 pages and contained what was essentially a thesis on Sovereign Citizens and similar persons who use pseudo\\-legal arguments to attempt to achieve their ends in court. The case of [*Meads v Meads*](https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html) has become fairly famous and [somewhat influential](https://ablawg.ca/2013/04/08/what-has-meads-v-meads-wrought/), which seems to have been what the judge was hoping for.\n\nHowever, on what basis did the judge decide to stray beyond the matter immediately before him (a divorce dispute)? The *Meads* decision categorised several different (albeit related) types of vexatious litigant. Surely Meads himself was just one type, so the others were not relevant in the immediate context of the case. In terms of court procedure, it seems to me that J.D. Rooke probably *should* have written a much shorter decision, relevant only to the facts immediately before him, and published the rest as an article in a law journal.\n\nIs there any reasonable constraint on how much a judge can or should write in a decision? How common is it for judges to sneak essays into their rulings? Given that this was a civil case between two private citizens, using the opportunity to address the nation, as it were, seems out of place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: These decisions are inherently individual. The judge in this case explained the reasons why he thought it would be helpful to set out the full context of organized pseudo\\-legal commercial arguments. *Meads v. Meads*, [2012 ABQB 571](https://canlii.ca/t/fsvjq):\n\n> \\[2] Over a decade of reported cases have proven that the individual concepts advanced by OPCA litigants are invalid. What remains is to categorize these schemes and concepts, identify global defects to simplify future response to variations of identified and invalid OPCA themes, and develop court procedures and sanctions for persons who adopt and advance these vexatious litigation strategies.\n> \n> \n> \\[3] ... One of the purposes of these Reasons is, through this litigant, to uncover, expose, collate, and publish the tactics employed by the OPCA community, as a part of a process to eradicate the growing abuse that these litigants direct towards the justice and legal system we otherwise enjoy in Alberta and across Canada. I will respond on a point\\-by\\-point basis to the broad spectrum of OPCA schemes, concepts, and arguments advanced in this action by Mr. Meads.\n> \n> \n> \\[5] The Meads case illustrates many characteristic features of OPCA materials, in court conduct, and litigation strategies. These Reasons will, therefore, explain my June 8, 2012 decision and provide analysis and reasoning that is available for reference and application to other similar proceedings.\n> \n> \n> \\[6] Naturally, my conclusions are important for these parties. However, they also are intended to assist others, who have been taken in/duped by gurus, to realize that these practices are entirely ineffective; to empower opposing parties and their counsel to take action; and as a warning to gurus that the Court will not tolerate their misconduct.\n\nOne of the roles of a judge in the common\\-law legal system is to guide the development of the law. By describing this collection of vexatious tactics, the judge was hoping to allow future courts to simplify court responses to these tactics in future cases.\n\nWhile the reasons in *Meads* were written prior to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in *Hryniak v. Mauldin*, 2014 SCC 7, it is consistent with the Supreme Court's direction to create an environment that promotes timely access to justice.\n\n> Increasingly, there is recognition that a culture shift is required in order to create an environment promoting timely and affordable access to the civil justice system. This shift entails simplifying pre\\-trial procedures and moving the emphasis away from the conventional trial in favour of proportional procedures tailored to the needs of the particular case. The balance between procedure and access struck by our justice system must come to reflect modern reality and recognize that new models of adjudication can be fair and just.\n\nBy helping other judges efficiently understand and dispose of pseudo\\-legal commercial arguments, the reasons in *Meads* further the goals of access to justice. This implication was recongized in *Jarvis v. Morlog*, [2016 ONSC 4476](https://canlii.ca/t/gsdr5):\n\n> In my view, precious judicial time should be spent on resolving real matters. Simply taking judicial time to respond seriously to OPCA claims gives the claimants a measure of success in advancing their improper purposes. Associate Chief Justice Rooke spent more than enough of his very valuable time creating a textbook of abusive OPCA practices in *Meads v. Meads.* In my view, not another moment of judicial resources or party expense should be invested on OPCA claims.\n\nThe legacy of *Meads* is examined by Donald J. Netolitzky, \"[After the Hammer: Six Years of *Meads v. Meads*](https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/doc/2019CanLIIDocs2094)\" (2019\\). He argues that the judge was successful in this goal. He also agrees with you that this decision is \"exceptional\": in the breadth of its investigation and its choice of audience (at times speaking \"directly to those who use and promote OPCA concepts\"). He notes that *Meads* has been accepted in subsequent jurisprudence as a \"critical resource\" in Canada and around the world.\n\nWhile one might expect that the material in *Meads* would have been the more appropriate role of an academic article, Netolitzky observes that \"\\[i]n Canada, legal academia has paid essentially no attention to pseudolaw, both before and after *Meads*.\" Perhaps had there been a helpful body of academic literature, *Meads* would have been unnecessary.\n\nNetolitzky argues that the reasons in *Meads* reflected \"trial court expertise.\" These matters tend not to end up in courts of appeal. He also agrees with your analogy to an academic article, calling this a \"review judgment\" (like a \"review article\"). He says that *Meads* \"atypical content\" was needed to \"fill a gap in legal literature\" and that it was sufficiently connected with the materials and arguments put forward in the case. \"Without that context, Meads is a bizarre, inexplicable actor, a caricature of vexatious litigation.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: What was the primary purpose of Associate Chief Justice J.D. Rooke's extensive 176-page decision in the Meads v. Meads case, beyond addressing the immediate divorce dispute?\n\nA) To publish a comprehensive academic article on Sovereign Citizens within a court ruling\nB) To set a new precedent for the length and scope of judicial decisions in civil cases\nC) To categorize and address various pseudo-legal arguments to assist future courts in handling similar cases efficiently\nD) To use the court's platform to criticize the Canadian legal education system\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The primary purpose of Justice Rooke's extensive decision in Meads v. Meads was to categorize and address various pseudo-legal arguments, particularly those used by Organized Pseudo-legal Commercial Argument (OPCA) litigants. This was done to assist future courts in efficiently handling similar cases and to promote timely access to justice. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the decision was comprehensive, its primary purpose was not to serve as an academic article but as a practical guide for the courts.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the decision was not intended to set a precedent for the length of judicial decisions, but rather to provide a thorough analysis of a specific issue.\n\nOption C is correct as it aligns with the judge's stated intentions and the subsequent impact of the decision, as noted in the passage.\n\nOption D is incorrect because criticizing the legal education system was not a primary focus of the decision, even if it indirectly highlighted gaps in academic literature on the subject."}}
