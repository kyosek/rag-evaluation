This is legal. *See, e.g. SPARF v.U.S.* 156 U.S. 51 (1895\\); *U.S. vs Moylan*, 417 F 2d 1002, 1006 (4th Cir. 1969\\); *U.S. v.

The legal precedents cited, such as SPARF v. U.S., U.S. vs Moylan, and U.S. v.

Can I refuse entry to a specific representative of theirs (e.g. a plumber), and if so, on what basis am I allowed to refuse?\n\nResponse to answer/comment:\n\nMy reasoning for wanting to refuse them access is as follows:\n\n1. I do not trust the representative (rep). Mostly because I don't know\nthem so why should I.\n2. I currently work from home.\n3. This particular rep has been very unprofessional, particularly with communication and time management (always late, has twice cancelled after they were\ndue at the property, always underestimates ETAs \\- by months\nsometimes).

Given the above, I have to adjust my work schedule during their visits to mitigate disruption to my work and to monitor their work. This, coupled with their poor time management, wastes my time.

The question is not clear on that point.\n\nIf there is a specific and reasonable ground for refusing a particular representative or agent of the landlord, you might be able to do so. If, for example, that particular worker had previously insulted you in your apartment, or had attempted to steal from you there, you could probably refuse entrance and request the landlord to send a different worker to do the job.\n\nBut in general the landlord may choose his or her agents, and if it is a reasonable for an agent to be admitted, you must admit whatever agent the landlord sends. You can probably demand reasonable notice, depending on the terms of the lease. You may be able to demand to be present when the agent is to be in the premises, again depending on the lease.

Is it all just an act?***\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As I mentioned in [this answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/78365/17500) following the rule of law does not imply that the law guarantees any particular right, or adheres to any particular standard. It also does not imply that justice is done in every case.\n\nThe rule of law is a norm, an aspiration, not a promise that is kept in every case. It is probably beyond human ability to do exact justice in every legal case. In any event, the rule of law *per se* does not have to do with doing justice fairly, it has to do with respecting the laws as they stand, and not being subject to unlawful injustice by corrupt or biased officials.\n\nIf the law decrees, say, that sentences for using crack cocaine (favored by the poor and back) are ten times those for using powder cocaine (favored by the richer and whiter) and a court follows that law strictly, imposing those disparate sentences, then the rule of law has been fully satisfied, although perhaps not the principle of fair justice.\n\n> Why do people on this forum, and lawyers in general, behave as if their profession is so objective, unbiased, etc? Is it all just an act?\n\nMany answers on law.se have recognized that injustices in court, including wrongful convictions, happen with distressing frequency. It has also been mentioned that various laws are or may be perceived as unjust themselves. But since law.se is devoted to describing and explaining what the law is, and how it is supposed to work, unjust events which violate the law are of only limited relevance here, beyond noting that they do indeed violate the law. Whether an existing valid law is unjust is of even less relevance here, because the main subject is what the law is, not if it is good law or bad.\n\nIt might be argued that prosecutorial discretion vests excessive power over criminal cases in a single official, and that this is contrary to the general principle of the rule of law. But it has a very long history, and some practical reasons behind it. The courts do not have the resources that would be needed if every arguable violation of law were to be prosecuted to the limit, and in many cases doing so would quite likely work injustice, not justice. Perhaps a different system, involving some sort of review, might be better. But it is less than clear if such a system would in fact be an improvement, and it would surely add delay and expense. (In practice, most such decisions are made by an assistant prosecutor under one title or another, and reviewed by a senior prosecutor, so there is not a **single** official able to act on whim unchecked.)\n\nWhile it is true that (in the US) the Police cannot be legally compelled to enforce the law in a particular case, they normally do enforce it, and political and social forces combine to incline them to do so in most cases.\n\nI agree that it should be easier to overturn apparently wrongful convictions in the light of new evidence, but this is in part because the laws, as currently written, make it hard, and the courts are following the laws, thus upholding the rule of law. It has been said that courts do not enjoy a random commission to do acts of justice, meaning that they must follow the law. even when the result seems unjust to the judges.\n\nIt is also true that those involved in an allegedly wrongful conviction are **very** reluctant to admit past error, thinking that to do so will harm their current reputations, and perhaps endanger their political futures, and so such officials place unneeded obstacles in the way of such proceedings.\n\nI think that while US laws are sometimes unjust, and court proceedings are sometimes rigged or biased, this is less common than in some places, particularly in authoritarian countries. I will not claim that the US is the \"Greatest country in the world\", but I think that I can truly state that it has a higher level of ordinary justice than many places do, although perhaps not the highest anywhere.\n\nBut a high level of justice is **not** not the same as \"following the rule of law\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the rule of law and justice in the United States legal system?\n\nA) The rule of law guarantees fair and unbiased justice in every legal case.\nB) Following the rule of law always results in just outcomes, even if laws themselves may be unjust.\nC) The rule of law is an aspiration that focuses on respecting existing laws, but doesn't necessarily ensure justice in every case.\nD) The rule of law and justice are completely unrelated concepts in the US legal system.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the documentation states that \"the rule of law is a norm, an aspiration, not a promise that is kept in every case.\" It emphasizes that following the rule of law means respecting the laws as they stand, even if those laws may not always result in fair outcomes. The rule of law doesn't guarantee justice in every case, but rather focuses on applying the law consistently and avoiding arbitrary decisions by officials.

Instead they are consolidations, classifications, and editorial codifications made by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel.\n\nTitle 42 (noted in phoog's answer) is not a positive codification. This means Congress did not choose its numbering scheme. Only the titles with an asterisk [on this page](https://uscode.house.gov/#.xhtml) have been enacted as positive law.\n\nInstead, the law codified into Title 42 are the various public statutes passed by Congress over the years that the Law Revision Counsel has included in Title 42\\. It is the public statutes that have the force of law. See e.g. [Pub. L. 98\\-183](https://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=97&page=1301), whose elements the Law Revision Counsel put in Chapter 20A of Title 42\\.\n\nThe Law Revision Counsel says:\n\n> Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, is a non\\-positive law title. Title 42 is comprised of many individually enacted Federal statutes\u2013\u2013such as the Public Health Service Act and the Social Security Act\u2013\u2013that have been editorially compiled and organized into the title, but the title itself has not been enacted.\n\n[Whether a provision of a public statute is included in the U.S. Code and where it will be included is determined by the Law Revision Counsel](https://uscode.house.gov/about_classification.xhtml), although placement may be obvious when a statute amends an already codified statute.\n\nAs for the cramped numbering ([contrary to the comment of Weather Vane](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/94580/why-are-some-sections-of-the-us-code-formatted-so-weirdly#comment217877_94580), which says that insertions would require renumbering of subsequent clauses), the Law Revision Counsel says:\n\n> Chapters based on statutes that have been amended many times may have cumbersome numbering schemes with section numbers such as 16 U.S.C. 460zzz\\-7 and 42 U.S.C. 300ff\\-111\\.\n\nWhere the U.S. Code skips over large portions of section numbers this could be an intentional decision to leave room for growth, especially in a title that has undergone positive codification process through Congress, or it could be the result of previous sections that have been removed after repeal.\n\nFor more background, see the [detailed guide](https://uscode.house.gov/detailed_guide.xhtml) from the Law Revision Counsel.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the nature and organization of the U.S. Code?\n\nA) All titles in the U.S. Code are positive codifications enacted by Congress, with numbering schemes carefully planned to allow for future additions.\n\nB) The U.S. Code is entirely organized by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel, with no input from Congress on numbering or structure.\n\nC) Many titles in the U.S. Code are non-positive codifications, compiled by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel from various public statutes, which may result in unusual numbering schemes.\n\nD) The numbering system in the U.S. Code is always sequential, with no gaps or unusual alphanumeric combinations, regardless of whether the title is a positive or non-positive codification.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the nature of many titles in the U.S. Code.

The US government's position on what a derivative work is [here](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ14.pdf). They identify as an example \"A musical arrangement of a preexisting musical work\". One can check relevant US case law [here](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html) pertaining to \"fair use\" (a likely defense in case \"copying\" was found). The statutory definition of \"derivative work\" at [17 USC 101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101) is that it is\n\n> a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a\n>  translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,\n>  motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,\n>  condensation, or any other form *in which a work may be recast,\n>  transformed, or adapted*. A work consisting of editorial revisions,\n>  annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole,\n>  represent an original work of authorship, is a \u201cderivative work\u201d.\n\nOne may presume that the map is \"based on\" a protected work, so the question is whether it is recast, transformed of adapted: presumably, it is. A rhythm can be an element in a finding of infringement ([Dorchester Music v. National Broadcasting Company](http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/171/580/1555697/) 171 F. Supp. 580: melody and rhythm were fund to be substantially similar). However, many rhythms are centuries old or more, e.g. Dhruva Tala, Scandinavian polska. [This resource](http://mcir.usc.edu/) may also be useful in sorting out musical infringement questions. The essential question is whether the map \"copies\" a protected element of a composition, and that depends on what the map \"is\".\n\nWhether or not this matters to you depends mostly on whether you are creating the possibly infringing work (a map). If you are just creating a program that allows people to do something with what they already have, then there is no liability for infringement (just as a person who creates a program allowing sound to be recorded or sound files to be manipulated is not liable for infringement if someone uses the program to infringe on copyright).

Unfortunately, there is effectively no money in the estate which would allow me to hire a lawyer, so I'm hoping you folks can help.\n\nBy the time I found out about the passing, the house had lain fallow for six months. There were break\\-ins, burst pipes, the cops had been called multiple times but openly refused to investigate (we actually had a voicemail where the police officer explained that they didn't bother investigating reports of looting for that property anymore) which also meant there was no way to file reports with the police to report the stolen goods because they outright refused to have anything to do with the place.\n\nThe house had been refinanced six months before the passing. By the time I came on the scene, the house was in ruins and the refinancers were going crazy from lack of feeding\\- er, payment. I tried to ask for a stay from them, explaining the circumstances, and that I was trying to get the various paperwork and such in order. They conveniently lost almost every single document I sent them at their request, and when they did manage to track them down, would dispute them.\n\nMeanwhile, the insurance company (as an aside, we were more assuredly not in good hands, they made the whole process into a nightmare and if I had the money I would sue them for fraud) eventually paid out a check for the personal items and a check for the damage to the house. The former went into the estate account, the latter went to the mortgage company. A week before that resolution, the lenders announced that they were foreclosing on the property.\n\nAn hour ago, I was served with the foreclosure paperwork. I don't particularly see anything that I could do to stop the foreclosure (in part because I'm not really sure what I could do, and I also live several states away so showing up in court would be difficult), and none of the heirs particularly wants the place, especially now, so there doesn't seem much point in fighting it.\n\nSo. The money from the insurance company to pay for repairs for the house is a substantial percentage of the mortgage on the house ($45,000 on a mortgage of \\~$110,000\\). Assuming the house is foreclosed upon and presumably sold, what happens to the money? Can the loan company do what they want with the money, use it to fix up the house? Or can they short sale it and pocket the difference? What are my options here? Is the estate entitled to any money left after selling the house assuming the sale price plus the insurance money is above the mortgage loan balance? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: IANAL. I am not your lawyer. The following is not legal advice.\n\nThe insurance company, regardless of how you feel about their process, has it appears, to have discharged their duties, namely they have paid out two separate claims. The personal property claim has been paid to the estate as the beneficiary, while the property claim has been paid out with the mortgage company as the beneficiary.\n\nThe mortgage company seems, to me (disclaimer, I work at a financial institution, albeit in an IT role), to also be reasonable. Six months is an extremely long time without contact or payment (where I work, the loss mitigation department is sent all loans that are 3 months delinquent); the fact that you, the estate executor were not aware of the passing of the debtor is of no consequence. Also, many loans contain clauses that allow the lender to accelerate the loan (i.e. demand \"immediate\" payment of the whole outstanding balance). So they've started foreclosure proceedings, probably about 3 months ago.\n\n**As for the foreclosure proceedings:** The received $45,000 will be applied to the loan. The property (not just the house, but the entire lot) will be sold at public auction, as all foreclosed houses are in the state of New York. Proceeds from the sale of the house shall be applied to paying off the loan. If the proceeds exceed the outstanding mortgage amount, the estate will be sent the remaining proceeds. If the proceeds are less than the remaining amount, the estate is retains (i.e. owes) the remaining debt.\n\nEDIT: As an example of why the noting of jurisdiction is important on this stack\\-exchange, Nate Eldredge has informed me that in New York, it is possible for a judge to reduce the \"remaining debt\" of the estate by declaring that the sold house had a higher \"fair market value\" than it sold for.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a foreclosure on a property in an estate in New York, where insurance money has been paid to the mortgage company for repairs, what happens to any excess funds after the property is sold at auction?\n\nA) The excess funds are automatically kept by the mortgage company as compensation for their troubles.\n\nB) The excess funds are returned to the insurance company that originally paid out the claim.\n\nC) The excess funds are given to the estate, but only if the executor challenges the foreclosure in court.\n\nD) The excess funds are sent to the estate after the mortgage is paid off.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, if the proceeds from the foreclosure sale plus the insurance money exceed the outstanding mortgage amount, the remaining funds will be sent to the estate.

See, for instance, [*Gibbons v. Odgen*, 22 U.S. 1, at 210\\-211 (1824\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/22/1/case.html#210) (emphasis added):\n\n> This opinion has been frequently expressed in this Court, and is founded as well on the nature of the government as on the words of the Constitution. In argument, however, it has been contended that, if a law passed by a State, in the exercise of its acknowledged sovereignty, comes into conflict with a law passed by Congress in pursuance of the Constitution, they affect the subject and each other like equal opposing powers.\n> \n> \n> But the framers of our Constitution foresaw this state of things, and provided for it by declaring the supremacy not only of itself, but of the laws made in pursuance of it. The nullity of any act inconsistent with the Constitution is produced by the declaration that the Constitution is the supreme law. The appropriate application of that part of the clause which confers the same supremacy on laws and treaties is to such acts of the State Legislatures as do not transcend their powers, but, though enacted in the execution of acknowledged State powers, interfere with, or are contrary to, the laws of Congress made in pursuance of the Constitution or some treaty made under the authority of the United States. **In every such case, the act of Congress or the treaty is supreme, and the law of the State, though enacted in the exercise of powers not controverted, must yield to it.**\n\nFederal preemption exists to ensure that the topics of regulation that the Constitution delegates to the federal government are under the effective control of the federal government. Regulation is not always restrictive; sometimes, Congress (or a federal regulatory agency) will decide that some actions should be *allowed* in order to achieve federal objectives. In *Gibbons*, for instance, Congress set up a licensing scheme for coastal maritime trade. New York had set up a monopoly on steamboat navigation in New York waters. Both laws are acceptable in isolation; New York can pass laws about New York waters, while Congress can pass laws about interstate shipping. But while it was possible to comply with both sets of laws, New York's laws would undermine the federal system of interstate shipping, and so they were preempted.\n\nWhen preemption comes up in court cases, the power of Congress to preempt is generally not in question (there are some edge cases, like when Congress is directly interfering with internal state operations, but those are edge cases). The question is whether Congress actually intended to preempt state laws. When Congress explicitly says \"state laws are preempted,\" it's easy to figure out that they did mean to preempt them. Otherwise, federal courts look to whether the state laws conflict with the federal laws (in the sense that it's impossible to comply with both), whether the state laws are an obstacle to the full achievement of Congressional objectives, and whether the Congressional regulation is so extensive that it occupies the field, leaving literally no room for states to do anything in the area.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the doctrine of federal preemption, which of the following scenarios would most likely result in a state law being preempted by federal law?\n\nA) A state law that regulates air quality standards more strictly than federal standards, in a case where Congress has explicitly stated that federal air quality standards are a minimum requirement.\n\nB) A state law that prohibits the sale of certain firearms, while federal law permits their sale but requires background checks.\n\nC) A state law that sets a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum wage.\n\nD) A state law that establishes a monopoly on interstate shipping within its waters, while federal law has created a licensing system for coastal maritime trade.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \n\nOption D is the correct answer because it closely mirrors the example from Gibbons v. Ogden discussed in the passage.

In the scenarios you have outlined elsewhere, an arbitration clause is to be enforced by virtue of it being a contractual matter rather than because the clause is about arbitration. A mere change of parties to a contract generally does not preclude enforcement of provisions in that contract. That is because the new party acquires the rights and obligations pursuant to the contract.\n\n> Does the new policy differ based on whether we know the two parties entered in an agreement to arbitrate at some point vs. when the parties dispute the formation of an arbitration agreement in the first place?\n\nNo. A dispute of whether the parties formed an arbitration agreement is moot if there is evidence \\-\\-i.e., \"*we know*\"\\-\\- that they entered an agreement to arbitrate. But the policy itself remains the same.\n\nEnforcement of the FAA is premised on the ascertainment that the party(\\-ies) \"*knew of the right \\[to arbitrate]*\", just as with any other contract.\n\n> Are there any instances where the courts have favored arbitration (especially in NJ), after the U.S Supreme Court ruling?\n\nThat seems unlikely.

The pleading is for a mandatory injunction against the directors of a corporation located in Boston which does not involve any monetary claims.\n\nThere are two possible venues: the Central Division of the Boston Municipal Court and the Suffolk County Superior Court.\n\nI have read conflicting information. On one hand I have read that the Superior Court only hears cases involving claims over $25,000, however, I have also read that the the municipal court's jurisdiction only extends to cases cases involving monetary claims, and if a tort does not involve monetary damages, and only injunctive relief and does not fall into a special category (family, probate, etc), then it has Superior Court jurisdiction. Any opinions which it should be?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short Answer**\n\nThe Superior Court is the court of general jurisdiction and the primary equity court will full authority over cases seeking injunctive relief. So, if the case does not fall into a category such as family court, probate court, or land court, the Superior Court is probably the correct court.\n\nThe District Court has limited equity jurisdiction, but the wording of the statute giving it equity jurisdiction is ambiguous and doesn't appear to divest the Superior Court of any authority, so the Superior Court is probably correct, although it is hard to know without more information. For example, Housing Court is part of District Court (i.e. Boston Municipal Court), and so injunctions relating to landlord\\-tenant issues might properly be brought in that court.\n\n**Superior Court Jurisdiction**\n\nSuperior Court original civil jurisdiction (i.e. opposed to appellate or criminal jurisdiction), other than territorial jurisdiction (I am assuming that Boston is actually the right location for your claim without knowing what it is for sake of argument) is as follows:\n\n> The court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of civil actions\n>  for the foreclosure of mortgages, and of real and mixed actions,\n>  **except those of which the land court or district courts have\n>  jurisdiction**, of complaints for flowing lands, and of claims against\n>  the commonwealth.

Here's why:\n\n1. The Superior Court has general equity jurisdiction, which includes the power to grant injunctions. This is stated in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, \u00a7 1.\n\n2. While the Boston Municipal Court (a type of District Court) does have some equity powers, these are limited. According to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, \u00a7 19C, their equity powers are restricted to specific areas, mainly related to summary process actions, civil actions for money damages, and certain health code violations.\n\n3. The case doesn't involve monetary claims, which rules out jurisdiction based on the $25,000 threshold mentioned for both courts.\n\n4. This case doesn't fall into any special category (like family, probate, or land disputes) that would give jurisdiction to a specialized court.\n\n5. The Superior Court is described as having \"original jurisdiction of all civil actions, except those of which other courts have exclusive original jurisdiction\" (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 212, \u00a7 4).\n\nTherefore, given the nature of the case - a request for injunctive relief in a corporate matter with no monetary claims - the Suffolk County Superior Court is the most appropriate venue.

According to the documentation, a bar is only considered a public accommodation during its regular operating hours when it's open to the general public. When the bar owner rents out the establishment to a private group, it temporarily becomes a private space. During this rental period, the private group (in this case, the ethnic club) has the right to decide who to admit or exclude, even based on ethnicity.

The $1000 prize money and $4600 of entry fees are essentially pass-through funds that do not represent income for the company.

Whether such a claim will be believed is another matter. A party to a contract with a \"wet\\-ink\" signature can claim that it was forged or that the signer was impersonated. But such claims are hard to prove, particularly if they are not true.\n\nThe answer to the question in the title is that terms are binding if the user freely agrees to them, and if they meet the conditions for a legally binding agreement in the relevant jurisdiction. The question in the body is more about what evidence will establish this.\n\nSuppose the code behind a web\\-site is so designed that no user is allowed to proceed without affirmatively accepting the ToS, and the operator can demonstrate this. That will be persuasive evidence that the user did accept the terms. If the site logs the consent in a database along with a timestamp that would be further evidence. A journaling database provides an audit trail of changes, which would be further evidence.\n\nEvidence of other users that the site always worked that way, and of coders that the code had never permitted a user to proceed without accepting the ToS might also help. Backups of the DB stored with a 3rd party including the consent logs would also provide evidence that the timestamps were present and unchanged. A hash of the log can be stored on the blockchain.\n\nThe site could also send a \"registration accepted\" email to the user (if the user has provided an email address) which could include a mention that the user had accepted the ToS. Such an email would be reserved in the logs of the senders and receiver's email providers, and could be retrieved as evidence.\n\nUltimately it will be a question of what the finder of fact believes, if the matter goes to court. And as user Amon says, the US standard is preponderance of the evidence (that is, the evidence is at least a little bit stronger on one side.

In this case, the landlord only provided 3 hours notice, which violates this requirement. However, there is no legal obligation for the landlord to leave a note after completing repairs.

When his father died, his mother contacted him, and they began to rebuild a relationship. She came to the US 8 different times to visit over the next 25 years. I failed to mention that upon his father's death he left his mother a very, very wealthy woman. Over the years of visits and many phone conversations his mother assured my husband at her death, he and his younger brother would never want for anything. She told him that there was a trust that would handle everything. My husband received a phone call from his aunt in mid\\-May of last year (2021\\) who told him his mother had died several weeks before of lung cancer. Because of the pandemic, the funeral was virtual. My husband's mother had many personal assets as well as a bank account and most probably real estate holding. There was only my Husband and his younger brother, no other siblings. My husband received NOTHING! No one will give us any information about anything. We were told that there was most likely no will because there was a trust. My question isn't a trusted company responsible for treating the client's assets fairly? His brother knows we have no money to get a lawyer so he simply took everything, isn't this the same as stealing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can't give personal legal advice, but we can explain in general terms what the law is.\n\nApparently, the mother, brother and estate are outside the US, in country X. The disposition of the estate follows the laws of X, so you would need an attorney who can practice law in country X. The primary issue is, (1\\) how are estates probated in X and (2\\) what provisions, if any, did the deceased(s) make for the disposition of the estate (was there a will; a trust; did one or more parents die intestate?).\n\nTo simplify matters, we will assume that the laws of X are very similar to US law (which is not uniform \u2013 it is state\\-specific, but broadly similar). In the US, assets can be in a trust and can be directly transferred to a beneficiary. The disposition of the assets may be irrevocable, meaning that the person setting it up can decide who gets what, and then that cannot be changed.\n\nIt is thus possible that a child could be excluded as a beneficiary of a trust. E.g. the father could set up a trust with just the mother and brother as beneficiaries. The mother may simply have been misinformed as to what the trust document said. Or, there could have been illegal misappropriation of funds, even something as heinous as providing fraudulent documents purporting that an actually living beneficiary is dead. In other words, even though you can't afford a (foreign) attorney, that is realistically the only way to get a clear answer, if the brother is being uncooperative or untruthful.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of international estate law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the situation described?\n\nA) The husband automatically inherits a portion of his mother's estate due to being her son, regardless of the existence of a trust.\n\nB) The laws of the United States govern the disposition of the estate, since the son is now a U.S. resident.\n\nC) If there is a trust, it must be administered fairly and equally among all children, regardless of the trust's terms.\n\nD) The disposition of the estate follows the laws of the country where the deceased resided, and a local attorney would be needed to investigate the matter.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. In international estate cases, the laws of the country where the deceased resided typically govern the disposition of the estate. This means that even though the son lives in the US, the estate would be handled according to the laws of his mother's country of residence. To properly investigate and potentially contest the distribution of assets, an attorney licensed to practice in that specific country would be necessary.

While there have been attempts to introduce more specific legislation, such as \"The Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill, 2005,\" these have not yet been enacted into law.

After filing a lawsuit, the ACLU received over 500 documents from its request.\n\nAccording to [this ACLU page](https://www.aclu.org/other/more-about-intelligence-agencies-ciadni-spying):\n\n> An ACLU lawsuit revealed that the CIA has also used National Security Letters to demand Americans' personal financial records without prior court approval. The CIA has acknowledged using National Security Letters \"on a limited basis\" to obtain financial information from U.S. companies.\n\nAccording nto [this NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/washington/14spy.html?auth=login-email) from Jan 13 2007:\n\n> The C.I.A. has also been issuing what are known as national security letters to gain access to financial records from American companies, though it has done so only rarely, intelligence officials say.\n\nThere are other circumstances in which an executive branch government official may order a private citizen to take specific action. Indeed, this happens in almost every case of a police arrest, except those done by an arrest warrant (which is a court order). \n\nDuring the Korean War, President Truman issued an order seizing a number of steel mills, to be operated by the government, in order to stop a strike which was, he said, impeding the military effort and thus the security of the United States. This order was challenged in the case of [*Youngstown Sheet \\& Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown_Sheet_%26_Tube_Co._v._Sawyer) and was overturned on the ground that the President was not only not\\-authorized by any law, but had failed to follow the provisions of a law dealing with situations of the kind at issue.

The information provided indicates that executive branch agencies, when authorized by statute, can issue orders to private citizens, such as National Security Letters. These orders are typically not issued directly by the President, but by authorized investigative agencies. The orders must comply with specific legal requirements and are limited in scope.\n\nOption A is incorrect because presidential orders to civilians are not unconstrained and typically require statutory authorization. \n\nOption B is false because there are indeed circumstances where executive agencies can issue orders to private citizens.\n\nOption D is incorrect because National Security Letters are not exclusively issued by the President and their use is restricted by law to specific circumstances, not for any purpose deemed necessary by the executive branch."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70691/why-was-it-formerly-illegal-to-use-the-swiss-coat-of-arms-in-the-united-states", "docs_id": 70691, "title": "Why was it formerly illegal to use the Swiss coat of arms in the United States?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 708 formerly made the unauthorised commercial usage of the Swiss coat of arms (the white cross on a red field) a criminal offense in the United States.

is correct as it accurately reflects the provision in Article 53 \u00a7 2 of the First Geneva Convention 1949, which mandates the protection of the Swiss coat of arms to avoid confusion with the Red Cross symbol.\nC is likely incorrect because even though 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 708 was repealed, the protection may have been transferred to another part of the US code due to international obligations.\nD is incorrect because while Switzerland is known for neutrality, this is not the reason for the international protection of its coat of arms."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source":

2009](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/23/contents) which creates the offence of depositing objects in the UK's territorial waters without a

2009 is the most applicable law in this scenario. Section 65 of the Act requires a license for depositing objects in UK territorial waters, which Greenpeace likely did not have. The act of dropping boulders falls under the definition of a \"licensable marine activity\" in Section 66. The maximum penalty for this offense, as stated in Section 85(4), is a fine or imprisonment for up to two years, or both, when convicted on indictment. While other laws might be relevant, this Act specifically addresses the unauthorized depositing of objects in marine areas and carries the most severe penalties among the options provided."}}
