So this does not \"override\" state law. If you refuse admission, they must obtain a warrant (constitutional requirement), making the justification subject to judicial review, i.e. conformity with the states grounds for such entry.

This aligns with constitutional requirements and does not override state trespassing laws. \n\nOption A is incorrect because firefighters do not have unrestricted access; there are limitations and procedures they must follow. \n\nOption B is too restrictive, as the code does allow for inspections without a warrant in certain circumstances, though permission or a warrant is required if entry is denied. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the city code does not override state law or constitutional protections against unreasonable searches, and it does not give firefighters unlimited access without restrictions."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37234/licensing-an-idea-to-public", "docs_id": 37234, "title": "Licensing an idea to public?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: With my research, it looks like a patent doesn't really make much profit from it due to the high maintenance fee. So I'm thinking is it possible to license my idea to public (for free or way less money) so that anyone can integrate into their product while they can't register as their patent. Something like Creative Common for innovations. Is there such a method?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are correct that it is quite expensive to patent something in U.S. law.\n\nUnder U.S. patent law, once an idea is publicly published, if no one else has a patent application for the same idea that is pending, the idea enters the public domain and no one can obtain a patent of that idea. The publication become \"prior art\" with respect to any future patent application which cannot be protected by patent law.\n\nOf course, if you publish an invention which you discovered independently, that someone else already has a patent application pending for that will be approved the following week, the fact that you published it after the patent was applied for doesn't prevent the person with the pending patent application from having it approved.\n\nThe term \"invention\" rather than \"idea\" is what I will use for the remainder of this answer, because there are many ideas which may not be patented, while the lion's share of patentable ideas are appropriately described as \"inventions.\" But, understand that as used in this answer, the term \"invention\" is being used to refer to the concepts and ideas necessary to make the invention, and not to a particular instance of a product made using those concepts and ideas.\n\nWhen an invention is in the public domain, anyone can utilize the invention free of charge without a license. People who use the invention are not even required to acknowledge that you invented or discovered it.\n\nAn invention is also not eligible to be patented if more than a year has elapsed since the first sale of a product using it. But, in that case, the invention can still be protected as a trade secret until it is voluntarily disclosed in some fashion to someone who is not subject to a non\\-disclosure agreement. (I say voluntary, because the fact that, for example, an unauthorized corporate spy sees the trade secret doesn't end the status of the invention as a trade secret.)\n\nSome inventions, are effectively publicly disclosed and published the moment that anyone looks at it closely. \n\nThe patentable element of other inventions are invisible to an end user, or to observer of an end user.\n\nFor example, if the invention involves something in the interior of a device, or the invention involves something not visible to the naked eye (e.g. a process for synthesizing an industrial chemical from other chemicals where the chemical formula of the ingredients and end result can't be determined without a microscope or analytical chemistry tests), merely showing someone a product made using the invention will not put it in the public domain.\n\nIt is generally legal to reverse engineer or independently come up with an invention which is merely a trade secret. It is not legal to use a patented invention or process, even if it is not directly copied and is instead reverse engineered or independently discovered, during the lifetime of the patent.\n\nThere is no straightforward way to put an invention into the public domain while retaining any right to acknowledgement that you invented it or otherwise exercise control through a licensing agreement without patenting it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An inventor has developed a new manufacturing process but doesn't want to pursue a patent due to high costs.

The documentation emphasizes that not every imbalance in bargaining power implies duress or coercion. The banker had the option to decline the bonus and avoid the repayment clause. It would be difficult to prove that refusing to sign would end their career, as other employment opportunities exist in the field.

I'm pretty sure that, just a few years ago when I lived there, all such packaging had indication of trademark status. Did the law change since then? Can someone provide details, please?

Many company lawyers thought that they helped make a stronger case for infringement actions if someone did infringe.

However failure to use it may reduce the damages available in the case of infringement.\n\nI cannot find any provision of US law authorizing or requiring the use of the tm symbol. It appears to be a matter of common law, that is judge\\-made law, and a reference to court cases would be needed.\n\nThere have been significant developments in US trademark law in recent years, but mostly in the degree to which First Amendment concerns are being held to limit tr4ademark protections. I found no change in regard to the symbols, their use, meaning or effect.\n\nMany countries, unlike the US, do not grant protection to trademarks unless they are registered, so the tm symbol is largely a US usage.\n\nWhat Changed?\n-------------\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in US law on this issue in recent years. I see lots of tm and \u00ae symbols on everyday products. I just looked at the power supply for my laptop and it has a tm after the maker's name. I just looked at a candy bar wrapper and it carries an \u00ae. If there WAS a recent court case that changed the practice or influenced a change I haven't heard of it, and I've done some reading in recent major trademark cases. But I am not a lawyer, much less an IP lawyer, so I can't be sure.\n\nAnother possibility is that the comparatively large symbol adjacent to the large logo on the front of the package was removed, and a smaller logo, with symbol, was placed on the back of the package.

We live in the US (the state of Ohio) and have been divorced (technically a dissolution) for around 2 years. As our child is not yet school age we opted to put off assigning a \"custodial parent\" (which, I know, is rapidly approaching). \n\nSince before we were divorced I have suspected my ex has a drinking problem but perhaps naively (or more likely for lack of visibility) I had thought she compartmentalized her drinking to her off\\-parenting time. Recently, however, there was an event that gave me great cause for concern and I want to be sure I understand the law so as not to mistep. \n\nLast weekend, I was asked to watch my son for a few hours on a day that was scheduled hers (he had been cooped up in the house sick and was apparently driving her nuts). I took him out to run errands with me for a few hours but when it came time to drop him back off I received an alarming text message. \n\nEssentially, she let me know that she had been drinking so it wasn't a good idea for her to meet us at the playground where we were going to be, so instead could I drop him off directly at her house? Obviously concerned, I asked her how much she had drank, to please stop and indicated I could keep him for an additional couple of hours while she took efforts to sober up. She was (understandably?) outraged, claimed to have drank only 3 beers and demanded I drop him off immediately. I held my ground and (after a lot of arguing) we eventually rescheduled the drop\\-off time to later in the day. \n\nOne of the things she let slip (verbally) while we were arguing was that she apparently regularly drinks while she has him but never drives \"even after one beer\" and \"never gets drunk\" when he is around. \n\nSince this episode, I have been reading up on denied visitation and the contempt charges that can spur from that and so I want to be very careful in how I act. At the end of the day I want to protect my son but I'm also scared that I could jeopardize my ability to gain primary or full custody of him. I understand I need to document everything I see to begin building a case (which I have started) but I also want to be sure that if I have to involve the police that I do so in a way that doesn't harm my case.\n\nMy Questions:\n\n* Is there a legal standard as to how sober a care\\-giver must be to safely watch a child (or in other words) how drunk does my ex have to be for me to deny a drop\\-off? Is it entirely based upon outward signs or blood\\-alcohol level?\n* Am I correct in assuming that in order to protect myself from being accused of denying visitation, that (in the future) I need to involve the police if I suspect her of being intoxicated?\n* If I involve the police, do I need to be sure that she is extremely intoxicated in order to avoid a \"false alarm\"? (Obviously this scares me as I'd prefer she didn't drink at all)\n* What options do I have, if any, if she drinks around him in her own home? Is she within her legal right as long as she doesn't get in a car, doesn't pass out or does something blatantly abusive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In 50/50 custody you have the right to stand your ground to ensure the safety and well being of your children. You do not need to involve police unless it is an emergency. \"911 Operator, what is the emergency\". Only call them when you feel your children are in grave danger. For example, you know for sure that the other parent is drunk and driving, or the other parent is drunk and on the ground unable to move and the child is in danger, etc.\n\nIf you involve the police over your partner excessive drinking than, and they find that she was not excessively drinking, you will face false accusation charges and her lawyer will try to make you look like the bad guy trying to take away her children.\n\n**how drunk does my ex have to be for me to deny a drop\\-off? Is it entirely based upon outward signs or blood\\-alcohol level?**\n\n*You should not search for drugs or alcohol, or administer tests, as to avoid the accusation of an illegal search.*\n\nYou can, however, based on your judgment of common sense assess the situation and see how drunk (s)he is and make your decision based on that circumstances. Make a 1\\-page log to document the date, time, situation description (3\\-5 sentences of what you see and why you make that decision.) It would be wise to have a witness around, so write down the person name as well for reference, (NOT MANY PEOPLE LIKE TO BE WITNESSES, But you can write down the people names that you know were around that incident.)

It really reduces to this sentence: \"Having concluded there's no genuine dispute as to any of the material facts, I conclude that the Plaintiff is\nentitled to judgment on liability as a matter of law\". There is ample discussion in the preceding pages establishing that the two sides agreed on the legally\\-material facts. Defendants (who represented themselves) may have had some idea for a \"matter of law\" defense, and did propose that plaintiff is a \"public figure\" (thus bring in the \"actual malice\" standard), but the judge ruled against that.

This allowed for a summary judgment on liability. The key legal principle demonstrated is that when both sides agree on the material facts in a defamation case, the court can rule on liability as a matter of law, without needing a full trial. Fetzer's defense failed not because of issues with opinion or disclosed facts (A), nor due to the actual malice standard (B), which the judge ruled did not apply as Pozner was not a public figure.

The citizen placed the call after he drove past a roadkill deer off to the side of the road.

To my knowledge, a LEO is the only one with the authority \u2013 save a wildlife related authority \u2013 who could discharge a firearm for the purpose of euthanizing a wounded animal.

Can the officer allow *dispatch* to tell the citizen that he has permission?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\nThis is governed by state law (for state law enforcement officers granting this authority) or federal law (in the case of authority granted by a federal law enforcement officer), so the details may vary from case to case.\n\nIn many circumstances, however, a law enforcement officer has the authority to temporarily 'grant' his authority to another private citizen in order to deal with a specific incident.\n\nWhen this is done one says that the law enforcement officer \"deputized\" the person who was given this authority.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\n### The Power To Deputize Civilians\n\nMost states have statutory circumstances under which certain kinds of law enforcement officers can deputize a non\\-law enforcement officer to carry out a law enforcement function under the supervision, direction and control of a law enforcement officer, on an incident by incident basis.\n\nFor example, if a single sheriff responds to a bar fight with several people who need to be arrested, under most state's law, the sheriff could authorize a bouncer or patron at the bar who wouldn't have the power to make a citizen's arrest under the circumstances (e.g. because the patron arrived at the scene after the alleged fight took place) to detain a suspect whom the sheriff has the power to arrest, until additional law enforcement personnel can come to the scene to assist.\n\nColorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 16\\-3\\-202 is typical of such a statute. It states:\n\n> (1\\)\u2002A peace officer making an arrest may command the assistance of any\n> person who is in the vicinity.\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2002A person commanded to assist a peace officer has the same\n> authority to arrest as the officer who commands his assistance.\n> \n> \n> (3\\)\u2002A person commanded to assist a peace officer in making an arrest\n> shall not be civilly or criminally liable for any reasonable conduct\n> in aid of the officer or for any acts expressly directed by the\n> officer.\n> \n> \n> (4\\)\u2002Private citizens, acting in good faith, shall be immune from any\n> civil liability for reporting to any police officer or law enforcement\n> authority the commission or suspected commission of any crime or for\n> giving other information to aid in the prevention of any crime.\n\nFurther, another Colorado statute provides that \"conduct which would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal when it is required or authorized by a provision of law or a judicial decree binding in Colorado,\" including laws \"defining duties of private citizens to assist public servants in the performance of certain of their functions.\" Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 18\\-1\\-701 (in pertinent parts).\n\nThe exact details of how someone is deputized, who may deputize someone, and what authority this conveys varies in detail from state to state. Also, often this is done piecemeal, rather than globally, or is implied in part under common law agency principles. The power of a law enforcement officer to deputize someone to kill a dying deer hit in a car accident is likely to be in a different statutory section than the power of a law enforcement officer to deputize someone to make an arrest.\n\nPeople who are deputized by a law enforcement officer in this fashion are collectively called a [posse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse).\n\nThe posse was heavily used in rural areas and frontier areas into the early 20th century, but this authority is now, while still utilized, much less commonly used, and less familiar, especially in urban areas with large professional police departments. In these areas, it is more common for police to resort to mutual aid agreements with regional law enforcement agencies to seek reinforcements who are law enforcement officers at some other agency, rather than seeking help from private citizens.\n\n### Other Solutions\n\nOften, conduct that literally fits the definition of prohibited conduct, like possession of a wildlife carcass without a license, is resolved in regulations or definitions in a statute or regulation that exclude the conduct in question from what is prohibited.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, the definition of hunting, which is what you need a license to do, is defined in such a way as to exclude road kill related incidents. *See, e.g.,* Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 33\\-1\\-102(25\\.5\\), (29\\) and (43\\).\n\n### The Legal Doctrine Of Reliance On Official Authority\n\nThere is also another legal doctrine that can make it possible to achieve almost the same result.\n\nAs a matter of U.S. Constitutional law, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that a criminal defendant may not be punished for actions taken in good faith reliance upon authoritative assurances that the defendant will not be punished for his actions. *See U.S. v. Laub*, 385 U.S. 475 (1967\\); *Cox v. Louisiana*, 379 U.S. 559 (1965\\); and *Raley v. Ohio*, 360 U.S. 423 (1959\\).\n\nFor example, suppose that a 911 dispatcher tells a passing motorist that she has the authority to authorize the motorist to shoot and kill the deer because she is deputizing the motorist to do so, and that the applicable state law actually provides that a private citizen may be deputized to euthanize a deer struck in a car accident when a law enforcement officer deputizing the citizen is physically present. Despite this fact, if the motorist has no reason to believe that the dispatcher doesn't have this authority (even though the dispatcher does not have this authority under state law), the motorist is immune from criminal liability for shooting a deer out of season without a license pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court cases cited above.\n\nAnd, while the dispatcher's conduct may have technically violated state law by directing someone to violate the law under circumstances when the dispatcher did not have the authority to do so, the District Attorney is likely to decide that this technical violation of the state's hunting laws by the dispatcher, whether or not the dispatcher knew that the dispatcher did not have the authority to deputize the motorist, is not an offense that warrants prosecution. Indeed, prosecutors routinely overlook technical violations of the law by law enforcement officers who are carrying out their duties in good faith or for other non\\-selfish reasons (e.g. out of a desire to treat the downed deer humanely without diverting law enforcement resources urgently needed elsewhere at the time).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A sheriff in a rural county receives a call about a mortally wounded deer on the side of the road.

Boxing and MMA are regulated by state athletic commissions primarily because these sports involve intentional physical harm to opponents, which would normally violate criminal laws. State regulation provides a legal framework and exceptions for these activities. Additionally, the regulation helps address concerns about gambling and historical issues with corruption in combat sports.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because boxing and MMA are not considered protected forms of free speech under the First Amendment.

For instance, WonderWidgets might try to prevent its janitor from going to work for AAA because it taught him how to mop floors, and it has cleaner floors than AAA, and therefore its cleaning techniques must be superior, and therefore those techniques must be protected.\n\nThere are some states in which WonderWidgets would win the cinnamon case, and some where Jane would win, because the state doesn't recognize inevitable\\-disclosure at all.

Each act of copying is an infringing act, so if there are copyings to 1,000,000 devices, there are 1,000,000 devices whose owners are liable for copyright infringement.\n\nThe person who distribute the software might also be liable, per [MGM v.

That permission can be rescinded, but only by the owner. The owner seems to have given permission and has stated in advance some conditions under which permission might be rescinded. The towing company could be called (by the owner) to act as the agent for the owner and remove the offending vehicle; but the towing company cannot just up an do this on their own. If they *were* to spontaneously tow a vehicle without officially acting on behalf of the owner, they would be liable for damages, owing to their having torted some guy's chattels. So the company will want to know that they are protected, in acting as the agent of the property owner. One way to do that is to verify that the person calling the towing company is the owner. Another would be to get the caller to swear that they are the owner and indemnify them against damages, in case they get sued. That pound of cure is more costly and annoying than the ounce of prevention of making sure that you're towing a car with proper authorization, so it's unlikely that they would just tow the car on your say\\-so.\n\nYou might try suing the complex owner for some kind of breach of contract, if you think you have a contractual right to a parking space and they are negligent in doing what's necessary to meet your contractual right.

The question is, who is responsible, the vendor or the manufacturer? Under The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the manufacturer primarily bears liability. The bad news is that the seller is not primarily responsible, unless they have \"done something\" with the product (installed it, modified it, further warrantied it), but also is \"the identity of the manufacturer is not known or if known the service of notice or process or warrant cannot be affected on the manufacturer or it the manufacturer is not subject to the law which is force in India\", i.e. the manufacturer is in another country and isn't subject to Indian law.

The case underlying that ruling arose from a product that repeatedly failed after multiple repairs where the manufacturer played the \"expired warranty\" card after a number of repairs, but the underlying legal principle is equally applicable to the situation where a repair or replacement is not even made though applied for within the period of warranty.\n\nSo you should sue the manufacturer, unless the manufacturer is not subject to Indian law, in which case you should sue the seller.

The lease and [California law](http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/sec-deposit.shtml) agree that normal wear and tear is not the responsibility of the tenant. You may then need to sue the landlord in small claims court to get the remainder of the deposit (the above guide will be useful). The thing that is not clear is exactly what constitutes \"normal wear and tear\". The state guide tends to emphasize extreme forms of damage such as dogs chewing the woodwork, or cigarette burns.

The property now shows signs of regular wear-and-tear after the tenancy period. The landlord wants to renovate the property at the tenant's expense to restore it to \"new\" condition. Based on California landlord-tenant law, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The tenant is responsible for restoring the property to \"new\" condition because they acknowledged its new state when moving in.\n\nB) The landlord can use the entire security deposit to renovate the property to \"new\" condition, regardless of wear-and-tear.\n\nC) The tenant is only responsible for damages beyond normal wear-and-tear, and the landlord cannot charge for ordinary wear-and-tear.\n\nD) The tenant and landlord must split the cost of renovation equally to restore the property to its original condition.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to California law and the lease agreement, tenants are not responsible for normal wear-and-tear. The landlord can only use the security deposit to repair damage beyond ordinary wear-and-tear, clean the premises if necessary, or cover unpaid rent. The tenant's acknowledgment of the property's \"new\" condition at move-in establishes a baseline but does not obligate them to return it to that exact state if the changes are due to normal use over time.

My conclusion is that for most of the web\\-sites we manage, Google's IP anonymization is *adequate* to ensure *security of processing* as required by the DPIA process. However, on some sites that are likely to visited by users interested in what the GDPR calls \"special categories of personal data\" (Article 9\\), we either do not use Google Analytics, or we add additional layers of security in case the USA Government orders Google to disregard the stipulations in the DPA and hand over the data (yes, the US Government can legally do that \\- read the fine print in the Privacy Shield accord).\n\nAs for Facebook Analytics, I think you've simply misunderstood their [policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php).\n\nNowhere in that policy document does Facebook say that they \"are not collecting Personal Identifiable Information\".\n\nAFAIK, they collect tons of it, in all sorts of obnoxious and sneaky ways.\n\nWhat they actually say about PII in the context of Analytics is this:\n\n> We do not *share* information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission.\n\nLet me remind you that one of their \"analytics partners\" was Cambridge Analytica, so if this promise not to share is true, it looks like a pretty new policy.\n\nOK, moving on to cookie compliance.\n\nTo you (the controller), both Google and Facebook are processors.\n\nGiven the history of the NSA and the methods it have used and AFAIK still use to get US\\-based companies to hand over the personal data about Europeans through orders issued by secret FISA courts, plus the fact that total nutcases currently are in charge in the USA, I am not going to rely on the privacy policy of any US\\-company for protection of personal data.\n\nSo *if* I make use of Google Analytics (and I often do, they provide a great service), I always make sure that my users opt\\-in on that (hard cookie concent), even I make use of their IP anonymization feature (YMMV).\n\nAs for Facebook, the fact that they promise *not* to share PII with third parties is irrelevant because they *collect* personal data.

And co\\-tenant A wanted to move out of the place. So A convinced B and C that if as co\\-tenants A,B, and C sign the new lease identical to the original without A's name on it (effectively \"removing\" A from the lease), A would in exchange, provide postdated checks to the landlord for the next three months of \"A's portion\" of the rent, plus the lease change agreement fee. So B and C signed the new lease without A on it.\n\nNote that here, A's agreement to pay \"A's portion\" (which technically isn't spelled out in the lease) of the rent was only communicated to B and C, and not the landlord. In fact, for the lease change, the landlord did not inquire nor care about who will pay how much \\- just that the rent for the place were to be paid by somebody (including possibly those outside the lease).\n\nSoon after A moved out, B and C found out that A in fact, asked the landlord to give A back the postdated checks, and B and C are the only ones obligated to pay the upcoming rent.\n\nSo in summary, what's remaining are 1\\) the new lease which is identical but without A on it, and 2\\) rental obligations of B and C (which are now increased), and 3\\) some traces of A saying that A will pay to the landlord \"A's portion\" of the rent after the lease change.\n\nFrom some of the answers to the original question, there seem to be contract between A and (B and C) for paying \"A's portion\" of the rent, and another contract, the new lease between (B and C) and the landlord.\n\nWhat legal actions do B and C have against A?

Instead, break\\-ins are (depending on the nature of the crime) prosecuted as trespassing (Hausfriedensbruch, \u00a7 123 StGB), criminal damage (Sachbesch\u00e4digung, \u00a7 303 StGB) and/or theft (Diebstahl, \u00a7 242 StGB). (Some cases may fit additonal statutory offenses, e. g. tampering with an electronic lock can be computer fraud (Computerbetrug, \u00a7 263a StGB) and hurting someone can be robbery (Raub, \u00a7 249 StGB) and/or personal injury (K\u00f6rperverletzung, \u00a7 223 StGB).)\n\nThis means: If your brother breaks the lock, then that's vandalism. If your brother walks in (without authorization), it's trespassing and if your brother steals your stuff, it's stealing.\n\nOn top of that, since your brother is living in the same household as you, breaking into your room may also be considered domestic violence. The violence protection act (Gewaltschutzgesetz) is very harsh when it comes to domestic violence: The offender can be ordered by court to hand over their home to the victim and to stay away from the home. This means that if your brother breaks into your room, your brother may be removed from the house by court order.\n\nNon\\-compliance with a court order issued under the Gewaltschutzgesetz (e. g. your brother tries to show up at your house after he was ordered to stay away), can be prosecuted under civil *and*(!) penal law.\n\nYou can read the English translation of the German penal code (STrafgesetzbuch, StGB) here (although I prefer to use German because all translations at gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de tend to be low quality): [https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/englisch\\_stgb/englisch\\_stgb.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html) \n\nAnd the Violence protection act is here (unfortunately untranslated):\n[https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/gewschg/BJNR351310001\\.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gewschg/BJNR351310001.html)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Germany, if your brother breaks into your locked room in the family home while you're away, which combination of legal actions could you potentially pursue against him?\n\nA) Trespassing and theft\nB) Breaking and entering and vandalism\nC) Trespassing, criminal damage, and potential domestic violence charges\nD) Computer fraud and personal injury\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to German law, there is no specific offense of \"breaking in.\" However, the scenario described could involve multiple offenses:\n\n1.

So, a limited liability company that purported to be a member would not have all of the obligations of a member under Oregon law.\n\nUnder Section 63\\.265 of the law, if the last member of the company ceases to be a member, for example, by dying, the person who becomes the owner of the membership interest (e.g., in the case of a death, the probate estate of the member) automatically becomes a member so that the company has members. This same section also describes transactions by which one can cease to be a member that do not have the effect of causing the company to be a member.

But, British statutes did not have direct force and effect in the U.S. after independence.\n\nAs much as anything else, this simply reflect how the nature of statutes v. common law was understood in the late 18th and early 19th century. Nobody expected that British statutes would be directly applicable, so they weren't.\n\nThere may have been instances where common law rules actually had their roots in British statutes that were mostly forgotten in long layers of British common law case law, and many statutes expressly adopting British case law also expressly incorporate selected relevant British statutes of generally applicability. But, no British statutes were applicable \"automatically\" in the U.S.\n\n> For example, before Congress enacted the Naturalization Act of 1790,\n> would a person born outside the US to a US citizen father have been a\n> US citizen by dint of the US \"inheriting\" the British Nationality Act\n> 1772 mutatis mutandis?\n\nNo. Basic ways of thinking about what nationality or citizenship even was or meant would have been received, but not by receiving the British Nationality Act 1772 as U.S. law.\n\n> And before Congress enacted the Crimes Act of 1790, would an American\n> who levied war against the US, gave aid and comfort to its enemies, or\n> counterfeited US currency have been convicted and sentenced under the\n> Treason Act 1351?\n\nNot really.\n\nFrom the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776 until the adoption of the Articles of Confederation on June 11, 1777, as a practical matter, the revolutionary forced had very little actual control of the courts in an enforceable way, there was an insurgency against the British underway, and it was an ad hoc effort from day to day and month to month that was muddled through without a formal structure or guidance at a colony by colony level, or even more granularly within a colony.\n\nIn the period from June 11, 1777 until the new U.S. Constitution was implemented in 1789\\-1790, under the [Articles of Confederation](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/articles-of-confederation), the situation was fluid and irregular. State governments made most statutory and common law, adopting their colonial era colonial statutes but not necessarily British statutes that their local legislature didn't adopt. Central government laws usually acted on the states, not directly on individuals, much like treaties today. There was little or no directly applicable central government legislation.\n\nMany topics, like citizenship, were simply ignored in this era. The U.S. Constitution adopted in 1789, and the initial acts of the First Congress to implement it, were a response to the realization that after the war and its immediate aftermath had settled down, that the newly formed country needed to regularize, institutionalize, and deal with a lot of governance issues and legal questions that nobody had had the time or resources or authority to deal with while a war had been going on.\n\nFor much of this time period the Revolutionary War was in progress and it wasn't always obvious who even controlled the courts or had practice authority to enforce court judgments. The [Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War) was not concluded until 1783\\.\n\nIt was an improvisation at first, and not necessarily a uniform one, since the Articles of Confederation conceived of the U.S. as many countries in an alliance with each other rather than an actual single nation that had to address legal issues uniformly.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the federal court system under the U.S. Constitution of 1789 that remains in force, the only institution of the central government was Congress and its committees, which functioned as a legislative body, a body selecting people with executive authority, and as a court of last resort from state court judgments. Everything was carried out at the state level except for courts\\-martial.\n\nStructurally, the Articles of Confederation were a fused system, akin to the U.K. Parliament which had its highest court of appeals and its prime ministership fused with the legislative authority of parliament, layered on top of 13 separate sovereign state governments.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the application of British laws in the United States after the Declaration of Independence?\n\nA) British statutory laws automatically remained in force at the federal level until explicitly repealed by Congress.\n\nB) British common law definitions of crimes were received into state law, but British penal statutes were not directly applicable.\n\nC) The British Nationality Act of 1772 continued to govern U.S. citizenship until the Naturalization Act of 1790 was passed.\n\nD) The Treason Act of 1351 was used to prosecute cases of treason against the U.S. until the Crimes Act of 1790 was enacted.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Quorum; chair (Title 10 \u00a78010\\) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a majority of the members serving on a board or commission under section 8001, subsection 38 constitutes a quorum. The board or commission shall elect its chair.\n\n---\n\nI want to know how a vacancy on this board might affect the actions the board can take. Suppose there are only 6 members appointed to the 7 member board for the course of 2 calendar years.\n\nLaw \\#1, which I cited above, almost seems to answer the question in favor of the undermanned boards. However, that law says specifically that where **authority** is given to a group, then the majority of that group is permitted to act. Law \\#1 does not say that where a **duty** is imposed upon a board, that the majority may assume that duty alone. And we see that there is definitely a distinction in law \\#2\\. Does that mean, for example, that the whole of the land surveyors board \"must\" meet at least once per year? Yes or no?\n\nIf you're thinking is that we would be lead to an absurd conclusion in thinking the whole of the land surveyor's board would be required to also (as in law \\#4\\) \"administer and enforce\" and that the \"obvious\" purpose of law \\#1 was to avoid such a burden, I think it is certainly possible that the board could develop its own bylaws to handle voting procedures during absences. If the board, on day 1, voted to empower a smaller minority to handle certain business, that would effectively be a case where the board had fulfilled its duty through delegation. No?\n\nIt is not so important to me that there **always** 100% of the time be a full board. The important thing to me is that these occupational boards are meant to be filled by a majority of professionals in the field, plus a couple of lay persons for balance. Guess which seats are empty most often? The lay persons. I understand you can't always get people to show up, but if the laws say the board is composed of lay persons too, they ought to show up at least once a year like the law says. That's my take, and I think it provides a little bit of legislative intent to back up that side of the argument.\n\nCase history on this sort of thing is scant, as far as I can see.

For the board you detail (7 members 4 for a quorum) the answer is the same either way \\- 4 members at the meetings make a valid meeting.\n\nIf there are 4 or more members on the board, the board can function providing that 4 or more members attend each meeting. \n\n> Does that mean, for example, that the whole of the land surveyors board \"must\" meet at least once per year?

Basically, the story is that Damien Riehl and Noah Rubin put every melody on a hard drive, thus automatically copyrighting them, in order to defend the independent creation of small musicians. In the following thought experiment, I am going to take one step further and try to copyright all creative works created hereafter. I'm not sure of its practicality, but I assure you it would be fun.\n\nLet me first introduce the Infinity Hard Drive. It is simply a device that echoes back its input. For example, if you feed a document/painting/music into it, it would echo back the identical document/painting/music. Essentially, it is merely a repeater that is unable to store anything like a conventional one, but you will see why I call it a hard drive in a moment.\n\nSay Alice publishes her creative work, and I would like to sue her for violating my copyright. I have the evidence that if someone feeds Alice's work into the Infinity Hard Drive, it will return the identical work. In fact, you can find anything in the Infinity Hard Drive, as long as you know what you are looking for.\n\nYou might say \"Seriously? You are literally taking Alice's work to generate yours!\" But think about it: what would Alice do if Bob sues her for violating his copyright law? She would read Bob's work, and try to find the relevant drafts on her drawer that proves her work is original and independent. Relevance is the key here: if Alice has thousands of drafts at hand, it would make no sense to submit all of them to a court in response to a lawsuit concerning a specific work. Alice can read Bob's work to find her relevant work, so why can't the Infinity Hard Drive read someone's work to find my original work? I am arguing that conceptually, the process is more like using Alice's work to query my infinite collection of creative works to compute the location where my work resides, rather than generating one from scratch. Maybe Alice doesn't need to read Bob's whole work, but this is because her collection is finite. The Infinity Hard Drive is infinite in capacity, so naturally, it takes more information to find a specific work. In fact, Damien Riehl and Noah Rubin also need to take a melody to locate its counterpart in their hard drive, so if their approach works, so will mine.\n\nTo reiterate, the Infinity Hard Drive serves as a \"tangible medium of expression\" of my infinite collection of creative works. From my understanding, the internal mechanism of such a media does not matter. It can be a piece of paper, an SSD, or the Infinity Hard Drive which conceptually contains everything. What really matters is the outcome, that \"(works) can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\"\n\nJust to clarify, what I\u2019m trying to (automatically) copyright is not the Infinity Hard Drive itself, or the process of \"querying\" stuff in it, or the idea of making one. I am copyrighting the conceptual contents within. Just like you don't copyright the ink on a paper or electronic signals on a hard drive; you copyright the conceptual content born.\n\nI probably also need to prove that my work is \"the result of creative decisions of a human being\", but that is arguable. We know that [a randomly\\-generated book is not a violation of copyright](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1985/is-a-randomly-generated-book-a-violation-of-copyright). Also, how could J.K. Rowling prove her work is creative instead of the accurate deception of an alternative universe? Anyway, if the contents of the Infinity Hard Drive is not copyrightable, then nothing is, because it contains everything.\n\nFinally, how do I prove that Alice had access to my infinite collection of creative works prior to her creation? Well, you are reading this right now, and the Infinity Hard Drive is, in fact, ubiquitous, e.g. a mirror, or a computer that echoes back your keystrokes on the screen.\n\nNow, can I sue you for copyright infringement with the Infinity Hard Drive? To extend the scope of this question a little, can I also claim its ownership? originality? If the answers to the above questions are all \"No\", then can I defend myself from a copyright infringement lawsuit with the Infinity Hard Drive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright requires originality\n------------------------------\n\nYour infinity hard drive appears to be a machine designed to violate copyright by immediately copying anything presented to it.\n\nDamien Riehl and Noah Rubin were creating original melodies. These do not have copyright until they are fixed in a tangible medium. That's what the hard drive is for. This is insurance against *them* being sued if they release a song and someone claims it violates that person's copyright \\- they can produce in court the melody with a date stamp of 2015 (or whatever). GitHub or similar would be even better evidence.\n\nIn this context there is a specific allegation that melody X infringes copyright. Riehl \\& Rubin can then go to their records (including metadata) and say no, here is melody X version 1 through n and they all predate your release so we didn\u2019t violate your copyright.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes why the \"Infinity Hard Drive\" concept would not be a valid defense against copyright infringement claims?\n\nA) The Infinity Hard Drive lacks originality, as it merely copies existing works without creating anything new.\n\nB) The Infinity Hard Drive cannot prove prior creation dates for its contents, unlike Riehl and Rubin's melody database.\n\nC) Copyright law doesn't apply to digital storage devices, only to tangible mediums like paper or physical recordings.\n\nD) The Infinity Hard Drive contains an infinite number of works, making it impossible to register copyrights for all of them.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The key issue with the \"Infinity Hard Drive\" concept is that it lacks originality, which is a fundamental requirement for copyright protection. Unlike Riehl and Rubin's project, which created original melodies and fixed them in a tangible medium with provable creation dates, the Infinity Hard Drive simply echoes back whatever is input into it. It doesn't create anything new or original, but merely copies existing works. This violates the basic principle of copyright law, which protects original works of authorship. The ability to reproduce any work fed into it doesn't establish prior creation or ownership rights. Options B, C, and D are incorrect or less relevant to the core issue of originality in copyright law."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83133/does-the-unlocking-consumer-choice-and-wireless-competition-act-confer-a-right-t", "docs_id": 83133, "title": "Does the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act confer a right to unlock a phone one owns, or merely limit the scope of the DMCA?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Smart phones come in two different kinds: locked, and unlocked. A locked phone has been modified from its original design, in its software, hardware, or firmware, to only accept cell service from a specific provider. The provider sells these phones at a discount to a consumer, because the provider believes that the provider will make up the difference in price later when the consumer is forced to use the provider's phone plan.\n\nOrdinarily, circumventing the technological restrictions which prevent the user from accessing cellular networks other than the provider's would violate the DMCA. However, the Obama administration signed a law in 2014, creating an exception within the DMCA that permits users to circumvent technological restrictions for the purpose of unlocking their phones. This is called the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act.\n\nBut, many companies still sell locked phones, and they are not keen on people unlocking them. They put notices on the packaging of locked phones, stating that by buying the product the consumer implicitly agrees to their terms of service. Their terms of service state that the user is not allowed to unlock the phone, and that the user agrees that this action would financially harm the company. This presumably means that the company can sue the user (or, perhaps, a tech repair shop that unlocks the phone for the user) for financial damages if the user unlocks the phone.\n\nMy question is: is this really legally enforceable? If the DMCA explicitly says that the DMCA cannot be used to prevent someone from unlocking a phone, can cell phone service providers get around this by placing a notice on the package that says the customer, through the act of purchase and through the use of the phone, is implicitly agreeing to terms of service that restrict and make the user liable for financial damages to the company if he unlocks the phone?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act of 2014, consumers are permitted to unlock their mobile phones.

The Act specifically addresses the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions, but other contractual agreements between the provider and consumer may still have some validity. However, any terms that directly conflict with the consumer's right to unlock their phone as established by the Act would likely be unenforceable. This creates a situation where the terms of service may be partially enforceable, but cannot override the fundamental right granted by the Act. Courts would likely need to balance the consumer's rights under the Act with any legitimate interests of the service provider that don't directly conflict with the Act's provisions."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27548/is-mark-zuckerberg-subject-to-questioning-by-every-u-s-senator-or-only-select", "docs_id": 27548, "title": "Is Mark Zuckerberg subject to questioning by every U.S. senator, or only select ones?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been watching the live questioning for the last 2\\-3 hours and wonder about the Senate's hearing process: Do all of the senators get to question Mark, or just a limited number of them?

Once a trial is granted each side can ask for data. In the Enron case 800,000 documents were collected and I don't know how many were actually produced. There will be a matter and they typically agree to certain file shares and certain email accounts. And often certain words \\- it is often referred to as go fish. If that come back to be 20 millions documents they will argue to trim the collection. The collection starts the chain of custody. The data is collected (e.g. hard drives), it is typically loaded into a litigation support application. There will be a formal definition of responsive document. In the Enron case it was certain type of trades. Responsive documents are identified and redacted. This is formally called review. Typically each page produced will have a bates number. Then the documents and agreed meta data are produced to the opposing party. There are a few common formats for these load files. Along with the production will be a chain of custody showing what server(s) and people that had access. It is formally called a production. Like me as a programmer they don't typically even let me have access to the customer data. If I have to get in I certainly don't change data but they would need to list me as someone that had access. Not every produced document will be introduced as evidence. The sides have to provide each other and the court a list of documents by bates number. There is no formal chain of custody between the time it is produced and introduced as evidence that I can tell. If the document has been altered it is up to the other side to say no that document has been altered since we produced it. \n\nSo lets say documents were formally produced to law firm A. If they have trouble loading and need me to load the documents into my application would they need to tell the court and the opposing council a third party had access to the data? How can I best manage the that?\n\nThese load files come can come in jacked up. Control characters that look like they were inserted intentionally. You may agree to certain delimiters and 1/2 through a file they will change. Or delimiters conveniently in a meta field.\n\n99% of the time I would not even need access to the actual document. I could just fix the load files with the meta data and have them load the actual documents. But sometimes you get jacked up file names and file paths. With the litigation support service firms I work with I have never had to access the actual document but I have a system guy I can tell here is what is wrong and here is what needs to be fixed. \n\nMost of these ligation support applications are Web (HTML) based so it is hard to have a stand alone version that could be loaded on a lap top and take into court. You cannot always count on Internet access in a court room. Mine is an EXE where I can easily include the server side with the client and run it on a lap top. \n\nProductions are almost never symmetric.

Similarity depends on the overall effect of a mark, and the main test is the likelihood of confusion or deception of reasonable customers or potential customers. If the text is, say, multiple words, none of which is the word \"supreme\" or any similar word, then it might arguably be not the Supreme logo, but a different logo that has some similar elements. (If you describe it as \"the Supreme logo but\" you make your opponent's case for them.) \n\nWhether a specific choice of words would be confusingly similar is more specific than this forum can get.

In that early form, the King's Court exercised both judicial and legislative functions. In 1215, with the Magna Carta and the beginning of Parliaments, [the House of Lords assumed the judicial functions of the King's Court](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1834884).\n\nPrior to 1876, it was possible for any member of the House of Lords to hear appeals. Eventually, however, the judicial function tended to be exercised by those appointed specifically to judicial office in the House of Lords, although this was not a formal restriction until 1876\\.\n\nSince 1876 and [until 2009](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-types/law-lords/), the judicial function of the House of Lords was formally restricted to be exercised by the [Law Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_Appeal_in_Ordinary) (see s. 5 of the [*Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876*](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/39-40/59/enacted/data.pdf)). However, the outcome of the appeal was also still formally an action of the entire House of Lords, on the recommendation of the panel of Law Lords that heard the appeal (see Stanley Clark, [\"Gentlemen, Their Lordships\", p. 1443\\-44](https://books.google.ca/books?id=OBE7jTuhi74C&pg=PA1443&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)). And custom was that only the Law Lords that heard the appeal would vote, with all other members of the House of Lords abstaining.1 Rather than lords via hereditary peerage, the Law Lords were Lords/Ladies holding special qualifications and having received specific appointment to be a \"Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.\" Among other qualifications, they would have already served in a high court or practised as a barrister for fifteen years.\n\nAs an example of the kind of background a person might have before appointment as a Law Lord, this is [Lord Denning's Wikipedia introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Denning,_Baron_Denning):\n\n> He was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1923 and became a King's Counsel in 1938\\.

Option D is incorrect because it overstates the limitations on tenant defenses in eviction proceedings."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/66786/who-is-at-fault-for-an-under-nourished-animal", "docs_id": 66786, "title": "Who is at fault for an under nourished animal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is a property near us where there is a horse that is under nourished, while I am not an animal expert, from what I can tell, the horse is probably a 2 on the health scale.\n\nThe person who owns the property is an elderly lady who is chair bound, the owners of the horse have refused to move the horse to somewhere where there is more food. They do feed the horse hay, but its living in a small area where there is literally nothing left to eat.\n\nWe have found people for them to give the horse to who are willing to do what is necessary to bring the horse up to health, but so far they are not interested.\n\nIf the horse keeps going the way it is, it's going to starve. One option is to bring in a vet to look at it and see where things go from there.\n\nFrom a legal point of view who is at fault here? is it the owners of the horse, or is the person who owns the property even though she is an invalid and cannot possibly go out and do anything with the horse?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most states have a law such as Washington's [RCW 16\\.52](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=16.52&full=true), designed to protect the welfare of animals. There are provisions against starving an animal, and provisions allowing the authorities to intervene, so that an animal care or control agency can deem that the horse is not being fed properly. They can then remove the animal to feed it. There is also [a provision](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=16.52.100) that\n\n> If any domestic animal is impounded or confined without necessary food\n> and water for more than thirty\\-six consecutive hours, any person may,\n> from time to time, as is necessary, enter into and open any pound or\n> place of confinement in which any domestic animal is confined, and\n> supply it with necessary food and water so long as it is confined. The\n> person shall not be liable to action for the entry, and may collect\n> from the animal's owner the reasonable cost of the food and water.\n\nOf course, you would be concerned about the laws of the state that the horse is in. I can't think of a reason to *not* call the local Humane Society, if your estimation of the situation is correct.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a case where a horse is being neglected on a property owned by an elderly, chair-bound woman, but the horse belongs to different owners who refuse to properly care for it or relocate it, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding legal responsibility and potential interventions?\n\nA) The property owner is solely responsible for the horse's welfare, regardless of her physical limitations.\n\nB) Only state authorities have the legal right to intervene and remove the horse from the property.\n\nC) After 36 consecutive hours without proper food and water, any person can legally enter the property to provide necessities for the horse.\n\nD) The horse's owners are exempt from legal responsibility if they provide some food, even if it's insufficient for the animal's health.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, many states have laws similar to Washington's RCW 16.52, which allows for intervention in cases of animal neglect. Specifically, there is a provision stating that if a domestic animal is confined without necessary food and water for more than 36 consecutive hours, any person may legally enter the property to provide these necessities. This makes option C the most accurate statement. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the property owner's physical limitations don't necessarily make her solely responsible, especially since she doesn't own the horse. Option B is false because the law allows for citizen intervention in certain circumstances, not just state authorities. Option D is incorrect because providing some food doesn't exempt owners from responsibility if the animal is still undernourished."}}
