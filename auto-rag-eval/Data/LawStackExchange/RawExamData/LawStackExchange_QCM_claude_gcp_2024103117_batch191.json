The other paragraphs within clause 10\\.5 relate to conduct by which you use Google's data to populate your own system or obscure the fact that you are using Google's system to provide a service. Accordingly, the kind of 'incorporation' whereby your software makes part of the Google Maps system's user interface appear as part of your software's user interface is not prohibited. \n\nThe other key bit of context is the fact that Google Maps is obviously intended to be used. It would be absurd to offer a service and, in the terms of service, prohibit anybody from using it. A court would interpret the words such as to avoid such absurdity.

This can happen if, for example, you witnessed something that is incredibly unusual. It might also happen if enough other people conspire to lie about something that you know the truth about.\n\nThe fifth amendment to the constitution should prohibit you from being forced to testify in a situation where you have a reasonable belief that truthful testimony could subject you to prosecution for a crime. But it seems like that can't help you in this case. Immunity from prosecution for truthful testimony won't help you if a prosecutor can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that your testimony is false. And I can't imagine a prosecutor allowing someone to testify with immunity from prosecution for making false statements in that very testimony.\n\nThis can't be so rare it has never happened. If it has happened, what happens when someone tells a judge that he pleads the fifth because he believes that if he gives the testimony he believes is truthful it will subject him to perjury charges because it can be proven false beyond a reasonable doubt (despite his belief that it is true)? If it has never happened, what should happen in this case?\n\nTo be precise, the assumption behind this question is that you have an objectively\\-reasonable belief that an answer that you believe is true would subject you to criminal liability for perjury.\n\nTo be clear:\n\n1. The person has not yet testified.\n2. They are being asked to testify.\n3. They have an objectively\\-reasonable fear that the testimony they would give will subject them to criminal liability for perjury.\n4. They therefore invoke their fifth amendment right.\n\nAssume none of these points are controversial. Obviously, others may not agree that the testimony they say they will give is truthful. But there is no reason to doubt their claim that the testimony they would give would subject them to criminal liability for perjury.\n\nThe question is whether this has ever occurred and, if so, what happened. Or, if it has not occurred, what would happen next? Can the person be granted immunity from prosecution for perjury in the very testimony they are given? Or can they be compelled to testify even though they have an objectively\\-reasonable belief that the testimony they would give will subject them to criminal liability? Or is there some third alternative?\n\nLastly, if this has never happened, why not? It seems like this wouldn't be a terribly uncommon situation. I don't think it would happen every day or even every year \\-\\- but never in the history of jurisprudence?!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The California [jury instructions for the crime of perjury](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/2600/2640/) give more detail on what it means to commit perjury: it's not just that you make a statement that is false, you have to willfully state that the information is true even though you know it is false. If you have a belief that you will be convicted for perjury (or any crime) by testifying, you may invoke your 5th Amendment right (I assume you are not testifying as the defendant in a criminal matter). You might (theoretically: see below on immunity and perjury) be granted immunity from prosecution, in which case there is no 5th Amendment right to refuse to testify (you are not putting yourself in criminal jeopardy), and the court can order you to testify. Or, you might not be granted immunity and still be ordered to testify.\n\nThe federal immunity statute, [18 USC 6002](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/6002), also needs to be scrutinized. When ordered to testify, \"the witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his privilege against self\\-incrimination\", but it generally cannot be used against him:\n\n> no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any\n>  information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or\n>  other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal\n>  case\n\nHowever, there is an exception:\n\n> except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or\n>  otherwise failing to comply with the order.\n\nIn other words, you cannot be immunized against a perjury charge.\n\nIn [Kastigar v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/406/441/), 406 U.S. 441 defendant refused an order to testify, on the grounds that they (allegedly) believed that the government's grant of immunity was not broad enough, i.e. that there were areas where they might be questions and forced to criminally implicate themselves. They refused, and were held in contempt.\n\nThe opinion recognized that the 5th Amendment \"protects against any disclosures that the witness *reasonably* believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used\" (emphasis added). \n\nIn [Mason v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/244/362/), 244 U.S. 362, the court held that\n\n> The Fifth Amendment does not relieve a witness from answering merely\n>  on his own declaration or judgment that an answer might incriminate\n>  him; whether he must answer is determinable by the trial court in the\n>  exercise of its sound discretion, and unless there is reasonable\n>  ground, as distinct from a remote or speculative possibility, to\n>  apprehend that a direct answer may prove dangerous to the witness, his\n>  answer should be compelled.\n\n[Heike v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/227/131/), 227 U.S. 131 asserts that \"the constitutional protection is confined to real danger, and does not extend to remote possibilities out of the ordinary course of law, citing [Brown v. Walker](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/161/591/), 161 U.S. 591 (itself quoting Lord Chief Justice Cockburn):\n\n> \"the danger to be apprehended must be real and appreciable, with\n>  reference to the ordinary operation of law in the ordinary course of\n>  things; not a danger of an imaginary and unsubstantial character,\n>  having reference to some extraordinary and barely possible\n>  contingency, so improbable that no reasonable man would suffer it to\n>  influence his conduct\"\n\nAlthough the wording of the immunity statute does not allow immunity from prosecution for perjury, the 5th Amendment right can only be invoked against a real legal jeopardy. They *can* be compelled to testify, they probably cannot be immunized against a perjury conviction (certainly not at the federal level).

According to the case law cited (Mason v. United States and Heike v. United States), the court has the discretion to determine whether there is a real and appreciable danger of self-incrimination, not just a remote or speculative possibility. The Fifth Amendment protection only applies to real danger, not imaginary or unsubstantial risks. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Fifth Amendment invocation can be overruled if the court determines there's no real danger of self-incrimination. \n\nOption B is wrong because federal immunity statutes explicitly do not provide immunity from perjury charges. \n\nOption C is incorrect as per Mason v.

Option B is also incorrect, as explicit permission from the game developer is not required if the video falls under fair use. Option D is incorrect because the legality doesn't specifically depend on whether the cheats involve modifying source code, but rather on the educational nature of the content.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while such videos are generally considered legal, game manufacturers may still attempt to discourage this practice through legal action, even if such action may not ultimately succeed in court."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32773/why-do-websites-exclude-cisg-in-terms-of-service", "docs_id": 32773, "title": "Why do websites exclude CISG in Terms of Service?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Today I clicked into the Terms of Service page of a popular website.

How hard can it be to forge a log file?

In the question, OP states that his boss asks him to forge a log file in order to win a dispute. The answers clearly suggests not to do it. They also suggest to get the requested action written *and* to make sure a copy of this document is available outside the work (just in case the boss tries to destroy the evidence in case of a legal action).\n\nAgain, assume that this incident is indeed carried to court and boss claims he did not request such thing. The employee claims the boss requested such thing and presents his copy of the written request as an evidence. The boss claims that this was forged by the employee. What is going to happen? Who is the judge going to believe?\n\nOr yet a simpler example. Say Party 1 has some witnesses. Party 2 claims what these witnesses say is not correct and presents some kind of counter evidence. What is going to happen?\n\nIn the end, what determines which party the judge is going to believe?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In law there are two different concepts: admissibility of evidence and the weight of that evidence.\nYour question concerns both. I will begin by discussing a little bit about what both these two terms mean.\n\nAdmissibility means that this evidence may go before the trier of fact. Typically the trier of fact is the jury, however, if both parties have waived their rights to jury trials (particularly the defendant) the judge is the trier of fact as well as the law. When documents or testimony by witnesses is admissible, the trier of fact can consider it in reaching a decision.\n\nWeight of evidence is a different concept. The weight of evidence is what someone believes. For example if two witnesses who were bystanders testify that the light was red, but the defendant testifies that the light was green, most people would believe the bystanders. However, in this case the evidence by the defendant that the light was green is admissible, but the trier of fact may not afford it much weight.\n\nNow let's consider these logs. In the United States all statements made out of court, whether verbal or written, are considered hearsay (with some exceptions, a couple will be discussed later). Hearsay is generally inadmissible; however, there are many hearsay exceptions.\n\nOne exception is a record of a regularly conducted activity. The requirements are (summarized, you may refer to the federal rules of evidence 803\\-6\\.) for the full text):\n(A) the record was made at the time of the event by someone who knew about what happened\n(B) the record was kept in the course of this regularly conducted activity\n(C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity\n(D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness\n(E) neither the opponent does not show that the source of information nor or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n\nNow if these logs fit these requirements you can most likely use them in court. If they don't you probably will not be able to use to in court, unless one of the following applies:\n1\\.) you are being sued by someone (or you are suing them) who made the logs and you are offering the logs against them (this is referred to in legal settings as party\\-opponent statements) OR\n2\\.) the other party has offered evidence that you are lying and you are offering this logs to show you are telling the truth.\n\nMost likely the only admissible evidence would be the testimony of the employee and the employer. This leads to a he said she said scenario and the legal results will be highly ambiguous. The credibility of both witnesses will be likely assessed by the trier of fact and the trier will consider who has a higher incentive to lie. If there are more witnesses saying one thing versus another, it is likely they will be believed unless there is a reason all of them are lying.\n\nAlthough this is not legal advice, my suggestion for an employee in such a situation is to gather evidence that an employer asked you to commit a crime as part of your job. Print out emails, get written requests from the employer, and have witnesses present at the time of the request. Then the employee should refuse to perform the act. If as a result the employee is fired, one can sue. All these statements of the employer can be admitted as party\\-opponent statements. \n\nAdditionally I suggest that you advocate for your company to adopt policies which require record keeping, which will satisfy the hearsay exception given above.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is asked by their manager to forge log files to win a dispute with a client.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the admissibility and weight of this evidence in court?\n\nA) The emails are inadmissible as evidence because they are considered hearsay.\n\nB) The emails are admissible as evidence and will be given significant weight by the court due to their written nature.\n\nC) The emails are admissible as party-opponent statements but their weight will depend on various factors including credibility of witnesses and other corroborating evidence.\n\nD) The emails are only admissible if the company has an official policy of keeping such records as part of regularly conducted activity.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The emails would likely be admissible in court as party-opponent statements, which are an exception to the hearsay rule. This means the developer can present these emails as evidence against the employer. However, the weight given to this evidence by the trier of fact (judge or jury) will depend on various factors. These include the credibility of the witnesses (both the developer and the manager), any corroborating evidence, and the overall context of the situation. The court will consider who has more incentive to lie and may look for additional supporting evidence. While the emails provide written documentation, they alone may not be conclusive, especially if the manager disputes their authenticity or context. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the emails are admissible but their weight in the case will depend on these various factors."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8438/is-it-legal-to-own-lockpicks-in-pennsylvania", "docs_id": 8438, "title": "Is it legal to own lockpicks in Pennsylvania?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am interested in learning about lockpicking as a hobby.

Is this true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a relevant law, [Title 18 section 907](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=9&sctn=7&subsctn=0) which states that \"A person commits a misdemeanor of the first degree if he possesses any instrument of crime with intent to employ it criminally\". So possession of lock picks is not a crime *per se*. In [Com. v. Gendrachi 389 A.2d 604](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2073535/com-v-gendrachi/?q=cites%3A1560947) we are reminded that \"intent need not be directly proved, but may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the incident out of which the charges arise\". The accused was busted in mildly suspicious circumstances at 5:20 am in the dead of winter, urinating. The court notes that \"There is no evidence that appellant's hands were on the door or that he made an attempt to extract the tools from his pocket and apply them to the door. In fact, there is no act or statement by appellant that would lead one to infer that he intended to use the tools at that time\", and that \"appellant is a certified locksmith and it is not unreasonable to find the tools of his trade in his pocket, especially when he is wearing his work attire\". Note that this is on appeal: he was convicted initially. The point is that there is a lot of slop in cashing out the legal concept of \"intent\".\n\nPennsylvania does not, apparently, have any specific laws that refer to lock picks. It does have a statute that addresses having criminal tools, which are defined as (including) \"Anything used for criminal purposes and possessed by\nthe actor under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for lawful uses it may have\". Mr. Gendrachi had those very tools, and the appeals court did not say anything to suggest that the tools were not \"criminal tools\" (and in FN 5 they actually point out that the Commonwealth cannot say that the tools were weapons, a ludicrous proposition never raised by anyone \u2013 so by failing to deny that lock picks are criminal tools, they are adoptively admitting that they *are* criminal tools).

In Pennsylvania, possessing lock picks is not inherently illegal, but it can be considered a crime under certain circumstances. According to Title 18 section 907, possessing any \"instrument of crime with intent to employ it criminally\" is a misdemeanor. Lock picks can be considered \"criminal tools\" under this statute.\n\nOption A is incorrect because possession alone is not illegal; intent to use them criminally must be proven.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while possession itself is not illegal, it can be prosecuted if criminal intent is demonstrated.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although Pennsylvania doesn't have laws specifically mentioning lock picks, they fall under the broader category of potential \"criminal tools\" in existing statutes.\n\nThe case of Com. v.

What reasons could there be to keep the two seperate but in the same hands?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This could have occurred for a variety of reasons, but is usually a way for a developer (or freehold asset company, or local authority) reserve control, or keep open a revenue stream of fees on an estate. As you are no doubt aware, the lease is essentially a contract between the landlord and the tenant, stipulating rights, reservations and obligations over a demised piece of land. It is common for freehold management companies to charge fees for issuing consents to alterations, keeping pets and such like. And of course premiums can be charged by a landlord for renewing leases, although the legislation governing leasehold houses is slightly different (see [Leasehold Reform Act 1967](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/88/contents)).\n\nThis kind of freehold/leasehold arrangement was also common in older 'equity release' sale and leaseback schemes, where the owner sells the freehold to a third party who then leases the property back to the tenant, usually at a nominal rent.\n\nThat being said, some developers of new estates have sold houses as leasehold (as good as freehold, apparently). It's a problem that's come into sharp focus recently and the government has issued [White Paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fixing-our-broken-housing-market) intending to legislate further, and perhaps ban the sale of new leasehold houses. \n\nIt may have been the case for the previous owner that when they came into ownership of both leasehold and freehold interests it didn't affect their enjoyment of the property in any way, so the titles were never merged. \n\nProvided there are no outstanding charges or incumbrances, both freehold and leasehold titles are in the same ownership and there is clear intention to merge the estates, this can be dealt with quite easily by application to the Land Registry. \n\nI'd suggest asking your solicitor to send you the lease, and explain any terms or provisions you're not sure of or don't understand.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a property transaction where the buyer is acquiring both the freehold and leasehold interests of a house, which of the following is NOT a typical reason for keeping these interests separate?\n\nA) To reserve control over certain aspects of the property for the original developer\nB) To maintain a revenue stream through fees for the freehold owner\nC) To comply with local zoning regulations and building codes\nD) To preserve rights or obligations stipulated in ancient contracts\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because reserving control for the original developer is a common reason for keeping freehold and leasehold interests separate.\nB is incorrect as maintaining a revenue stream through fees (e.g., for alterations or keeping pets) is another typical reason for this arrangement.\nC is the correct answer because complying with local zoning regulations and building codes is not mentioned as a reason for keeping freehold and leasehold interests separate in this context.\nD is incorrect because preserving rights or obligations in ancient contracts is suggested as a possible reason by the solicitor in the original text.\n\nThe question tests understanding of the complex nature of freehold/leasehold arrangements and the various motivations behind keeping these interests separate, even when owned by the same party."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85922/do-us-public-school-students-have-a-first-amendment-right-to-be-able-to-perform", "docs_id": 85922, "title": "Do US public school students have a First Amendment right to be able to perform sacred music?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I believe that in the US, public schools are allowed to perform music with religious texts, and that this has been upheld by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the music program is teaching music, heritage, and culture, not indoctrination.

The specific details are governed by the laws of your state, but every state has provisions for \"intestate succession\" i.e. when someone does not have a will. In every state, somebody would have to petition the court to make them be \"in charge\", and then they have to follow the law in disposing of the estate. First you have to settle up any debts, then you can divide the remainder between the legal beneficiaries. Let's say that that means \"the 6 sisters\".\n\nThe person in charge gets to implement the law, so could give the youngest sister the truck as (part of) her share. Let's now say that the administrator\\-sister did not do this: she has a duty to protect the interests of all the beneficiaries. That would mean \"subtract that amount from what sister 6 gets\", and does not necessarily mean \"and file a criminal complaint against sister 6\". When all is said and done, if you don't get your fair share, you would have a civil case against sisters 1 and 6, so you could sue to get the money back. There are probably procedures in your state whereby all beneficiaries have to sign off on the disposition of the estate, though the court probably does not affirmatively track whether the paperwork has been filed and go after the person in charge.

The administrator has a legal duty to protect the interests of all beneficiaries and properly dispose of the estate's assets.\n3.

But, this simply consists of making a report to law enforcement about an incident and asking that the prosecutor either directly, or indirectly through a request directed to the law enforcement officer to whom a report is made, to pursue criminal charges in the case.\n\nBut, this request has no binding or legal effect, even though many law enforcement agencies and prosecutors offices have a formal or informal unwritten policy of honoring a crime reporting victim's wishes whenever possible. In the United States, a prosecutor can commence a criminal case against someone without consulting a victim of a crime, or over the objections of the victim of the crime, and can even (and sometimes does) incarcerate the victim of the crime to force the victim to testify against a criminal defendant (this most often happens in cases of statutory rape, domestic violence and cases involving organized crime or gangs).\n\nLikewise, a prosecutor (in the United States) can choose to decline to prosecute a criminal case despite irrefutable evidence tied up with a bow and the pleas of the victim and lots of other members of the general public.\n\n(Not all countries are like this. For example, in Germany, some crimes can only be prosecuted with the victim's consent, and within reason a prosecutor is required to prosecute every case in which there is clear evidence that a crime was committed and the victim's consent, if necessary, is present. While Germany is something of an extreme case, it is much closer to the norm than the U.S. is in countries that do not have a common law legal tradition, while the U.S., while an extreme case, is closer to the norm of countries in the common law tradition of British law.)\n\nA crime victim's wishes aren't entirely irrelevant in practice. Many states have a \"victim's bill of rights\" that requires a prosecutor to confer with a victim when possible over whether a criminal case will be commenced against a defendant, and in practice, many prosecutors in ordinary type cases come to think of the victims of crimes, rather than \"the People\" as their client, even though that isn't technically correct from a legal perspective.\n\nMost of the time, a crime victim's wishes will be respected by prosecutors whether conveyed directly to a prosecutor, or indirectly through a law enforcement officer. But, nothing requires either a law enforcement officer or a prosecutor to do so.\n\nLaw enforcement officers in some ways have even more discretion than prosecutors do and simply don't pass on information about myriad crimes that they have knowledge of and could prove, every day. But, prosecutors can choose to disagree with a law enforcement officer's exercise of discretion when they do know about an incident, either by declining to prosecute a crime, or by prosecuting a crime that law enforcement officers didn't want to prosecute. And, law enforcement officers as a matter of practical reality can be forced by prosecutors to execute search warrants and arrest warrants.\n\nAlso, it is true that when neither law enforcement or prosecutors know a crime has been committed that they can't prosecute it, and usually, the way that they learn of a crime is that a crime victim reports the crime to law enforcement. The decision to report or not report a crime not known to law enforcement is, in practice, what \"pressing charges\" or \"not pressing charges\" usually means and this does, in practice, constitute a veto power over further criminal proceedings arising from an incident, even though the language used implies a more formal step in a legal process than it does.\n\nExceptions To The General Rule\n==============================\n\nN.B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are a few exceptions to the general rule.\n\nA handful of U.S. states, so far as I know, all on the East Coast (and also England and South Africa), allow individuals who are crime victims to directly commence the prosecution of minor crimes in a court of law without the intervention of law enforcement or a prosecutor, or grand jury, often without an attorney. Usually, if this is done, the prosecuting attorney's office can take over the case from the private individual litigant if they choose to do so. A discussion of the historical practice with case citations can be found [here](https://www.insurancefraud.org/role-of-victims.htm).\n\nIn the roughly half of U.S. states and in the federal system, where felony criminal charges must be brought via a grand jury indictment before they can be tried, a so called \"[runaway grand jury](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2005/09/what-s-a-runaway-grand-jury.html)\" can bring criminal charges that the prosecutor has a duty to make a good faith effort to prosecute, without the request of the prosecutor convening the grand jury.\n\nFor example, [in a recent Alabama case](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/us/alabama-pregnant-woman-shot-in-stomach-manslaughter-indictment-trnd/index.html), prosecutors went to a grand jury seeking felony charges against someone who shot a pregnant woman, and the grand jury decided to indict the woman who was shot for manslaughter on the theory that she caused the death of her unborn child by starting a fight that led to the shooting. The prosecutor's office once it had control of the case, and had observed the public outrage over the decision, then dismissed those charges.\n\nThere are a few states where a crime victim who is dissatisfied with a prosecutor or law enforcement officer's exercise of discretion can apply to a court to have a disinterested and uninvolved attorney appointed as a [special prosecutor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_prosecutor) to review the facts of an alleged crime and decide independently regarding whether criminal charges should be pressed in a case where law enforcement and the prosecutor's office declined to do so. This is most frequently invoked when the alleged perpetrator of the crime is connected to law enforcement or the prosecutor's office.\n\nAlso, just become a prosecutor declines to bring a criminal case despite a crime victim's desire to \"press charges\", this doesn't mean that the victim can't sue the person who committed the crime for money damages (including punitive damages in many cases) from the same conduct that constituted the crime. In big dollar cases involving fraud or theft from a small number of affluent victims (a kind of case I frequently handle in my law practice), this happens all the time.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A woman is assaulted by her neighbor and wants to ensure he faces criminal charges.

In most jurisdictions in the United States, \"pressing charges\" typically means reporting a crime to law enforcement and requesting that the prosecutor pursue criminal charges. However, the final decision to press charges lies with the prosecutor, not the victim. The prosecutor can choose to pursue charges even if the victim doesn't want to, or decline to press charges despite the victim's wishes.

All that is required is an agreement by both parties which presumably was made in this case. Obviously the exact wording would affect this and that's a matter for either Paypal but it seems that:\n\n* You agreed to produce the materials in exchange for money\n* You agreed as part of this to give exclusive rights to use the materials to the buyer, at least until he chose to publish it\n* The buyer changed their mind and was refunded the work that had not been done.\n* At this point, it still appears you had an agreement that he would have the rights to publish the work. You reneged on this.\n\nThe reason people use services with buyer/seller protection is to avoid having to go to court in situations like this. Your best bet is to submit all relevant details to PayPal and hope they decide in your favour. Unfortunately, PayPal is notorious for siding with buyers who are in the wrong.\n\nIf they don't, legal action is an option.

Even without a signed formal contract, a legally binding agreement can exist based on the agreed-upon terms and actions of both parties. In this case, there was a clear understanding that the artist would produce work in exchange for payment, and both parties acted on this agreement for nearly a year. The law recognizes that contracts can be formed through verbal agreements and the conduct of the parties involved. The fact that work was produced, delivered, and paid for over an extended period demonstrates the existence of a binding agreement, even without a written contract or Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).

It could be argued that even fixing bugs doesn't create copyright.\n\nPS The license is completely irrelevant to this. The only thing that the GPL license does is saying who commits copyright infringement if they use the code, and who doesn't. As the sole copyright holder you cannot possibly infringe on your own copyright. And whoever is threatening you, as non\\-copyright holder they have no standing to sue you and will be laughed out of court. Even if I did illegally copy your software, that person who is not the copyright holder would have no standing to sue me, only you as the copyright holder would. So the case is double ridiculous: They have no standing to sue, and you have the copyright and would win even if they had standing. \n\nI'll just repeat that: Anyone who isn't the copyright holder will be laughed out of court if they sue you. The judge won't even look at the license. The judge will ask them: Are you the copyright holder?

In this case, the company is the sole author and copyright holder of the software. Therefore, they cannot infringe on their own copyright, and no external party has the legal standing to sue them for copyright infringement related to this software.

State legislatures can do the same, so you could petition the New York Legislature, the Virginia General Assembly, or the Pennsylvania General Assembly.\n* At both the state and federal level, attorneys general have the authority to initiate an investigation of crimes committed within their jurisdictions.\n* At both the state and federal level, a judge's authority to appoint a special prosecutor is a power considered to be inherent in the courts, so nearly any court could appoint someone to pursue the investigation. Of course, the prosecutor's authority could be jurisdictionally limited \\-\\- if a New York state judge appointed a prosecutor, he wouldn't really have much authority to investigate federal crimes, and if a small\\-claims court judge in Idaho appointed a prosecutor, he'd be limited by both his lack of authority to investigate events outside his jurisdiction and the practical difficulties of enforcing a subpoena from out of state.\n* Even at the local level, law enforcement and legislative bodies have the authority to launch investigations. If NYPD or the Somerset County Sheriff or the Arlington County Board want to investigate, they could do so.\n* I don't know what the relevant rules are in each jurisdiction, but some states allow lawsuits for civil damages based on criminal activity. So if the gist of the sponsor's complaint is that someone used \"explosives and/or incendiaries\" to kill his son, it may be that he could bring a lawsuit over that, which would in turn open up the the tools of civil discovery. Of course, that's only if the claim isn't time\\-barred; now that we're nearly 17 years out, I'd guess that it would be too late.\n* And there's always the possibility of continuing an independent investigation.

As demonstrated in the Melmark v. Schutt case, filial responsibility lawsuits can cross state lines, but they involve complex \"choice of law\" analyses. Courts must determine which state has the greater interest in applying its law. In this scenario, since the parent and the medical care are in Pennsylvania, there's a strong argument for applying Pennsylvania law, but it's not automatic. The son living in California (which has conflicting laws on filial responsibility) adds complexity to the case.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because living in a different state doesn't automatically exempt someone from another state's filial responsibility laws.\n\nAnswer B is overly simplistic. While Pennsylvania does have a clear filial responsibility law, cross-state cases aren't straightforward.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect. While filial responsibility laws are controversial, they haven't been ruled unconstitutional."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14323/can-a-solicitor-challenge-a-binding-financial-agreement-they-dont-agree-with", "docs_id": 14323, "title": "Can a solicitor challenge a binding financial agreement they don&#39;t agree with?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My ex and I separated last year, with everything between us being very amicable.

On applying for finance, the bank required a binding financial agreement between us. I would assume that this was to make sure that there are no sudden nasties later on. \n\nBoth of us agreed that the only thing we wanted to settle on with our separation was her share of the house, which is half of the value of the house less the remaining mortgage, forgoing a share of the value of my superannuation (for clarification, the agreement equates to a 54%/46% split of total assets, which effectively consist of the house and combined super). She went to a solicitor to get this drawn up on our behalf, who strenuously advised against such an agreement. We are both very comfortable with this decision, and said that yes, this is what we want.\n\nThe solicitor stated that they would work directly with her instructions, but \"have a professional duty to warn you of their concerns\".

Alex*, [2017 SCC 37 at para. 31](https://canlii.ca/t/h4mzd#par31)).\n\nMany factors would pull a court to interpret a statute more narrowly or broadly than an acontextual, isolated reading of the words would suggest. Generally, this includes the full text, context, and purpose of the statute. Courts will look to:\n\n* the words of the provision\n* the surrounding words and related provisions\n* the words of the entire statute\n* the entire statute book\n* the legislative purpose as revealed through legislative history and the mischief the provision is meant to deal with\n* the presumption of constitutionality\n* etc.\n\nBasically every doctrine of statutory interpretation will pull towards either a narrow or broad reading of a provision. I would hesitate though to call these \"corrections\" of \"legislative flaws\" but rather an attempt to give effect to the legislative intent. Even the doctrine of absurdity that you mention is based in an assumption that the legislature does not intend absurd results. Instead of correcting \"legislative flaws\" this doctrine/canon is a way to *avoid* judicial error.\n\nHowever, *after* a full interpretation of a statute reveals that it is unconstitutional because it is over or under\\-inclusive, then a court may use the *remedies* of reading down or reading in (these are constitutional remedies not part of the ordinary act of interpretation). In such a circumstance, where it is a \"safe assumption\" that the Legislature would have enacted the \"corrected\" version, the court may declare the correction. See *Schachter v.

This indicates that Canadian courts use a comprehensive approach (option C) when interpreting statutes, considering multiple factors including the text, context, purpose, and relevant legal norms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests courts rely solely on plain meaning, which the passage explicitly states is not the case.

A crime is committed either where the acts causing the crime took place or where the harm caused by the crime is directed. In the classic example, if you shoot and murder someone in Oregon from within California, either state (or both states) can prosecute you for murder.

State law crimes are tried in the jurisdiction where they are committed. John cannot simply move the trial to Texas. \n\nWhile it's possible for John to serve probation in Texas, it's not automatic. There's an interstate process for probation supervision, but it requires cooperation between states and may involve additional costs or conditions. The Florida court would need to approve this arrangement.\n\nThe court might also consider alternatives like a jail sentence or larger fine instead of probation to avoid inter-state complications. John would need to work with his lawyer to request and arrange for out-of-state probation if that's what he desires.\n\nOption B is incorrect because relocation isn't mandatory.

Here is a list of some of them:\n\n* Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs (\\>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Olmec Inscriptions (\\>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Mayan Glyphs\n* Ancient Aztec Glyphs\n* Old English Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Old Runic Inscriptions (\\>1000 years old)\n* Old Irish Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Inscriptions (\\>3000 years old, like the [oracle bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone))\n* Ancient Latin Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Greek Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Etc. There are many other cultures such as Finnish, Tibetan, etc.\n\nSome of these are owned by places like the Catholic Church, others by places like the British Library, or other Libraries or Museums, even others are held by Universities, and still others are held by private individuals who may post an image online of the artifact for a variety of reasons, like [this person did](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/4t9kop/book_written_in_geez_ancient_ethiopic_unknown_age/). Also, some artifacts may have been *created* in one place (like in China), but *hosted* in another place (like at the British museum).\n\nSo the question is about looking at an online image of one of these artifacts, which is provided by one of the owners, and then either drawing a picture to replicate the object (like the image below), or copying it into text form, such as [this](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/), which was transcribed from [an image of a manuscript](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/manuscripts/cp/?tp=ob), into [electronic text](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/view/#edition/translation).\n\nSpecifically, all of the things I am talking about are pre\\-copyright era, the actual objects themselves. So then someone finds/discovers the item (either they found it pre\\-copyright era, like 1000\\+ years ago finding something and putting it in the king's library), or it was discovered post\\-copyright\\-starting era. So somebody owns it. I am not concerned with that part. But then they take a picture of it and put it online. Some of the pictures (like the reddit image) are just quickly shot with an iPhone. Others require significant cost, care, and tooling, such as taking a picture of a fragile ancient manuscript, while others require that much cost/care/tooling to startup, but then can be automated for thousands or millions of artifacts (like the Google books project). But in the end, an image of a natural, copyright\\-free artifact (since it was created pre\\-copyright era) is online and publicly available.\n\nWhat you see in this situation often is \"this image is copyrighted\". To me that means that you can't directly sell the image, or host it on your site/product for commercial gain. But given the *content* of the image is in the public domain (again, the content from all those cultural resources listed at the beginning) because it was created thousands of years ago, I wonder what you are allowed to do with the image.\n\nI wonder if you are allowed to:\n\n* Make a drawing of it (like the sketch below).\n* Transcribe the text contained in the original document (which you could *see* because of the copyrighted image).\n\nObviously the drawing wouldn't be a straight copy of the *photograph*. It would draw the essence of the content instead. So the content is public domain, but the image is copyrighted and the artifact is owned. I wonder if you are allowed to essentially write down in electronic form what is in the manuscript artifact, or in the case of glyphs, to write down the glyphs.\n\nWhat this would mean is that one could go to a museum website and view their manuscripts, and transcribe them, and then do what you want with the transcription. If that's not allowed, I would be interested to know the reason.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you're describing is generally permissible in the United States.\n\nThe photographer has copyright in the photograph itself, not in the items photographed. This means that they have copyright in the way that they composed the photograph \\-\\- what background they placed it against, lighting, camera placement, etc. \\-\\- but not in the ancient manuscript. \n\nIf you are strictly transcribing the text of the script, you're not infringing on anything that's copyrighted. If you make a sketch, there's more potential for infringement, but I suspect that you would not be working to faithfully copy the angles of the shadows as much as you would working to faithfully copy the image and condition of the artifact. \n\nEven if you were, calling that a copyright infringement would require that the image truly be copyrighted, and I'm not 100 percent convinced that they would be. Copyright is only available to *original* works of authorship, and that means that the author has to make some meaningful efforts to create something new out of the copyrighted elements discussed above.\n\nBut what has the photographer done in that picture of the Coronation Oath? It appears that they've photographed the book head\\-on, as it's displayed by the museum, with lighting as provided by the museum, in an effort to recreate the display one would see while visiting the museum. Is that really sufficiently \"original\" to merit copyright protection that could be invoked to prevent someone from drawing a duplicate? I doubt it.\n\nBut that picture of the Ge'ez book may be different. Someone appears to have grabbed the book, opened it up under weird lighting, kept their hands in the photograph, and otherwise actually composed a photograph that may not be particularly artistic, but is nonetheless difficult enough to duplicate that it can be considered original.\n\nSo let's be generous to the copyright trolls and assume that the sketch you're imagining is protected. Even then, that only raises the question of whether the copy is a fair use. You haven't said anything about how the hypothetical copier would be using these materials, but I have a hunch that the idea isn't to launch a multimillion dollar merchandising enterprise. If the idea is more academic or cultural, you'd have a better claim to fair use.

Can he claim self defense?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This appears to apply to all criminal activity, BUT\n===================================================\n\nIt only applies when defending a dwelling or business\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nand only removes a presumption, not the full right to self defense\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt has no effect on the Kyle Rittenhouse case.\n==============================================\n\nWhen interpreting the law, you can't take one sentence out of context and try to apply it. You must read the entire law, and interpret each statement in context.\nIn Wisconsin statute 939\\.48 (Self\\-defense and defense of others), the section you are citing is (1m)(b)(1\\). It contributes to 939\\.48(1m)(b), which modifies 939\\.48(1m)(ar), which expounds on (1\\).  \n\nTo paraphrase the law,  \n\n939\\.48 (self\\-defense)  \n\n1\\) A person may only use lethal force to defend themself or others from an immanent crime that would cause death or great bodily harm.  \n\n1ar) When defending your home or business, you may presume that someone breaking in poses the threat of death or great bodily harm.  \n\n1b) On second thought, you MAY NOT presume this under a couple of conditions:  \n\n1b1\\) You are actively engaged in criminal activity  \n\n1b2\\) You have reason to believe the person breaking in is a police officer, fire fighter, or paramedic engaged in their lawful duty.  \n\nIn legal terms, a presumption is something you shall / may act on before you have firm evidence to the contrary.  \nIf someone is breaking into your home, you do not have to identify them or see clear evidence of a threat (e.g., if it's too dark to see).  \n\nBUT if you can see someone clearly, and see a clear threat / clear lack of threat, you are no longer acting under presumption.  \n\nSo,  \n\nIf you are in bed, and someone breaks into your house, you may normally fire on them without clearly seeing a weapon.  \n\nBut if your spouse flips on the light and the intruder sees your gun and surrenders, you may no longer fire. You have firm evidence the intruder is not a threat.  \n\nIf you are hacking into the pentagon's computers late at night, and someone kicks in your door, you may **not** shoot at them, because you cannot presume threat. (It may be the FBI serving a no\\-knock warrant.)  \n\nBut if you flip on the the light and see someone in a ski mask threatening you with a crow bar, you may shoot him. You now have firm evidence of a threat to your life.  \n\nNone of this has any effect on the Kyle Rittenhouse case.\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nKyle was not defending his dwelling or business.  \n\nKyle's legal defense does not rest on a (claimed) presumption of threat, it rests on (claimed) evidence of threat.  \n\nLikewise, the accusations against Kyle don't claim that illegal possession of a firearm negates self\\-defense.  \n\nI don't know of any case law in Wisconsin involving self\\-defense while illegally carrying a gun, but there's nothing in the statute law that would bar self\\-defense in that situation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Wisconsin, under what circumstances does engaging in criminal activity affect a person's right to claim self-defense?\n\nA) It completely nullifies the right to self-defense in all situations\nB) It only affects self-defense claims when defending a dwelling or business\nC) It removes the presumption of threat but doesn't eliminate the right to self-defense\nD) It has no effect on self-defense claims whatsoever\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nAccording to Wisconsin statute 939.48, engaging in criminal activity does not completely nullify the right to self-defense in all situations, which eliminates option A. The statute specifically addresses this issue in the context of defending a dwelling or business, ruling out option D. \n\nThe correct answer is C because the law states that engaging in criminal activity removes the presumption of threat when defending a dwelling or business, but it does not eliminate the right to self-defense entirely. The individual would still be able to claim self-defense if they can provide clear evidence of a threat.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the statute does address criminal activity in the context of defending a dwelling or business, it doesn't limit the effect to only those situations. The removal of the presumption of threat could potentially have broader implications in how self-defense claims are evaluated.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the nuances in self-defense law, particularly how engaging in criminal activity interacts with self-defense claims in specific contexts."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/20002/can-i-use-youtube-free-audio-library-music-in-my-online-video-editor", "docs_id": 20002, "title": "Can I use Youtube Free Audio Library music in my online video editor?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I made an online video editor (website) and I want to let users to use music from youtube free audio library in their videos.

My question is why can't all rights directly come from the Constitution? As far as I knew constitutional law mainly deals with the functioning of states and governments so why encode certain rights directly into the Constitution while others as separate law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the right to privacy *derives* from the Constitution, as \"an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution\", see [Justice K.S.

The issue here is that prior to this ruling, the right to privacy was only *implicit* in the Constitution, and it took a lawsuit and argumentation to extend the interpretation of the Constitution. The right to information is a [statutory right](https://rti.gov.in/rti-act.pdf). The rights created by this law are stated explicitly, so no lawsuit or interpretation is required (unless a court case is required to understand what a \"competent authority\" is, or whether the right includes more than the 4 enumerated sub\\-rights). That is, this statute specifically creates a right, which could not be inferred from the Constitution.\n\nThere are three ways to create a new right. One is to \"discover\" that it was implicit in existing law, as in the Aadhaar ruling. Another is to amend the Constitution and add something to Part III. Turn to the [Constitution itself](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/India_2015.pdf?lang=en), art 368, which describes amending the Constitution. The third way is to do this statutorily, as in the right to information. Acts of Parliament are \"easier\" than Constitutional amendments: an amendment requires a 2/3 quorum, and us subject to other specific restrictions, possibly requiring approval by a majority of states. Likewise the right to free, compulsory education is Art. 23a of the Constitution, but the details of implementation are a statutory creation, subject to judicial review unlike Constitutional amendments (hence [Pramati Education and Cultural Trust v.

The landlord is within their rights to deny the former tenant's request to enter the property for repairs. The appropriate course of action is for the landlord to obtain professional quotes for the repairs, have the work done to a satisfactory standard, and then deduct the costs from the tenant's bond.

It is recommended reading.\n\n**TL;DR**: The *controller* is the one who calls the shots (i.e. what personal data to process, what means to use to process it, the purpose of processing, and the legal basis for processing). This is usually the owner of information system. The *processor* is the the entity that actually do the processing. If their relationship is not described in a legal document known as a DPA, both the controller and processor risks fines.\n\n> A client has asked for my privacy policy but the only one I have is based around my own personal website. Do I need to create another policy for my clients and base this around what I process for them?\n\nI think you have the right idea about you having different roles in different contexts, and also that you work for clients, *you* are processor. This also means that the client is the *controller*.\n\nA \"privacy policy\"\\-type document is not sufficient to regulate the relationship between the *controller* and *processor*. \n\nHow to regulate this relationship is described in [GDPR Article 28 (3\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/). Its start out by saying:\n\n> Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject\\-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller.\n\nIt then goes on to describe what stipulations the contract must contain.\n\nThis contract is usually called a **DPA**. The initials may stand for \"Data Processing Agreement\" or \"Data Protection Addendum\".\n\nBasically, if you personal process data on behalf of clients, you *need* to have this place. Both the controller and processor will be fined by the supervisory authority finds out that you are processing personal data without having such a contract in place.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A web developer who processes data for clients and also maintains their own website is preparing documentation for GDPR compliance. Which of the following statements is correct regarding their responsibilities?\n\nA) The web developer only needs a privacy policy for their personal website, as this covers all data processing activities.\n\nB) The web developer should create separate privacy policies for their website and for each individual client.\n\nC) The web developer needs a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with each client, in addition to their own website's privacy policy.\n\nD) The web developer is always considered a data controller and doesn't need to worry about processor responsibilities.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The web developer plays different roles in different contexts. For their own website, they are a data controller and need a privacy policy. However, when processing data for clients, they act as a data processor. In this capacity, they need a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with each client as required by GDPR Article 28(3). This DPA is separate from and in addition to the privacy policy for their own website. It regulates the relationship between the controller (client) and processor (web developer) and must contain specific stipulations about the nature, purpose, and duration of data processing, among other details. A simple privacy policy is not sufficient to cover the processor-controller relationship, and having a DPA in place is crucial for GDPR compliance in this context."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80611/benefits-of-registering-copyright-should-i-register-or-not", "docs_id": 80611, "title": "Benefits of registering copyright - Should I register or not?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a question regarding copyright registration in Canada.

In Canada, copyright registration is not mandatory, but it does provide official proof of ownership, which can simplify the process of proving ownership in an infringement case. However, it's important to note that registration is not required to file a lawsuit, unlike in the United States.\n\nOption A is incorrect because copyright registration is not mandatory in Canada, even for filing lawsuits.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while registration provides official proof, it's not necessarily irrefutable and could potentially be challenged in court.\n\nOption D is partially true but oversimplified. While creative works are automatically protected in Canada without registration, the registration still offers benefits in terms of proving ownership, so it's not entirely unnecessary.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the nuanced role of copyright registration in the Canadian legal system, requiring examinees to differentiate between mandatory requirements, legal benefits, and practical advantages."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/39110/is-there-a-law-that-says-you-have-to-care-for-a-minor-that-isn-t-your-child", "docs_id": 39110, "title": "Is there a law that says you have to care for a minor that isn\u2019t your child?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a minor that isn\u2019t your child would die if unhelped, and you were the only one that could help them, is there any law saying you have to?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The law imposes no general duty to \u201ccare for\u201d anyone\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, unless you are a lifeguard, there is no duty to render aid to a drowning person.\n\nThere are a number of specific duties including:\n\n* the duty of a parent or guardian to provide for and keep safe a child\n* a similar duty for anyone standing *in loco parentis* \\- in the place of a parent.
