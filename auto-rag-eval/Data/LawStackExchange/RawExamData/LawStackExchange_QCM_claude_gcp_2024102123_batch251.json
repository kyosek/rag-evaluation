While all other land was sold off with the houses, this patch of land remained to be owned by the company that build the houses.\n\nAbout 30 years ago the owners dissolved the company. Land registry lists the dissolved company still as the owner, and the owners of the company can no longer be found.\n\nWhat happens to the ownership of this land? Will it now forever be owned by a no longer existing entity or can an official entity (like the local council) step in and take ownership?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the general case, when a company is dissolved any assets still belonging to it becomes *bona vacantia* under [Section 1012 of the Companies Act 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1012) which means that it belongs to the Crown.\n\nThe Crown can then choose to disclaim its rights to the asset under [Section 1013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1013), and typically will do this where there are risks involved (e.g. leasehold land). The effect of dislaimer, per Sections [1014](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1014) and [1015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1015) is that the \"*property is deemed not to have vested in the Crown*\" and it terminates \"*the rights, interests and liabilities of the company in or in respect of the property disclaimed*\".\n\nIn the case of freehold land that is disclaimed, it [escheats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escheat) (transfers) to the [Crown Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Estate) and the freehold interest is extinguished. According to [Practical Law](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/w-007-3468) (paywall):\n\n> Note, if the land is registered, the registered title will remain and\n> the Land Registrar may enter a notice on the Land Registry title if\n> notified (rule 173, Land Registration Rules 2003\\). The notice will\n> recite the fact of the liquidator's disclaimer or Crown disclaimer but\n> will not otherwise specify that the land has passed by escheat.\n> \n> \n> The Crown Estate then becomes entitled (but not obliged) to take\n> possession of it. The Crown Estate will not assume any liabilities as\n> owner of the land unless it does take possession or exercises control\n> over the property. The result of this is that the only action the\n> Crown Estate will generally take as regards escheated land is to sell\n> the whole of the land to a suitable buyer who approaches the Crown\n> Estate.\n\nYou can read more about how the Crown Estate subsequently deals with such property (including if and how it sells the property) in their [FAQs](https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/en-gb/resources/faqs/).",

While the Crown can disclaim its rights to the asset, in the case of freehold land, it typically escheats (transfers) to the Crown Estate. The Crown Estate then becomes entitled (but not obliged) to take possession of it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the local council does not automatically gain ownership of such land.\nOption B is incorrect because a dissolved company cannot own property.\nOption D is incorrect because the company's assets do not automatically transfer to shareholders upon dissolution.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the most likely scenario based on the legal framework described in the original text."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is based on a story that happened a couple of days ago.\n\nTwo friends and I were walking outside. Right now, in Germany there are strict regulations about the number of persons and households that are allowed to meet together. So, as we were seen from a police car passing by, the car stopped and two officers went towards us.\n\nOne of us, a friend who didn't want any contact with the police, instantly ran away, which was seen by the officers. They didn't try to chase him. They then stopped us and started to ask questions about the friend who escaped. Seems like the fact of us gathering wasn't a problem at all, compared to the fact that one person escaped from them.\n\nWe told that we were just hanging around as friends, after which the officers asked if we could call our buddy and ask why he ran away and if he could get back. We told that his phone is dead, after which we should prove it to the police by calling him. After a failed call, police asked us to provide them the contact information, which we obviously had, because we tried to call him.\n\nWe were let go after police got our IDs but it just doesn't feel right that they tricked us to get the phone number of our friend who escaped. I understand that it was our own fault, that we responded to the question if we could call him, but could we just refuse to call him or answer any of their questions in that situation?\n\nWere the officers even allowed to ask if we could call him or to ask us to show our phones to them, so they could get the contact information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From the German lawyer association (\"Deutscher Anwaltverein\") one can find the [following](https://anwaltauskunft.de/magazin/gesellschaft/strafrecht-polizei/was-darf-die-polizei-bei-einer-personenkontrolle?full=1) (Google\\-translation):\n\n> In the case of a purely preventive identity check, the officers are initially only allowed to determine the identity of the respondent. This means that you can ask for your name, date and place of birth, home address and nationality and have your ID shown \\- by the way, as a German citizen you don't have to always have your ID with you.\n\n> \"You don't have to answer any questions beyond that,\" says lawyer Robert Hotstegs from the German Lawyers' Association (DAV). Of course, police officers often try to gather more information with emphatically casual questions. \"Well, where do we come from\" or: \"And where are we going now?\" Are typical examples. The police are not allowed to insist on an answer. Anyone who, as a respondent, is voluntarily too willing to provide information can harm themselves and possibly even give rise to concrete suspicions.\n\nSo they are allowed to ask such things, but you don't need to answer everything.\n\nHow to handle such situations, again according to the link above:\n\n> \u201cI recommend answering the survey as briefly and politely as possible. This has a de\\-escalating effect and helps to end the unpleasant situation as quickly as possible, \u201dsays Attorney Hotstegs.\n\n> However, you should always answer the questions about yourself. Because if the police cannot determine the identity of a person or only with great effort, they may take further measures to determine the identity. This includes taking it to the police station and, under certain circumstances, a search. Otherwise, these measures are not permitted without a specific reason.",

This includes asking for name, date and place of birth, home address, nationality, and requesting to see an ID (though German citizens are not required to always carry ID). \n\nOption B is incorrect because citizens are not obligated to answer questions beyond basic identity information. \n\nOption C is incorrect as there's no legal requirement to call others or provide their contact information. \n\nOption D is incorrect because allowing searches of personal belongings or devices is not a standard part of an identity check and would typically require additional legal justification.\n\nThe correct approach is to provide the required identity information politely and briefly, without volunteering additional information that isn't legally required."

So I would like to simply download it, include it on a page of my book, and sell that book. Note that the picture serves a purpose of illustration within the book, which is actually original content written by me.\n\nCan I do this:\n\n* By simply adding a \"Disclaimer/Copyright notice\" at the beginning of the book, stating something like \"all pictures in this book are in the public domain, no copyright infringement is intended, blablabla\"?\n* Not attributing the image to any person that was involved in taking the picture, or uploading it to Wikipedia?\n* Do the same with about 20 more images that are relevant to my book, each time not specifically mentioning the copyright info or in which country it is public domain, just the fact that \"all images are public domain\"?\n\nThanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, you *can* do that, assuming that the pictures are really in the public domain (i.e. due to their age, and not only claimed to be). But you probably *shouldn't*, but you'll probably want to add a label to the images anyway (what it depicts, who the original painter is, etc).

You can do that on a separate page as well, giving the source for each.\n\nNote that while using pd images does not create a copyright violation, even if you blatantly say that you created them yourself, it could still be considered plagiarism.

Option D is the most comprehensive and responsible approach, as it:\n\n1. Respects the original creators by acknowledging their work\n2.

Suppose you are good at sleight of hand, i.e. dextrous illusion\\-making like a magician. Using a product or good you actually own that looks to an outsider's eyes just like one in the store, but which you've marked in a discreet place so you are assured you don't accidentally actually take the one that isn't yours, and using your magician skills, you make it look like you were pocketing the wares when you actually didn't. To security, and to the limited resolution on a surveillance camera, it looks like a theft, and the police are called.\n\nWhat happens? Even if the illusionary nature is eventually discovered and proven (e.g. if the store keeps suitable inventory records which they can cross\\-check with transaction logs and they do and find that no items are unaccounted for), does the mere fact of having \"hoaxed\" the crime itself constitute some kind of crime in at least the same common\\-law jurisdictions? Could you be charged with something oblique like \"wasting police time\" or something? Could *someone* be charged with that? Even if none of that, would you still stand a strong chance to be successfully convicted of theft directly (albeit *de facto* wrongfully, but still), because someone could always claim you switched the items and it'd be your word against theirs that that mark was on the one you owned and not the one you didn't, and the injustices of unequal bargaining power would work against you?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can\u2019t think of any laws against pretending to commit a crime, *per se*. For example, undercover police officers often pretend to buy or sell illicit goods, to see who will take them up on the offer.\n\nHowever, pretending to commit some crimes could be a crime. if you intentionally pretend to be violent or unstable, and this \u201cputs another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact,\u201d that could be common assault.",

Prior to obtaining the consent of a personal data owner for the collection and utilization of their data, a data controller must inform the personal data owner of its retention period for the personal data. A data controller also is required to cease all processing of personal data once the retention period has lapsed.\n> \n> \n> Despite the above provisions, the PDP Draft Law is silent on how long a retention period should be. Lawmakers in the House have expressed concern that there will be no legal certainty if the duration of the retention period is not stipulated in the PDP Draft Law, resulting in a hodgepodge of retention period policies among companies. With input from lawmakers, the government may decide to stipulate a specific data retention period in the new law, although as far as we are aware the House has not suggested how long the retention period should be.\n\nThe term PDP Draft Law brought me further to [lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ad6c624f-975c-4ad0-ae87-78be636fb823), further detailing the proposed law. To get the current state, I finally unearthed [legal500](https://www.legal500.com/guides/chapter/indonesia-data-protection-cyber-security). The latter points to an **EIT Law** of 2016 and an **MCI Regulation** of the same year. A quick glance over the explanations given by the site makes it appear to be very close to GDPR with a data minimistion requirement and Right to delisting.\n\nIP Addresses?!\n==============\n\nApparently, [a comparison of VPN networks](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/ip-address-indonesia) points out that ISPs in Indonesia only need to contain IP\\-addresses for 3 months, quoting [a website](https://iclg.com/practice-areas/telecoms-media-and-internet-laws-and-regulations/indonesia) that paraphrases the indonesian law as follows:\n\n> GR 52/2000 requires \\[Telecoms and internet operators] to maintain and store a Customer Data Record (\"CDR\") or details of the communications usage. Storage of the CDR shall be kept for a period of at least 3 months.\n\nA website doesn' count as an Internet operator, an ISP does.

While there is a general 5-year retention period for personal data mentioned in other regulations, IP addresses fall under the specific category of CDR, which has a shorter retention requirement.

The provider of information shall, at any time while availing the services or otherwise, also have an option to withdraw its consent given earlier to the body corporate. Such withdrawal of the consent shall be sent in writing to the body corporate.\n\nIt is not clear to me whether \"letter or Fax or email from the provider\" \\[from the information provider (aka the Data Subject)] could include a message automatically sent when a person using a web site clicks a button clearly indicating consent to collection of such information. It certainly does not require a letter mailed in the post. The provisions of sub\\-rule (7\\) clearly contemplate collection of information online as long as there is active consent and an option to withdraw consent.\n\nI find it hard to imagine that a separate, manual, communication mu8st be sent in advance under rule 5 (1\\), and that does not seem to be how this rule has been enforced over the past 10 years. I think that \"through letter or Fax or email\" is being interpreted to include positive written consent through a web site. But I cannot find a cite of a law or rule explicitly saying as much, and I do not know Indian law very well, so I could be mistaken.\n\n**Additional info**:\n\nThe [Press note](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files.PressNote_25811.pdf) \"Clarification on Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and\nprocedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011 under section 43A of the Information Technology Act, 2000\" dated 24\\-August\\-2011 17:03 IST says:\n\n> ... in Rule 5(1\\) consent includes consent given by any mode of electronic communication.\n\nThis seems to dispose of any suggestion that a separate letter or email is required, and permits the user to indicate consent though a button, checkbox, or other online interaction, as long as it is clear what consent this will be giving.",

The clarification effectively broadened the acceptable methods of obtaining consent beyond just letters, faxes, or emails, making option B the correct answer. Options A, C, and D are too restrictive and do not align with the clarification provided in the Press note."

While copyright is reserved by default, copyright law contains many exceptions, and a disclaimer in a book's imprint cannot override them. What exceptions are available depends on national laws. The *fair use* exception is famous, but specific to U.S. law. German law instead provides a number of exceptions for specific situations. For example:\n\n* \u00a7 51 UrhG: publication of citations is legal, if the amount of cited material is justified by the specific context. In particular, including citations is justified in academic works that discuss the cited work.\n* \u00a7 53 Abs 1 UrhG: private copies are allowed, as long as the original was acquired in a manner that was not obviously illegal, and as long as the copy is not used directly or indirectly for commercial purposes. See the German Wikipedia Article [*Privatkopie*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie) for context. Limitation: entire books may only be duplicated by manual transcription.\n* \u00a7 53 Abs 2 UrhG: analogue (non\\-digital) copies for personal purposes are allowed in some additional circumstances.\n* And some specific exceptions for schools, teaching, research, and data mining.\n\nWhat does this mean for taking notes?\n\n* Notes that capture your own thoughts, or a summary of the copyrighted material in your own words, are not derivatives in the sense of copyright. (However, German copyright law doesn't have a 1:1 equivalent to the term \u201cderivative\u201d. Instead, \u201cadaptation\u201d might be a better fit for the German *Bearbeitung*.)\n* If these notes are purely personal, you can likely copy parts of the book into your notes. For example, this might cover a diary in which you write down poems that you like.\n* Quotes/citations can be allowed when necessary to discuss the book in your notes. Remember to clearly cite the source.\n\nPersonally, I keep extensive notes in digital form, for personal and for work purposes, and make extensive use of my right to cite parts of others' works, as necessary for discussion my notes. I generally keep those citations down to a level so that my notes could be published without copyright concerns, even if quoting longer passages could be allowed as an \u00a7 53 private copy.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A German student purchases a textbook for her studies and wants to create digital notes using a note-taking app. Which of the following actions would most likely be permissible under German copyright law?\n\nA) Copying entire chapters of the book verbatim into her digital notes for future reference\nB) Transcribing short quotes from the book and adding her own commentary and analysis\nC) Scanning every page of the book and storing the images in her note-taking app\nD) Creating a complete digital copy of the book's text to use for a study group\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nB is the correct answer because it aligns with several provisions of German copyright law:\n\n1. It falls under \u00a7 51 UrhG, which allows for citations when justified by context, especially in academic work discussing the cited material.\n2. The use of short quotes with personal commentary likely qualifies as fair use and doesn't create a derivative work.\n3. This approach respects the spirit of \u00a7 53 Abs 1 UrhG by limiting the amount of copied material and using it for personal, non-commercial purposes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because copying entire chapters verbatim would likely exceed the limits of fair use and private copying exceptions.\n\nOption C is problematic because it involves creating a complete digital copy of the book, which is not allowed under the private copying exception for entire books (\u00a7 53 Abs 1 UrhG specifies that entire books may only be duplicated by manual transcription).\n\nOption D is incorrect for similar reasons to C, and additionally because it involves sharing the copy with a study group, which could be seen as distribution and thus a violation of copyright."

I suspect maybe the head of the Federal Aviation Administration or the Postmaster General or the Director of the Census is one of those. (For some decades before the late '60s \\-\\- maybe the Nixon administration \\-\\- the Postmaster General was a member of the Cabinet.)\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, all members of the Cabinet and all ambassadors and all federal judges need to get confirmed by the Senate.\n\nWhat is the current list of those officers who need to get confirmed by the Senate and those \"inferior officers\" who are appointed by the President without the need for confirmation, and those \"inferior officers\" who are appointed by department heads, and those \"inferior officers\" who are appointed by the judiciary? Would this list be on the web somewhere?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I conclude (contrary to an earlier expression) that there is no such list, nor can there be, because the term \"officer\" is not well enough defined.\n\nThe inferior officers are those officers who are not principal officers (as specified in the Constitution, e.g. ambassadors, cabinet members, judges), since there are only two kinds of officers. There is no constitutional or statutory definition of \"Officer of the United States\", so we have to figure it out from case law. As noted in [Morrison v. Olson](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/487/654/case.html) 487 U.S. 654\n\n> The line between \"inferior\" and \"principal\" officers is one that is\n>  far from clear, and the Framers provided little guidance into where it\n>  should be drawn.\n\nOfficers of the US cannot be appointed by Congress ([Buckley v. Valeo](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html) 424 U.S. 1 (1976\\), so that narrows down the possibilities \u2013 if in fact an appointment can be made by Congress, that is not an inferior office (since Congress has no such authority). That court also said that\n\n> We think that the term \"Officers of the United States,\" as used in\n>  Art. II, defined to include \"all persons who can be said to hold an\n>  office under the government\" in United States v. Germaine, supra, is a\n>  term intended to have substantive meaning. We think its fair import is\n>  that *any appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the\n>  laws of the United States is an \"Officer of the United States,*\" and\n>  must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \u00a7 2, cl. 2,\n>  of that Article.\n\nTo take a specific example, \"special trial judges\", authorized in [26 USC 7443a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7443A) are an example of an officer. We know they are officers, because [Freytag v. Commissioner](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/868/case.html) 501 U.S. 868 says so (since they read Buckley):\n\n> A special trial judge is an \"inferior Office\\[r]\" whose appointment\n>  must conform to the Appointments Clause. Such a judge acts as an\n>  inferior officer who exercises independent authority in cases governed\n>  by subsections (b)(1\\), (2\\), and (3\\). The fact that in subsection\n>  (b)(4\\) cases he performs duties that may be performed by an employee\n>  not subject to the Appointments Clause does not transform his status.\n\nThe Dept. of Justice offers [an analysis](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2015/05/29/op-olc-v031-p0083.pdf) of \"Officer of the United States\". The main elements in their opinion are that the position must possess delegated sovereign authority of the Federal government, and the position must be continuing. There are other criteria possibly applicable (things that were invokes at some time) including method of appointment, having been established by law, taking an oath of office, an emolument (not a volunteer), and receiving a commission. Still, Congress authorizes (by law) the hiring of federal employees, and not all employees are \"officers\".\n\nAn earlier memorandum on the topic is [here](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/1996/05/31/op-olc-v020-p0124_0.pdf). Footnote 54 notes that \n\n> It is at least arguable, however, that the authority \n>  exercised by second lieutenants and ensigns is so limited and\n>  subordinate that their analogues in the civil sphere clearly \n>  would be employees.\n\nWarrant officers and non\\-commisioned officers would likewise have quite limited authority.\n\nSince the definition of \"Officer of the United States\" is up for grabs, there can't be a complete list of inferior officers, especially if all military officers are included. There is a long list of civilian officers under the executive branch published in [United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Government_Policy_and_Supporting_Positions), after each presidential election. The so\\-called Plum Book is [on a government web page here](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012/pdf/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012.pdf) in the 2012 version, and [here](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2016/pdf/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2016.pdf) for 2016\\. However, you will not find special trial judges of the tax court in the Plum Book, which were held in Freytag to be officers, and are civilians in the executive branch. The special trial judges are apparently listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Judges_of_the_United_States_Tax_Court), as are the sitting judges (who are also not in the Plum book).",

Driving  on  roadways  laned for traffic. Whenever any roadway\nhas been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for  traffic  the\nfollowing  rules  in  addition  to  all others consistent herewith shall\napply:\n  (a) A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within\na single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has\nfirst ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\n\n```\n\n(b and c are not relevant)\n\n```\n   (d)  When  official markings are in place indicating those portions of\nany roadway where crossing such markings would be especially  hazardous,\nno  driver  of a vehicle proceeding along such highway shall at any time\ndrive across such markings.\n\n```\n\nThe last bit, (d), is of interest. Basically, you are allowed to change into the correct lane as long as the pavement markings permit it. The pavement markings at an intersection with a sign like the one you posted are generally solid white lines. These details are governed by the [Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ser-pubs.htm), published by the Federal Highway Administration. Their information on pavement markings is available both in PDF and [HTML format](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/services/publications/fhwaop02090/index.htm). Pertinently, it says:\n\n> A double white line indicates that lane changes are prohibited. A single white line indicates that lane changes are discouraged. A dashed white line indicates that lane changes are allowed.\n\nTherefore, if the lines separating the lanes are, as usual, solid white lines, you are encouraged to get into the correct lane before the beginning of the solid white line, but you are permitted to change lanes across the solid lines. An example of such marking is in the right\\-hand example in the given image:\n\n[![Intersection marking examples from the US Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KZRT.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KZRT.gif)\n\nOne point of possible contention is that the [New York State Driver's Manual](http://dmv.ny.gov/about-dmv/chapter-4-traffic-control-2#pav-mar) describes the meaning of the solid white line somewhat differently:\n\n> **One solid line:** You can pass other vehicles or change lanes, but you can only do so when obstructions in the road or traffic conditions make it necessary.\n\nI don't see any statutory basis for that description, but I may well have overlooked something.\n\nI suppose you know where the signs are specified, since you probably got the image from there, but for anyone reading this who does not know, they are specified in the publication [Standard Highway Signs](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ser-shs_millennium_eng.htm). This is available as a set of PDF files; the relevant file is the one containing [regulatory signs](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/SHSe/Regulatory.pdf); the sign in the question is 1\\-33, and it is in the midst of several similar signs.\n\nIf a police officer ticketed you for getting into the lane too late, I suppose you should find a lawyer who specializes in fighting traffic tickets, and ask whether there really is such a thing as \"too late.\" By my reading of the law, there isn't. (Of course, if it's dangerous to change lanes because of other vehicles, you shouldn't change lanes, but if you had, I would suppose the officer should have written a ticket for some other violation, like reckless driving.)",

Apple's way of backing things up is subscribe to iCloud, which is of course comes with a price.\n\nAfter my phone got bricked, I went to Apple and got that phone hardware replaced for being within a year of warrenty coverage of purchasing the phone. But then, surprisingly I found that I cannot restore my data on my new phone from those external harddrive.\n\nI called Apple customer care and they said I should have used my Mac or iCloud to backup those data.\n\nThere were tons of personal data, banking info, cryptos, auth tokens saved in my phone.

I called some of the lawyer around the place where I live in Florida, but with all I have talked so far I am having hard time explaining what is going on.\n\nRight now, what I am seeking is to understand if there are any scope for taking any legal action against apple?

Some software, like banking software, may not like it. My banking software figured out it wasn\u2019t the same phone and I had to register it with my bank again. If things go wrong, Apples liability will be limited. The third method, you\u2019re on your own.

The user has limited legal recourse against Apple in this situation. Apple provides specific methods for backing up iPhone data (iCloud or Mac/iTunes) that are guaranteed to work for restoration. By choosing to use an external hard drive backup method not officially supported by Apple, the user assumed the risk of potential data loss. Apple's customer support confirmed that official backup methods should have been used. Additionally, the documentation mentions that in similar cases involving significant financial losses (like the $600,000 Bitcoin loss), compensation was unlikely. While the situation is unfortunate for the user, Apple's liability is limited when users choose to use unofficial backup methods. This emphasizes the importance of using manufacturer-recommended backup solutions, especially for devices containing valuable personal and financial data."

This is known as the \"command\" theory of law. This clearly cannot explain obligation at international law. But nor can it explain many of the rules in domestic legal systems that we have no problem conceiving of as law (e.g. the law\\-making process itself, the system of adjudication, rules that confer power, etc.).\n\n### Modern views: internal sense of obligation\n\nThe command theory of law has largely been supplanted by other theories of obligation such as that of [H.L.A. Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._A._Hart). In this view, law does not require rules to be backed by threats of force, or to be imposed by a superior sovereign. Law can exist and sustain itself purely through a group's internal point of view: do the participants (states, in the case of international law) \"*use* the rules as standards for the appraisal of their own and others' behaviour\" and do they see them as imposing obligations?\n\nThis focus on the internal viewpoint is actually part of the test for recognizing a norm as customary international law. For something to be customary international law, it must be accomanied by *opinio juris*. This is a \"'psychological' element'\" (John H. Currie, *Public International Law*, p. 195\\). States need to behave as if a rule has legal obligation. International judicial bodies will look to evidence about how states explain their motives, including how they explain deviations from the rule.\n\nH.L.A. Hart explicitly noted the common question, \"How can international law be binding?\" (*The Concept of Law*, \"Chapter X: International Law\"). His answer:\n\n> there is something very confusing in this favourite form of question; and before we can deal with it we must face a prior question to which the answer is by no means clear. This prior question is: what is meant by saying of a whole system of law that it is 'binding'? The statement that a particular rule of a system is binding on a particular person is one familiar to lawyers and tolerably clear in meaning. We may paraphrase it by the assertion that the rule in question is a valid rule, and under it the person in question *has some obligation or duty*.\n\nHe recognizes that \"one source of doubt on this point is simply the absense from the system of centrally organized sanctions.\" But for all the reasons that this is not the criteria of what makes law law or creates the internal view of obligation, even in domestic systems, this fact does not undercut international law's status as law.\n\nHe describes nation states' expressed attitude towards the rules of international law:\n\n> Yet what these rules require is thought and spoken of as obligatory; there is general pressure for conformity to the rules; claims and admissions are based on them and their breach is held to justify not only insistent demands for compensation, but reprisals and counter\\-measures. When the rules are disregarded, *it is not on the footing that they are not binding; instead efforts are made to conceal the facts*.\n\n### In what sense is international law binding?\n\nWhen one makes the assertion that a rule is *binding* at international law, they are simply describing or predicting that the participants view the rule as generating obligation and duty, likely due to the rule's basis in treaty or customary international law.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the modern view of how international law can be binding, according to H.L.A. Hart's theory?\n\nA) International law is binding only when enforced by a superior sovereign power with the ability to impose sanctions.\n\nB) International law is binding when states internally view the rules as standards for behavior and see them as imposing obligations, even without centralized enforcement.\n\nC) International law is binding only when it is codified in formal treaties signed by all major world powers.\n\nD) International law is binding when it is backed by the threat of military force from the United Nations.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to H.L.A. Hart's theory, which has largely supplanted the older \"command theory\" of law, international law can be binding without centralized enforcement or a superior sovereign. Instead, it derives its binding nature from states' internal point of view - they use the rules as standards for appraising behavior and see them as imposing obligations. This is evidenced by how states behave as if the rules have legal obligation, even when trying to conceal breaches rather than denying the rules' validity. The other options represent misconceptions about international law or outdated views like Austin's command theory."

The law shall ensure their equality, both in law and in practice, most particularly in the family, in education, and in the workplace. Men and women have the right to equal pay for work of equal value.\n> \n> \n> 4 The law shall provide for the elimination of inequalities that affect \\>persons with disabilities.\n\nAnd, later:\n\n> Art. 59 Military service and alternative service\n> \n> \n> 1 Every \\[name of the country] man is required to do military service. Alternative civilian service shall be provided for by law.\n> \n> \n> 2 Military service is voluntary for \\[name of the country] women.\n> \n> \n> 3 Any \\[name of the country] man who does not do military or alternative service is liable to pay a tax. This tax is levied by the Confederation and assessed and collected by the Cantons.\n> \n> \n> 4 The Confederation shall legislate for fair compensation for loss of income.\n> \n> \n> 5 Persons who suffer damage to their health or lose their lives while doing military or alternative civilian service are entitled to appropriate support from the Confederation, whether for themselves or for their next of kin.\n\nThis clearly contradicts the idea that males and females have the same rights and duties. While this is still somehow acceptable (you also would want the ones who are best for the task, not just everyone) the tax for those who are not allowed (!) to do the service in my eyes is not.\n\nLike in my situation, it was that I went to military, but during service I got rejected because of my health. I am not even allowed to do civil service.\n\nLaw now requires me to pay 3% of my income, but at least 400USD every year \u2013 no matter if I live in this country or not. If I were not earning enough, I still would have to pay at least 400USD to my country every year. You could say that it is illegal for me to be poor.\n\n**1\\. Do this laws contradict human rights?**\n(Note: Many people went to the human rights court because of this, sometimes they agreed that it does, sometimes it does not. In the end it doesn't matters as my country doesn't care about decisions of the human rights court.)\n\n---\n\nYou have different possibilities to be expelled from that tax.\nThe most famous one is being a woman.\nThe second one is being disabled by at least 40%.\n\nSince males and females have the same rights and duties, I come up with this equation in this particular situation:\n\n> male \\+ 40% disabled \\= female\n\nAs mentioned both genders have the same law applied to the according to human rights and constitution. Does this empathize that ALL woman are at least disabled by 40%?\n\n> male \\+ 40% disabled \\= female (who are all disabled).\n\nI know this sounds salty but somehow I cannot get rid of this equation.\n\nAnyway, we have a law for transsexuals that states that you don\u2019t need to pay anymore if you switched gender and:\n\n> A psychiatrist and a\n> endocrinologist\n> confirmed that you're not a male anymore and don't have a male body.\n\nIf you need to switch gender it is considered an illness (living the wrong body) and healthcare pays for your therapy and operations.\n\nThis makes becoming female free, staying male costs. Considering with the points above (some people cannot afford to pay):\n\n**2\\. Is it legitimate that the government puts pressure onto someone to switch gender and get rid of his genitals?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Article 8 is pretty clear. The fact that it is recommended to extend the draft to women indicates that there is a conflict needing resolution. [A relevant case](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjS0YSSnLHQAhUO-GMKHWNQDFwQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fhudoc.echr.coe.int%2Fwebservices%2Fcontent%2Fpdf%2F001-92525%3FTID%3Dihgdqbxnfi&usg=AFQjCNGHLIgcfwL7Slt-goWMkiT6NQL9OQ&sig2=BeEiIwR_U5JJwgBrIhBmlw&cad=rja) before the European Court of Human Rights ruled on this and found the law to violate articles 14 and 8 of the ECHR. They identify an exoneration from the tax under the Military\\-Service Exemption Tax Act sect. 4\\. Reading the judgment could be helpful (maybe you know the case). What I get from it is that there are a bunch of situation\\-specific details that could be applied (e.g. you have to first complain formally in\\-country before going to ECHR), and issues of disability level and the distinction between disability and illness. This gives a model for anyone to attempt to resist the tax, but only a change in the law will get rid of it.",

The military service tax appears to conflict with both human rights principles and the country's constitutional guarantees of equality, particularly Article 8. However, challenging such laws typically requires following specific legal procedures, including exhausting domestic remedies before appealing to international courts like the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR has previously ruled on similar cases, finding violations of human rights, but this doesn't automatically invalidate the law in the country. Successful challenges would likely need to address specific situations and follow proper legal channels, with a change in the law itself being the ultimate solution to eliminate the tax entirely."

There is a mandatory right to cover someone else's composition outside of a movie or TV show (roughly speaking) for a statutorily fixed royalty, but the bureaucracy is such that it would be impractical to do here.\n\nWhether or not the \"fair use\" defense applies in this case is a \"colorable\" argument, but really, when you perform the entire work as written except for transcription, winning a \"fair use\" defense in a infringement action would be a long shot.\n\nThe fact that it is somehow connected to an educational activity would be the strongest argument in this case. Also, as noted in a comment, your school may have obtained express permission to cover the work:\n\n> Your music school may have a license with a [PRO (performing rights\n> organization](https://blog.songtrust.com/guide-to-usa-pros)) that covers your song. You might make some inquiries\n> with the administration as to whether this is the case.\n\nRadio stations obtain similar licenses to play a large catalog of music without individually obtaining licenses to use each work separately from the author.\n\nThis said, this kind of activity is often done, despite the fact that it is a copyright infringement, and most of the time, if the performance isn't too widely broadcast, most copyright owners will never pursue copyright infringement claims over something like this and indeed often won't even consider doing so.\n\nStill, copyright is an absolute bar to infringing rights without permission, even if there is absolutely no money received for the work and even if there is full attribution of its author. I'm not a great fan of the law as it is, and it is often disregarded, but that is the law.\n\nAlso, this answer is based upon U.S. law, but there isn't much international variation in this part of copyright law in countries that meaningfully enforce copyright laws in their courts. But, as another answer notes, in some countries the mandatory right to do a cover of songs in the U.S. is much easier bureaucratically, in some other countries:\n\n> In several countries, there are organizations that deal with the\n> copyright issue globally.

Sarah can indeed sue John for the tort of conversion, which is the civil equivalent of theft. This lawsuit could potentially allow her to recover various damages, including the value of the stolen laptop, related expenses (such as the cost of reporting the crime or acquiring a replacement), and possibly even compensation for emotional distress.\n\nHowever, the answer also acknowledges a practical consideration mentioned in the original text: the feasibility of such a lawsuit often depends on the defendant's ability to pay. As stated, \"there is no point suing someone who has no money.\" This practical aspect is an important consideration in deciding whether to pursue a civil action.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they misstate the legal process. The criminal conviction doesn't automatically provide full compensation to the victim, nor does it prevent a civil lawsuit. Option B is partially correct but too limited, as it only mentions recovering the market value of the stolen item, whereas a conversion lawsuit could potentially cover a broader range of damages."

Lee and Int'l Airport Centers, L.L.C. v. Citrin, individuals can be successfully sued for willfully deleting or destroying another person's digital data in various circumstances. The key factors are:\n\n1. The action was willful or intentional.\n2. The data belonged to someone else.\n3. The deletion or destruction caused damages.\n\nIt's important to note that:\n- The recoverability of the data may affect the damages but doesn't preclude a lawsuit.\n- The data doesn't need to have explicit monetary value like cryptocurrency.\n- It applies to both personal and business data.\n- The destruction doesn't need to involve physical damage to hardware.\n\nThis broad interpretation of data protection under US law allows for legal action in many scenarios of data destruction, making C the correct answer."

Are you thinking you can go to a country yours has no extradition treaty with and just commit arbitrary crime sprees with impunity? Presumably you mean to ask if they can extradite someone even without a treaty, and the answer is: depends on their laws, but otherwise of course they can if they feel like it (which may require giving them something in return).\n\nAn extradition treaty just creates a formalized process for handling extradition requests, which may include the types of crimes that may be considered, who can be considered or exempted, and the specific procedures a country may go through to decide on whether or not to grant the extradition. \n\nThe existence of a treaty does not guarantee the request will be granted. US requests to extradite [Roman Polanski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case) from Poland, France, and Switzerland have all failed, despite the fact that the [US has extradition treaties with all of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition_law_in_the_United_States#International_extradition). Several countries, such as France and Canada, will also refuse to extradite anyone who may be subject to the death penalty.

A citizen of Country X is accused of a serious crime in their home country but is currently residing in Country Y. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) Country Y cannot arrest or extradite the accused individual under any circumstances due to the lack of an extradition treaty.\n\nB) Country Y can arrest the individual but cannot extradite them to Country X without a formal treaty in place.\n\nC) Country Y can both arrest and potentially extradite the individual, depending on their own laws and diplomatic considerations, even without a formal extradition treaty.\n\nD) Country Y must immediately extradite the individual to Country X upon request, regardless of the absence of a treaty.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The absence of an extradition treaty does not prevent Country Y from arresting or potentially extraditing the individual. Extradition treaties primarily formalize the process and set agreed-upon terms, but countries can still choose to cooperate in legal matters without such treaties. The decision to extradite would depend on Country Y's own laws, diplomatic relations with Country X, and the specifics of the case. Countries retain sovereignty in making these decisions, and may consider factors such as the nature of the crime, potential punishments, and their own interests. Options A and B are incorrect because they falsely limit Country Y's actions. Option D is incorrect because it mandates action that is not required in the absence of a treaty, and even with a treaty, extradition is not always guaranteed."

Has this ever happened?   \n\nOr is the judge always picked in such a way that they could never be a witness? (Out of fears of bias or whatever)\n\nI was thinking about ancient or medieval situations where the ruler would witness a crime and order a punishment directly, since he didn't need more convincing, and they were judges for all intents and purposes once upon a time. I guess they can't do that today anymore, but what would happen if a judge today would witness the crime directly and just happen to be deciding in the court case?\n\nLet's say for example the judges in some location happen to be visiting a security facility for some guided tour or whatever, and they get to see the security cameras just as somebody is burglarizing the monitored building, so you can only get \"non\\-witness judges\" from out\\-of\\-state or another region. The lawsuit hasn't begun yet, and all of the possible, local judges saw it happen.   \n\nHow does it affect the process? Is the defendant automatically prevented from pleading not guilty? Is evidence still necessary, is the process just a formality then? What effects would it have on the process and verdict themselves?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is one context where this does happen.\n\nCommon law judges have direct contempt power.\n\nThis means that while a judge is in the courtroom presiding over a case, the judge can summarily punish someone with incarceration and/or a fine without a trial for \"contempt of court\" because the judge has personally observed what has happened. Contempt of court encompasses types of disorderly conduct that wouldn't otherwise be criminal conduct.\n\nIn other contexts, the judge is just one more witness and would not be assigned to handle the case.\n\n> so you can only get \"non\\-witness judges\" from out\\-of\\-state or another\n> region.

When a judge witnesses a crime outside of their courtroom, they are considered just another witness and would be disqualified from presiding over the case. This is to maintain impartiality and avoid conflicts of interest in the judicial process. The judge would likely be called as a witness if a trial occurs, but their testimony would be treated like any other witness testimony.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a judge's power to immediately pronounce verdicts without trial (as in contempt of court) is limited to specific behaviors occurring in their courtroom, not crimes witnessed elsewhere.\n\nOption B is false because witnessing a crime does not automatically prevent a defendant from pleading not guilty, nor does it reduce the trial to a mere formality. The defendant still retains their rights to due process.\n\nOption D is incorrect because even if a judge witnesses a crime, their account does not supersede the need for additional evidence.

They may, however, have an institutional obligation to act in a particular way, which might include always email questions, or never emailing questions (the latter is most likely). Assuming someone filed an institutional grievance against you, you have some right to answer these charges \u2013 it will be spelled out in the institution's rules. The federal regulations are between the institution and the government, and the institution then creates rules to keep themselves in compliance.\n\nThe usual worst\\-case scenario is that someone files a grievance, which is reviewed by the institution. As the accused, you will be informed of the charges against you, and will have the opportunity to defend yourself at least by the \"committee decision\" phase. Prior to that point, the institution can gather any data deemed relevant, and may well require that all questioning be conducted in a face\\-to\\-face meeting. Universities generally have minimal specification of procedural requirements, until they run into a problem and impose rules. To determine a person's authority to require something of you, you can ask them to tell you the university rules that give them that authority. Your attorney can then compare their demand with their authority and advise you whether you must comply, or perhaps strategically should comply, or should refuse.\n\nThe federal regulation which drives this is [34 CFR 105 subpart A](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d94e05d2e1f31c95c2387b077955a23&mc=true&node=sp34.1.106.a&rgn=div6). The logic of this is that the institution cannot discriminate on the basis of sex, if they do, they can be punished, but they can also \"erase\" the discrimination if they \"overcome the effects\" of the discrimination. [\u00a7106\\.8](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d94e05d2e1f31c95c2387b077955a23&mc=true&node=sp34.1.106.a&rgn=div6#se34.1.106_18) requires the institution to have a coordinator who assures compliance and does what is necessary including investigating. There must also be a grievance procedure:\n\n> (b) A recipient shall adopt and publish grievance procedures providing\n>  for prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee complaints\n>  alleging any action which would be prohibited by this part.\n\nThere is absolutely no further federal specification as to what this coordinator can do, instead the government leaves it up the the institution to come up with procedures.

According to the information provided, federal Title IX regulations do not specify the exact procedures a Title IX coordinator must follow in investigations. Instead, each institution is required to develop its own grievance procedures that provide for \"prompt and equitable resolution\" of complaints. The coordinator's authority and methods of communication would be determined by these institution-specific procedures, not directly by federal law.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there is no federal law specifically prohibiting email communication in this context. \n\nAnswer B is false because Title IX does not mandate any specific method of questioning or communication.\n\nAnswer D is not necessarily true, as the student's rights in this situation would be determined by the university's specific procedures, not by a blanket right to refuse all communication."

Is the rule simply that any such charts must be introduced into evidence before the trial, or can explanatory charts be used in final arguments without having submitted them beforehand?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The kind of chart you are talking about is called a \"demonstrative exhibit\". The rule governing the use of demonstrative exhibits in states that follow the numbering scheme of the federal rules of evidence (which most states do) is Rule 1006 (Summaries) which states:\n\n> The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs which\n>  cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form\n>  of a chart, summary, or calculation. The originals or duplicates,\n>  shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other\n>  parties at reasonable time and place. The court may order that they be\n>  produced in court.\n\nBasically, this means that demonstrative exhibits are fine as long as they are supported by the evidence offered at trial, or are admitted in circumstances when the opposing party has an opportunity to review at trial their factual basis. A demonstrative exhibit for use in closing doesn't necessarily have to be introduced into evidence at trial, although it often would be used first in opening, then during trial and again in closing, as a matter of good trial litigation practice.\n\nA complication is that many state court rules (and federal courts) require that demonstrative exhibits be disclosed a certain number of days before trial as part of a trial management order designed to prevent undue surprise. This provisions are sometimes contained in Rules 16 or 26 of rules numbered similarly to the federal rules of civil procedure, and are sometimes set forth in a court specific case management order or trial management order tailored to a particular case or a particular judge's preferences. This would vary considerably from court to court, sometimes even within the same state. These disclosure requirements are less common in courts with limited civil jurisdiction, but are sometimes found even in those courts.\n\nAlso, while advanced arrangements would ordinarily not need to be made with respect to a chart in terms of court facilities, one would want to make sure that an easel was available to put the chart on as one was talking about it. \n\nSome discussion of the use of visual aids in a closing argument can be found [here](http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/judges/Inns%20Presentation--Closing%20Arguments.pdf), although that source is light on the technical steps that must be taken to use them.\n\nIf a more sophisticated arrangement (e.g. a power point presentation or a video) is desired, this can generally be permitted as well, but advanced consultation with the court and opposing counsel to arrange the logistics of getting the projector and screen set up, etc. must usually be made usually via the court's division clerk (i.e. the court clerk assigned to the particular courtroom or judge).\n\nThe main objection to a demonstrative exhibit is that it is not supported by facts offered at trial (if it was not itself admitted as an exhibit at trial with an offer to disclose the underlying facts), either because the facts were not introduced into evidence, or because it inaccurately states the facts offered at trial. Also, certain kinds of statements (e.g. an attorney stating that a particular witness was lying, rather than listing facts that show that the witness was lying, or referring to evidence that was kept out of the record at trial) are prohibited completely in an closing statement in any format.",

They want to use a chart summarizing financial transactions that were discussed during the trial but not explicitly entered into evidence. The attorney did not disclose this chart before the trial. Under which circumstances would the use of this chart likely be permissible?\n\nA) The chart can be used without any restrictions, as closing arguments allow for new visual aids.\nB) The chart can only be used if it was previously entered into evidence during the trial.\nC) The chart can be used if the underlying data was presented during the trial and the opposing counsel is given an opportunity to review it before closing arguments.\nD) The chart cannot be used under any circumstances because it wasn't disclosed before the trial.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to Rule 1006 (Summaries), demonstrative exhibits like charts can be used in closing arguments if they are supported by evidence offered at trial, even if the chart itself wasn't entered into evidence. The key requirements are that the underlying data was presented during the trial and that the opposing party has an opportunity to review the chart's factual basis. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there are restrictions on introducing new information in closing arguments. \n\nOption B is too restrictive; the chart doesn't necessarily need to have been entered into evidence if it's based on facts that were presented during the trial. \n\nOption D is incorrect because while some courts require pre-trial disclosure of demonstrative exhibits, this isn't a universal rule, and the ability to use such exhibits often depends on whether they accurately represent evidence presented during the trial.\n\nThe key here is that the chart must be based on evidence already presented and the opposing counsel must have a chance to review it, making C the most accurate answer."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the U.S. the Constitution has been interpreted as requiring that anyone arrested be allowed, at their request, to consult with a lawyer before being questioned, and to have one present during questioning. (Actually, that may be too strong an assertion: as best I can tell these often\\-called [Miranda rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_warning) appear only to apply when law enforcement wishes to ensure that statements from a subject in custody be admissible in a criminal trial against the subject.)\n\nRecently the Supreme Court ruled in [United States v. Gonzalez\\-Lopez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Gonzalez-Lopez) that not being allowed counsel of one's choice was grounds for automatic reversal of a conviction. The Right to Counsel seems well\\-defined for trial, but not for arrest and investigation. Therefore:\n\n**Regarding the arrest and/or custodial interrogation stage:** Are there any laws that govern *who* can serve as counsel, and *how* one must be allowed to contact them?\n\nFor example, if I am arrested and:\n\n1. I want use a friend who has no legal training as \"counsel,\" do the police have any legal recourse from allowing me to talk to him prior to interrogation? E.g., can they insist that my counsel be a member of the bar in the state where I have been arrested?\n2. I want to consult a \"team\" of qualified counselors. Are there legal grounds or regulations to limit the number of individuals I consult prior to interrogation, and who I have present during interrogation?\n3. Can my contact with counsel be proscribed in any way? E.g., can the police limit the duration or schedule of my contact with counsel? Can they impede or delay access to me by someone who claims to be my counsel?\n4. What do police have to do to facilitate my access to my desired counsel(s)? E.g., how long can I be held after requesting an attorney without being allowed to attempt to contact one? What means must I be granted to find and contact the counsel of my choice?\n\n(I'm hoping that there is settled law on these questions, though [this report](https://web.archive.org/web/20150821035734/http://shadowproof.com/2015/03/31/attorneys-people-detained-by-chicago-police-demand-end-to-systematic-violations-of-right-to-access-lawyer/) suggests that, practically, police can do whatever they want until a lawyer actually finds out a client has been arrested and manages to locate him!)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **1\\. I want use a friend who has no legal training as my \"counsel,\" do the police have any legal recourse from allowing me to talk to him prior to interrogation? E.g., can they insist that my counsel be a member of the bar in the state where I have been arrested?**\n\nYes. If they don't want you to, you cannot talk to a friend, only a lawyer. If you got an OUI, and you're not being a jerk, they will probably let you talk to whomever you want (within reason \u2013 it's not social hour). However, *they can* keep you from speaking to anyone but a lawyer as that person could gain information from you that can corrupt their investigation. (E.g., they arrest you with 10 lbs. of methamphetamine. They know it's \"fresh\" and likely came from a local lab that they suspect you of running. You cannot be allowed to talk to just anyone, as they could help get the lab broke down, moved, destroyed). In TV shows you see attorneys doing this type of illicit thing, but in reality that is very rare. When you enter the police station to speak with a client, you must present your bar card (license to practice). Friends are not allowed in, even if you value their counsel \u2013 they are not counselors!\n\n**2\\. I want to consult a \"team\" of qualified counselors. Are there legal grounds or regulations to limit the number of individuals I consult prior to interrogation, and who I have present during interrogation?** \n\nNo. You can have your entire legal team with you, while preparing for court, or while being questioned, within reason. They do not need to rent a conference room to fit your 30 person legal team, but if you want 3 or so lawyers in with you, and you can afford paying each $250\\-$500 per hour, then have at it. Most lawyers would counsel you against this, as it creates an undue impression of limitless (hence likely illegal) funds. (But if you're a hedge fund manager, and you can show your money is legally earned, it's really your choice.) I have had occasion to go in to meet a client with co\\-counsel numerous times (especially in early years of practice when there is a lead attorney and second chair, so to speak, even for interrogation (which means silence by the client).\n\nThey can \"impede\" access to some extent, though they typically don't. They can play games with your lawyer and make them wait and make you wait, but not while they are in with you, and only for so long. Once your lawyer arrives they should leave you alone. (Some courts say once you ask for counsel they need to leave you alone, but this only really matters if they get a confession from you (or any evidence) before you've (and this is what they're hoping for) recant your request for counsel and your right to remain silent.)\n\n**3\\. Can my contact with counsel be proscribed in any way? E.g., can the police limit the duration or schedule of contact with counsel? Can they impede or delay access to me by someone who claims to be my counsel?**\n\nOnce you've called your lawyer, they need to to let him or her meet with you for a reasonable amount of time before questioning. This is typically a quick meeting, just long enough to make sure you will not say a word. *Even completely innocent people should keep their mouth shut \u2013 innocent people do occasionally get arrested and convicted!* \n\nNo matter what the police say, there is *no* benefit, ever, from talking to them. Some police, who know it's their last shot to get a confession and know once your lawyer gets there will never talk to you again (and they have enough to go forward without your confession in the event you just start blabbing \"you did it\" before they can get you to invoke your rights) will keep talking to you and tell you not to comment, just to listen, even while your lawyer sits outside. They can say you're being processed, or there's a security issue, any number of reasons for short delays if they need it. They will then go on and on about \"how they can maybe *help you out* if you talk now, but once your lawyer arrives all bets are off.\" These are just tricks to get you to recant/revoke your rights and to obtain your confession. You will usually see your lawyer shortly after arrival.\n\n**Can they impede or delay access to me by someone who claims to be my counsel?** Yes, if your lawyer doesn't have adequate ID or cannot verify he is licensed in that state, or in another state and with local counsel. The police do not have a duty to research your lawyer's credentials, and don't have to go online and look your attorney up in the bar directory to make it easier for him or her to get to you. However, if they know the attorney, and he or she forgot his bar card, they would probably lose the confession if you confessed while they make him go get it. Most lawyers carry their bar card in their wallet, so this is not a typical problem.\n\n**4\\. What do police have to do to facilitate my access to my desired counselor(s)? E.g., how long can I be held after requesting an attorney without being allowed to attempt to contact one?**\n\nYou have a right to contact a lawyer. There is no explicit right to a phone call, although some form of contact is implied. Hence, you can usually be held 3 hours before they have to let you \"contact\" someone, and this is after processing. You can be held until your lawyer gets there or until your arraignment, whatever comes first. If your lawyer doesn't show up, you will be given another opportunity by the court to get your lawyer of choice there for arraignment. If you can't, and you don't want to go forward, a public defender will move to waive your right to a speedy trial and seek a continuance until you can get your counsel of choice there. If this happens, consider getting a new lawyer.\n\n**What means must I be granted to find and contact the counsel of my choice?**\n\nThis actually differs depending on where you are and what you did. Again, you have a right to counsel but they can determine how you get this done. Sometimes there are local laws that say you get any number, or 3, or 1 completed phone call to reach your counsel of choice. If there is an overriding risk that you will call someone to communicate information that could put the investigation in jeopardy or would be adversely impact their evidentiary value in some way, even when these laws exist the police can refuse you direct contact with anyone and may implement a strict \"they call\" policy, where they will call the lawyer and tell them, or call your family to let them know, and they can call the lawyer. They cannot hold you for a protracted amount of time without giving you some way to get word to a lawyer; it must be reasonable. There is not a lot of law out there about what *is not* reasonable, because the police know, and for the most part accept, that once right to counsel has been invoked they are done. There is case law saying that 3 hours is reasonable. What is not reasonable? That is fact dependent.",

In this scenario, the information is used to verify the tax assessment for a particular person, so the information clearly *relates* to a data subject.\n\nThe owner for a piece of land is certainly identifiable with the help of the land registry, if one exists in the country. Similar registries might also exist with tax authorities or a postal service. Here, it is the tax authority itself doing the processing, so they probably already have tax records about the owners at the address.\n\nBut just because it's processing of personal data doesn't mean that it is illegal.\n\n* Satellite data and aerial photography providers can probably rely on a *legitimate interest* to collect, sell, or otherwise publish their data. Homeowners can reasonably expect that their property will be included in low\\-res aerial photography. It might not be necessary to notify the data subjects if an exception in Art 14(5\\) applies.\n* A public authority using aerial photography to find building code violations or to levy correct taxes may be able to base this processing activity on authorization via some law. If the public authority would have the right to inspect the buildings, then it might be possible to argue that the public authority can use aerial photography to decide which inspections/audits to prioritize. Of course, decisions producing significant legal effects must not be based on \u201cAI\u201d alone, due to the Art 22 GDPR right to not be subject to unchecked automated decision making (unless specifically authorized by a suitable law).",

The company's policy states that employees who work for \"a month\" are entitled to 7 days pay in lieu of notice. Which of the following statements is correct regarding Alex's entitlement?\n\nA) Alex is entitled to 7 days pay in lieu of notice because they worked for more than 4 weeks.\nB) Alex is not entitled to any pay in lieu of notice because they did not complete a full calendar month.\nC) Alex's entitlement depends on the specific legal definition of a month in their jurisdiction.\nD) Alex is entitled to a pro-rated amount of pay in lieu of notice based on the exact number of days worked.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the entitlement to pay in lieu of notice depends on the legal definition of a month in the specific jurisdiction. As mentioned in the example from Australia, a month is typically defined as a calendar month, not just four weeks. However, this definition can vary between jurisdictions. Therefore, to determine Alex's entitlement, one would need to know the precise legal definition of \"a month\" in the relevant jurisdiction. Options A and B make assumptions without considering potential variations in legal definitions, while option D introduces a concept (pro-rating) that wasn't mentioned in the original policy."

If that's true, it's basically impossible to fetch any external resources on a website without asking for consent first, so not even style sheets or JavaScript libraries from CDNs. Recently, a [German court even fined a website owner for using Google webfonts (German source: golem.de)](https://www.golem.de/news/landgericht-muenchen-einbindung-von-google-fonts-ist-rechtswidrig-2202-162826.html). People at my workplace where advised to host Google fonts locally because of that decision.\n\nThat being said, while I was reading about this regulation on <https://gdpr.eu/>, I noticed that the site itself uses Google webfonts without asking for user consent (see screenshot).\n\n[![Screenshot of a web page on gdpr.eu in the Firefox browser. The opened network analysis tab shows a GET request to fonts.googleapis.com](https://i.stack.imgur.com/S5jbL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/S5jbL.png)\n\nWhat I would like to know is basically:\ncould gdpr.eu be in violation of the GDPR? Or am I misunderstanding the regulation? I am honestly confused. The consent form on the site also implicitly assumes consent, which I thought [was also a violation](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28959/required-data-entry-seemingly-against-gdpr). I've read some questions about the GDPR on here and information from gdpr.eu and other websites, but it's still very unclear to me what is legal and what is not.\n\nI know that a EU regulation can be implemented and interpreted differently from country to country, and that a single court ruling in Germany doesn't even mean that the national law was correctly applied. From what I've read, I get the impression that this particular ruling was not unlikely to be overturned by a higher instance, if it came down to it. So my question probably both pertains to German law specifically and the EU regulation itself.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> As I understand it, the GDPR does not permit sending of personal information (which includes the IP address) without prior consent by the user.\n\nThat's not exactly true, consent is merely one of six possible legal basis for processing (article 6\\). For example, processing of personal data can also be lawful if it necessary to perform a contract, legally mandatory, or in the public interest.\n\nThe court decision acknowledges that but rules out another basis in this case because it considers that it is possible to serve fonts without relying on a third\\-party (*\\[\u2026] der Einsatz der Schriftarten auch m\u00f6glich ist, ohne dass eine Verbindung von Besuchern zu externen Servern hergestellt werden muss*). Confusingly, it only refers to article 6(1\\)(f) when it seems to me that (b) would also be plausible but maybe this wasn't raised during the proceedings?\n\nIf the data controller cannot invoke any other basis for the lawfulness of the processing then yes, the only thing left is asking for consent, i.e. invoking article 6(1\\)(a). But that doesn't mean that you should expect to be asked for consent each and every time your personal information is being used.\n\n> The consent form on the site also implicitly assumes consent, which I thought was also a violation.\n\nYes, implying consent doesn't really make sense under the GDPR definition (article 4, see also article 7\\):\n\n> \u2018consent\u2019 of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action\n\nEuropean data protection authorities have [issued guidelines](https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_202005_consent_en.pdf) that detail what that means and clearly reject \u201cbundling\u201d different data processing. The regulation also makes it clear that data subjects should be able to withdraw consent at any time, which does not seem possible with the fonts on golem.de\n\nMy reading of all this is that assuming consent because you are using a service (or even created an account or checked a box at some point) simply isn't valid consent. Either you don't need consent at all in the first place or what you need is freely given, specific consent and \u201cimplying\u201d consent or bundling it with a registration process achieves exactly nothing. But this is still extremely common and it might take some time before enforcement and case law definitively settle this question.\n\nSmart data controllers trying to avoid collecting consent (like Meta) have abandoned any claim that signing up to the their services would constitute consent (because that's transparently not the case) and try to bypass the issue entirely using another basis like contractual necessity. This is also being litigated.\n\n> I know that a EU regulation can be implemented and interpreted differently from country to country, and that a single court ruling in Germany doesn't even mean that the national law was correctly applied. From what I've read, I get the impression that this particular ruling was not unlikely to be overturned by a higher instance, if it came down to it. So my question probably both pertains to German law specifically and the EU regulation itself.\n\nThat sounds more like the way EU directives work. Regulations are supposed to be immediately applicable (no implementation in national law necessary) with minimal differences between countries (except when they explicitely provide for that). Of course, enforcement would still mostly be in the hands of national court systems and (in Germany) provincial data protection authorities but there are mechanisms to ensure consistency (the European Data Protection Board, prejudicial questions to the CJEU, infringement proceedings from the European Commission\u2026).",

(I live in the UK).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm pretty sure that under GDPR, you can indeed request them to send all data they have on you. If it's a complex request, they may charge you something like \u00a310\\. If they have a lot of data on you, they may list the categories of data they have and ask you to pick one, rather than them having to collect and send everything. They should respond within one month, but iirc in the UK implementation, they can inform you (within that month) that they will respond within three months instead.\n\nFor the rest, I only know current Dutch law. GDPR is not that different from what we already had (in general terms) and in many cases it even extends it. Under our law (WBP), you can also request a correction of the data in case it is incorrect, or deletion if they no longer need it for the purpose for which it was collected and stored. I don't really know how that works out in practice though, as Facebook can of course claim that \"being able to connect you to your friends when you sign up for WhatsApp or Facebook with that number\" is a legitimate purpose (in their eyes).\n\nThey might also not have your full name and therefore not be able to connect your data to your request. Or, perhaps, they have *only* your full name (and there are probably more people with your name), so they'll have a hard time verifying that it's really your data which they would be handing over or deleting. The company is required to verify your identity before acting on your request. How they implement that is up to them. Under Dutch law, if I remember correctly, any data that can be connected to your person *by any party* is personally identifiable information (PII). While Facebook might not be able to find who's behind a phone number, your carrier most certainly can. Therefore, the data falls under PII protection laws and they will have to implement a way to verify you and get you your data.\n\nFinally, whether your local laws apply to Facebook, I don't know exactly. There's lots of information on this though, so you should be able to find it. Generally, countries say that if something happened within their territory (e.g. you signed up for WhatsApp while in the UK), their law applies. Companies, I've read, will instead try to claim that their main office is in SomeCountry and therefore SomeCountry's laws apply. But I'm pretty sure you'll be able to find a Facebook office somewhere where GDPR applies, so that's probably fine.\n\nWhile not an exact answer and while I am not sure about everything, I hope this gave you some pointers to go on!",

The door seems to be well secured to a normal user and is actually a door to safe deposit vault/ stock exchange etc. The locksmith notices something unusual the Locksmith has an account (but no safe deposit) himself in the bank. Concerned the locksmith waits and see unusual activity like people who don't look like bank employees loitering around the door. He also observes that the security is so bad that it might be deliberate ignorance.\nAlso, the Locksmith is a convicted (Ex CatBurglar) so him observing and reporting this can give the wrong signal to authorities.\n\nAnother analogy to this is an ex/reformed \"Some Amateur Troll\" observed \"Some Country X Trolls\" on a \"Big Network\" but can't point fingers and also cannot approach both cause he legally cannot say \"Country X Trolls\" activities benefit \"Big Network\" and \"Big Network\" might be simply naive or maliciously ignoring such activities for their own benefit. \n\nHow does he inform stakeholders legally?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Duty of care dilemma when reporting Web vulnerabilities to both\n>  Stakeholders and Web Service owner\n\nDoes OP have any duty of care to stakeholders or the web server owner? No.\n\nOP is not obligated to inform anyone. OP didn't create the problem and isn't involved in causing it and doesn't owe any special duties to the Stakeholder and Web Service owner. He doesn't even know for sure if there is misconduct.\n\nIf OP none the less feels morally compelled to do so (he should remember the maxim that \"[no good deed goes unpunished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_good_deed_goes_unpunished)\" before doing so), he could give an anonymous tip to persons or in places that would create an opportunity to act upon it, although the tip should not in any way make it possible to identify OP.\n\n> How does he inform stakeholders legally?\n\nFrom context it seems that OP is technically sophisticated enough to know how to provide an anonymous tip, but if this is mistaken, those matters could be considered further (perhaps by someone more familiar with the tech and the industry than I am).\n\nThe tip should make clear that it is an inoffensive, helpful FYI and not a threat.\n\nSo, who does OP provide it to? \n\nThe right person might be the email of the right person to handle the issue within the Web Owner's organization (or the best available contact point if that is not clear), and the right place to inform stakeholders might be a forum or discussion board similar to Stack.SE but particular to that platform, or to the contact information of a known and prominent Stakeholder who is likely to and is likely to be able to, take action.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A former hacker discovers a potential security vulnerability in a major financial institution's online platform. Concerned about the implications but wary of his past, he wants to alert the appropriate parties. Which of the following courses of action is both legally sound and ethically responsible?\n\nA) Directly contact the financial institution's CEO with detailed information about the vulnerability and his personal background.\n\nB) Post anonymously about the vulnerability on public forums to raise awareness among stakeholders.\n\nC) Ignore the issue entirely to avoid any potential legal complications due to his past.\n\nD) Provide an anonymous tip to the institution's security team without revealing personal information or making threats.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most appropriate course of action. It allows the former hacker to alert the relevant parties about the potential security issue without exposing himself to legal risk or misinterpretation of his intentions. This approach respects the principle that he has no legal obligation to report the vulnerability, while still allowing him to act on his moral concern. The anonymity protects him from potential backlash due to his past, and by contacting the security team directly, he ensures the information reaches those best equipped to address the issue. This method also avoids the risks associated with public disclosure (option B) or the ethical dilemma of ignoring the problem entirely (option C). Option A is too risky as it exposes his identity and past, which could lead to misunderstandings or legal complications."

And not all tribes historically were friendly to each other.\n\n**Are there any rules in place that would prevent members of another tribe to settle in the reservation? If so, how do those rules mesh with federal laws of USA?**\n\n(I'm specifically talking about **formal rules**, NOT social norms where an outsider may simply be made to feel unwelcome enough that they would want to leave on their own).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Reservations aren't of or for a single tribe (meaning roughly \"ethnic group\"), they are for a particular Nation (whether or not that term is used in a specific case \\-\\- it could be \"Confederation\" or \"Band\"). In Washington state, the Yakama Nation is a confederation of people who are Klikitat, Palouse, Walla Walla, Wanapum, Wenatchee, Wishram, and Yakama; the Tulalip Tribes covers the northern Lushootseed tribes made up of the Duwamish, Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Skagit, Suiattle, Samish, and Stillaguamish. Only 2/3 of the recognized tribes have reservations. The key legal concept is not exactly being \"of a certain tribe\", it is \"being enrolled\". Ancestry relates to enrollment (and disenrollment) via individual rules about membership.\n\nFederal Indian law is encoded in [Title 25](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25). Let's just say that a question about what that title says is way to broad to ever answer. Generally speaking, there are two types of reservation land, trust land and fee land. The US government holds trust land in trust, which has various restrictions on transfer, and is exempt from taxation: transfers require higher approval (tribe, BIA). Fee land is land that the individual(s) own outright. In the case of fee land, anyone can purchase that land. The land that would be of interest for this question is trust land. The Yakama reservation, for instance, has open and closed areas, the latter being mostly trust land with use restricted to enrolled members.\n\nOn fee land located within a reservation, that does not mean that one is completely free of tribal rules. After all, off the reservation, you are still subject to the local government's land use rules (zoning restrictions, for example). The ruling of [Brendale v. Confederated Tribes, 492 U.S. 408](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/492/408/case.html) is very complex and says \"yes and no\". Tribes do *not* have authority to zone fee land on the reservation owned by non\\-members, but they do have authority to generally zone fee land on closed areas of the reservation. (Very roughly speaking, fee land is subject to general government\\-planning type restrictions on land use that we are all subject to; but there are limits on how discriminatory those rules can be. Above all, fee land is in fact owned by the individual, and a tribe cannot claw the land back, though they can buy it back).\n\nA Nation can set rules for membership which would be patently illegal in the general context of US law. In [Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/436/49/), the situation was that the rule of the Santa Clara Pueblo nation said that the children of a Pueblo woman who married outside the tribe (e.g. to a Navaho) may be denied tribal membership, but did not exclude children of a Pueblo man who married outside the tribe. The consequence is that the children of a woman lose the right to reside on that land after the mother dies (also can't vote, etc.) The short version is that SCOTUS held that this is legal. Indian nations enjoy sovereign immunity, so you can't sue them.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tribe's authority over zoning and land use on fee land within the reservation?\n\nA) The tribe has full authority to zone all fee land within the reservation, regardless of whether it's in open or closed areas.\n\nB) The tribe has no authority to zone any fee land within the reservation, as it's privately owned.\n\nC) The tribe has authority to generally zone fee land in closed areas of the reservation, but not in open areas.\n\nD) The tribe can only zone fee land owned by enrolled members of the Yakama Nation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Brendale v. Confederated Tribes case, tribes do not have authority to zone fee land on the reservation owned by non-members in open areas. However, they do have authority to generally zone fee land on closed areas of the reservation. This nuanced ruling reflects the complex nature of tribal authority over different types of land within reservation boundaries. Option C accurately captures this distinction between the tribe's zoning authority in open versus closed areas of the reservation."

The company has **not** created any internship contract/agreement yet. During the interview process, we just verbally informed me that they are going to pay me according to the local standards. When I asked about the contract, they told me that we will do it later. It's been 3 weeks now and the company hasn't shown any proactivity regarding creating a contract. \n\nMy plan is now creating the contract myself, leaving a blank space where the company can input the amount they are going to pay me. Then, I will come to my manager and tell him to read it, escalate it to the concerned parties in HR, fill the blank and sign if the company agrees. Is it my right to create such contract?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general, \"a signed piece of paper\" is not \"a contract\". It may be a record of a contract, but the contract itself is the meeting of minds where an agreement is reached and doesn't depend on the existence of the piece of paper. (Depending on the jurisdiction, some sorts of contract are required to be in writing, but this doesn't usually apply to employment contracts; it's usually contracts involving land.)\n\nWhat is far more worrying to me is that you don't know how much they are going to pay you. That suggests there hasn't been a meeting of minds, and there *is* no contract. (It *might* be that \"the going rate\" is good enough to form a contract \\- to determine that would require advice from a local lawyer.)\n\nI suggest you don't write up a formal agreement, but nag your boss to decide how much they are actually going to pay you.",

According to the documentation, a contract is formed by a \"meeting of minds\" where an agreement is reached. In this case, the fact that the student doesn't know how much they will be paid suggests that there hasn't been a clear agreement on a crucial term of employment. Without this key detail, it's unlikely that a valid contract has been formed, even verbally.\n\nOption A is not advisable, as the documentation suggests it's better to discuss the pay rate with the employer rather than drafting a contract unilaterally.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while verbal agreements can sometimes be binding, they require clear terms, which are lacking in this scenario.\n\nOption D is incorrect as employees generally have the right to request written terms of employment, especially regarding compensation.\n\nThe correct approach, as suggested in the documentation, would be for the student to follow up with their boss to establish clear terms of payment before considering any formal written agreement."

I am writing from New Zealand, but we have some similar intellectual property laws due to being member countries of the World Intellectual Property Organisation. We are also both member countries of the World Trade Organisation (WTO has the TRIPS agreement which relates to IP). So my answer may or may not be right \u2013 check what it says in France's copyright acts: you should be able to search for terms like first owner, and moral rights, films/videos, etc.\n\nThe school isn't your employer, and so the basic rule is that you as the author are automatically the first owner. Since you're not really at school to create anything or research for the school, I don't think the court would enforce a blanket term that you had to agree to that the school owns intellectual property in what you create. You probably own the copyright. \n\nYou also have moral rights in what you have created, which means even if the school does own the copyright in your work, you can request they attribute it to you if they show it in public (online). Not all works have moral rights. However, in NZ if you create a film/video you do have moral rights in it.",

Additionally, French law strongly protects authors' moral rights, which include the right to be identified as the author and to object to certain treatments of their work. The school assignment doesn't automatically transfer copyright or waive moral rights. Therefore, without explicit permission or a valid contract clause, the school would likely need the students' consent to use the videos commercially, and the students would retain both copyright ownership and moral rights."

Trademarks owned by virtue of use, rather than registration, are protected only in the market area in where actual use can be documented. Even state registration may be limited to a geographic market area in which use can be shown, and may not extend to the whole state unless use throughout the state, or at least in most major markets in the state, can be shown.\n\nAs discussed in the news story [\"Burger King Is Banned From Opening Within 20 Miles Of This Original, Mom\\-And\\-Pop Burger King Sign\"](https://www.businessinsider.com/burger-king-is-banned-from-opening-within-20-miles-of-this-original-mom-and-pop-burger-king-sign-2013-6) The owners of a small restaurant branded \"*Burger King*\" secured a state\\-level trademark on that name, but it only serves to exclude the well\\-known fast\\-food chain from a 20\\-mile circle.\n\nRemember, the prime purpose of a trademark is to identify the source of goods or services, and to prevent one supplier from benefiting by the reputation of another.

Nationwide use of \"*Pear*\" as a mark for a brand of computer would not prevent use of the same word as a mark for a brand of automobile, say, or for a restaurant chain.\n\nNote also that trademarks are normally at most national in scope.

I have recently submitted a Subject Access Request to my motor insurer, and as part of that they sent some data that the received from the [Motor Insurance Database (MID)](https://www.mib.org.uk/) and [Equifax](https://www.equifax.co.uk/). The Equifax data included policy numbers and dates over the last few years that I would have had access to at one point but to not know now, and the MID included three identifiers per row, two of which I have not seen before, and an encoded string that I am unable to decode but appears to encode data that I may have had access to. I have also used the internet, and as I understand it this involves a lot of passing around information about me between entities.\n\nWhat exactly triggers the requirement for a data controller to inform the subject under Article 14?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Simply put, Art 14 GDPR is often ignored. But also, it triggers less often than some might think.\n\nWhile Art 14 applies whenever the data controller processes personal data that weren't obtained (directly) from the data subject (see Art 14(1\\)), there are a bunch of exceptions to the notification obligation, such as Art 14(5\\)(a): no notification is necessary if the data subject already has the information in the Art 14 privacy notice.\n\nFor example, your motor insurer likely fulfilled its transparency obligations under Art 14 together with its Art 13 transparency obligations by providing a privacy notice when you signed up to your service, and making updated versions available subsequently. While a privacy notice must be \u201cprovided\u201d, it is not required to force you to actually read and comprehend this document. And it is not necessarily required to specifically notify you about Art 14 processing if you were already provided this information in a privacy notice.\n\nHowever, \u201cproviding\u201d the information implies a more active approach than merely making the privacy notice easily available on a website. The [ICO says](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/the-right-to-be-informed/when-should-we-provide-privacy-information/#when3) that data controllers \u201cmust proactively make individuals aware of this information and \\[\u2026] need to give them an easy way to access it\u201d.\n\nThe lack of notification from the MID or from Equifax must be viewed critically, but it could technically be that they are compliant if you were notified about their privacy notices by the data sources.\n\nSo this approach would be clearly compliant:\n\n* You open a bank account.\n* The bank provides its own privacy notice per Art 13 GDPR.\n* The bank sends data to Equifax.\n* Equifax notifies you about their processing per Art 14 GDPR.\n\nBut so would this:\n\n* You open a bank account.\n* The bank provides its own privacy notice per Art 13 GDPR.\n* The bank notifies you about Equifax' processing per Art 14 GDPR.\n* The bank sends data to Equifax, noting that they've already notified you.\n\nThere are of course some exceptions in Art 14(5\\), in particular that notification can be skipped if it would entail \u201cdisproportionate effort\u201d. There was a high\\-profile case about this [in Poland](https://uodo.gov.pl/en/553/1009):\n\n* A data controller had collected data from public registries, affecting an estimated 6 million data subjects. The data included contact information such as addresses, phone numbers, emails.\n* The data controller did notify those people for which they had an email address (about 90\u2009000 people, about 1\\.5%).\n* The data controller did not notify other data subjects, citing high costs for sending letters.\n* The Polish UODO (corresponds to the UK ICO) found that this wasn't disproportionate effort, and that the data controller failed to meet its Art 14 obligations.\n* If I remember correctly, the data controller decided to destroy the collected data instead of sending out notifications.\n\nA roughly similar UK case was the [ICO's 7\\.5M GBP fine against Clearview](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2022/05/ico-fines-facial-recognition-database-company-clearview-ai-inc/), though there the breach of transparency obligations was just one of many problems.",

The ICO states that controllers must proactively make individuals aware of the information.\n\nC) This is the most compliant approach. While it may be costly, the Polish case shows that financial cost alone is not considered a \"disproportionate effort\" when it comes to notifying data subjects. Sending postal notifications to all affected individuals ensures full compliance with Article 14.\n\nD) While this would indeed avoid the notification requirement, it's an extreme measure that prevents the company from using the data for its intended purpose. It's not a practical solution for most businesses.\n\nThe correct answer, C, aligns with the GDPR's emphasis on transparency and the data subject's right to be informed, as demonstrated by the Polish UODO case."

The policy would be discriminatory if it only targeted mosques, but extending it to all places of worship doesn't necessarily make it legal.

I imagine at least one person in the department will try to tell me that I can't do that, so I'd like to know before I try. By the way, I am at a public university in Michigan where we have the Open Meetings Act. I am not sure this law applies but here is a link:\n\n[https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl\\-act\\-267\\-of\\-1976\\.pdf](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-act-267-of-1976.pdf)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Mich. Comp.

The core prohibition is \u00a7539c, which says\n\n> Any person who is present or who is not present during a private\n> conversation and who wilfully uses any device to eavesdrop upon the\n> conversation without the consent of all parties thereto, or who\n> knowingly aids, employs or procures another person to do the same in\n> violation of this section, is guilty of a felony\n\nAn open faculty meeting is by law not a private conversation (however, a closed meeting is). Per the Open Meetings Act, \"the faculty\" constitute a public body\n(a state \"committee, subcommittee, authority, or council\", empowered by the constitution and statute to perform a governmental function). \u00a715\\.263 directly says \"yes you may\":\n\n> All meetings of a public body shall be open to the public and shall be\n> held in a place available to the general public.

One unsatisfactory remedy would be to sue the university for resulting damages, which would put university counsel in the position of having to defend the university's actions (i.e. what the employees did). It is possible that there already exists an official university document regarding the public meetings act which would resolve the matter. Or, the university attorney's office *might* provide instructive guidance, but it is equally likely that they will refuse to respond if the request does not come from the department chair or other empowered administrator, such as the dean. Unfortunately it is not a statutory slam\\-dunk that a faculty meeting is a meeting of a public body. Case law has centered around the Board of Regents, who do nothing but run the university, and I can't find any case law addressing the matter of the faculty being a \"public body\".

The Act states that \"All persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting except as otherwise provided in this act.

I may be wrong but I think I would need to change both my UK and Italian IDs to be allowed to change the info on my C permit.\n\nUK dual citizenships require the other citizenship to have the name and gender changed before changing it on the UK passport, so I need to change my Italian ID card first. Doing it abroad seems easy so that won't be an issue.\n\nI'm not even 100% sure how to proceed to change an Italian ID card as I can barely find any info online on the steps required. But from the little I found, it seems like I need to go to court in Italy, and then pay a lawyer and a fee to change my name and gender. It doesn't seem like there are any dual citizenship limitations like the UK has. I should mention that I can't speak Italian very well too.\n\n**Is there an easier way? Do I really need to do all this?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [switzerland](/questions/tagged/switzerland \"show questions tagged 'switzerland'\")\n\nYou may [change your civil status information](https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/fr/home/gesellschaft/zivilstand/faq/geschlechtsaenderung.html) as recorded by Switzerland as long as you are domiciled in Switzerland and your information is recorded in the Swiss civil status database.\n\nYour information is automatically registered in the Swiss civil database if you had a civil status event in Switzerland (birth, marriage, divorce, adoption). Otherwise, you have to apply to have your information registered first. The registration may need your civil status documents, i.e. birth certificates and documents related to marriages, divorces, changes in names, (translated, notarized and legalized if needed) and proof of your residency in Switzerland.\n\nYour name and gender, for civil purposes in Switzerland, then become what is recorded in the database. A certificate of your registered information can be issued.\n\nDespite the change in your official name and sex marker in Switzerland, your residence permit will have the same information as recorded in your passport (probably the Italian one, if you are exercising your rights as an EU citizen) on the front side, so the machine readable zones are consistent and facilitate border examinations. However, your official name in the Swiss registeration database may be reflected on the back in the observation field (see e.g. [Geneva](https://www.ge.ch/actualite/changement-pratique-matiere-saisie-noms-autorisations-sejour-etablissement-30-09-2021)).\n\nHaving mismatching names and gender markers on different offical documents of course may come with problems; but as far as Swiss authorities are concerned, you have the right to make changes to your civil information according to Swiss law as a Swiss resident.\n\nAdditionally, difficulties can still arise since the changes are new and it is not unheard of that an employee may ignore (deliberately or ignorantly) federal guidelines, especially if you present a more \"complicated\" case. You may find helpful to contact your local trans\\* or LGBTQ\\+ organizations who often have social and legal contacts that may help you navigate through the bureaucracy.",

We walk along the public road to get to the park, hike the trails, and return home via a wash (dry riverbed) that runs behind the park back towards the main road. We, and several other neighborhood residents, have been doing this for years.\n\nRecently we had an encounter with a nearby resident claiming that we were trespassing on private property as were walking through the wash. We checked the property records, and indeed, there are two parcels of private land through which we were crossing to get back on the main road. Both parcels are vacant, unmarked, not fenced, and not owned by any of the nearby residents.\n\nI'm not overly concerned with this person's claims as we aren't entering their property, but yesterday we found two posted signs in the wash at the park boundary stating: *Private property. No public access.* The signs were apparently installed by the county and seem legitimate with county seal and all. My question is, do these signs constitute reasonable notice (as described below) since they were not posted by the private landowners?\n\n[Arizona Revised Statute 13\\-1502](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/01502.htm) states (emphasis mine):\n\n> 13\\-1502\\. Criminal trespass in the third degree; classification\n> \n> \n> A. A person commits criminal trespass in the third degree by:\n> \n> \n> 1. Knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully on any real property after a reasonable request to leave by a law enforcement officer, the owner or any other person having lawful control over such property, or **reasonable notice prohibiting entry**.\n> 2. Knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully on the right\\-of\\-way for tracks, or the storage or switching yards or rolling stock of a railroad company.\n> \n> \n> B. Pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, a request to leave by a law enforcement officer acting at the request of the owner of the property or any other person having lawful control over the property has the same legal effect as a request made by the property owner or other person having lawful control of the property.\n> \n> \n> C. Criminal trespass in the third degree is a class 3 misdemeanor.\n\nThe words on the sign are clear enough, but can the county speak for the owner of the vacant lots who, as far as I'm aware, don't know or care about what's going on? Is there any room to interpret the sign as simply a park boundary leaving the owners of the adjacent property to post their own \"no trespassing\" signs as they feel necessary (or not)?\n\nFollow\\-up question: If the sign does constitute an enforceable, *reasonable notice*, would the private property owner(s) have to get involved for trespassing charges to be filed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The county can certainly post a sign on the edge of the county property, informing people that what lies beyond is private property, and no permission to pass has been granted. Unless this was endorsed by the property owner or the owner's agent, I don't think this would constitute the \"reasonable notice\" mentioned in 13\\-1502 A 1 (quoted above) needed to make entry count as criminal trespass. If the property owner authorizes the county to post notices, that is of course different.\n\nI don't see how the county can be considered a \"person having lawful control over such property\" but the law does not say that \"reasonable notice\" must be given by an owner or owner's agent, indeed it does not say who may or may not give such notice. I wonder if there is caselaw on the point.\n\nSince the law makes a request from a law enforcement officer, who could be acting with no authorization from the owner, one of the possible conditions for criminal trespass, I don't see that the owner would need to participate in a trespass action.",

The county-posted signs may serve as informational notices to park visitors, but they likely do not meet the \"reasonable notice\" requirement for criminal trespass as defined in Arizona Revised Statute 13-1502. This is because the signs were not posted by the property owners or their authorized agents. While the statute does not explicitly state who must provide the notice, it's generally understood that such notice should come from the property owner or someone with lawful control over the property. The county, in this case, does not have lawful control over the private lots. Therefore, while the signs provide information, they probably do not carry the legal weight required to make entry a criminal trespass without further involvement or authorization from the property owners."

Location: California\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no California law requiring you to have a license to make things. Building power lifting racks is not a regulated business so there are no specific certification or licensing requirements (there are, though, general requirements to be licensed, imposed on all businesses, and city hall is your first stop for that). However, you might be liable for damages if the device is constructed negligently. For example, if you solder the joints, and someone is consequently injured, you could be held liable since you didn't exercise ordinary care in making the product. The [jury instructions](https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/1200/1221/) for negligence will give you a basic summary of how negligence would be judged, and [this](http://trialattorneysofamerica.com/documents/primer2012.pdf) is a more detail analysis of product liability law. However, sports injuries are in the realm of things where the would\\-be plaintiff assumes some risk, so your error would have to be grossly negligent or reckless (I think soldered joints would do it).",

According to the documentation, there is no specific California law requiring a license to manufacture powerlifting racks, and it's not a regulated business requiring special certification. However, the maker could still be held liable for damages if the device is constructed negligently. The concept of \"ordinary care\" is important, and if the construction falls below this standard (e.g., using inappropriate materials or techniques), the manufacturer could be found negligent. While sports injuries involve some assumed risk, gross negligence or recklessness in construction could still lead to liability.

There will be an estate sale of the majority of his possessions at the end of February, the soonest we could get everything arranged. This will extend into the month of March by a week.\n\nMy uncle had sent the February rent check in early January, post\\-dated for February. When the landlord learned of his death, he deposited the check; he agrees that the apartment is paid through the end of February. However, he wants a new security deposit and a month's rent for the time we will use it in March, claiming that the sale process makes us new tenants.\n\n**What are the legal rights and legal obligations of an estate in a month\\-to\\-month rental situation?** The estate is just starting the probate process, and I am unclear on whether the landlord is a \"traditional\" creditor or in a unique situation since the money he is owed for rent continues to accrue after death.\n\nAll parties agree that there will be a new, unrelated tenant starting April 1st. We're just trying to figure out what everybody's legal obligations are in this situation. The situational specifics are only important insofar as I don't know what paperwork I'm entitled to from the landlord, and whether I should be directing the landlord entirely to the probate court instead of trying to work things out with him.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> However, he wants a new security deposit and a month's rent for the\n>  time we will use it in March, claiming that the sale process makes us\n>  new tenants.\n> \n> \n> What are the legal rights and legal obligations of an estate in a\n>  month\\-to\\-month rental situation? The estate is just starting the\n>  probate process, and I am unclear on whether the landlord is a\n>  \"traditional\" creditor or in a unique situation since the money he is\n>  owed for rent continues to accrue after death.\n\nThe decedent's security deposit, less valid deductions, is property of the estate, so if the landlord takes a second security deposit he is double dipping.\n\nGenerally speaking, after someone dies, money judgments that have not been reduced to judgment liens, and unsecured debts (i.e. debts not supported by collateral) only have a right to be paid via submission of a claim to the probate estate in the probate process with claims made paid according to a priority schedule set forth in the probate code.\n\nBut, generally speaking, death does not impair the property rights of third parties, so the fact that a debtor's estate is in probate is usually not a basis upon which a foreclosure or repossession of collateral for a default on a secured debt, or an eviction due to the termination of a lease, may be postponed while the probate case runs its course. Probate does not have the equivalent of the \"automatic stay\" in bankruptcy that prevents any creditors, secured or unsecured, from engaging in any collection activity against an estate, and probate estates are not allowed to file for bankruptcy either.\n\nIf you really wanted to play hardball and only needed the apartment for a few days in March, the estate could simply continue to occupy it for that period of time and they pay the landlord the extra month's rent but not the additional security deposit when it was done. The landlord can't begin a foreclosure proceeding until there is a default which can't happen sooner than the last day of February. Even if the landlord is really on his toes, the landlord will be hard pressed to get a notice to vacate served on the estate and then to prepare and serve an eviction lawsuit on the estate and get that case in front of a judge before the estate will be ready to move out anyway. The estate might incur some attorneys' fees in the process if it did that, but the attorneys' fees would be an unsecured claim of the landlord that would have to be collected through the claims process in the probate proceeding which is usually a fairly favorable forum for the estate, instead of the usual court where small landlord\\-tenant disputes are handled. The probate estate could simply deny his claim for attorneys' fees and then, if the landlord wanted them after making a claim, the landlord would have to bring a lawsuit on fairly tight deadlines in the probate court to have the disallowance of the claim overturned.\n\nIf you wanted to be even more aggressive, rather than paying the last month's rent, the estate could just holdover into March without paying rent or a new security deposit (vacating before the eviction process can run its course), effectively forcing the landlord to use the security deposit for March rent, and then forcing the landlord to use the probate claims process for both damages to the property claimed and for an attorneys' fees. If the estate is insolvent, or if the claim wasn't filed by the landlord (who may not even know that it is necessary to file a claim in probate) within the short deadline for probate claims arising after death, those expenses just wouldn't get paid at all.",

The estate can continue to occupy the apartment for a short period into the next month without immediately paying additional rent or security deposit. This is because:\n\n1. The eviction process takes time, and the landlord cannot begin proceedings until there's a default, which wouldn't occur until the end of the paid month.\n2. The original security deposit is considered property of the estate, so the landlord cannot demand a new one without releasing the first.\n3. If the estate only needs the apartment for a few days into the next month, they could occupy it during that time and deal with any potential consequences through the probate process, which often favors the estate.\n4. The landlord would have to file any claims for additional rent or damages through the probate court, which has specific deadlines and procedures that could delay or complicate the landlord's ability to collect.\n\nThis approach, while potentially aggressive, reflects the legal realities of the situation and the protections afforded to the estate during the probate process."

Thus Eve may use the minimum necessary force to help Alice as *Nothilfe*, which is defined as using [\u00a732 StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__32.html) (Self protection/Notwehr) and [\u00a734 StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__34.html) (justifying state of emergency/Rechtfertigender Notstand). As a result, it is allowed to harm someone to the degree of self protection for the benefit of someone else that can't protect themselves \\- such as Alice. However, the amount of force allowed must be proportional to the harm done to Alice \\- so Eve may use the *least* needed amount of force to get Bob from stopping Eve from helping Alice.\n\nAs an example, Eve might shove Bob out of the way, hit him, or use the threat of serious harm (which is usually illegal!) to deter Bob from getting in the way, but unless Alice is actually at risk of dying from Bob keeping her from applying pressure on a lacerated artery this very moment, she can't shoot at Bob \\- that would overstep the Notwehr, but might not be punished if the overstepping is for the right reasons defined in [\u00a733 StGB.](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__33.html)\n\nBob *also* is liable for not rendering aid, [\u00a7323c StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__323c.html) *unterlassene Hilfeleistung/Behinderung von hilfeleistenden Personen* (Failure to provide assistance/hindering persons providing assistance).",

It's not clear whether there is actually any winner selected or not. (Even when names *are* published, like \"Jane D. from Minnesota,\" they're often unverifiably vague). \n\nIt seems that no individual, not even an entrant, would have standing to take action because nobody can prove they specifically would have won, nor can anybody prove that there was no winner, because of the sponsor's ability to limit access to information. It also seems like there is no regulator whose job it is to follow up on those things, who actually cares (because the harms to any individual are relatively low, and there are higher\\-priority issues). \n\nAt first glance, running a sweepstakes with no actual winner seems unethical, but from a **practical** perspective, what if any negative legal consequences could such a sponsor **actually** face for doing so, and how would that **practically** come about? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Every state has a regulatory framework called laws and regulators called county and state attorneys. (Some states have special legal bodies specifically for gambling). There are specific laws concerning sweepstakes, raffles, real gambling (if allowed), horse racing, senior citizen's bingo parlors, you name it. \n\nRunning any game of chance with no intent of showing or awarding winner has legal consequences called fraud, at very least.

According to the documentation, state and county attorneys have the authority to investigate and prosecute cases of potential fraud in sweepstakes. Every state has laws governing sweepstakes and games of chance, and running a promotion without awarding a prize could be considered fraud. State and county attorneys can investigate such cases when brought to their attention, and decide whether to prosecute based on the evidence.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the legality of the sweepstakes is not determined by the prize value, but by whether it's conducted fairly and as advertised.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because while federal agencies might have some oversight, state and local authorities play a crucial role in regulating and enforcing sweepstakes laws.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because individual participants generally wouldn't have standing to sue, as they can't prove they specifically would have won.

CT Ravikumar: Who are you asking the question to?\n> \n> \n> Adv: To the \\#SupremeCourt\n> \n> \n> J. Shah: You cannot ask us questions. You can say 'I ask myself'. That's okay. Only we have that prerogative \\- to put questions to you.\n\nAs seen in the responses below, to the general public, this comes across as highhandedness.\n\nLet's assume the lawyer is a newcomer still getting used to the system. What I'd like to know:\n\n1. Would judges in the courts of developed countries like USA, UK, France, Germany, etc. give similar instructions in their own courts? Or is this phenomenon, let's say, \"uniquely Indian\"?\n2. If so, what would be the reason a lawyer can't ask a judge questions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question should not include France and Germany, and should be limited to common law jurisdictions that are similar to India, because the function of judges differs starkly between adversarial vs. inquisitorial systems.\n\nThe adversarial model pits two parties against each other, with the judge serving as the decider (of law, and perhaps of fact). The parties can offer witnesses, who can be compelled to respond to questions, and the attorney asking the question gets to control the question asked (subject to a possible objection by the other party, to be ruled on by the judge).\n\nThe judge can rule on requests (which are not questions) i.e. petitions by either party. Otherwise, the judge sits there more or less mute, soaking up the argumentation being presented. Appellate proceedings are somewhat special in that the justices may address questions to the attorney, in order to better understand the logic of the proffered argument. The burden is on the attorney to make the case. There is *no* direct burden on the justice to \"make a case\". The \"court of public opinion\" may be relevant in a jurisdiction where the justice is an elected office or is appointed for limited time. Or, the contrary opinion of a higher court may have some influence on a justice's rulings \u2013 this is not the case with a Supreme Court.\n\nIn other words, it would be highly dysfunctional within the adversarial system for a party to be allowed to interrogate a judge. Formal petitions are allowed, as long as you follow proper form.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In an adversarial legal system, why are lawyers generally not allowed to directly question judges during court proceedings?\n\nA) To maintain the hierarchical structure of the courtroom\nB) To preserve the impartiality and neutrality of the judge\nC) To ensure the judge has time to hear all arguments\nD) To prevent lawyers from manipulating judicial decisions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In an adversarial legal system, lawyers are generally not allowed to directly question judges during court proceedings to preserve the impartiality and neutrality of the judge. This is fundamental to the adversarial model where the judge serves as an impartial decider of law and fact.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while there is a hierarchical structure in the courtroom, this is not the primary reason for prohibiting direct questioning of judges.\n\nOption C is not the main reason; while time management is important, it's not the core rationale behind this practice.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it implies a negative motive on the part of lawyers, which is not the basis for this rule.\n\nThe adversarial system is designed to have two parties present their arguments, with the judge remaining neutral. Allowing lawyers to question judges could compromise this neutrality and potentially influence the judge's decision-making process, which goes against the principles of fair and impartial justice."

Consider the following cases, assuming no other applicable signage:\n\nCase 1 \\- Right on red\n======================\n\n[![Right turn on red](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2uAXX.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2uAXX.png)\n\nHere, the person U\\-turning has a green light, while the person right\\-turning has a red light. I believe in this case, the U\\-turning person has right of way because the vehicle turning right [should come to a full stop](http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/driver/handbook/section2.6.3.shtml) before proceeding, but am not sure.\n\nCase 2 \\- Right green arrow\n===========================\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9Iir.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9Iir.png)\n\nIn this case the U\\-turning vehicle has [advance green light](http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/driver/handbook/section3.2.5.shtml), allowing left, right, and straight directions (don't know about U\\-turn). The right turning vehicle has a green right arrow.\n\nI am most looking for answers for Ontario, Canada, but would accept answers for other jurisdictions with similar traffic laws (at least where they don't outright ban U\\-turns at intersections).\n\n*Note: The Ontario driver's handbook, and applicable laws don't seem to mention U\\-turns much. In particular, it's not explicit that U\\-turns are even allowed at intersections, but they seem to be according to [this Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/2jagd8/are_uturns_at_a_green_light_legal_if_there_are_no/), and according to the no U\\-turn signs present at some intersections.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: U\\-turns are prohibited in certain circumstances ([*Highway Traffic Act*](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90h08#BK230) Paragraph 143\\). It does not say that U\\-turns are prohibited at intersections controlled by traffic lights. By the principle of *[expressio unius est exclusio alterius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation#Canons)*, U\\-turns at intersections controlled by traffic lights are generally allowed.\n\nHowever, in determining fault for insurance purposes in Ontario,\n\n> The driver of automobile \u201cA\u201d is 100 per cent at fault and the driver of automobile \u201cB\u201d is not at fault for an incident that occurs, \\[...] when automobile \u201cA\u201d is making a U\\-turn \\[...] ([*Insurance Act*](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/900668) Paragraph 19\\.)",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Ontario, Canada, at a traffic light-controlled intersection where U-turns are not explicitly prohibited, a vehicle making a U-turn on a green light collides with a vehicle making a right turn on a red light. According to Ontario traffic laws and insurance regulations, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The U-turning vehicle has the right of way, and the right-turning vehicle is 100% at fault for the collision.\n\nB) The right-turning vehicle has the right of way, and the U-turning vehicle is 100% at fault for the collision.\n\nC) Both drivers share equal fault for the collision, as neither had a clear right of way.\n\nD) The U-turning vehicle likely has the right of way, but for insurance purposes, it would be considered 100% at fault for the collision.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to Ontario's Highway Traffic Act, U-turns are not explicitly prohibited at intersections controlled by traffic lights unless otherwise signed. The U-turning vehicle likely has the right of way over a vehicle turning right on a red light, as the latter must come to a full stop before proceeding. However, Ontario's Insurance Act states that for insurance purposes, a vehicle making a U-turn is considered 100% at fault in the event of a collision. This creates a situation where the U-turning vehicle may have the legal right of way, but would still be deemed at fault for insurance claims."

For example, are there laws on how soon you can return back to US as a tourist?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Be very cautious about this! It depends on whether your visa is \"single entry\" or \"multiple entry\".\n\nFrom the [US State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-expiration-date.html):\n\n> Depending on your nationality, visas can be issued from a single entry\n> (application) up to multiple/unlimited entries.\n\nIf you have a single entry visa and leave the US for Canada, you will NOT be allowed to renter the US from Candada. You'll have to return to your home country and apply for a new US visa.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tourist from India is visiting the United States on a single-entry visa. They are considering a day trip to Niagara Falls on the Canadian side. Which of the following statements is correct regarding their ability to re-enter the United States after visiting Canada?\n\nA) They can freely re-enter the US as long as their visa hasn't expired.\nB) They need to apply for a Canadian visa but can return to the US without issues.\nC) They will not be allowed to re-enter the US and must return to India to apply for a new US visa.\nD) They can re-enter the US if they stay in Canada for less than 24 hours.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question specifies that the tourist has a single-entry visa. According to the US State Department information provided, a single-entry visa becomes invalid once the holder leaves the United States. In this scenario, by crossing into Canada, even for a day trip, the tourist would invalidate their US visa. They would not be allowed to re-enter the US from Canada and would need to return to their home country (India) to apply for a new US visa. This situation highlights the importance of understanding visa restrictions and entry requirements when planning international travel, especially for short trips to neighboring countries."
