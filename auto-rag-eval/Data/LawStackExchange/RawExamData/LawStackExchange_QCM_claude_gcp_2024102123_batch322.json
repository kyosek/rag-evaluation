            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is my question, based on a hypothetical scenario:\n\nLet's assume that I start spreading a smear campaign against vaccines (which would be ethically and morally wrong to do) using Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks using bots and other automated systems. If enough people start believing in the fake news I am spreading then they might stop giving vaccines to their children the end result of which might be something really bad like a malaria or measles epidemic, in which 1000's of kids might die in multiple states.\n\nSo will I be blamed for spreading false Information and would this not be protected under the 1st amendment and I could also argue that it's the fault of the parents who accepted opinion posts (framed as news stories), rather than consulting with actual physicians?\n\nThe above scenario was just a hypothetical question. What are the implications of spreading fake news legally?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on who the news is being spread about and how you do it. If the person or persons (including a company) are not publically known or not generally known to the general public prior to the news spread, Libel/Slander is easier to prove. However, if the targeted person is a \"public entity\" it can be harder to prove.\n\nEven then, the burden of proof is not on you to prove that the statement is true, but them to prove it is untrue. In addition, if you are a \"public entity\" you must prove that there was actual malice behind the reporting OR that you knew it was false and did not then stop reporting it. Additionally, you must prove that this false reporting lead to damages to you and associations (though this is the easy part).\n\nA good number of quality journalists will use attribution of potentially false statements (for an organization that has such a terrible relationship with the President, CNN has a lot of sources \"Close to the President\") or that some people are saying (on Wikipedia, this gets a great big \\[who?] if an editor sees this in an article. In 24\\-hour news \\[who?] tends to be \"A guy on one of our prime time shows, which everyone knows is entirely fictitious\" or the people ready to debate the topic on actual news shows again, they are making opinion statements, not factual ones... or they are making factual statements when they say \"I believe...\" or \"In my opinion...\").\n\nFinally, several states with big media production industries (New York and California) have what's called Anti\\-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) laws. This allows the defendant (respondant? It's a civil lawsuit) to challenge the entire suit on the grounds that the person suing is doing so to get you to shut up about an issue and not because of any meritorious libel or slander accusation. This requires the judge to decide if the case has merit and if it doesn't drop it entirely.\n\nAnd finally, in the United States, we also have Anti\\-Libel Tourism laws. This means that we will not extradite anyone (citizen or not) to a country on any Libel/Slander charges UNLESS those same charges can be won in a US court. This both protects political refugees AND stops people from filing Libel Suits in the UK to get around how respondent friendly the United States courts are on the subject (The UK is more plaintiff friendly).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a case of spreading false information about vaccines on social media platforms, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences in the United States?\n\nA) The person spreading the false information would automatically be held liable for any resulting health crises, as freedom of speech does not protect deliberate misinformation.\n\nB) The person spreading the false information would be protected under the First Amendment, regardless of the consequences, as long as they frame their posts as opinions.\n\nC) The person spreading the false information could potentially face legal action, but the burden of proof would be on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that the information was false and caused harm, especially if the spreader is not a public figure.\n\nD) Anti-SLAPP laws would automatically protect the person spreading false information from any legal consequences, as long as they claim they were participating in public debate.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate based on the information provided. In the United States, spreading false information could potentially lead to legal action, but there are several factors to consider:\n\n1. The burden of proof is on the plaintiffs to prove that the information is false and caused harm.\n2. If the person spreading the information is not a public figure, it may be easier for plaintiffs to prove libel or slander.\n3. For public figures or entities, plaintiffs must prove actual malice or that the spreader knew the information was false and continued to spread it.\n4. Damages must be proven as a result of the false information.\n\nWhile freedom of speech offers some protection, it does not unconditionally protect all forms of speech, especially when harm can be demonstrated. Anti-SLAPP laws provide some protection against frivolous lawsuits but do not automatically shield all instances of spreading false information. Framing posts as opinions may offer some protection, but it's not an absolute defense, especially if presented as factual news."

Why they are claiming they are owner ?\n2. Is there any legal action i can take against him ?\n\nHere is the part of email :\n\nContinuing support from Company\\_Name, We suggest you to not to do any kind of\nchanges using the domain cpanel \\& ftp login details. Let us inform you that after\nreleasing the credentials, if any issues like\\- Website Hacking, Errors and Major Virus\nissues, DNS Updation, Data misuse, Running of wrong functionality on website or\nany kind of negative changes happens in the website using the domain cpanel \\&\nftp login details, Then Company\\_Name will not responsible for that, Also if such kind of\nthings happens and if you want us to resolve the issues then there will be possibility\nthat it will be done on ADDON basis and depends case to case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The email quoted does not say anything about domain ownership. It says that if you use the hosting hosting company's tools to modify the contents of the web site, you might cause problems, and if that happens, the web design company Company\\_Name will not be responsible. Further it says that if that happens, and you want Company\\_Name to fix the problem, there will be an additional charge.\n\nAs to ownership, the web design firm will own the copyright on the web code that they wrote, unless your contract specifies that you will own it from the start (work made for hire) or that they will transfer it to you (assignment), perhaps after you pay for it. If you supplied any documents for them to place on the site, the copyright to those will remain unchanged, Company\\_Name will not get ownership of such copyrights. \n\n(Note that, in the US at least, \"work made for hire\" **can** apply to a contract job, but only if the contract explicitly says so. I don't know if that is true under the law of India.) \n\nAs to ownership of the domain, that will depend **entirely** on the language in the contract that you signed with Company\\_Name. If you paid for the domain registration, it is reasonable for you to own the domain, but the contract will control.\n\nThe quoted email implies that you have been given the passwords to the cpanel and ftp accesses to the site, which would allow you to change anything on the site, or engage a different firm to make future changes. This would typically imply that you had \"ownership\" of the site, but again, everything depends on the wording of your contract with Company\\_Name. \n\nNote that ownership of the copyright to the web code used, ownership of the copyright to other content displayed on the web, ownership of the domain, and ownership of the site (i.e. the right to make and control changes to it), are all separate, and it would be possible for each of these to rest in a separate entity. It would be common for the design firm to retain ownership of the web code, and license it to the client. ownership of the domain and the site would be more likely to go to the client, but the design firm could retain all or any of these, if that was the agreement. Any not owned by the site owner would need to be licensed so that the site owner could use them. Such a license might be permanent, or might expire after some period.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A client hires a web design firm to build a website. After completion, the firm sends an email about transferring ownership. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the ownership and rights of the website components?\n\nA) The web design firm automatically owns all aspects of the website, including the domain, content, and code.\n\nB) The client automatically owns all aspects of the website once they've paid for the service.\n\nC) Ownership of different components (domain, code, content) can vary and depends on the specific contract between the client and the firm.\n\nD) The email transfer of credentials implies full ownership transfer to the client, regardless of the contract terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because ownership of different components of a website can indeed vary and ultimately depends on the specific contract between the client and the web design firm. The documentation clearly states that:\n\n1. The web design firm typically owns the copyright to the web code they wrote, unless the contract specifies otherwise (work made for hire or assignment).\n2. The client retains copyright to any documents they supplied for the site.\n3. Domain ownership depends entirely on the language in the contract.\n4. Site control (ability to make changes) is separate from ownership of various components.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the firm doesn't automatically own all aspects, especially content provided by the client. Option B is incorrect because payment doesn't automatically confer all ownership rights; it depends on the contract. Option D is incorrect because the transfer of credentials doesn't necessarily imply full ownership transfer, as copyright and other ownership aspects are separate from mere access to the site."

[Publisher uploaded chapters 1\\-3](http://emond.ca/downloads/ILCB-01.pdf).\n\n> As the foregoing account makes clear, the civil law system has a long and historical evo\\-lution on the European continent. It has been shaped by Roman law more than English \n>  common law was. It also differs from the common law in that judges play a more active role \n>  in the judicial process (such as in the questioning of witnesses and marshalling of evi\\-dence), in what is referred to as an **inquisitorial system**. `Further, the interpretation of civil \n>  codes is more influenced by legal scholars than by judges.` \n> \n> \n> **inquisitorial system**  \n> \n>  a feature of civil law \n>  proceedings whereby \n>  trial judges actively \n>  assist lawyers in present\\-ing their cases and are \n>  free to call and question \n>  witnesses and to order \n>  investigations into other \n>  evidentiary matters; \n>  contrasts with the \n>  adversarial system used \n>  in common law courts\n\nI know that Continental Law judges [\"works within a framework established by a comprehensive, codified set of laws\"](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html). But how does this absence of official *stare decisis* explain the grey sentence overhead? \n<https://imgur.com/ZEKyLhx> may help. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First off, let me confirm that this text accurately describes the reality.\n\nSecond, this is less far afield from the common law than you would think. If you are in a jurisdiction without any binding case law on a particular point, a so called \"question of first impression\", you then turn to persuasive authority.\n\nPersuasive authority includes case law that is binding in some other jurisdiction and legal scholarship, often in the form of a treatise or commentary. And, it is much easier to find an answer in a treatise which is carefully arranged on a subject matter basis, than to do case law research from other jurisdictions. This is particularly true when you have not devoted a lot of time to learning how to find the needle of the law you want in the haystack of the mountain of decided cases on all available subject. \n\nThe very difficult task of case law research was only possible on more than an isolated hit or miss basis at all in common law systems where case law matters in the years before the 1980s when computerized case law word searching started to become possible at an affordable to lawyers price, because a lot of full time institutional actors devote a great deal of time and money to developing and maintaining tools like digests, citation indexes, and annotations to statutes to allow practitioners to locate that case law.\n\nIf court decisions don't serve as binding precedents, those institutions aren't developed. For example, in common law countries, until very recently, there were no good resources for locating trial court decisions and rulings in state courts which handle the bulk of litigation, but whose rulings are not binding precedents. (Electronic record keeping in trial courts has changed the economics of this practice and made it much more common to publish trial court decisions and to index them appropriately.)\n\nSo, if persuasive authority in your legal system in the form of non\\-binding case law is hard to find because it wasn't worth the money for the legal system to collectively develop the resources to publish and index it on a systematic basis for an audience of pretty much the entire legal profession, the other form of persuasive authority, legal treatises, becomes much more influential by default.\n\nYou see something similar in very early legal opinion writing by American judges before the institutions necessary to systemically utilize case law precedents was developed. Judges were constantly citing treatises like Blackstone, which is something they rarely do now, because that was what was on their bookshelf.\n\nFurther, there are feedback effects. Smart people who wish to influence the law for society without going the legislative route in common law countries will often seek careers as judges. But, absent the psychic perk of influencing the law and making a difference in society, a lot of the most ambitious people in the judiciary in a common law system will choose instead to go the route of academia and seek to become law professors where they can have a similar influence, while earning similar pay and having more time off and freedom to pursue your own personal and professional interests.\n\nSo, in systems where legal precedents aren't binding, people who might otherwise be inclined to write probing legal opinions that develop legal concepts are less inclined to become judges, and the people who do become judges care more about getting the right result and less about explaining their decisions in a way that will influence future judges in the same circumstances.\n\nFinally, consider that many civil law legal systems involve countries with a lot less appellate litigation than the United States (currently 330 million people with more than 200 years of case law), or the UK (currently 60 million people with about 1000 years of case law), or India (more than 1 billion people with a couple of centuries of case law, since colonial precedents have relevance).\n\nSuppose that you live in Denmark or Belgium or Portugal or Costa Rica or South Korea, where your population is much lower and your time frame during which your legal system has been in place is not as long.\n\nIn a situation like that, half a dozen or a dozen leading legal scholars can publish treatises over ten or twenty years that are going to cover, somewhere, the lion's share of the pressing issues in the legal system, and there is probably only one law school in the entire country, so it is quite likely that most of the lawyers in the entire country took contracts or property or family law from the the same people in law school, which makes them predisposed to consider a treatise written by that professor a credible one in that area of law. And, all other sources are a comparative vacuum.\n\nIf you are a judge, why cite non\\-binding precedents from your fellow non\\-specialist judge in a country that simply has no precedents in many areas of law and has fewer carefully reasoned ones, when you could instead look for guidance from the person who taught you this area of law in the first place and literally \"wrote the book\" and who was probably consulted by the government in any recent amendments to relevant civil code or statute of broad general applicability. And, once you start out using those methods, it becomes habitual and legal treatises become very influential.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In civil law systems, legal scholars tend to have more influence on the interpretation of civil codes than judges do. Which of the following best explains this phenomenon?\n\nA) Civil law judges are not as well-educated as legal scholars and therefore defer to their expertise.\n\nB) The absence of binding precedents (stare decisis) in civil law systems leads to a greater reliance on comprehensive legal treatises written by scholars.\n\nC) Civil law countries have larger populations, resulting in more diverse legal opinions that require scholarly interpretation.\n\nD) Judges in civil law systems are prohibited from interpreting the law and must strictly adhere to the civil code as written.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In civil law systems, the absence of binding precedents (stare decisis) leads to a greater reliance on comprehensive legal treatises written by scholars. This is because:\n\n1. Without a system of binding precedents, there is less emphasis on case law research and more focus on codified laws.\n\n2. Legal treatises written by scholars provide a systematic and subject-matter-based approach to understanding and interpreting the law, which is more accessible than searching through non-binding case decisions.\n\n3. In many civil law countries, especially smaller ones, there may be fewer court decisions to refer to, making scholarly works more valuable as a source of legal interpretation.\n\n4. The lack of a strong precedent system means that ambitious legal minds may be more likely to pursue careers in academia rather than the judiciary, further strengthening the influence of legal scholars.\n\n5. Judges in civil law systems may find it more efficient and credible to refer to well-regarded legal treatises, especially if those treatises were written by the same professors who taught them in law school.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's not a matter of education, but rather the structure of the legal system. Option C is incorrect because many civil law countries actually have smaller populations than common law countries like the US or India. Option D is incorrect because while civil law judges work within a codified framework, they are not prohibited from interpreting the law."

However, in this particular case you need to take a preliminary step regardless of your jurisdiction, which I assume is somewhere in the U.S. *Prior to* filing any complaint (and I will repeat this below), it is in your best interest that you demand a retraction *and* removal of the defamatory falsehood. Be sure to show the prospective defendant(s) some proof that supports your pre\\-suit demand.\n\nYou need to secure your ability to prove in court that you made that demand. For that reason, your requests should be in writing (email, and certified mail if practicable). If it is not by email, you should have the addressee at least sign a receipt copy of your demand letter.\n\nA demand of retraction is prerequisite in jurisdictions such as Texas and Florida. If you \\[or your lawyer] omit that step, the court will easily dismiss your complaint altogether. In other jurisdictions, such as Michigan, the request of retraction is a requirement only if you intend to pursue *exemplary and punitive damages*. See [MCL 600\\.2911(2\\)(b)](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(tk433kjllzeh4ksykna5zsqf))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-600-2911). Regardless of the jurisdiction, your request or demand to each prospective defendant needs to be made *prior to* filing the corresponding complaint/pleadings in court.\n\nEven if your jurisdiction does not have that prerequisite, failing to request a retraction and removal of the defamatory falsehoods would allow the defendant to justify itself and/or obtain leniency on the basis that it was not aware that the registry information turned out to be disproved/inaccurate.\n\nIn your complaint(s), you will pursue *injunctive relief* that consists of ordering the removal \\[from each website or post] of the defamatory falsehoods. It is also reasonable for you to also ask for monetary relief.\n\nYou certainly have a claim of *defamation per se*, but a ruling granting you an award of *substantive damages* is doubtful unless the defendant refuses \\-\\-or neglects\\-\\- to remove the inaccurate records. If the website owners/authors promptly remove the false records, it is going to be difficult or impossible to prove *actual malice*: that is, that they published the falsehoods (1\\) despite knowing them to be false, or (2\\) with reckless disregard of their truth.\n\nWithout the ability to prove *actual malice* or that you suffered *special damages* (whether it is a loss of employment or other economic damages), the court would only grant you *nominal damages*, which is the negligible amount of one dollar.\n\nLastly, beware that even the granting of injunctive relief might be ineffective. I \\[vaguely] recall a case where federal court ordered a removal from sex offender registry, but apparently the defendant ignored the order. I have no idea how much the plaintiff's lawyer charged him for the futile representation, but the last time I checked neither the problem was fixed nor did it appear that the attorney pushed any further to ensure compliance with the order. I will not disclose the name of the lawyer, since that would facilitate the unintended consequence of identifying the defamed plaintiff.",

Before taking legal action, what is the most crucial step John should take?\n\nA) Immediately file a defamation lawsuit against the websites\nB) Contact law enforcement to have the websites shut down\nC) Demand a retraction and removal of the false information from each website in writing\nD) Publicly announce his removal from the registry on social media\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most crucial step John should take is to demand a retraction and removal of the false information from each website in writing (option C). This step is important for several reasons:\n\n1. In some jurisdictions, such as Texas and Florida, demanding a retraction is a legal prerequisite before filing a defamation lawsuit. Failure to do so could result in the case being dismissed.\n\n2. Even in jurisdictions where it's not required, demanding a retraction provides evidence that John attempted to resolve the issue before resorting to legal action. This can strengthen his case if he does need to file a lawsuit later.\n\n3. It gives the websites an opportunity to correct the information without the need for legal proceedings, potentially resolving the issue more quickly and with less expense.\n\n4. If the websites refuse to remove the information after being notified, it could help establish \"actual malice\" in a potential defamation case.\n\n5. The demand should be made in writing (email or certified mail) to create a record of the communication.\n\nOption A is incorrect because filing a lawsuit immediately without first requesting a retraction could weaken John's case and may even result in dismissal in some jurisdictions. Option B is inappropriate as law enforcement doesn't have the authority to shut down websites for this type of issue. Option D, while it might inform some people, does not address the legal issue with the websites and doesn't create any official record of John attempting to correct the false information."

Even though the Agreement of Sale includes a clause suggesting the buyers opted not to obtain an inspection \"at this time,\" this doesn't necessarily mean they waived their right to an inspection entirely. The key factor is when the inspection contingency option expires according to the contract.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because sellers are not obligated to comply with all buyer demands, even if made before closing. They have the right to negotiate or refuse.\n\nAnswer B is overly simplistic. While the clause suggests the buyers initially declined an inspection, it doesn't definitively preclude them from requesting one later, depending on the contract's specific terms and timelines.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because opting not to obtain an inspection \"at this time\" doesn't necessarily mean the buyers have permanently forfeited their right to an inspection. The contract's specific language and timelines would determine this.\n\nThe most accurate response acknowledges that the seller's obligations depend on the contract's specific terms regarding the inspection contingency period, which is why C is the correct answer."

Lord Mansfield CJ held in [*Holman v Johnson*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holman_v_Johnson) (1775\\) 1 Cowp 341:\n\n> The principle of public policy is this; *ex dolo malo non oritur actio*. No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act. If, from the plaintiff's own standing or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise *ex turpi causa*, or the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted.\n\nSuppose that A continues to manage company B while disqualified, by arranging for (and signing on behalf of) B to borrow money from C. If C sues B to recover the loan, can B argue that it is not bound by the contract because it was illegal for A to sign on B's behalf?\n\nDoes the answer depend on whether B \"allowed\" A to illegally act on its behalf (for example, because A was the sole director and shareholder)? Would it be different if there were other directors who tried to stop A from purporting to act on behalf of B?\n\nDoes the answer depend on whether C knew that A was disqualified from managing corporations? What if C knew about, or turned a blind eye to, B's internal management problems because C stood to earn a high interest rate?\n\nWhat if the loan was in the other direction? If B sued C to recover a loan, could C refuse to pay because A was disqualified from lending B's money in the first place? Would it matter whether C was aware of A's disqualification?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Suppose that A continues to manage company B while disqualified, by\n> arranging for (and signing on behalf of) B to borrow money from C. If\n> C sues B to recover the loan, can B argue that it is not bound by the\n> contract because it was illegal for A to sign on B's behalf?\n\nThe fact that the person who signed a contract couldn't legally have authority to execute the contract on behalf of a company doesn't mean it is an \"illegal contract\".\n\nWhether a contract is illegal or not goes to the subject\\-matter of the agreement, not to the means by which it is entered into.\n\nA contract on an otherwise valid subject\\-matter is not invalid *on the grounds of illegality* merely because the circumstances under which the contract was entered into were irregular or illegal, whether the problem with the entering into the contract was duress, abuse of a confidential relationship, minority, lack of authority to do so within the company, failure to memorialize the contract in writing when it is required by law, or what have you.\n\nUnless there is clear statutory direction to the contrary in Australian law, the analysis here would be the same as the analysis under the common law of agency that applies in any circumstance where someone purports to enter into a contract on behalf of a principle (such as a company) without the legal right to do so.\n\nThis rule is that the company is bound if the person had \"apparent authority\" to enter into the contract on behalf of the company and the connection between the company and the person claiming to act on its behalf was not totally made up (i.e. that the company had done something that contributed to the appearance that someone who was in some way connected to the company has the authority to take action on its behalf by not being clear enough with the outside world about who has authority to do what).\n\nSo, absent clear statutory authority to the contrary, the company would be bound by the contract vis\\-a\\-vis the third\\-party on the other side of the contract (assuming that the counterpart to the contract didn't actually know that the person they were dealing with was disqualified), even though the person entering into the contract didn't have \"actual authority\" to do so, because that person was prohibited under the Australian Company Law from exercising that kind of authority.\n\nThe company could still sue the disqualified person who entered into the contract for any harm suffered by the company as a result of the disqualified person's failure to disclose to the counterparty in the contract that the disqualified person didn't have the authority to enter into the contract. But that would be it and would only be available if the company actually did suffer economic harm from being wrongfully bond by the contract.\n\nThe disqualified person could also be criminally prosecuted for entering into the contract.\n\nNow, some kinds of improperly entered into contracts aren't subject to a rule as unyielding or harsh as the apparent authority rule, and I wouldn't be shocked if Australian courts chose to deviate from the apparent authority rule in this particular case.\n\nFor example, another possible analogy would be a case where a minor enters into an executory contract (i.e. one that is not fully performed by both parties contemporaneously when it is entered into like a purchase of goods at a retail store), that is not for \"necessities\", rather than under the agent without authority to act under internal corporate allocation of responsibility to employees analogy.\n\nIn the contract by a minor case, the contract improperly entered into by the minor is not automatically void *ab initio*, but it is \"voidable\" by the minor. In other words, the contract could be undone, or there could be a defense to a lawsuit to enforce the contract, if the minor, properly represented by a guardian, wanted to do so.\n\nContracts entered into under duress, through fraud in the inducement, and as an abuse of a confidential relationship, for example, are similarly not \"void *ab intio*\", but are \"voidable\" in the same way as a contract entered into by a minor who did not have the capacity to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, if some random third\\-party in an act of outright fraud, who has no connection to the company, purports to sign a contract on behalf of the company, that contract is void *ab initio* and has absolutely no force or effect. This is treated legally as if the purported contract formation never happened and can't be enforced by either party to the contract.\n\nI don't have access to Australian legal authorities sufficient to determine definitively if this situation under this particular Australian statute is governed by the apparent authority rule of agency law, or by the voidable contract rule that applies to other contracts with legal subject\\-matters which are entered into improperly. But, the basic legal theories involved and the main possible legal conclusions are ubiquitous for how the common law of contracts and agency handles this situation in all common law countries where statutes don't expressly provide otherwise.\n\n> Does the answer depend on whether B \"allowed\" A to illegally act on\n> its behalf (for example, because A was the sole director and\n> shareholder)? Would it be different if there were other directors who\n> tried to stop A from purporting to act on behalf of B?\n\nSomewhat. If B allowed A to illegal act on its behalf, it would probably be governed by the apparent authority rule. And, if other directors tried to prevent this in a way that wasn't effectual to advise C of A's disqualification, that probably wouldn't matter in lawsuits vis\\-a\\-vis C.\n\n> Does the answer depend on whether C knew that A was disqualified from\n> managing corporations? What if C knew about, or turned a blind eye to,\n> B's internal management problems because C stood to earn a high\n> interest rate?\n\nYes, this matters. If C knew that A was disqualified or was on inquiry notice due to suspicious circumstances that he might be disqualified and ignored those circumstances, the contract would be void or voidable.\n\n> What if the loan was in the other direction? If B sued C to recover a\n> loan, could C refuse to pay because A was disqualified from lending\n> B's money in the first place? Would it matter whether C was aware of\n> A's disqualification?\n\nGenerally speaking if C agreed to pay the loan, the fact that A was disqualified wouldn't matter. If C was aware of A's disqualification, B might have a right to bring a lawsuit against both A and C for fraud or conspiracy to commit fraud, in addition to the right to bring a lawsuit for breach of contract or unjust enrichment for failing to repay the loan, which might conceivably provide B with addition relief or remedies (e.g. it might impact thee way that the debt was treated in a bankruptcy if C went bankrupt).",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Company X, managed by disqualified director A, enters into a high-interest loan agreement with Lender Y. A signs the contract on behalf of X, despite being disqualified under Section 206B of the Australian Corporations Act. Lender Y suspects A might not have proper authority but proceeds with the loan due to the attractive interest rate. If X defaults and Y sues to recover the loan, which of the following is most likely to be the legal outcome?\n\nA) The contract is automatically void due to A's disqualification, and Y cannot recover the loan.\n\nB) The contract is voidable at X's discretion, allowing X to choose whether to honor or void the agreement.\n\nC) The contract is enforceable against X under the apparent authority doctrine, but X can sue A for damages.\n\nD) The contract is unenforceable due to Y's willful blindness to A's potential lack of authority.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In this scenario, the apparent authority doctrine is likely to apply. Even though A was disqualified from managing the corporation, they appeared to have the authority to enter into the contract on behalf of X. Y's suspicion alone, without concrete knowledge of A's disqualification, is not enough to void the contract.\n\nThe apparent authority rule generally holds that a company is bound by contracts made by those who appear to have authority, even if they lack actual authority. This protects third parties who deal with the company in good faith.\n\nWhile the contract would likely be enforceable against X, the company could potentially sue A for any damages resulting from A's unauthorized actions. Additionally, A could face criminal prosecution for violating their disqualification.\n\nOption A is incorrect because A's disqualification alone doesn't automatically void the contract. Option B is less likely in this corporate context compared to situations like contracts with minors. Option D goes too far; mere suspicion without clear knowledge doesn't typically rise to the level of willful blindness that would void the contract."

The users have set up a crowdfunding campaign to finance their legal action. SocialConnect's management decides to remove all links to this crowdfunding campaign from their platform. Which of the following best explains the legal justification for SocialConnect's actions?\n\nA) SocialConnect is exercising its First Amendment right to control the content on its platform.\nB) SocialConnect is fulfilling its fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of its shareholders.\nC) SocialConnect is complying with a court order to remove the fundraising links.\nD) SocialConnect is protecting its users from potentially fraudulent fundraising activities.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. The management's decision to remove links to the crowdfunding campaign can be justified by their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company's shareholders. By removing these links, they are potentially limiting the funding available for a lawsuit against the company, which could result in financial losses regardless of the outcome. This action aligns with the principle that company directors have a duty to protect the company's interests and, by extension, the interests of its shareholders.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while platforms do have some control over their content, this specific action is more about protecting the company's interests than exercising free speech.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there's no mention of a court order in the given information. The company is acting on advice from its legal team, not a court mandate.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there's no indication that the fundraising is fraudulent. The company's primary motivation is to protect its own interests, not to protect users from fraud."

While most games on Steam have ESRB ratings, some not (such as Valve's own Dota 2\\).\n\nIs this considered legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, it is legal.\n-----------------\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board):\n\n> The ESRB ratings system is enforced via the voluntary leverage of the North American video game and retail industries for physical releases; most stores require customers to present photo identification when purchasing games carrying the ESRB's highest age ratings, and do not stock games which have not been rated. Additionally, major console manufacturers will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings, while console manufacturers and most stores will refuse to stock games that the ESRB has rated as being appropriate for adults only.\n\n\"Ennforcement\" is done by the market; it is harder to sell games without ratings. In Valve's case, there is little incentive to rate their games, because they control the entire distribution system. The only reason for a rating would be that some customers may choose not to purchase or play games without ratings; apparently, these customers make up a small enough fraction of the market that Valve is not concerned.\n\nIn fact, it is unconstitutional to require ratings, or at least to restrict sale based on ratings.

The ESRB rating system is not legally mandated (ruling out option A), but it is widely adopted due to industry practices. Major console manufacturers require ESRB ratings for games on their platforms, and most retailers choose not to stock unrated games.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while digital platforms like Steam have more flexibility, the ESRB system still applies to both physical and digital releases. The lack of ratings on some Steam games is a choice by the platform, not a limitation of the ESRB system.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association actually ruled against government-mandated restrictions on game sales based on ratings, affirming that such restrictions would be unconstitutional.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it overstates the legal status of ESRB ratings, which are voluntary and not enforced by government agencies."

I also understand that similar international treaties and other pacts will be cited in the U.S. in, for example, the following format:\n\n> \u201cTreaty title, Parties (if applicable), date of signature, treaty source designation, optional treaty source \\| pinpoint reference (date of entry into force and optional information).\u201c \u2014 <https://guides.library.ubc.ca/legalcitation/intlaw>\n\nA cite, according to my research in the matter, would, for example, look like this:\n\n> Convention on Great Lakes Fisheries, United States and Canada, 10 September 1954, Can TS 1955 No 19, 6 UST 2836 (entered into force 11 October 1955\\).\n\nHow would the international treaty of, say, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights look like in a U.S. complaint or elsewhere wherever it may be deemed binding law?\n\nAre there any case laws that specifically outrule that U.S. courts be bound by the legal cornerstones of the UDHR? Any for the opposite?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not self\\-executing and may not be applied in U.S. courts as binding law. *See, e.g.*, Barbara Macgrady, Note, Resort to International Human Rights Law in Challenging Conditions in U.S. Immigration Detention Centers, 23 BROOK. J. INT'L L. 271, 300 (1997\\) (\"Since Congress has made its intent clear \\[by adopting NSE\ndeclarations], it is certain that the courts will not enforce these treaties in a domestic action.\"). *See also* this [1999 Yale Law Review Article](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1099&context=yjil).\n\nSometimes these treaties and declarations are cited by parties in litigation, but these are always losing arguments. These arguments are made to encourage diplomatic pressure and generate PR, not to convince U.S. judges to rule in their favor.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the U.S. takes the minority position that an ordinary domestic statute that conflicts with an earlier adopted Senate ratified treaty overrides the earlier adopted Senate ratified treaty. Almost no other country in the world takes this extreme position. *See generally* [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-2/section-2/clause-2/treaties-as-law-of-the-land) (general background on treaties as U.S. law).\n\nThe [citation form for Article 3 this document](https://law.gwu.libguides.com/humanrights/tips) under the prevailing \"Bluebook\" standard is\n\n> Universal Declaration of Human Rights, G.A.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am not asking for legal advice, just curious about the law. To illustrate the question I think it's best to use a specific example.\n\nA friend of mine responded to an ad on craiglists for shared housing. It was agreed upon, one of the roommates would be the acting landlord (rent would be paid to him and he would be responsible for the up keep of the house). No paper work was signed. A week after everyone moved in, the actual land lord (the owner of the house), has everyone co\\-sign a lease.\n\nIs it legal for the landlord to request the tenants sign a lease a week after moving in and if it is, could the landlord evict if a tenant refuses to sign? What if only the one tenant who had said he would be acting as the landlord had already signed it, but the actual owner wants everyone to sign now? If relevant, I'm talking about one lease with everyone's names on it (not individual leases). \n\nI understand if someone rents and moves in before signing the lease, the landlord can kick them out if they don't agree to the lease, but I'm wondering if different if they've already lived there a week? \n\nThis is assuming none except the \"acting landlord\" had signed any lease (though the verbal agreement was only the acting landlord would have to). \n\nThis is for B.C. Canada.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To begin, it is always legal to request the signing of a contractual arrangement in this type of circumstance; however, it is not your duty to assent to this so long as the original tenant had the right to sublet or take on roommates. Without having signed the new lease, you (all the new tenants not on the lease) would just be tenants\\-at\\-will. This occurs when an occupant has rented a premises without a lease but pays rent at a set interval (typically monthly). The agreement for a Tenancy\\-at\\-Will may be either written or verbal. Just because a rental agreement is in writing does not make it a lease. \n\nEither the landlord or tenant may terminate this arrangement by giving written notice 30 days or one full rental period in advance, whichever is longer. In a situation where you rented from a renter, I would want to have the assent of the landlord, as no reason is required to terminate by either party. This should be done in writing either by certified mail or have the landlord sign it, if you are presenting it in person. If rent is paid the first of each month, notice should be given prior to the first day of the month. \n\nMany landlords are fond of tenancies\\-at\\-will because they maintain the ability to terminate a rental at any time with only a month's notice, without needing a reason. This is their prerogative for even petty reasons (e.g., they don't like your friends, or the hours you keep). This is especially true with a roommate situation, where the original lessee has a lease and is subletting rooms, because the lessor has someone on the hook for a time certain (the original lessee), but if the roommates get annoying for whatever reason to either the landlord or the lessee, you can be given a 30 day notice for a great many reasons that a lease cannot control and are not viable reasons to evict. A lease is for a duration certain, after which, the renter would either move, sign another lease, or in the case where they stayed on past the end date and continued to pay (and landlord continued to accept) rent, it would just become a tenancy\\-at\\-will. \n\nIn many ways a lease protects the renter just as much as it does the landlord, because moving is expensive and (except in very limited circumstances) the renter is guaranteed being able to keep the rental until the lease ends, so long as they pay rent and do not violate the lease or local statute(s), which would subject them to eviction. This would be beneficial in a roommate situation as it takes the power to give notice or evict away from the original lessee who sublet the rooms. \n\nIt is important to understand that just because there is a writing does not necessarily mean it is a lease. Many landlords who don't want the time constraint of a lease still like to affirm in writing basic issues like date of rent due, pets, etc. It is just cleaner than a verbal agreement. \n\nSo, in your hypothetical, the landlord could ask the new renters to (co)sign a new lease, join the existing lease, or just sign a rental agreement as a Tenant\\-at\\-Will, even though the tenancy has already begun. The renter is not obligated to sign any writing at this point. However, if the renter refuses and if the landlord insists, the landlord would likely exercise their right to terminate by serving a 30 day notice to quit. Having already taken possession, you would also be in a good position to negotiate the terms, which could be to your benefit, so it is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nRegarding eviction, that would only be an option to the landlord if you failed to vacate *if* a 30 day notice to quit was issued and you didn't move (or of course, as with any renter, if actions that would always allow the landlord the right to seek eviction occur, like failure to pay rent). I would not be concerned about showing you have a right to be there as you likely had to pay rent to move in and your check is proof that the tenancy began, and other things like having a key, etc., support your position if it ever came to that and you had paid cash. If you do ever pay cash, get a receipt.\n\nIf, hypothetically, the new renters sign a lease, I would want to make sure it is for the room and not the whole so that liability (at least for rent) is limited if others default.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In British Columbia, Canada, a group of roommates moved into a shared house based on a verbal agreement with one roommate acting as the \"acting landlord\". A week later, the actual property owner asks everyone to sign a lease. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation of the non-signing roommates?\n\nA) They are legally obligated to sign the new lease or face immediate eviction.\nB) They are considered trespassers and have no legal right to stay in the property.\nC) They are tenants-at-will and can be given a 30-day notice to quit if they refuse to sign.\nD) They have the same rights as lease-holding tenants and cannot be asked to leave for at least one year.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The non-signing roommates are considered tenants-at-will. They have a legal right to occupy the property based on their verbal agreement and the fact that they've moved in and presumably paid rent. However, they don't have the protections of a formal lease. The landlord can request that they sign a lease, but cannot force them to do so. If the tenants refuse to sign, the landlord has the right to end the tenancy by providing a 30-day notice to quit. This notice period is required before the landlord can initiate eviction proceedings if the tenants don't leave voluntarily. Options A and B are incorrect because the tenants have established occupancy rights. Option D is incorrect because without a lease, they don't have guaranteed long-term tenancy rights."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As I understand it assault can include the implied threat of using physical force against an individual, such as looming over someone, to compel them to do something. I believe many US states also have related laws about harassment, menacing, etc.\n\nHowever, the job of security personnel seems to be primarily to discourage activities by being present as deterrent against such crimes. Their mere presence is not a threat or assault of course, but if they are attempting to deter someone from acting in negative manner the security personnel would likely have to get close to the person and make demands that they leave or stop whatever activity their engaged in in a manner that could be considered a threat of force if they don't comply.\n\nTo go with a particular difficult example think of a bouncer at a bar. More then most security personnel a bouncers job is practically defined by their ability to loom. My father owned a bar, and as he described it to me a good bouncer should be identifying someone who's likely to cause an incident and basically pre\\-emptively start looming nearby them to remind the inebriated fellow that the bouncer is ready to use physical force if necessary in hopes of preventing a situation from occurring. Likewise breaking up a minor fight often involves a good amount of getting between the two fighting and looking menacing enough that no one want's to try to go around you. Basically you *want* your bouncer to be able to menace people when a situation is escalating because it's a far safer way of preventing the escalation then allowing it to degreed to violence.\n\nIs a bouncer, or other security individual, guilty of assault or related crime when they do something like this? Does the fact that they are employed by a business with the explicit task of keeping the peace give them any extra leeway with such actions? Is the fact that they are trying to prevent/discourage other crimes give them more leeway?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The above is not quite accurate. \n\nFirst, assault. The correct [definition](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/assault_and_battery) is \"a threat or physical act that creates a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact.\" Therefore, no attempt at a battery is necessary. Rather, simply making someone subjectively believe that you are about to commit a battery against them is enough for an assault charge. Please note the following [two points](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/assault). One, that apprehension does not mean fear. Apprehension means that the victim has to believe that the actor's conduct will result in imminent harmful or offensive contact. Two, it's not necessary that the victim believes such conduct will actually be effective \\- rather, he only has to believe the conduct is \"capable\" of making the contact. \n\nI can't tell if by \"other security personnel\" you mean, in addition to bouncers, say, security at concerts or if you mean private security guards, such as ones who guard warehouses or other businesses. \n\nNonetheless, for the warehouse/business \"guards,\" they do not have a special privilege above or beyond what any random person may do. That is, you may use force to the extent you reasonably believe necessary to prevent a felony, riot, or serious breach of the peace. You may use deadly force only if it appears reasonably necessary to prevent a \"dangerous felony\" involving risk to human life, including, for example, robbery, arson, burglary. \n\n[However,](http://law.jrank.org/pages/1687/Police-Private-Police-Industrial-Security-Legal-authority.html) if the private security personnel are operating under authority vested to them by local ordinance or the state legislature, then their rights (and also any attendant restrictions, such as those provided to citizens under the Fourth Amendment) would apply instead. \n\nSo where's [the difference](https://nationalparalegal.edu/public_documents/courseware_asp_files/criminalLaw/defenses/UseofForce.asp)? It comes about at the standard a situation must meet to allow use of deadly force. A police officer can use deadly force to effectuate an arrest based on a reasonable belief that a suspect has committed a felony involving the risk of physical harm or death to others (murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, rape or burglary) or if there is substantial risk that the suspect was dangerous to the point that he may cause serious physical harm or death to someone if the arrest were delayed.\n\nOn the other hand, as a private citizen, you may only use deadly force when attempting to effectuate an arrest if the suspect did indeed commit such a felony. Police can base their action on a reasonable belief and even if that belief is wrong, they will be safe from prosecution. A private citizen actually must be right about the suspect having committed the requisite crime. No matter how reasonable the belief was of a private citizen regarding a suspect, if that suspect did not actually commit the crime, the private citizen who used such force will be subject to prosecution. \n\n[Bouncers](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/what-are-bouncers-legally-allowed-to-do.html) are afforded no more rights than private citizens. They can issue verbal warnings, ask a patron to leave the establishment, check identification, refuse entry, call the cops, protect bystanders from violence, break up fights, and respond with equal force if necessary. They may not strike an individual with a punch or kick, push or physically toss someone out of the establishment, restrain them using chokeholds or other submission techniques, or use weapons or pepper spray.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A bouncer at a nightclub notices a patron becoming increasingly aggressive and confrontational with other customers. The bouncer approaches the patron, stands close to him with arms crossed, and says in a stern voice, \"You need to calm down or leave immediately.\" The patron feels intimidated but doesn't leave. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the bouncer's actions?\n\nA) The bouncer has committed assault because he created a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful contact.\nB) The bouncer's actions are legally justified because he has special privileges as a security professional.\nC) The bouncer's actions are legally acceptable as they fall within the scope of his duties to maintain order.\nD) The bouncer has committed harassment but not assault, as there was no physical contact.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The bouncer's actions fall within the scope of his duties to maintain order in the establishment. While he created an intimidating presence, he did not explicitly threaten violence or make physical contact. Bouncers are allowed to issue verbal warnings and ask patrons to leave, which is what this bouncer effectively did. The action doesn't rise to the level of assault, as there was no clear threat of imminent harmful contact, just a stern warning. While bouncers don't have special legal privileges beyond those of private citizens, they are allowed to take reasonable actions to maintain order and safety in their workplace. Option A is incorrect because the bouncer's actions likely don't meet the threshold for assault. B is wrong because bouncers don't have special legal privileges. D is incorrect because this situation doesn't meet the legal definition of harassment, and the absence of physical contact doesn't preclude assault charges if there had been a clear threat."

The majority will typically sign a single \"per curiam\" decision, which constitutes the judicial precedent (and hence law) on the question decided.\n\nBut judges who disagree with the majority opinion will often author dissenting opinions or statements which are published along with the majority opinion. What significance, if any, do these dissents have for purposes of law?\n\nFor example, I was just reading [a filing with SCOTUS requesting an emergency stay of a Pennsylvanian Supreme Court decision](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/LWV_v_PA_Emergency-Application-for-Stay-SCOTUS-final.pdf). The filing includes not only the majority state court *per curiam* in question (ref A1\\), but also several dissenting statements from that court in that case (ref A5\\-). Do those have any more weight before the SCOTUS than any other writing or argument that may be filed in support of the appellants' arguments?\n\nOr, do dissents have any sort of intermediate authority \u2013 less than precedent, but more than any other argument would have solely on its merits \u2013 in terms of informing future legal decisions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The decision of a court consists of several things:\n\n* The orders made\n* A summary of the evidence\n* The judge's reasoning from the evidence to their conclusions of what the facts of the case are\n* The judge's reasoning from the evidence to their conclusions of what the law applying to those facts is\n* The judge's reasoning from those findings of facts and law to the orders that were made ([ratio decidendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_decidendi))\n* Reasoning on how things might have been decided otherwise (or the same way) if the facts or the law were different ([obiter dicta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obiter_dictum)).\n\nWe hope that the judge is articulate enough that we can tell which is which.\n\nWhere there is more than one judge there is more than one opinion. However, there is still [ratio decidendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_decidendi) and [obiter dicta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obiter_dictum) across all the opinions. Typically, a dissenting judge disagrees with the [ratio decidendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_decidendi) in whole or part and his reasoning about that is [obiter dicta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obiter_dictum).\n\nThe [ratio decidendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_decidendi) \u2013 \"the point in a case that determines the judgement\" or \"the principle that the case establishes\" \u2013 creates binding precedent. The [obiter dicta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obiter_dictum) creates persuasive precedent.\n\nA binding precedent is just that \u2013 it binds the decisions of lower ranked courts in the hierarchy. If the facts of the current case match the facts of the precedent then the judge must follow the precedent even if they disagree with it \u2013 indeed there are many decisions where the judge expresses their disagreement with the precedent in no uncertain terms. \n\nIn addition, there can be conflicting precedent, for example, where the High Court of Australia has made a decision on a piece of legislation that conflicts with a decision of the Supreme Court of NSW on an essentially similar provision in a different Act. A wise judge in such a situation should do what McDougal J did in [Chase Oyster Bar v Hamo Industries \\[2010] NSWCA 190](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2010/190.html?context=1;query=security%20of%20payment;mask_path=au/cases/nsw/NSWCA) and issue orders referring it to a court that can overturn one (or both) of the precedents.\n\nA persuasive precedent can influence the decisions of other courts \u2013 they are an authority a judge can look to in formulating their reasons but they are free to consider and reject them even if the facts match. [Obiter dicta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obiter_dictum) from same level or higher courts in the hierarchy is persuasive precedent as is [ratio decidendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_decidendi) and [obiter dicta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obiter_dictum) from same level courts *and* courts in other jurisdictions.",

That said, the police of the host nation are allowed to ticket the offender. However, there's little they can do to enforce the fines against the ambassador after the ticket is written. That said, most police will still write them as some nation's foreign services offices do actually make the diplomats pay the tickets (in fact, an unofficial barometer of corruption in a nation's government is how likely diplomats are to pay their tickets.).\n\nThat said, committing a serious crime while under diplomatic immunity is a major international incident. The receiving country will perceive the crime as an endorsement of the sending nation. The most immediate remedy is the sending nation waives Diplomatic immunity, at which point the receiving nation can prosecute.\n\nThere are times where this doesn't happen (often the sending nation and recieving nation punish the crime differently) at which point one of three things will happen. Either the sending nation will recall the diplomat (effectively removing them from their job) and punish them based on their own laws, if any exist.\n\nIf that is not done, the receiving nation can declare the diplomat as *Persona non Grata* (lit. Unwelcomed Person) which is effectively a person specific ban on entry into the country (the sending nation can send whoever they want to be a diplomat... but that specific person cannot enter the receiving country.). As such, the diplomat who is named PNG is given some amount of time to leave the receiving country or have their diplomatic immunity revoked. It's the international equivalent of \"You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.\"\n\nIf neither of those work, than the receiving nation can cut off diplomatic ties, and in some cases has a good cause for war over the matter (A diplomat who Murders the citizen of a host nation and isn't recalled or has their immunity waived has just committed an assassination's sanctioned by the sending nation, which is a justification for war.).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A diplomat from Country A is accused of sexual harassment in Country B. Both countries are not permanent members of the UN Security Council, do not have nuclear capabilities, and do not share borders. Country B wants to prosecute the diplomat. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial course of action for Country B?\n\nA) Immediately arrest and prosecute the diplomat, ignoring diplomatic immunity\nB) Request that Country A waive the diplomat's immunity\nC) Declare war on Country A\nD) Unilaterally revoke the diplomat's immunity and proceed with prosecution\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because it violates the principles of diplomatic immunity established by the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. \nB) is the correct answer because it respects diplomatic protocols while seeking a resolution. Requesting a waiver of immunity is the appropriate first step in such situations.\nC) is an extreme overreaction and not justified based on the information provided. War is typically a last resort in international relations.\nD) is incorrect because the host country (Country B) cannot unilaterally revoke diplomatic immunity. This would violate international law and diplomatic norms.\n\nIf Country A refuses to waive immunity, Country B could then consider other options such as declaring the diplomat persona non grata or, in extreme cases, severing diplomatic ties. However, the initial and most appropriate step is to request a waiver of immunity from the sending country."

The wills looked real because they emulated the\n> will forms that had been used by the Navy.\n> \n> \n> The wills that the fraudster made disinherited relatives and left\n> everything to various charities. He claimed to have discovered these\n> \u201clost\" wills\u201d and approached the charities. He was then able to charge\n> them a hefty percentage fee from the estate as a finders fee.\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Who administers the will of someone who dies intestate, who has no\nfamily?\n2. Other than the administrator, who else did he need to convince the\nwill was genuine?\n3. By what credible set of occurrences could have have led him to\n\u2018find\u2019 the \u2018lost\u2019 will as a non\\-family member, nor friend? Would he\nhave to have somehow had access to the deceased's property after\ntheir death? Is there somewhere else he could have \u2018found\u2019 the will\nthat would have been credible?\n4. How could he have gotten away with listing \u2018fake\u2019 witnesses? (doesn't the administrator do research?)\n5. Once he had convinced the right people/organisations, who would have\nbeen responsible for selling the deceased\u2019s assets, and paying the\nmoney to the charities in the will?\n\n**Finally:**\n\nWhat benefit could his approach have had over simply\nacting as a normal heir hunter, e.g. using genealogy research\ndatabases to track down distant family members (who eventually\nbrought his fraud to light), and just charging them a finders fee\nas he did the charities?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Who administers the will of someone who dies intestate, who has no\n> family?\n\nThere is a position known as the \"public administrator\" paid mostly from fees charged to probate estates in most jurisdictions. In the absence of such a post, creditors of the estate or beneficiaries of the estate can apply to do so when there is no family.\n\n> Other than the administrator, who else did he need to convince the\n> will was genuine?\n\nThe court with probate jurisdiction.\n\n> By what credible set of occurrences could have have led him to \u2018find\u2019\n> the \u2018lost\u2019 will as a non\\-family member, nor friend?\n> \n> \n> Is there somewhere else he could have \u2018found\u2019 the will that would have\n> been credible?\n\nA companion had it. A bank had it. A former lawyer of the person had it. A military colleague had it. A landlord or storage unit company found it.\n\nNote also that the probate court sees only the will, and doesn't hear the whole story of how it was found, in the absence of a will contest or a will not executed with the usual formalities as these wills would have appeared on their face to have.\n\nAnd, if the notices to disinherited family members are not actually delivered (not mailed or mailed to bad addresses), the disinherited family doesn't show up to contest the matter until the finder's fee has been collected, the fraudster is nowhere to be found, and the charity has received the money and is being asked to refund it.\n\n> Would he have to have somehow had access to the deceased's property\n> after their death?\n\nNo. Often a will in not stored with someone's other property. And, in this case, he already knew that there was no actual will to find. He just needed to know that they died and weren't paupers.\n\n> How could he have gotten away with listing \u2018fake\u2019 witnesses? (doesn't\n> the administrator do research?)\n\nIf the witnesses signatures are notarized, the witnesses aren't interrogated unless there is a contest. Frequently, they are law office or bank employees who witness many wills and may not have a very specific recollection. The notary's authenticity wouldn't usually be checked unless there was a dispute as to the will's authenticity raised by some interested party.\n\n> Once he had convinced the right people/organisations, who would have\n> been responsible for selling the deceased\u2019s assets, and paying the\n> money to the charities in the will?\n\nThe executor of the estate appointed by the court. Sometimes distant family, sometimes a creditor or a representative of a charitable beneficiary, sometimes the public administrator.\n\n> What benefit could his approach have had over simply acting as a\n> normal heir hunter, e.g. using genealogy research databases to track\n> down distant family members (who eventually brought his fraud to\n> light), and just charging them a finders fee as he did the charities?\n\nFamily, even distant family, is likely to know more about the decedent and to research that relative (previously unknown or little known to them) than a charity that never met the decedent and doesn't want to contest a bequest to itself.\n\nAlso, close disinherited family will usually find out eventually. A finder's fee recipient can be paid and gone by then. A recipient of the inheritance under a forged will can be forced to disgorge it to the rightful heirs. Money laundering of the finder's fees received would be a necessary component of the scheme if it is to be successful.\n\nThis was a pretty successful \"long con\". After the fraud was discovered and proved:\n\n> The relatives we had found were then able to inherit, following the\n> rules of intestacy laid down by law. The criminal was not prosecuted\n> in this case because of his advanced age.\n\nIn fraud, if they only catch you after you are dead, it is a win for the fraudster.\n\n**Footnote**\n\nIn cases where the decedent had no family, this is a \"victimless\" crime that gives money to the finder and charity in lieu of an escheat of the decedent's entire estate to the government.\n\n**Second Footnote**\n\nThis is not a common fact pattern at all. I've never seen it in twenty\\-five years of practice, I've never encountered someone who has seen this happen, I've never seen a news account or continuing education instructor account, or professor's account of this particular kind of scheme before today, and I've never seen a court opinion addressing this fact pattern. This may be the only time in the history of the world that this particular kind of fraud has occurred. More common instances of fraud involve:\n\n* A family member who feels great financial need duping other family members to get the entire estate for himself or herself.\n* A family member forging a will in an effort to win an internal family struggle where the testator isn't budging.\n* A family member forging the estate plan the decedent intended to make, but didn't, with little substantive change.\n* An outsider or family member winning the trust of a frail but wealthy elderly person and having that person execute a will leaving them everything.\n* A professional conservator or guardian for someone who has no close family (or unrelated power of attorney agent) charging excessive fees (perhaps for services not actually rendered) and making undisclosed self\\-dealing transactions (e.g. gifts to himself or herself, and unfair business deals with related parties).",

The probate court typically only examines the will itself and doesn't necessarily investigate the circumstances of its discovery unless there's a contest. This creates a vulnerability that the swindler exploited. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while a public administrator may be involved, they are not solely responsible for authentication and can be deceived. \n\nOption B is false because witness signatures, especially if notarized, are not always thoroughly investigated unless there's a dispute. \n\nOption C is incorrect; in fact, charities are less likely to scrutinize a bequest than family members who might have personal knowledge about the deceased.\n\nOption D correctly identifies a key weakness in the probate process that made this fraud possible: the limited scope of the court's examination in uncontested cases."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This scenario is based on a real life event but is a purely hypothetical question (because this isn't remotely worth going to court or even arguing over). The situation seems surprisingly complicated, so it made me curious what, if anything, the \"legal\" answer may be. Consider the following scenario:\n\n1. Tenant rents out a house which comes with a washer\\+dryer.\n2. Lease specifically stipulates that Tenant is welcome to use washer/dryer but that Owner is not responsible for fixing them if they break.\n3. Tenant moves in and discovers that the washing machine is, in fact, broken (it never worked even before Tenant moved in)\n4. Conveniently, Owner recently purchased the property and has a seller's warranty available, which will cover repairs on the appliances (including washer/dryer)\n5. In an attempt to be helpful, Owner calls the company that provides the warranty. The washer is declared dead and a new washing machine is provided by said company.\n6. The warranty requires a deductible for this replacement. Since Owner declared that they would not be responsible for fixing the washer/dryer, they refuse to pay the deductible for the visit. Tenant pays for the deductible on Owner's Warranty.\n7. If it matters, the deductible is less than the cost of the replacement washing machine.\n\nIn short, the owner stated they would not pay for repairs or replacement on washer/dryer. As stated in the lease, when the washer broke the owner did not pay anything for the new washing machine \\- the tenant did. However, the owner's warranty was still used to acquire the new washing machine. **Therefore, who owns the washing machine?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The house Owner owns the washing machine.\n\nPaying the deductible on Owner's warranty has nothing to do with (changing of) the ownership of it.\n\nEffectively, the tenant has incurred expenses just for arranging the replacement.\n\n> Lease specifically stipulates that Tenant is welcome to use washer/dryer but that Owner is not responsible for fixing them if they break.\n\nNote that depending on the jurisdiction this term may be unenforceable: tenancy laws often stipulate that landlords have to keep things in working order at their expense (unless things break because tenants misuse/abuse them). In this case the tenant could claim the deductible he paid. But again, this would not affect the ownership of the washing machine in any way.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: In the described situation, where a tenant pays the deductible for a new washing machine obtained through the landlord's warranty, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding ownership and legal implications?\n\nA) The tenant now owns the washing machine since they paid the deductible.\nB) The landlord owns the washing machine, but must reimburse the tenant for the deductible.\nC) The landlord owns the washing machine, and the tenant has no claim to reimbursement due to the lease terms.\nD) Ownership of the washing machine is split between the landlord and tenant based on the proportion of the deductible to the machine's total value.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The landlord remains the owner of the washing machine, regardless of who paid the deductible. The lease terms stating that the landlord is not responsible for repairs or replacement are generally enforceable, although this may vary by jurisdiction. The tenant's payment of the deductible does not transfer ownership, but rather can be seen as a cost incurred to arrange the replacement. While some jurisdictions might have laws requiring landlords to maintain appliances, this doesn't change the ownership status. The tenant acted voluntarily in paying the deductible and, based on the lease terms, likely has no legal claim for reimbursement under most circumstances."

POTUS might claim executive privilege, and then the question is whether the courts would order Banon to testify. We don't know the basis for such privilege, but we can assume that it would involve national security issues (thus might be within the penumbra of the Nixon ruling).

Possession is a separate offense, and in this scenario, Bob never physically possessed the substance. Therefore, Bob would only be guilty of an offense if the substance he consumed was opium.

According to [here](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2015/03/exactly-speed-limit-come-effect/) it occurs at \"the exact point of the sign\", however this is not very precise. Is it when the *front* of the car passes the point or the *rear* of the car passes? For example if there was a change from 30 to 25 and you were driving 26 mph when your front passes the sign, but 25 when your rear passes the sign, could you get a ticket? \n\nI understand that this is never a practical concern for most cars. But say you have a huge big rig or something. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the U.S., this almost certainly depends on jurisdiction. My understanding is that many places have laws that provide only basic default speed limits and require drivers drive at prudent and safe speeds. Violating posted limits constitutes prima facie evidence that your speed is not reasonable or safe, but the offense isn't that you were doing X in a Y. Given that, the exact placement of the sign might not even be meaningful. The real question is where the conditions which warrant a reduction in speed begin, and whether your speed was prudent and safe at the time the alleged violation occurs.\n\nUnder this theory, if the speed limit were changing for no good reason and you could prove it in court, you might beat the ticket. I wouldn't bet a large amount of money on such a venture being successful.\n\nPerhaps an interesting legal question is at what point the posted limit creates the conditions for recorded speed becoming prima facie evidence of imprudent or unsafe driving. Again, my gut says that the zone begins as soon as:\n\n* a reasonable man driving at a prudent and safe speed in the same situation would become aware of the posted limit; and\n* the conditions which justify the reduction in speed (a curve, intersection, construction, etc.) occur",

At what point is the driver legally required to be at or below 55 mph?\n\nA) As soon as any part of the vehicle passes the speed limit sign\nB) When the entire vehicle has passed the speed limit sign\nC) When a reasonable driver would become aware of the new speed limit and the conditions justifying it\nD) Exactly 100 feet after passing the speed limit sign\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, the exact placement of the speed limit sign may not be the determining factor. Instead, the legal requirement to adhere to a new speed limit is based on two factors: when a reasonable driver would become aware of the posted limit, and when the conditions justifying the speed reduction occur. This aligns with the concept that drivers are expected to drive at prudent and safe speeds given the conditions, rather than strictly adhering to an arbitrary point where a sign is placed. Option C best reflects this nuanced approach to speed limit enforcement."

So you can\u2019t do anything in practice if your parents know about it and are against it.\n\nWhether you can start an LLC as a minor I don\u2019t know. The fact that you could escape all otherwise binding contracts makes it unlikely. EBay apparently refuses to enter contracts with minors.\n\nObviously your parents can set up an LLC and enter contracts with eBay, while leaving you with all the work to do, allowing you to put profits into a bank account in your name and taking losses out of your savings. Ultimately they will be legally responsible, but as long as everything is fine (you do all the work, it doesn\u2019t keep you from going to school or is just to much work for a minor, and you make some profit going into your bank account) this is alright.

The documentation indicates that minors generally cannot enter into binding contracts, and eBay specifically refuses to contract with minors. However, parents can set up an LLC and enter into the necessary contracts while allowing the minor to do the work and receive profits. The parents would remain legally responsible for the business.

That would require that XXX have full rights to the software, that they did not for instance incorporate others' GPLed code.\n\nIt would be a stretch to read the second paragraph as attempting to limit the first paragraph, particularly given the \"please\".",

The first statement clearly indicates that the software is licensed under GPL v3, which allows for commercial use without additional permissions. The second statement is not a restriction, but rather an invitation for those who may want to use the software under different terms (e.g., incorporating it into closed-source projects) to contact the owner for a separate commercial license. This is a common practice known as dual-licensing, where the software is freely available under an open-source license (GPL v3 in this case), but alternative licensing terms are offered for those who cannot or do not wish to comply with the GPL terms.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because GPL v3 does allow commercial use without additional licensing. Answer B is incorrect because the statements are not contradictory when properly understood in the context of dual-licensing. Answer D is close but not entirely accurate, as the software itself is not dual-licensed; rather, it's licensed under GPL v3 with an option to obtain a different license if desired."

What are the regulations for such products and how does one create documentation for such artefacts in family possession where no provenance has ever been needed ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The regulations are in [50 CFR Part 17](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=50:2.0.1.1.1&rgn=div5). This is about 300 pages long, and there is no single answer \u2013 you have to investigate in a case by case manner. African elephant ivory, as an example, is covered in \u00a717\\.40(e). Subparagraph (3\\) says that\n\n> Except for antiques and certain manufactured or handcrafted items\n>  containing de minimis quantities of ivory, sale or offer for sale of\n>  ivory in interstate or foreign commerce and delivery, receipt,\n>  carrying, transport, or shipment of ivory in interstate or foreign\n>  commerce in the course of a commercial activity is prohibited.\n\nSo it will ultimately depend on the nature of the item. Assume that the item is an \"antique\", which is defined (regardless of species) in [16 USC 1539(h)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1539). The requirement is that the item\n\n> (A) is not less than 100 years of age; (B) is composed in whole or in\n>  part of any endangered species or threatened species listed under\n>  section 1533 of this title; (C) has not been repaired or modified with\n>  any part of any such species on or after December 28, 1973; and (D) is\n>  entered at a port designated under paragraph (3\\).\n\nParagraph (3\\) says that\n\n> The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary\n>  of the Interior, shall designate one port within each customs region\n>  at which articles described in paragraph (1\\)(A), (B), and (C) must be\n>  entered into the customs territory of the United States.\n\nSo it could be anywhere, subject to change. \n\nAs for documentation, [this document](https://www.fws.gov/international/pdf/final-rule-african-elephant-4d.pdf), which is the final rules for a change in rules pertaining to African elephant ivory, has a section *Comments on documentation requirements*. Their suggestion is\n\n> Provenance may be determined through a detailed history of the item,\n>  including but not limited to, family photos, ethnographic fieldwork,\n>  art history publications, or other information that authenticates the\n>  article and assigns the work to a known period of time or, where\n>  possible, to a known artist or craftsman. A qualified appraisal or\n>  another method, including using information in catalogs, price lists,\n>  and other similar materials that document the age by establishing the\n>  origin of the item, can also be used.\n\nThis could address the age requirement; the port of entry requirement is mildly problematic since the relevant law was not passed 100\\+ years ago so there were no specified ports of entry. They do not address how one is to prove that the item was not repaired after December 28, 1973\\.\nThe regulations themselves does not specify the documentation requirements, so if you run into trouble with the Feds for shipping your piano, you can point to the final rule.",

According to the Endangered Species Act and subsequent regulations:\n\n1. Antiques over 100 years old can be exempt from restrictions, but age alone is not sufficient.\n2. The item must not have been repaired or modified with parts from endangered species after December 28, 1973.\n3. Documentation is required to prove the item's age and history. This can include family photos, appraisals, or other evidence authenticating its age and origins.\n4. The item should have entered through a designated port, though this may be difficult to prove for very old items.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because age alone doesn't guarantee legality. Answer B is too restrictive, as there are exemptions for antiques. Answer D is incorrect because interstate commerce of ivory items, even within the US, is regulated and requires proper documentation."

The insurance company may be held liable if it failed to implement adequate security measures and policies as required by applicable laws. Companies are required to have security measures in place, as outlined by local, state, and federal laws, to prevent data theft. They must also have employees sign contracts agreeing to keep data secure.

The company's security measures and policies are still relevant.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the company's liability doesn't solely depend on whether Bob was a direct employee or contractor. In both cases, the company has responsibilities regarding data protection.\n\nOption D is incorrect because merely reporting the incident doesn't absolve the company of responsibility.

In\\-fact, in the UK it is my understanding that **no** public buses actually have seat belts.\n\nI also have the same understanding in regards to private coaches. While most private coaches do come with seat belts as far as I'm aware you're not required to wear one.\n\nI find it strange since in a car you're required to wear a seat belt by law. It strikes me as odd that buses do not have the same requirements since this seems to imply that the bus is somehow safer or drivers are more qualified, yet bus accidents do happen!\n\nIs there any specific mention of this in any UK legislation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Based on another Jurasdiction (Germany) the main criteria for when seat belt are **not** required seems to be\n\n* that peaple are **allowed to stand during transport**\n\nThe UK **[Guidance Seatbelts on urban buses](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/seat-belts-on-urban-buses/seatbelts-on-urban-buses)** of 2010 confirms this with:\n\n> **General requirements**  \n> \n>  Since 1 October 2001, seat belts have been required to be installed in each forward and rearward facing seat in all new buses. The use of an approved and properly fitted restraint system can help prevent death or serious injury, not only by restraining the occupant from forward motion but also by preventing their ejection from the vehicle, particularly in accidents where the vehicle rolls over.\n> \n> \n> **The only exemption from this requirement is for buses that are designed for urban use with standing passengers**. An exemption is permitted for these vehicles because they are typically used for short journeys, in both time and distance, undertaken at moderate speeds on urban routes. Although we are aware that vehicles equipped with seat belts are used by some operators for urban fare paying services, ultimately, it is for the operator to choose the type of vehicle used to provide a service.\n\nSo for vehicles that contain seat belts, their usage is required. \n\n---\n\n[**Commission Directive 96/36/EC of 17 June 1996**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31996L0036) also makes a sole exception using this terminology: \n\n* ***both* urban use and standing passengers**\n\n> Whereas it is possible to improve the protection provided for passengers against ejection in case of an accident by requiring a minimum of lap belts with retractors for all forward and rear\\-facing seating positions in motor vehicle sof categories M2 and M3, and in the case of certain M2 vehicles lap and diagonal belts, as foreseen in Directive 90/628/EEC (**except those vehicles which are designed for both urban use and standing passengers**);\n\n---\n\n> **Road Traffic Regulations (StVO)**  \n> \n> **Section 21a Seat belts, wheelchair restraint systems, wheelchair user restraint systems, protective helmets**\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Mandatory seat belts must be worn while driving; this also applies to mandatory wheelchair restraint systems and mandatory wheelchair user restraint systems. **This does not apply to** \n> \n> \n> 1.

There are personal data. Company XYZ, which used this room earlier, claims that this data does not belong to it and that it is not the controller. Does ABC temporarily become their controller in the sense of the GDPR and is therefore obliged to take certain actions as described in GDPR to protect this data? Or maybe ABC is not the controller and the protection of these found data results from completely different legal acts?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A simple box full of documents might not be [in scope](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-2-gdpr/) of the GDPR, unless it can be considered (a part of) a filing system (for example because it is sorted). Just for the sake of argument, let's assume this box is in scope of the GDPR.\n\nIf the company decides to store the box for a while, it is basically processing personal data, because storing is included in the definition in [Art. 4(2\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/). So it looks to me at that moment the company becomes a controller.\n\nHowever, probably some exceptions would apply. In particular is the box contains personal data of many different people, [Art. 14](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/) does probably not apply, because it would involve a disproportionate effort to inform all data subjects.\n\nFinding such a box is a personal data breach. Although it is caused by the previous (unknown) controller, I think the company has to notify this personal data breach to a supervisory authority. \n\nIf the company would decide to destruct the box and it's content, it would not change anything, because destruction of personal data is also processing. The destruction itself might even be a personal data breach, for example if there is no other copy of the documents.\n\nNote that similar responsibilities arise if something valuable which is not personal data is found. You need to take care of it, for example find the owner or bring it to a lost property office.",

However, ABC's obligations are limited due to the circumstances. They likely don't need to inform all data subjects (Article 14 exception for disproportionate effort), but they should report the personal data breach to supervisory authorities.

After all, this helps neither people with special accessibility needs nor those without them.\n\n**Does the ADA actually contain passages that can be used to require deletion / blocking of media that do not satisfy accessibility standards? And if yes, what is the motivation for that (assuming one it is documented somehwere)?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe the relevant section is [28 CFR 35\\.150 \\- Existing facilities](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/35.150)\n\n> \u00a7 35\\.150 Existing facilities:\n> \n> \n> (a)General.

Regardless, it seems that UC Berkley decided to preemptively take down the videos in order to \"reset\" their online lectures catalogue and make large improvements. But yeah, nothing in the statute says they must take such videos down, **but it would be a theoretical violation of the law to leave them up**.",

The ADA does not explicitly require the deletion of inaccessible media content, nor did the Department of Justice directly order UC Berkeley to remove the videos. Instead, the university's decision appears to be a proactive step to address potential legal concerns and to \"reset\" their online lecture catalogue for improvements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the ADA does not specifically mandate deletion of non-compliant media. Option B is false as there was no direct order from the Department of Justice to remove the videos. Option D is too extreme and does not accurately reflect the ADA's requirements, which focus on making services and programs accessible \"when viewed in their entirety\" rather than prohibiting any content that isn't fully accessible.\n\nThe situation highlights the complex interplay between accessibility requirements and existing content, where institutions may choose to remove content preemptively to avoid potential legal issues, even if not directly required by law."

I've been mulling over a certain name for a while though I've looked through the google play store and chrome add\\-on store and both have apps named virtually the same thing. They're all still in the same domain as mine (language learning with emphasis on vocab retention), but none of them have been updated in the last few years and they all have very few users/downloads.

The things I mentioned cut both ways; it will be difficult for the existing apps to claim trademark if they allowed each other's existence this whole time. Also, using \"passing off\" instead of trademark requires that the plaintiff prove a loss of goodwill. With few users/downloads, this will be quite hard for them to establish.

What is the most accurate assessment of the potential legal risks and best course of action?\n\nA) There is no legal risk; the developer can freely use the name without concern.\nB) The developer should immediately trademark the name to prevent others from using it.\nC) Using the name is risky, but the developer can proceed if the app has a distinctive icon.\nD) It's advisable to choose a different, unique name to avoid potential legal issues and ensure trademark protection.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because there are potential legal risks, even if they might be mitigated by the existing apps' low usage and lack of updates.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the developer likely won't be able to trademark the name if it's already in use by others in the same market, especially if it's a descriptive name.\n\nOption C is partially correct in that having a distinctive icon may help differentiate the app, but it doesn't fully address the legal risks of using a similar name.\n\nOption D is the best course of action.

According to the documentation, a minor from the EU can legally work in the US, but there are specific requirements. They cannot work under the visa waiver program or a standard visitor's visa, as these do not permit employment. The proper procedure is for a prospective employer to petition in advance for the minor to be a temporary worker, and the appropriate visa must be obtained before traveling. Options A and B are incorrect because they describe illegal work arrangements. Option D is incorrect because minors are not categorically excluded from obtaining work visas, though there may be additional restrictions or requirements for underage workers."

Further, it would be negligibly easy for Wright to prove it, either publically or privately to the court.\n\nHowever, in this case, both parties agree on the \"fact\".

Case in point would be the enforcement of Cannabis laws.\n\nSo what causes the heavy handed enforcement of US tax laws, but near\\-total non\\-enforcement of Cannabis as a Schedule 1 Federal drug?\n\nCan someone sue the DEA for refusing to enfore Cannabis laws?\n\nSimilarly, can someone sue the IRS for heavy handed enforcement of tax laws?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> So what causes the heavy handed enforcement of US tax laws, but\n> near\\-total non\\-enforcement of Cannabis as a Schedule 1 Federal drug?\n\n**Tax Enforcement In The U.S. Is Not Particularly Heavy Handed**\n\nFirst of all, enforcement of U.S. tax laws is not, contrary to your perception, heavy handed. In fact, tax law non\\-enforcement is one of the most well quantified circumstances in which there are good estimates of how often tax laws aren't enforced. For example, as of 2001, the federal income tax tax gap (i.e. the difference between taxes paid and taxes owed) was summarized as follows:\n\n> About 44% of \\[the tax gap] ($148 billion a year) comes from income and\n> self\\-employment taxes owed by closely held businesses. About 16% comes\n> from understated non\\-business income (disproportionately from\n> investment income not subject to information return requirements such\n> as capital gains and rental income), and about 9% comes from\n> overstated deductions, exemptions and credits. About 33% comes from\n> other sources (mostly underreporting of corporate income taxes and\n> employment taxes).\n> \n> \n> Non\\-compliance rates vary greatly by type of income. About 1\\.2% of\n> potential wage and salary tax revenue are not collected. About 4\\.5% of\n> potential dividend, interest, pension and taxable Social Security\n> income tax revenue are not collected. About 8\\.6% of potential tax\n> revenue alimony, partnerships, S\\-corporations, capital gains, and\n> overstated deductions and exemptions are not collected. And, about\n> 53\\.9% of potential tax revenues from farms, rents and royalties, and sole proprietorships are not collected. The biggest factor in tax law\n> compliance is the degree to which income appears on information\n> returns. Taxpayers whose income isn't reported by third parties are\n> much more likely to cheat.\n> \n> \n> More than a third of returns with capital gains incorrectly report\n> that amount of the gain. Independent contractors omit on average 17%\n> of income not subject to information returns, but just 3% of income\n> subject to information returns.\n> \n> \n> The I.R.S. is not funded at at level that maximizes compliance. It\n> estimates that for every additional dollar spent on enforcement, it\n> could collect about $14 of additional tax revenues.\n\n(Source: Senate Finance Committee testimony in 2005 summarized [here](https://washparkprophet.blogspot.com/2006/07/who-doesnt-pay-their-federal-taxes.html))\n\nSince 2001 the amount of enforcement done by the IRS has significantly declined due to reduced IRS funding. [According to the U.S. Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-case-for-a-robust-attack-on-the-tax-gap) (which includes the IRS), in 2019, the tax gap was as follows:\n\n> Today, the \u201ctax gap\u201d\u2014the difference between taxes that are owed and\n> collected\u2014totals around $600 billion annually and will mean\n> approximately $7 trillion of lost tax revenue over the next decade.\n> The sheer magnitude of lost revenue is striking: it is equal to 3\n> percent of GDP\\[.]\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1l41w.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1l41w.png)\n\nWhile there are countries with low tax compliance (e.g. Greece and Italy) those countries have serious public finance problems as a result, and internationally, U.S. tax law enforcement is weak. See, e.g. [here](https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/21460/1/The%20EU%20tax%20gap%20-%20a%20study.pdf) (quantifying tax gaps in E.U. countries and in the chart below from this source):\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9SeOj.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9SeOj.png)\n\n(The U.S. estimate of 3% of GDP is not a fair comparison to these figures which include all taxes in a country, not just federal income taxes as in the U.S. figure).\n\nU.S. expats are, in part, unhappy, because U.S. citizens are taxed as a matter of substantive U.S. tax law on foreign income that many other countries do not tax their citizens upon. But, expat tax enforcement in the U.S. is hardly comprehensive and is generally speaking, less vigorous and less consistent than tax enforcement in domestic cases.\n\n**Cannabis Law Enforcement In The U.S.**\n\nThe shorter story of cannabis law enforcement is that historically, most enforcement of marijuana laws has been by state and local governments, since federal, state and local governments had parallel and similar laws on the subject.\n\nSome localities and states deprioritized enforcement or legalized it under state or local law.\n\nThe federal government did not want to spend the money to replace the state and local enforcement that ceased to be present.\n\nSeveral U.S. attorneys (the federal DA for a U.S. District Court District) decided to allow the state legalization experiment to proceed and to not be arbitrary in making cannabis prosecutions. When they did this they issued statements stating that they would not enforce federal cannabis laws in places where it was legalized where the violators were in compliance with state and local law and where the additional conditions imposed by federal prosecutors were met.\nThis also reflected the fact that with state legalization, the risk of jury nullification in federal prosecutions for marijuana offenses that were legal under state law became much greater reducing the value of attempting such prosecutions.\n\nThis was later rescinded (at least at the national level) but was replaced by Congressional language in appropriations bills deprioritizing such criminal enforcement and not authorizing federal funds to be spent for this purpose.\n\nCBD and hemp (which are cannabis products that are not psychoactive) have effectively been legalized nationally, although THC has not and is only tolerated at the federal level where states have legalized it.\n\n**Is Prosecutorial Discretion Subject To Judicial Review?**\n\n> Can someone sue the DEA for refusing to enforce Cannabis laws?\n\nNo.\n\nAnother answer correctly cites the U.S. Supreme Court case of *Town of Castle Rock vs. Gonzales* as the basis for this realty.\n\nIn some cases, however, individuals can bring a private cause of action against a cannabis law violator under RICO (the Racketeering And Corrupt Organizations Act) if they can show particularized damages to them from this activity.\n\n> Similarly, can someone sue the IRS for heavy handed enforcement of tax\n> laws?\n\nNo.\n\nThe IRS has to prove that taxes are owed, in every cases where the taxpayer contests the liability, in either tax court (prior to payment of the tax) or in U.S. District Court (after payment of the tax in a refund lawsuit). But, there is no private cause of action related to the level of enforcement of meritorious cases that the IRS can bring. That is a political decision for the Secretary of the Treasury, the President, and Congress in funding the IRS.\n\nClaims that equal protection of the laws are violated under the 14th Amendment with discriminatory enforcement choices of prosecutors and law enforcement are almost completely (although not quite entirely) barred. Certainly, such suits are not permitted in the context the question raises.",

But you can't make one yourself.)\n\nLikewise, if you have a copy of the disc but have lost the license key, you're screwed. Even if you could prove beyond any doubt that you are the licensee, there's not any law i'm aware of that would compel the copyright owner to provide you another license key. And courts have held that [distribution of license keys without authorization is a violation of the DMCA](https://www.leagle.com/decision/20081606555fsupp2d105111511).

This allowed the Nazi Regime to occupy these areas without war or further international backlash and annex them.\n* One can't say that the Federal Republic of Germany did annex the German Democratic Republic, as there was no occupation and it was written into international law by a multilateral contract as an act of union.\n\nThe Kashmir Question\n--------------------\n\nNow, Kashmir is a powderkeg question. And the TL;DR here: No, India did not annex Kashmir and Jammu, Kashmir and Jammu did accede the Dominion of India.\n\nLet's look at it historically, starting with 1846\\. Then, the Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu was created when the very ethnically diverse territories that the British east Indian Company annexed from the Sikh Empire as a result of the first Anglo\\-Sikh War were sold to Gulab Singh of Jammu with the [Treaty of Amritsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Amritsar_(1846)).\n\nIn 1857 the Kashmeer sided with the British in the revolt. The British won and established the British Raj and assumed direct control over all the Indian subcontinent \\- but technically the Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu still existed as a part of the Raj. Time went by. \n\n1947 comes around, the British have given the Raj some years to negotiate the landscape of the countries to release from their rule as a reward for their part in the second world war. The [Indian Independence Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Independence_Act_1947) comes into reality, creating the Dominion of Pakistan and Dominion of India, with each Princely State having been given time to choose which to join beforehand. Only Hyderabad, Junagadh (and subsidiaries), the Khanate of Kalat and the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir have not chosen by 15th of August 1947\\. Hyderabad joins India 2 months late, Junagadh Pakistan. Kalat signed a standstill with Pakistan but was independent otherwise until March of 1948 as the Khan discussed some terms with the Dominion of Pakistan. However, the Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir and Jammu had planned to join **neither and stay independent**. But time wouldn't allow that to endure...\n\nThe Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu tried to get both Dominions to sign a standstill agreement that would keep the Status Quo on all administrative things until a proper agreement was signed. The Dominion of Pakistan accepted while the Dominion of India did demand that they'd only sign if they had a delegate to discuss terms with. The Dominion of Pakistan then blockaded the Princely State, technically violating their standstill agreement. Hari Singh did reach out for the Dominion of India's help as a result and got essential goods from them as aid. By now it is September 1947\\. Kashmir is still independent.\n\nIn the Poonch District, an uprising happens under Muhammad Ibrahim Khan. Weapons flow from the Dominion of Pakistan to the rebels, and on 22nd October, Pakistani soldiers join the fray and invade the independent Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu. Having no military fit to hold up against the Pakistani armed forces, Hari Singh once more reaches out to the Dominion of India, this time for military aid. The answer has three terms:\n\n* **[Sign the Instrument of Accession for the Dominion of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_of_Accession_(Jammu_and_Kashmir)).**\n* Convert the Princely State to democracy using a specific model.\n* Appoint a certain official into his government.\n\nOn 26th October, Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession for the Dominion of India. On 27th the Dominion of India accepted it, making the Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu a part of the Dominion of India. It **acceded to the Dominion of India** by a Bilateral contract and brought the Dominions of India and Pakistan into [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947%E2%80%931948). In the Ceasefire of 1948/49, some areas of Kashmir and Jammu were **occupied by the Dominion of Pakistan**. In 1971 the ceasefire line was declared a line of control, but to this day, no land was formally ceased, so technically it is still occupied to this day and the annexation is only *de facto* and not *de jure*.\n\nAs I am a historian, I draw my line here.\n\nWhat's Accession?!\n------------------\n\nAccession is defined by the UN as:\n\n> \"Accession\" is the act whereby a state accepts the offer or the opportunity to become a party to a treaty already negotiated and signed by other states. It has the same legal effect as ratification. Accession usually occurs after the treaty has entered into force. [[1](https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1376)](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview/glossary/page1_en.xml#accession)\n\nHari Singh did have his Princely State join the [Dominion of India,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_India) which itself was a technically a transitional body formed by the coalition of close to 700 Princely States. It was **not yet** one state of India but would in 1950 become the Republic of India.",

In October 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir and Jammu signed the Instrument of Accession, voluntarily joining the Dominion of India. This was not an annexation (A), as it was done through a bilateral agreement, not military force. The princely state did not remain independent (C), as it joined India in 1947. While there have been conflicts since then, India did not formally annex Kashmir and Jammu after the 1971 war (D). The accession in 1947 remains the key legal document defining Kashmir and Jammu's relationship with India."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Awhile back I had to hire an attorney when the state of California was erroneously notified from another state that I had been convicted of a DUI...resulting in a suspension of my California Driver's License. In California, one is only entitled to a DMV hearing for an administrative suspension. To contest a suspension resulting from a criminal conviction, one has to file a petition for a writ of mandate against the department ordering the suspension be set aside. My attorney notified me in this instance that he had heard that, on occasion, the department will effectively assert its equality with the court and refuse to remove the suspension...in which case one then has to move to the federal arena and get it ordered by a district court. \n\nI'm curious as to whether this is actually true. **That is, can a state agency simply assert that it is equal to a state court and ignore a *bona fide* order from that court?** In case this is \"too broad\", answers restricted to the laws of the State of California would suffice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This would be very uncommon, and [an ACLU suit from 2016](https://www.aclunc.org/our-work/legal-docket/hernandez-v-california-dmv-drivers-license-suspension) addressing similar issues suggests that it is incorrect. \n\nIt would depend on California specific cases governing the jurisdiction of the regular courts. The California agency could not ignore the lawsuit, but they might defend by arguing that the court in question doesn't have jurisdiction to rule. Usually, this would only occur if California law had provided other recourse to regular courts, perhaps via an appeal as opposed to a mandamus action. I'm not familiar enough with California's civil procedure rules to cite chapter and verse on the relevant California law, however.\n\nThis state law doctrine should also not be confused with the [constitutional \"equal footing\" principal](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/457/273/) which is that every U.S. state should have the same legal rights under the constitution as every other state in the absence of a history of past misconduct related to the differential treatment.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In California, if a state agency refuses to comply with a state court order to remove a driver's license suspension, what is the most accurate statement about the agency's ability to assert equality with the court?\n\nA) The state agency can legally assert equality with the court and ignore the order indefinitely.\n\nB) The state agency must immediately comply with the court order without any right to appeal or challenge.\n\nC) The state agency cannot simply ignore the order, but may defend its position by arguing lack of court jurisdiction, subject to further legal proceedings.\n\nD) The state agency can only challenge the court order by invoking the constitutional \"equal footing\" principle between states.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While it would be very uncommon for a state agency to refuse to comply with a court order, they cannot simply ignore it. The agency may defend its position by arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction to make such an order, but this would be subject to further legal proceedings and scrutiny. This approach aligns with the information provided in the documentation, which suggests that such situations are rare and likely incorrect, as evidenced by the ACLU suit from 2016.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because state agencies cannot legally assert equality with courts and ignore valid court orders indefinitely. This would violate principles of separation of powers and the rule of law.\n\nAnswer B is also incorrect because while agencies generally must comply with court orders, they do have legal avenues to challenge or appeal decisions they believe are incorrect or outside the court's jurisdiction.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the constitutional \"equal footing\" principle refers to equality between states, not between state agencies and courts within the same state. This principle is not relevant to the question at hand."

If something is licensed under 3\\.0, does that refer to the US version, the German version, the UK version? Copyright law differs across jurisdictions and US versus German versions could reflect local differences in law.\n\nCC provides a [\"what's new\" document](https://creativecommons.org/version4/) explaining what they think the differences are.

There does not seem to be a huge difference in that which is allowed across versions, but there is a difference (improvement) in comprehensibility.",

The weaker form of such laws says that at least one party to the conversation must consent to the recording. The stronger law, operative in Washington, California and about a dozen other states, is that all parties to the conversation must consent. The intent behind these laws is to require consent or knowledge of one or all of the people being recorded. What is not entirely clear (in all\\-party states) is what constitutes a communication, and what a party is, given the *wording* of the statutes.\n\n[Washington law](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/Rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73.030) is an example of an all\\-party consent law, which states a prohibition against recording without \"first obtaining the consent of all the participants in the communication\". The law does not *state* this in terms of \"the consent of those persons who are recorded\". It is unclear whether a person who could in principle hear and be heard (e.g. in a room full of people, with the phone on speaker) are \"participants\" since the term is not defined. [California law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&part=1.&title=15.&chapter=1.5) refers to \"the consent of all parties to a confidential communication\", again with no specific mention of people who do not speak, and also no exception made for \"parties\" who are not actually recorded.\n\nThe court in CA has determined that a confidential communication is one in which the parties have a reasonable expectation that no one is listening in. Suppose that A and B are having a quiet conversation in public, and they do not expect that anyone else can hear them, but there are other people nearby. This is a confidential conversation, recording of which requires permission of all parties. A and B can agree to record the conversation. A common sense understanding of \"party\" would find that if C *can* actually hear the conversation, he is still not a party to the conversation, therefore he does not have veto power over A \\& B recording their conversation. To the best of my knowledge, the courts have not ruled on what exactly constitutes a \"party\" or \"participant\". Nor have they ruled on what constitutes a \"communication\". It is possible, but legally untested, that you can record yourself (e.g. with a recorder in the room with you) talking into a phone, where there is some other person on the other end of the line: you're just recording your monologue.\n\nHowever, the legal utility of doing this is really not obvious, and you really need to hire an attorney who is versed in your jurisdictions case law on the topic, before sticking your head in the noose.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: John receives a gift of various items from his friend Tom. John decides to sell these items online. Later, he begins to suspect that some of the items might be stolen. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects John's legal situation?\n\nA) John cannot be held liable for selling stolen property as long as Tom told him the items weren't stolen.\n\nB) John is only at risk if he continues to sell the items after developing a reasonable suspicion that they might be stolen.\n\nC) John is automatically guilty of receiving and selling stolen property, regardless of his knowledge.\n\nD) John is completely safe from any legal consequences as long as he stops selling the items immediately.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the legal principle outlined in the documentation, it's only a crime to receive or sell stolen property if you know or reasonably suspect that it is stolen. The fact that John is beginning to suspect the items might be stolen creates a potential legal risk if he continues to sell them. \n\nOption A is incorrect because merely being told the items weren't stolen doesn't protect John if he develops reasonable suspicion later. \n\nOption C is too extreme; the law typically requires knowledge or reasonable suspicion, not automatic guilt. \n\nOption D is overly optimistic; while stopping sales might mitigate risk, it doesn't guarantee John is \"completely safe\" from any legal consequences, especially if an investigation has already begun.\n\nThe documentation also highlights that even being investigated can have serious consequences, emphasizing the importance of avoiding situations where one might be suspected of knowingly dealing with stolen property."

In some jurisdictions if the driving is \"reasonable and prudent\" under the then current conditions, it is legal even if over the posted limit. In many jurisdictions, exceeding the posted limit is normally illegal. But even there someone breaking the limit during an emergency when such speed is needed to save life may not be committing an illegal act.",

The terms \"lawful\" and \"legal\" are generally used interchangeably in legal contexts, both typically meaning \"in compliance with the law.\" This answer also correctly notes that in some jurisdictions, speeding may be legal if the driving is \"reasonable and prudent\" under the current conditions, which aligns with the information given about traffic laws.

He attempts to intervene but is knocked unconscious. Upon regaining consciousness, he notices several partygoers still present, though some have left.

As stated in the documentation, a peace officer can arrest anyone for whom they have probable cause to arrest, meaning a reasonable belief that the person has committed a crime. This applies even if the officer didn't directly witness the crime. Officer Johnson doesn't need to limit arrests to only those he saw commit a crime before losing consciousness, nor can he arbitrarily arrest anyone present. Being off-duty doesn't prevent him from making a lawful arrest if probable cause exists. To determine probable cause, he would likely need to gather information from witnesses and assess any available evidence before making an arrest decision."

This includes a convoluted digital security system on the lift requiring a code that is supposed to stop working at certain hours to restrict access but often malfunctions at other hours and the contract explicitly disclaims liability for the lifts malfunctioning.\n\nBut when one books a space online it is promoted when selecting a space that either it is on a ground floor or the customer is assured that there is lift access. Some of these spaces are big enough to only make sense for storing large furniture and thus couldn't be useful without functioning lift access.\n\nWhen the lifts break down as they frequently do, it invariably wastes hours upon hours of numerous customers' time.\n\n**is it possible/valid for a company to disclaim liability for not providing a service properly which they've contracted for consideration to do?**\n\nCorollary: sometimes things happen that are beyond the customer's control and they are slightly late vacating the premises at the agreed time. On these occasions they may be locked inside possibly creating a fire hazard, but that's another issue, but in any case, the duty manager or contracted overnight security company is supposed to come and resolve the situation.\n\nRecently after calling the out of hours assistance number someone had to wait 2 hours for the security to arrive as their keyring was on the first floor, with their storage, bike, and house key so they could'nt get home. When finally the security arrived he tried 5\\-6 different security pass codes but due to mismanagement by the storage company none of them had worked and the customer was left homeless that night unable to retrieve their house keys to get into their home. The security man tried to consult the duty manager liaising from the storage company itself but they also could'nt produce a code that actually functioned to give access to the premises. The customer's sleep and life were massively disrupted by this incompetent out of hours response.\n\nNo doubt the company's lawyers have painstakingly crafted their corporate service contract to eliminate any conceivable liabilities and give the corporation all the power possible in every conceivable circumstance.\n\nBut are there immutable limits to the ability of corporate legal gymnastics' ability to dissolve liability while taking people's money for a service?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\")\n\n\"A term in a consumer contract is unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good\nfaith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations\nunder the contract, to the detriment of the consumer.\" [s62 Consumer Rights Act 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/62)\n\nSome suppliers put terms in contracts that seek to limit or exclude liability.

The term disclaiming all liability for lift malfunctions, when lift access is a key feature of the service, likely creates such an imbalance. It undermines the value of the supplier's obligations and hinders the consumer from seeking a legal remedy, which the Competition & Markets Authority guidance suggests falls under suspicion of unfairness.

How is the procedure?\n\nI want to know whether it's possible to refuse the use of excessive drugs, on the grounds that it doesn't heal the root of the problem but only to suffer more.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [This is a law](https://www.conseil-national.medecin.fr/article/article-36-consentement-du-malade-260) about informed consent.\n\nI won't translate it verbatim, but it says more or less what one might have guessed it would say: i.e. that doctors need informed consent from the patient; or must consult with the patient's *proches*, except in emergency.\n\nThe noun *proches* literally means the patient's \"nears\", which is a word like \"kin\" except that in this case it can mean family, or it can mean anyone else who the patient has designated as being the person in whom they have \"confidence\", which could even include e.g. the person's GP \\-\\- effecting such a designation doesn't need a notary (but may require lucidity): they can give you a form at the hospital.\n\nThe above is *a* law, i.e. one of the laws: there are others \\-\\- see e.g. [France passes new end\\-of\\-life legislation to alleviate suffering](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11478999/France-passes-new-end-of-life-legislation-to-alleviate-suffering.html) dated 2015, which also mentions a 2005 law (named [la loi Leonetti](http://sante.lefigaro.fr/social/sante-publique/euthanasie/que-dit-precisement-loi-leonetti)):\n\n> France legalised \u201cpassive euthanasia\u201d in 2005, where treatment, needed to maintain life is withheld or withdrawn\n\nI don't know of English transcriptions of these laws, but Google Translate provides an IMO mostly\\-understandable translation of such web pages. Alternatively it's my experience that in a French hospital you may find that the doctor (or at least, that one of the doctors or nurses) can talk in English.\n\nSee also e.g. [http://www.chu\\-nice.fr/patient\\-visiteur/vous\\-informer/droits\\-du\\-patient/1963\\-consentement\\-du\\-patient\\-et\\-le\\-refus\\-de\\-soins](http://www.chu-nice.fr/patient-visiteur/vous-informer/droits-du-patient/1963-consentement-du-patient-et-le-refus-de-soins) (which is a random hospital explaining the \"informed consent\" and in a more lay language).\n\nNote that doctors may recommend or argue in favour of a course of treatment, and not accept a first refusal, and are for example expected to inform you of the likely consequences of withdrawing from treatment (that's part of your being \"informed\" so that you can give or refuse informed consent), which I suppose could seem like a refusal on their part; but so far as I know (i.e. in theory, based on the information such as I've referenced here) the patient (or their next of kin or their \"designated trusted person\") should (must in principle) be consulted and may say no.\n\nAs an aside, some people's personal experience has been that sometimes it seems as if some French doctors are more willing to divulge apparently bad news (e.g. a fatal or terminal prognosis) to the patient's kin than to the patient themselves.\n\n---\n\nReading the small print of Article 36 again isn't entirely clear:\n\n* Clearly the patient has a right to refuse treatment.\n* Equally clearly in case of emergency the doctor doesn't need permission before treating.\n* What's less clear is whether the the *proches* are allowed to refuse consent if the patient is incapable: what it actually says is that the doctor must \"consult\" with the kin.\n\nSo actually the other [http://www.chu\\-nice.fr/patient\\-visiteur/vous\\-informer/droits\\-du\\-patient/1963\\-consentement\\-du\\-patient\\-et\\-le\\-refus\\-de\\-soins](http://www.chu-nice.fr/patient-visiteur/vous-informer/droits-du-patient/1963-consentement-du-patient-et-le-refus-de-soins) text has this paragraph which gives additional detail:\n\n> **1\\- Patient hors d\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019exprimer son refus :**\n> \n> \n> Lorsque le patient est hors d\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019exprimer sa volont\u00e9, que ce soit du fait d\u2019un \u00e9tat passager limitant ou abolissant tout discernement (toxicomanie\u2026) ou d\u2019un \u00e9tat comateux ou d\u2019inconscience passag\u00e8re, le m\u00e9decin doit pr\u00e9venir la personne de confiance s\u2019il en existe une, ou \u00e0 d\u00e9faut un proche.\n> \n> \n> Face au refus de soins exprim\u00e9, au nom du patient, par la personne de confiance, ou un proche, ou par le patient dans ses directives anticip\u00e9es, le m\u00e9decin va devoir mettre en place une proc\u00e9dure dite coll\u00e9giale o\u00f9 l\u2019intervention de la personne de confiance ou du proche n\u2019est que consultative.\n> \n> \n> Pour prendre la d\u00e9cision de respecter ou non ce refus de soins, le m\u00e9decin va devoir se concerter avec son \u00e9quipe m\u00e9dicale et soignante, demander l\u2019avis m\u00e9dical motiv\u00e9 d\u2019un confr\u00e8re.

If that person refuses in the name of the patient, then the doctor must put in place a \"collegial\" process where the intervention of the kin is merely consultative. To decide whether to respect the refusal of treatment the doctor will have to decide in concert with their medical and treatment team and ask advice from a colleague (and then decide, taking advice into account).\n\nIn other words, the kin or person of confidence (in other countries may be a.k.a. \"guardian\") may refuse treatment and their refusal will be taken into account and yet might not be the final decision \\-\\- the final decision might be overruled by a quorum of doctors.\n\nThere may also be an \"[advanced directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_healthcare_directive)\" previously written by the patient.
