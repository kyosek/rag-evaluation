We both get a 50% share. All assets have been disposed of and now there is nothing but cash left. Tax returns were filed long ago and likely all expenses have been paid.\n\nThe attorney for the estate does not communicate with me. I think they are stalling to try and get me to accept a smaller settlement to make the ordeal end.

Creditors, for example, get 6 months in which to make their claims against the estate and the executor has 3 months to make a decision to dispute a claim. Disputing a claim will extend the time necessary to process the creditor's claims.\n\nAn estate subject to federal estate taxes (valued over $5\\.45 million) can take much longer \\- up to a year after the April following the year of death (based on when an estate tax return is due and how long the IRS is taking to issue a final letter).\n\nFrom this [NoLo](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/new-jersey-estatetax.html) article you can see that NJ estate tax returns are due 9\\-10 months after death and then one has to wait for the state to issue its tax waivers.\n\nHere's another [article](http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2010/08/beneficiaries_have_the_right_t.html) that describes the typical time it takes to process an estate (average of 1 to 2 years) along with the types of issues that can extend the time. It also lists the process beneficiaries can follow in order to get the current status and perhaps nudge things along.\n\nThe executor is required to provide an accounting of the estate to the beneficiaries and will have to provide a final accounting to the probate court before final distribution.

This timeline accounts for several factors:\n\n1. Creditors have 6 months to make claims against the estate.\n2. The executor has 3 months to decide whether to dispute a claim.\n3. New Jersey estate tax returns are due 9-10 months after death.\n4. The state needs time to issue tax waivers.\n\nExtensions to this timeline are possible due to various factors:\n\n- Disputes over creditor claims can extend the process.\n- Estates subject to federal estate taxes (valued over $5.45 million) can take up to a year after the April following the year of death.\n- The average time to process an estate is 1 to 2 years, depending on complexity.\n- The executor must provide an accounting of the estate to beneficiaries and the probate court, which can also add time to the process.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it's too short and doesn't account for creditor claim periods.

Would it be different if they were going through their own territory, or a third country's, with permission? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a hard question, but a good question. The following relates to the issue from the perspective of the USA.\n\nYou ask \"...if the US wants to invade France, **can** they officially declare war by...\", You have to make clear what you mean by \"can\". If you mean whether or not the US has the physical ability to do this, then of course they do. If you mean whether they are allowed, then this is another question. When you ask whether something is allowed, then you have to make reference to a moral code or a law that determines what is and what isn't allowed (legal). Normally each country will have laws that govern what is and what isn't legal for it's citizens to do. That hard part is how this applies to nations. There are two sides to the question. (1\\) What are the leaders allowed to do under their own laws, (the domestic laws) (2\\) what are countries as entities allowed to do? (the international laws) It sounds a bit like you are asking about the second thing. Here treaties govern what is and what isn't \"legal\". However, usually when someone breaks a law, other entities have the power to enforce that law and decide (judge) whether the person has broken the law. The question is: who decides whether a country has broken a treaty or an international law? And if a law is broken, what exactly can be done about it? This is hard to answer. \n\nConsider for example the conflict in Ukraine. Here many will argue that Russia has piratically invaded Ukraine. There should be war between the nations. But Russia denies this and other world powers have done little beyond imposing sanctions. This illustrates how hard it is to deal with this question.\n\nOne question that comes up is what the purpose of international treaties are if a country can just violate them without much consequence. Pointing out two points about this. (1\\) If, for example, a president wants to convince his/her own congress that the country *should* engage in war, then it makes a stronger point if you can show how the country you want to engage has violated international trities. (2\\) After you have won a war, you might want to prosecute the leaders of the loosing power. Here you will stand stronger if you can make references to some international law that existed before the conflict started. This second point is illustrated in the [Nuremberg principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_principles). Here it was exactly stated that \"*Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment.*\"\n\n[According to the US constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States) \"Congress shall have power to ... declare War\". That means that historically Congress has the power to decide where to wage war. The [War Powers Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution) says, for example, that \"[The President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities ...](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1542)\".\n\nNote that this doesn't mean that the US has do formally declare war before going to war. Example: [The Iraq War was authorized by Congress, but there never was a formal declaration of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States#Military_engagements_authorized_by_Congress). \n\nIt is interesting that you ask about the timing for when the declaration should be given. The Japanese wanted to [deliver their declaration of war just before](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/world-war-ii/resources/japan-declares-war-1941) the attack on Pearl Harbor. But because of issues with decrypting the message from Japan to the Japanese Embassy, the [declaration wasn't delivered until after the attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_declaration_of_war_on_the_United_States_and_the_British_Empire). \n\nRemember also in all of this that the winning party to a conflict, usually decides what was and wasn't legal!\n\nOne good reference for more on all of this is the report by the Congressional Research Service called \"*[Declarations of War and Authorizations for the Use of Military Force: Historical Background and Legal Implications](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf)*\".

Which of the following is the most appropriate and immediate course of action for the tenant?\n\nA) File a complaint with the Washington State Bar Association against the landlord\nB) Immediately vacate the property to avoid further legal complications\nC) Hire an attorney to address the ex parte decision and potentially reinstate the stay\nD) Wait for the first payment date to pass before taking any action\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate immediate action for the tenant is to hire an attorney (option C). The situation described is complex and time-sensitive, involving legal procedures that require expertise to navigate. An attorney can help address several key issues:\n\n1. The ex parte decision: An attorney can investigate how the landlord obtained an ex parte decision and potentially challenge it if proper procedures weren't followed.\n\n2. Service of notice: The documentation mentions that the tenant may not have received notice of the hearing. An attorney can examine whether the landlord followed proper service procedures as outlined in RCW 59.18.055.\n\n3. Default judgment: If a default judgment was entered due to the tenant's absence at a hearing they were unaware of, an attorney can work to have this judgment set aside.\n\n4. Reinstatement of stay: An attorney can file appropriate motions to potentially reinstate the stay and payment plan.\n\n5.

All hours over 40 in a week must be paid at 1.5 times the regular rate, regardless of which contract they fall under, per Massachusetts law.\n3. The overtime rate is based on the higher of the two contract rates ($25/hour), so overtime is paid at $37.50/hour.\n4.

Parents also have some level of control over their children spending their own money (not the topic of discussion here).\n\nMy question is: given that once minor children receive a special gift it is theirs and the parents cannot take it, can parents legally *prevent* their minor children from receiving gifts in the first place?\n\nLet's say Grandma wants to give $10,000 to Junior. Could the parents say \u201cNo, Mom. Either give the money to us and we will administer it, or Junior can\u2019t accept the gift at all.\u201d? This is not taking what Junior owns, it's preventing him from owning it in the first place.\n\nIf such prevention can be legally done beforehand, then consider further if the gift has already been accomplished. Perhaps Grandma has *already* placed one hundred crisp 100\\-dollar bills into Junior's hands (or, say she deposits money into his custodial bank account before the parents learn of it). He runs to Mom and displays the cash/balance slip saying, \"look what Grandma gave me!\" Has the gift been irrevocably given at that point, or can the parents require it to be returned or set conditions on the gift at that point, given this is happening the moment they learn of the gift and immediately after the giving?\n\nIf they cannot prevent the ownership against the child's wishes at this point, what if the parents convince the child to give the money back or give the money to them (perhaps operating under a mistaken belief about what is legal, knowingly or unknowingly communicating falsehoods about the situation to their child)? Could the child or the gift\\-giver later claim that the parents stole the money because the child didn't understand his rights at the time? It seems like if the law considers a child competent to receive and own gifted property, the child is competent to also give away such property, and if a child could legally refuse Grandma's gift in the first place (even if foolishly) then he can also give away Grandma's gift after its receipt (even if foolishly).\n\nFocusing more closely on the quoted cases in the original question, one part may be relevant: in [HOBLYN vs. JOHNSON, 2002](https://law.justia.com/cases/wyoming/supreme-court/2002/434232.html) as recorded at law.justia.co (emphasis mine):\n\n> \"As a general rule any property acquired by the child in any way except by its own labor or services belongs to the child, and not to the parent.\" \\[46 C. C. 1314]. . . . It furthermore goes without saying that a parent cannot deprive a child of its property except pursuant to law (31 C. J. 1011\\), and the fact that in this instance the father had the property in question assessed as his property could not affect the title of the children. In Banks v. Conant, 14 Allen (Mass.) 497, it was said: \"In consideration of the duty which the law imposes on a father to furnish adequate support to his child during infancy, the services of the child during that period are due to the father, and, if they are rendered to a third person, the right of the father to recover the value thereof is clear and indisputable. But this is the extent of the father's right. He has no title to the property of the child, **nor is the capacity or right of the latter to take property or receive money by grant, gift or otherwise, except as a compensation for services, in any degree qualified or limited during minority.** Whatever therefore an infant acquires which does not come to him as a compensation for services rendered, belongs absolutely to him, and his father cannot interpose any claim to it, either as against the child, or as against third persons who claim title or possession from or under the infant.\"\n\nRephrasing this more directly, \"the right of the child to receive property by gift is not limited or qualified in any degree during minority.\"\n\nThis would seem to *suggest* that parents may not interfere with gift giving to their children, however it is not clear. Does \"the right to take property or receive money is not limited\" assert that children must be allowed to receive *any* gift at all? Or is this only recognizing that, once given (a process that the parents might legally prevent, but did not), the parents cannot then take the gift after its receipt?\n\nImagine the parents believe all dancing is wrong, and a friend of the child gives him a book on how to breakdance.

Potentially, Author could under UK law (moral rights) stop Publisher from creating an unauthorized modification if Author can prove that the modification is \u201cderogatory\u201d, which is undefined and I assume is judged in terms of whether \u201ca reasonable person\u201d would be offended, rather than a proof that the Author would never have approved such a modification.\n\nThe agreement is (per a governing\\-law clause) subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of English courts, and contains an arbitration clause, which specifies that each party shall name an arbitrator, and there is no provision for a tie\\-breaker / umpire. For the hypothetical, Author desires to create and distribute a derivative work (perhaps a translation). Can Publisher stop / sue Author for exercising his rights under copyright law? Answers supported by actual case law (US or UK) are most desirable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If that is the whole of the contract the author has not retained many rights. Usually a publication contract will include a termination provision. This is likely to provide that if the work goes out of print (whch the contract normally defines) the author may reclaim the rights. But there seems to be no such provision in this case.\n\nThe contract language quoted does not license the right to perform the work. For a novel this would mean the right to read it aloud, possibly not of much value. For a musical or dramatic work, this might be of significant value.\n\nUnder [17 USC 203](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#203) a US author has the right to cancel all previous licenses and transfers at any time during a period lasting 5 years, and starting 35 years from the granting of the license, or 35 years from initial publication under the license.\n\n17 USC 293 (b) provides that:\n\n> (b) Effect of Termination.\u2014Upon the effective date of termination, all rights under this title that were covered by the terminated grants revert to the author, authors, and other persons owning termination interests under clauses (1\\) and (2\\) of subsection (a), including those owners who did not join in signing the notice of termination under clause (4\\) of subsection (a), but with the following limitations:\n\nSubsection (b)(4\\) providfes that:\n\n> A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any right covered by a terminated grant is valid **only** if it is made **after** the effective date of the termination. As an exception, however, an agreement for such a further grant may be made between the persons provided by clause (3\\) of this subsection and the original grantee or such grantee\u2019s successor in title, after the notice of termination has been served as provided by clause (4\\) of subsection (a).\n\nThis would as i understand it, allow the author or the author's heir(s) to reclaim the US rights at least, but only after some 35\\-40 years, if the proper steps are followed.\n\nOtherwise, I don't see anything the author retains, except the right to collect royalties as specified by the contract.\n\nIf the publisher materially breaches the contract (as perhaps by not paying royalties due), the author (or heir or othet successor) **might** be able to have the contract voided in a suit, and reclaim the rights granted under the contract.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An author based in the US signs a publication agreement with a UK publisher.

Under 17 USC 203, a US author has the right to cancel all previous licenses and transfers during a 5-year period starting 35 years from the granting of the license or initial publication. This allows the author to potentially reclaim US rights after 35-40 years if proper steps are followed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the exclusive license prevents the author from creating and distributing derivative works without permission.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the question states there is no termination clause in this contract for when the work goes out of print.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the contract doesn't explicitly license performance rights, the broad language of \"all forms and media\" likely includes performance rights, leaving the author with very limited retained rights."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81318/is-it-legal-to-let-someone-else-vote-on-your-behalf-in-oregon-if-you-sign-the-ba", "docs_id": 81318, "title": "Is it legal to let someone else vote on your behalf in Oregon if you sign the ballot?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: John Smith doesn't care about voting.

In legal systems that uphold the principle of \"innocent until proven guilty,\" the prosecution must provide sufficient evidence to convict an individual beyond a reasonable doubt. In this scenario, while it's known that one of the four is guilty, there isn't enough evidence to prove which one committed the crime. Therefore, the case would likely be dismissed due to lack of evidence, and all four suspects would be released.

Presumably the only test of such actions would be for someone to get arrested for violating the \"lockdown\".\n\nOn their face, these actions seem to be extra\\-judicial since in many cases the police are not acting under the penumbra of law, but are essentially creating martial law with no authority.\n\nAnother issue is that such actions could be construed as violating the First Ammendment's guarantee of the right of assembly.

However, the Supreme Court has recognized that sometimes there are *special law enforcement needs.* When those needs are present, the Supreme Court has approved of police setting up roadblocks to stop drivers without the police having any suspicion that that drive had violated a law. \n\nThere are two things that must be true for any given roadblock to be deemed appropriate. First, it must stop vehicles on a *neutral, articulable standard*. (An example is: \"all cars\"). Second, the roadblock must be *designed to serve the police officers' efforts closely related to a particular problem regarding vehicles and their mobility.* \n\nA roadblock to test for drunk drivers: valid due to the extent of the problem of drunk drivers. \n\nA roadblock to search cars for illegal drugs: invalid because its only purpose is to detect evidence of a regular crime (in other words, it has nothing to do with driving).\n\n**Addendum to address fixed checkpoints based on comment:**\n\nI came back to this and wanted to expand on the fixed checkpoints, which are checkpoints run by the border patrol inside of the US border. Crossing the checkpoint, a vehicles slow down and officials peer inside. Vehicles may or may not be asked to stop. \n\nBorder officials may operate such checkpoints in order to look inside of crossing vehicles and they may do so [*without a reasonable suspicion*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/428/543/) that the car includes illegal aliens. They also do not have to be approved in advance, so there is [no prior evidence\\-gathering needed](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/387/523/case.html) to put one up. Further, officials can point a car to a secondary pull\\-off location for limited inquiry, also without a reasonable suspicion. It does not require the higher standard because the nature of the secondary pull\\-off search is not as intrusive as that of a roving stop (where the official is part of a roving patrol and may stop vehicles *but does require a reasonable suspicion.*).

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The tenant must immediately pay the pet deposit and all back fees to comply with the landlord's policy.\n\nB) The landlord can modify the lease unilaterally to include the pet fee, as it was clearly a mistake.\n\nC) The tenant is not obligated to pay any pet deposit or fee unless they voluntarily agree to a lease modification.\n\nD) The tenant can be evicted for violating the landlord's pet policy, regardless of what the lease states.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Kansas renter rights, the terms of the signed lease take precedence over the landlord's general policies. If the lease doesn't specify a pet deposit or fee, the landlord cannot charge one retroactively or claim a violation. The tenant is bound by the terms of the lease as written, not by policies that were mistakenly omitted. The landlord's mistake doesn't override the legally binding contract, and the tenant isn't obligated to pay unless they agree to modify the lease.

The materials were discovered while a potential buyer was touring his house. \n\nAlthough I vehemently condemn the KKK, doesn't this officer have the right to display whatever he wants in his home so long as it doesn't actively and deliberately call for violence? Aren't these articles protected under the first amendment? I realize this is an extreme example, and as a police officer his job requires interacting with all races, but unless it can be shown that he's bigoted and that it negatively affected his job performance, isn't it illegal to fire him? \n\nEmployers can restrict speech according to company policy while at work, but we all have to go home at some point. Can those restrictions follow us after clocking out? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [In general, employers in the United States are free to fire you for your speech.](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/28831/37) The First Amendment does not apply to anyone except the government (other than a narrow set of circumstances where private parties act on behalf of the government or take on government roles, like when private universities employ campus police). If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question \\-\\- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" That\u2019s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off\\-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government *is* involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In [*Pickering v. Board of Education*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/391/563/), the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. *Pickering* imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see [*Pappas v. Giuliani*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1355900.html), where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off\\-duty time.\n\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job *requires* maintaining good relations with the community. In *Pappas*, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A police officer in a public department is found to have KKK materials displayed in his home.

In cases involving public employees' speech, the Supreme Court established the Pickering balancing test. This test requires weighing the employee's First Amendment rights against the government's interest in efficient operation. For police departments, maintaining public trust and effective community relations is a significant consideration. While the officer does have First Amendment protections, they are not absolute in the context of public employment. The department must consider both the officer's rights and the potential impact on its operations and community relations. Simply proving direct job performance issues (option B) is not the only factor, and the First Amendment does offer some protections, contrary to options A and D."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58474/can-i-use-the-governments-seals-and-logos-without-its-permission", "docs_id": 58474, "title": "Can I use the government&#39;s seals and logos without its permission?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it permissible to use a governmental seal for editorial purposes in a magazine?\n\nFor example, in a news story about the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, could I use ATF's logo to accompany the story?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes.\n====\n\nThe First Amendment permits you to use the seal of a government agency to illustrate a story about that government agency. The government can no more prohibit you from displaying its seals for expressive purposes than it can prohibit you from displaying its flag.\n\nThe questions raised about possible trademark violations and implied endorsement are red herrings. [Section 2(b) of the Lanham Act](https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-15-commerce-and-trade/chapter-22-trademarks/subchapter-i-the-principal-register/section-1052-trademarks-registrable-on-principal-register-concurrent-registration) prohibits registering a trademark that \"consists of or comprises the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the United States, or of any State or municipality,\" so the government therefore may not trademark its seals. [*In re City of Houston*, 731 F.3d 1326, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013\\)](https://casetext.com/case/in-re-city-of-hous) (\"As the nature of the mark is not disputed in this appeal \u2014 Houston admits that its city seal is an insignia under \u00a7 2(b) of the Lanham Act \u2014 the Board properly affirmed the examining attorney's refusal to register Houston's city seal.\")\n\nEven if the seal were a protected trademark, the context of its use \\-\\- in an editorial setting rather than for commercial purposes \\-\\- is protected by the First Amendment. For instance, in [*Renna v. Cty. of Union, N.J.*, 88 F. Supp. 3d 310, 323 (D.N.J. 2014\\)](https://casetext.com/case/renna-v-cnty-of-union-6), a county tried to stop a television host from using its seal in advertisements for a show about community affairs. The court noted first that the seal was not protected by trademark law, and that even if it was, the county's efforts to limit the host's expression would run afoul of the First Amendment:\n\n> Consider that the First Amendment prohibits a State from criminalizing the desecration of the United States flag as a form of political protest. ... Should a county, by means of an artful extension of trademark law, be permitted to quash political expression that uses its Seal? I think such an extension would be both unwarranted and Constitutionally risky.\n\nThe same is true of implied endorsements. The First Amendment does not permit the government to limit your expression because it thinks people might mistake it for government speech.\n\nFor instance, [*Rothamel v. Fluvanna Cty.*, 810 F. Supp. 2d 771 (W.D. Va. 2011\\)](https://casetext.com/case/rothamel-v-fluvanna-county), a county government adopted a law \"prohibiting the display of the Fluvanna County seal unless expressly authorized by the Fluvanna County Board of Supervisors.\" The law was prompted by concerns about a blogger who had been using the county's seal in stories about county government, and there were reports that some people thought the seal indicated that the stories were official county publications. When a blogger challenged the law, the federal court entered a permanent injunction against enforcing it:\n\n> The County takes the position that the showing of the seal by private citizens is not a form of expression at all; rather, the seal is government property, like a government vehicle or other form of personal property. ... While the County is correct that Rothamel does not have the right to take possession of a physical seal owned by the County, the County cannot control all privately\\-owned images or representations of the seal simply by declaring an interest in managing its own property.

I've actually  [answered this exact question](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56796/3209) from a pure US point of view, but your EU reference does throw a wrench into that analysis. Briefly summarizing my answer, *Kirtsaeng* does indeed shield the importer from liability under US law.\n\nHowever, here the book is being imported into Poland and so the transaction may not necessarily be legitimate under Polish/EU copyright law. You are correct in assuming that EU first sale doctrine is not as generous as the US counterpart. Per *[Infosoc (Copyright) Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32001L0029&from=EN)* Article 4(2\\), first sale doctrine is only triggered in the EU on first sale within its territory, unlike the US where the doctrine is triggered on first global sale. Therefore, under Article 4(1\\), the distribution rights of importing a book into Poland from outside the EU remains with the copyright holder.\n\nEdit: Though the transaction might itself be illegal from Amazon's perspective, being a commercial violation of distribution rights, even if you're considered the importer, there's a chance you are yourself not in violation of copyright law. EU law allows countries to implement personal use exceptions (Article 5(2\\)(a), Article 5(4\\)). From what I recall, most of continental Europe does indeed implement some form of personal use exception, though details vary by country. I've run out of time for now, but I'll probably later research Polish specific law here (though I don't know the language, so no idea how far I'll get).\n\nNow the reason I said there was some guesswork, is that there are details you wouldn't necessarily be aware of that would make this legal, and Amazon as a large enterprise would generally take into account legal considerations. Just because the book says unauthorized for distribution outside India, doesn't mean the publisher / copyright holder didn't later make separate contractual relations with Amazon to allow it.

Under EU copyright law, specifically the Infosoc (Copyright) Directive Article 4(2), the first sale doctrine is only triggered on the first sale within EU territory. This differs from US law, where the doctrine applies globally. Since the book was originally distributed in India, the EU first sale doctrine would not apply. The distribution rights for importing the book into Poland from outside the EU would still belong to the copyright holder, making the transaction likely illegal under EU copyright law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Kirtsaeng case applies to US law, not EU law. \n\nOption C is too absolute; while Amazon may consider legal implications, it doesn't guarantee the legality of every transaction.\n\nOption D, while acknowledging a possibility, is not the most accurate statement based on the information provided.

That means that a threat is communicating an intent to do something: it is *not* doing the thing. In order to constitute a threat against A, B would have to communicate to A the intent to reveal, rather than just directly revealing. If we assume that that did not happen, the act would not fit the description of a threat.\n\n**Wiretapping**\n\nThere is also [Ch. 9\\.73](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73&full=true#9.73.030), which includes the \"wiretapping\" law. (RCW 9\\.73\\.030, labeled \"Intercepting, recording, or divulging private communication\"). Washington is an all\\-party consent state meaning that all parties have to consent to a recording. Since email is an electronic means of communication and that is all that is required to be within the scope of the law, it might seem that this could be a violation of the wiretapping law. Nevertheless, the law says that\n\n> Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, it shall be unlawful for\n>  any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or the state of\n>  Washington, its agencies, and political subdivisions to intercept, or\n>  record\n\nand notice that the word \"divulge\" is not included in the law. Both parties clearly know that the conversation is being \"recorded\". The section does eventually include \"divulging\" as a permitted (not prohibited) acts:\n\n> (4\\) An employee of any regularly published newspaper, magazine, wire\n>  service, radio station, or television station acting in the course of\n>  bona fide news gathering duties on a full\\-time or contractual or\n>  part\\-time basis, shall be deemed to have consent to record and divulge\n>  communications or conversations otherwise prohibited by this chapter\n>  if the consent is expressly given or if the recording or transmitting\n>  device is readily apparent or obvious to the speakers.\n\nThe section has a number of places where it is specified that one can legally divulge a communication, and nowhere does it prohibit divulging information (recording and intercepting are prohibited, but not divulging). Consequently, those parts of the statutes are without effect. In such a case, the courts are likely to re\\-interpret the wording of the statute so that it is sensible to talk about \"divulging\" (the court always find an intent underlying the words of a legislative body). It might then turn out that the court would find that the statutes also prohibit divulging without consent. One [local attorney](https://rhodeslegalgroup.com/recording-conversations-and-communications-in-washington/) claims that the law \"punishes you if you publish the recording\", without explaining the authority for that conclusion (anyhow, passing on a copy of the emails is not \"publishing\").", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Washington state, Person B has ended an online intimate relationship with married Person A by revealing their communications to A's spouse.

(I don't care if I lose my US citizenship, but I am not willing to naturalize in the UK if it costs my me Irish citizenship)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In summary:\n\n1. Statute law allows Ireland to revoke your naturalisation on the grounds of acquiring another citizenship.\n2. But this law has recently been found unconstitutional.\n3. In practice, the government does not do this anyway.\n4. In the case of the UK, it is particularly unlikely.\n5. As an Irish citizen, there is no particular reason to pursue UK naturalisation.\n\nThe law\n-------\n\nAs of now, the possibility deprivation of Irish nationality for any reason is unclear, because of a ruling of the Supreme Court (*Damache v Minister for Justice* \\[2020] IESC 63\\) that declared the statute allowing for this to be unconstitutional. That was because the law (section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956\\) did not provide enough procedural safeguards. The Minister would initiate the process and make the final decision after expert advice, but was not an \"independent and impartial decision\\-maker\". It is now for the legislature to replace section 19 so as to cure the defect.\n\nUnder section 19, the grounds for revoking a certificate of naturalisation include:\n\n> (b) that the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State\n\nand\n\n> (e) that the person to whom it is granted has by any voluntary act, other than marriage or entry into a civil partnership, acquired another citizenship.\n\nThe issue in *Damache* was (b) following the appellant's conviction for terrorism offences in the United States. Regarding (e), it would seem on its face that acquiring UK nationality might trigger the possibility of revocation. However, in the scenario envisaged, that would leave you without any EU nationality, and in the *Tjebbes* case of 2019 (ECLI:EU:C:2019:189\\) the European Court of Justice found that such deprivation would only be possible after consideration of the specific consequences for the person concerned and their family. This point was not reached in *Damache* but would also tend to rule out any \"automatic\" loss of nationality; it would have to be the result of some longer and more involved process. Whatever replaces section 19 would have to be of this kind.\n\nSpecial considerations also apply if loss of Irish nationality would leave you stateless, but that is not the issue in question.\n\nThe policy\n----------\n\nAside from cases of immigration fraud and terrorism, the State has rarely initiated processes under section 19\\. In fact, official guidance on immigration and nationality admits a policy of dual nationality being allowed.\n\nFor the United Kingdom, there are many people who are dual British and Irish nationals. The understanding between the governments with respect to the Common Travel Area, the Good Friday Agreement, and the general historic situation, would make it very unlikely that Ireland would treat acquisition of British nationality as a problem. The British\\-Irish Agreement of 1998 includes that both governments respect the \"right to hold both British and Irish citizenship\" for the people of Northern Ireland. Even if you are not a person of Northern Ireland, any action by the government of Ireland that would be seen as potentially touching on this right is politically untenable.\n\nIrish citizens have full rights in the UK anyway\n------------------------------------------------\n\nUnder UK law, an Irish citizen can enter without a visa, live there as long as they want, get a job, claim benefits, vote in elections, be elected as an MP, and do everything that a UK citizen can normally do. There may be a vanishingly few exceptions for national security jobs.\n\nBecause of this, there isn't much reason why being naturalised in the UK would be worthwhile. You could do so for sentimental reasons but as far as the UK's concerned, you already hold a status that's just as good.\n\nExtra note: UK honours\n----------------------\n\n(In response to a comment below.)\n\nThe British Crown does grant honours, including knighthoods, to non\\-UK citizens and dual/multiple citizens, in some circumstances. It depends on whether the other nationality has King Charles III as head of state, and the attitude of the foreign government. Therefore, Canadians do not get knighthoods (Charles is King but the Canadian government would rather not), Belizians do (Charles is King and the government is fine with it), and Americans can get it as an honorary award that does not come with the Sir/Dame title.\n\nFor Ireland, Terry Wogan is an example of how this works. He was an Irish citizen who lived and worked in the UK for many years. In order to receive a British knighthood, he had to take up British citizenship (which was granted on an expedited basis), becoming Sir Terry. On the other hand, Bob Geldof is an Irish citizen (only) who holds an honorary British KBE, and is not formally entitled to be Sir Bob \\- much like American recipients such as Rudy Guiliani. The Irish government does not object to either possibility, although some individuals do.\n\nAn American\\-Irish\\-British triple citizen would be able to receive a UK knighthood and use the title Sir, assuming that the British government was willing to grant it, and unless there were some foreign legal blocker (e.g. the U.S. government does not allow federal officeholders to receive overseas decorations).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: John, a US citizen by birth with Irish citizenship by descent, is considering moving to the UK and becoming a naturalized British citizen.

Those usually include parts about not posting content that goes against the rules or laws. If the user goes against the terms, then they're the one who's responsible; if the forum owner is promoting things that are illegal, then they're the one who's responsible. For example, if they started a thread linking to pirated content and others comment on it, it's still the owner's responsibility for having posted it in the first place even if they didn't know it was pirated at the time. The site owner could change the terms at any time, but changing the terms won't change who was responsible for going against the country's laws. \n\nIn short, if a user posts something against Russian law, it's usually the user who's responsible and if the forum owner wants to moderate those sorts of things it's entirely optional.

Users are generally responsible for their own posts, especially if they violate the site's terms of service or local laws. However, forum owners may also bear responsibility in certain cases, such as if they actively promote or encourage illegal content. The presence or absence of a license agreement or registration requirement doesn't fundamentally change user responsibility, but it can affect how clearly the site's rules are communicated. Forum moderation is generally considered optional from a legal standpoint, though it may be advisable for maintaining the site's reputation and avoiding potential legal issues.

If it doesn't apply, then an IP block is superfluous.\n\nWhether GDPR applies is determined by Art 3 GDPR. For this, we must distinguish where the data controller is operating from. It is irrelevant where the site is hosted, but primarily relevant where the data controller (your colleague) has an \u201cestablishment\u201d, e.g. where he resides or typically works from.\n\n* Per Art 3(1\\), GDPR applies to all processing activities in the context of an European establishment, regardless of where the users are.\n\nSo if your colleague were running this site from Europe, they wouldn't be able to circumvent GDPR by blocking European users. However, if your colleague is running this site from outside of Europe, then Art 3(1\\) doesn't trigger.\n* Per Art 3(2\\), GDPR can apply to processing activities where there is no European establishment.\n\nThere is the Art 3(2\\)(a) \u201ctargeting criterion\u201d: if your colleague \u201coffers\u201d goods or services to people who are in Europe, regardless whether paid or gratis, then GDPR applies to all processing activities related to this offer. I'll discuss this more below.\n\nThere is also the Art 3(2\\)(b) criterion: if your colleague monitors the behaviour of people that occurs in Europe, then GDPR applies. For example, an app collecting geolocation information or a website creating interest profiles for ad targeting might trigger this criterion.\n\nAn IP block can help to establish that no offering/monitoring related to people who are in Europe is happening, but it might not be necessary.\n\nIt may be worth talking a bit more about the targeting criterion.\nThe GDPR explicitly says that mere availability of a website in Europe doesn't imply that GDPR would apply. Instead, it is necessary to establish the data controller's *intention* \u2013 are they soliciting users from Europe, or otherwise expecting that people from Europe might use those services? Recital 23 gives a couple of non\\-exhaustive factors that can be considered here, for example:\n\n* the site uses a language or currency used in the EU but not used in the controller's own country\n* the site mentions users or customers from Europe, e.g. in testimonials\n\nThis means that a lot of US websites, written in English or Spanish, only mentioning payment in USD (if any), not mentioning any European countries, will not be subject to GDPR.\n\nThen, occasional European visitors are irrelevant. It wouldn't be necessary to IP\\-block potential European users. However, such an IP\\-based block would help establish that the data controller really doesn't intend for those services to be offered to people who are in Europe. My personal opinion is that it's wasted effort to block users from foreign countries in case their foreign laws claim to apply, but if such a block brings peace of mind that might be worth it.\n\nWhile geoblocking might not be *necessary*, is it *sufficient*? There is no clear guidance on this subject, but it seems to be generally accepted that IP\\-based geoblocking is fine, even though it is trivially circumvented using VPN services. Of course, if a website were to block European IP addresses but were to also advertise that people in Europe can use their services via VPNs, that would probably still be an \u201coffer\u201d and might defeat the point of doing any geoblocking.\n\nThe Art 3(1\\)(a) targeting criterion is most easily applied to things like ecommerce where physical goods are shipped to the customer in return for payment \u2013 so essentially whenever the data controller participates in the EU Single Market. This is roughly similar to the concept of a Nexus in US tax law. But in principle the targeting criterion can also apply to other kinds of websites or apps such as blogs, even if they are gratis. GDPR does not just apply to for\\-profit commercial activity, and doesn't distinguish between controllers that are entities/LLCs and controllers who are natural persons.\n\nThings are slightly more complicated due to the Art 3(2\\)(b) monitoring criterion and the pervasive use of online trackers on websites, but this aspect of the GDPR is difficult to enforce and frequently ignored.\n\nIn this answer, \u201cEurope\u201d means the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), and the United Kingdom (UK).

He doesn't respond to text messages either. He has not taken the initiative to have his son for a visit. He has not responded to a letter the boy dictated to me which we sent through the mail.\n\nWhat is a succinct way of describing the fact that the father has, in essence, abandoned the child emotionally? (He is still paying child support.) I need a succinct description for the purposes of letting the child's school know, so they can be sensitive to the child's feelings. (He is relieved not to be living half\\-time with his father, who was abusive, but at the same time he is devastated at the total lack of contact.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In a case like this I would consider creating a Parenting Plan to cover details around visitation and communication and advance notice issues. Create the plan to be fair, and include specifics (like using email, and specifying the addresses). \n\nPetition the court to accept the parenting plan as it is necessary for effective co\\-parenting of the child.\n\nParenting plans can cover any issues which there needs to be common agreement on, such as accomplishing school work, diet, medical care and do on.

A Parenting Plan can cover specifics about visitation, communication, and other important aspects of co-parenting. It aims to enhance stability for the child and can address issues like school work, diet, and medical care. This approach recognizes that both parents have obligations beyond financial support and provides a structured framework for co-parenting, even when one parent is currently non-participative.

This is true in the US, and also in most of not all ,other countries.\n\nRights in the image and likeness of a person vary among US states, and also between different countries. In most US states any such rights end with the persona's death, or only continue for a few years after death (10 years in some cases). The year of birth is not, as far as I know relevant. The exact length of such rights should be checked if any person being pictured is alive or has died fairly recently. Such rights can protect against the commercial use of even an original (not copied) representation of the person's likeness.\n\nAbout Einstein\n--------------\n\n[Greenlight](http://albert-einstein.org/gotocorbis.html) claims to represent Hebrew University of Jerusalem and to hold marketing rights on images of Einstein for publicity purposes. This is mentioned in \"[Who Owns Einstein's Face?](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/04/who-owns-einsteins-face/237911/)\" From *The Atlantic*\n\nHebrew University of Jerusalem sued GM over the use of an image of Einstein in an advertisement. However, they ultimately lost. As reported by [CDAS](https://cdas.com/einstein-publicity-rights-deemed-expired-by-california-federal-court/):\n\n> United States District Judge A. Howard Matz rejected Hebrew University\u2019s claim that New Jersey common law provides for an indefinite duration of the postmortem right of publicity, or that it alternatively is coextensive with copyright law and lasts for a minimum of 70 years after a person\u2019s death. Instead, the Court ruled that New Jersey common law postmortem publicity rights endure for no more than 50 years after a person\u2019s death. Because Einstein died in 1955, the Court\u2019s ruling means that Einstein\u2019s publicity rights are now in the public domain.\n\n...\n\n> Judge Matz concluded that the New Jersey Supreme Court would likely limit the postmortem right of publicity under New Jersey common law to endure no more than 50 years after a person\u2019s death. He noted that the New Jersey Legislature has twice declined to enact a statutory postmortem right of publicity, and given the sparse New Jersey case law on the issue, \u201cit is likely that the New Jersey Supreme Court would perceive pitfalls in allowing an unlimited or lengthy term to the right of publicity.\u201d Comparing the right of publicity to New Jersey\u2019s common law right of privacy, the Court recognized that 50 years was a \u201creasonable middle ground\u201d to allow a deceased celebrity\u2019s heir to benefit from the right of publicity, while still respecting the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in free expression.\u201d\n\n[*Mercury News*](https://www.mercurynews.com/2012/10/18/gms-use-of-einstein-image-tasteless-but-not-illegal-judge-says/) reported on the same case, saying:\n\n> But the judge said descendants\u2019 right to control someone\u2019s image after his death must be balanced with the public\u2019s right of expression.\n\n> He also ruled any right Hebrew University had to sue expired in 2005 \u2014 50 years after Einstein\u2019s death \u2014 because that was the limit on copyright law in 1982, when Hebrew University acquired Einstein\u2019s right of publicity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A game developer is creating an educational card game featuring philosophers, including some born in the last 100 years.

As seen in the case involving Einstein's image, different states and countries have different laws and precedents. In the Einstein case, a federal court ruled that New Jersey's common law postmortem publicity rights last no more than 50 years after death.

Under French law, interns are not considered to be \"regular\" employees (\"salari\u00e9s\") and almost all aspects regarding interns are governed by specific laws, if any. \n\nThe general rule is that interns do not have paid holiday per say, but rather off\\-work days, i.e. days during which the employer allows the intern not to come to work, aside from certain circumstances such as parental leave for which the interns have \"proper\" leave. These days off can be paid but not necessarily. \n\nThe law doesn't state anything specific regarding any paid leave you may have left at the end of the contract. You would have to read your contract (which I assume you have done already) and perhaps the \"convention collective\" which is the collective labor agreement which is specific to the company's field of work.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A French intern is completing a six-month internship in France.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Interns are not considered regular employees (\"salari\u00e9s\") under French law, so the standard regulations for paid leave compensation do not automatically apply to them.\n\n2.

As stated in the documentation, \"Each of those people has the right to seek compensation independent of the others.\" This principle holds true even when multiple parties are affected by the same wrongful act. The settlement between two parties does not automatically bar other injured parties from pursuing their own claims.

The documentation states that the worker should have seen a registered Australian doctor and received a Workers Compensation certificate to initiate the claim process. Additionally, benefits are typically suspended if the worker leaves the country, although there may be exemptions for temporary workers. The worker's failure to follow these procedures and their departure from Australia before treatment make the claim process potentially very difficult, although not impossible.

The USPTO does not treat all \"downloadable software\" as identical. According to the documentation, claiming registration for \"downloadable software\" in class 009 would be rejected as too broad.

Our insurance company wrote us a check to cover some of the hail damage.\n\nAfter emphatically explaining how amazing his replacement windows are, he produced an iPad and asked me to \"sign\". I foolishly squiggled on the screen.

Thank you!\n> * I confirm that my action here represents my electronic signature and is binding.\n\nAt the time I did not write him a check because I wanted to discuss the scope of the job with my wife. The windows in our house are a bit old, so it would make sense to replace them all at once, and not just the ones that sustained hail damage.\n\nAdmittedly, I don't know much about windows (or the legal ramifications of squiggling on an iPad screen). That evening, as a sanity check, I looked at Google/Yelp reviews for the window make/model and saw that almost every review had the lowest possible rating. I reached out to the guy and explained that we could not move forward with his recommendation, and I asked him to quote products that rated highly in Consumer Reports, which he did.\n\nAt that time, he had not ordered any windows from his supplier, so things weren't yet set\\-in\\-stone (even though I had stupidly squiggled on the iPad). A few hours later, we received a quote that was almost twice the previous estimate. Because of the large amount of money at stake, I decided to get a second quote. His quote was 76% more expensive than Lowes for exactly the same product. In cash terms, Lowes was $10k cheaper.\n\nSo, regardless of the squiggle on the iPad, I decided *not* to move forward with the exorbitant quote.

Even though I screwed up by squiggling on the iPad, I think this is a somewhat predatory sales practice. From my perspective, he tried to rip me off and then sent me a bill for the trouble.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, is my position defensible? I did squiggle, after all.\n\nupdate\n------\n\nI took another peek at the electronic document I squiggled on and notice that it's in my wife's name. My name doesn't appear anywhere on the document.

You have agreed, and now you are know the downside of that agreement. However, Colorado law gives you a special privilege to cancel certain contracts, and this may be one: [here is the law](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/crs2017-title-05.pdf).

One exception is that you cannot cancel an agreement for \nan \"emergency requiring immediate remedy\" (there will be paperwork regarding that). A \"home solicitation sale\" is one that\n\n> solicits the sale and the buyer's agreement or offer to purchase is\n>  given to the seller or a person acting for the seller at a residence\n\nwhich matches the facts as you describe them.

However, the law also states that if the seller hasn't complied with certain requirements (such as providing a written agreement with specific information and a statement of buyer's rights), the buyer's right to cancel can extend up to three years after the sale. This makes option C the most accurate and complete answer. Option A is incorrect because the timeframe is too short. Option B is partially correct but doesn't account for the extended cancellation period if the seller doesn't comply with requirements. Option D is incorrect as it doesn't reflect the cancellation rights provided by Colorado law for home solicitation sales."}}
