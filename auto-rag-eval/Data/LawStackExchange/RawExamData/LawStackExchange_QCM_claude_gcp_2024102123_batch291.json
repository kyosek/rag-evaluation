If a particular lie is perjury (thus a violation of law, which defines perjury differently in some different jurisdictions) when uttered to the government, then uttering that lie to an attorney who is an officer of a court of the same government is perjury. This would not be limited to attorneys acting for a government such as prosecutors or private attorneys general. It would not matter whether the lawyer is representing the person who thus lied, under consideration to provide representation, or neither. It probably would not matter whether the lie is being told in the jurisdiction where the lawyer is an officer of a court, the lawyer was admitted pro hac vice, i.e., for purposes limited to one case, the lawyer does not have an active practice, the lawyer only advises other lawyers and does not represent anyone (such as by performing legal research without a confidentiality privilege), the lawyer is retired (but not diisbarred), the lie involves fraud, or the lawyer tells anyone else the content of the statement that is a lie without the lawyer personally intending to lie (as in \"my client said . . .\"). It probably matters whether the person who is lying knew or should have known that the person to be lied to is an attorney admitted to practice somewhere, or at least is an attorney.\n\nI don't think it's possible to distinguish between lying to the government and lying to an individual who is part of that government, because there is no other way to lie to the government. Even if the lie were told in a letter addressed only to \"Government, State of . . ., \\[capital city, state, and Zip code]\" and a machine opened the letter, scanned it into a computer, and used artificial intelligence to parse it with the AI having been written as free open\\-source software by a nongovernment programmer, if a human being on behalf of the government acts on the letter (including by deciding not to act on it), the lie is to a human who programmed the parsing system and/or to a human who acted on the parsed letter.\n\nUnless there's a law specifically exempting the liar from liability (criminal and civil) when lying to a lawyer (and it would be interesting to theorize about the rationale for such a law), how is it not illegal (unlawful) to lie to a lawyer under the above circumstances?\n\nI have no case involving this possibility. I'm thinking of writing about this, and I've seen various discussions that it's not illegal except for fraud (fraud has at least one additional element that makes it harder to prove than perjury), but none of the discussions I saw cited a source in the law. On the other hand, while I don't follow developments in the law with a practicing lawyer's diligence, I haven't heard of, say, a case against a client for having lied to their lawyer (viz., \"I didn't go to the bank\" while confessing to the police about robbing it in person without recanting the confession), and I imagine a few lawyers would gladly sue people for perjury to them. On the other hand, and this is just my speculation, maybe most lawyers don't think there's much of a problem and that letting the courts decide would create more problems than it's worth.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **No**\n------\n\nA lawyer is considered an \"officer of the court\" in the sense that certain duties to the court are imposed on the lawyer. That does not give the lawyer authority as if the lawyer was part of the court staff, nor a law enforcement officer.\n\nA statement can be prosecuted as perjury only if it is made under oath (or affirmation) in court, or if it is made \"under penalty of perjury\". This is generally done by a statement in a document signed, something like \"I declare under penalty of perjury that all statements in the above document are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.\" It can also be done verbally, with the person making the statement agreeing that it is true and that this is subject to perjury prosecution if it is false. The exact wording will vary, but it must be clear and explicit.\n\nAside from that, false statements to a lawyer are not generally subject to prosecution for perjury, nor otherwise illegal. In some cases a lie in a business transaction may be **fraud**, which is actionable, and possibly criminal. But that will not have anything to do with whether the person lied to is or is not a lawyer.\n\n[This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury) says:\n\n> Perjury is the intentional act of swearing a false oath or falsifying an affirmation to tell the truth, whether spoken or in writing, concerning matters material to an official proceeding.\n\n...\n\n> The rules for perjury also apply when a person has made a statement under penalty of perjury even if the person has not been sworn or affirmed as a witness before an appropriate official. An example is the US income tax return, which, by law, must be signed as true and correct under penalty of perjury\n\nThe US Federal law on perjury, [18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1621](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621) says:\n\n> (1\\) having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true; or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;\n> \n> \n> is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States.\n\n[Title 9 of the Maryland code, section 9\\-101](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2010/criminal-law/title-9/subtitle-1/9-101/) says:\n\n> (a) Prohibited.\\- A person may not willfully and falsely make an oath or affirmation as to a material fact:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) if the false swearing is perjury at common law;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) in an affidavit required by any state, federal, or local law;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) in an affidavit made to induce a court or officer to pass an account or claim;\n> \n> \n> (4\\) in an affidavit required by any state, federal, or local government or governmental official with legal authority to require the issuance of an affidavit; or\n> \n> \n> (5\\) in an affidavit or affirmation made under the Maryland Rules.\n> \n> \n> (b) Penalty.\\- A person who violates this section is guilty of the misdemeanor of perjury and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 10 years.\n\nNothing about statements made to a lawyer not under oath or affirmation, or under penalty of perjury.

I'm currently in the prototyping stage for a product based on that idea. That idea (the solution to the problem of improving that product in certain ways) is patentable according to all the stuff I read about patents. But patents are really expensive: My primary market would be western Europe (member states of the European Patent Convention) and possibly later the US, that would cost a 4\\-digit USD amount upfront and in total a 5\\-digit amount within a couple of years, as far as I can tell.\n\nSo I'm evaluating the possibility of just keeping my invention secret until I'm ready to sell a product based on it and then publishing the full details to make sure no one else can patent it.\n\nQuestion:\n---------\n\nBut when I'm selling such a product: Would competitors need to design a new product based on my idea, involving all the prototyping and too easy to patent but still not trivial problems \\- or would it be legal to take my product apart, put the parts in a 3D scanner and produce the exact same product? Where is the border between what is allowed and what not, exactly?\n\nHypothetical example:\n---------------------\n\nSay I found a new method to make car chassis more aerodynamic. There are certain equations and methods which are applied during the development process, and to keep anyone else from patenting them, I publish them (in my case, the invention is obvious from the final product). Are the competitors allowed to take the chassis I developed and use that, or do they need to design their own using my methods?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Without a patent, your inventions are not protected (except as trade secrets). If you publish your findings, anyone can use them.\n\nIt is possible to patent the specific design of your chassis. Design patents, which cover the specific aesthetic design of something, can be less expensive than utility patents, which cover functional aspects. Although your chassis is designed with functionality in mind, it will also embody an aesthetic design.\n\nThat said, enforcement of patent rights (or any other rights you might hope protect your chassis) is orders of magnitude more expensive (typically millions of dollars) than merely obtaining a patent. Thus, even if you do obtain protection for the chassis design or the method of designing it, your budget may make it impractical to effectively take advantage of those protections, unless a law firm is willing to take the case on contingency."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An inventor develops a new method for making car chassis more aerodynamic and decides to publish the details instead of patenting the invention due to cost concerns.

In which case, my question would be, why are some things that are wrong involving the government considered to be part of civil or criminal law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Civil litigation involves general causes of action that are available to anyone, including both private parties and the government. Civil courts are designed primarily to provide restitution to the injured party.\n\nCriminal courts exist for governments to exercise their police powers: specific, limited authority held only by the government. The principal purposes of criminal law are...well, they're debated, but broadly speaking, it's to punish and/or rehabilitate the criminal and deter future criminals.\n\nBecause criminal conviction can result in jail time and even the death penalty, there are more stringent procedural protections accorded to criminal defendants than there are to civil defendants. So when the government's goal is to recover damages, it's easier for them to use the less burdensoome civil procedures, just the same as anyone else would.\n\nLet me give you an example. Someone steals your identity and runs up $100,000 on your credit card.\n\nYou call the police, and they find someone they think is the guy. To convict him, the police must convince an entire jury panel that he did it, beyond a reasonable doubt\\-\\-a high standard. He pleads the fifth, and without his testimony, the police may not succeed. If they do, he will be sent to jail, and he may also be ordered to give part or all of your money back. If the case is weak, however, the police may not want to spend their limited time on it\\-\\-and that's their call, not yours. (This also applies to government agencies; only law enforcement can bring a criminal case, not any government agency.)\n\nHowever, you can also file a civil lawsuit. In that lawsuit, depending on the jurisdiction, you may only need to convince some of the jury\\-\\-civil verdicts don't always have to be unanimous. You may even just face a judge, with no jury. And the legal standard is a \"preponderance of the evidence,\" which in layman's terms just means \"more likely than not\"\\-\\-a much easier thing to prove. Because the Fifth Amendment doesn't apply to civil litigation, you may even be able to argue before the jury that the defendant's refusal to testify suggests he's guilty.\n\nIn summary: civil lawsuits use different rules and procedures, which may make it easier to recover money (or get other civil relief, such as an injunction) in cases where that's the goal. These courts are open to anyone, including the government. But if the government wants to use its special police powers to put someone in jail or get other criminal relief, they have to use the stricter criminal rules and procedures."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A government agency discovers that a private hospital has been systematically overbilling Medicare for the past five years.

The government is likely to pursue this case civilly for several reasons:\n\n1. Civil litigation has a lower burden of proof (\"preponderance of evidence\" rather than \"beyond reasonable doubt\"), making it easier to win the case.\n2. Civil courts are designed primarily to provide restitution, which aligns with the goal of recovering overpaid funds.\n3. The documentation explicitly mentions that \"the federal government can sue a hospital for overbilling Medicare and Medicaid\" as an example of a civil case.\n\nHowever, the government could potentially also file criminal charges if they believe the overbilling was intentional fraud, as criminal cases involve actions considered harmful to society. The choice between civil and criminal proceedings (or both) would depend on the specific circumstances, evidence available, and the government's priorities in this case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the government is not required to pursue this criminally.

A lawyer acting in such a role in U.S. practice is not limited to providing legal advice and can consider the client's needs more generally.\n\nMany organizations (for profit, non\\-profit, and governmental), however, have a **general counsel** or **corporate counsel** or **chief legal officer** or **county attorney** or **city attorney**, who works full time for the organization who is commonly described as [**in house counsel**](https://www.acc.com/sites/default/files/resources/vl/membersonly/InfoPAK/19654_2.pdf) and serves a similar role for the organization. Sometimes this is a full time position, sometimes, it is a part\\-time position.\n\nGoing back even further in history, this also has similarities to a [**courtier**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtier). @NateEldredge's reference to a **[consigliere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hagen)** in the modern sense of an advisor to an organized crime boss (who might be, but isn't necessarily, a lawyer) also isn't far off and traces back to the more legitimate feudal role of a particular sort of courtier. In modern politics, and less savory \"gray area\" activities corporate and criminal alike, a person who does something similar to this, who is sometimes, but not always, a lawyer, is sometimes also called a **[fixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person))**. @grovkin also suggests in a comment, the title of **handler** which heavily overlaps with the notion of a fixer.\n\nIn federal and state government, such a person would often be a **chief of staff** or a member of a President or Governor's \"kitchen cabinet\", although a **personal lawyer** in addition to the **Attorney General** and attorneys in the Office of Legal Counsel who also serve those roles exist formally as well.\n\nIn the military, sometimes a **staff officer** fills a role similar to this one, especially if that staff officer is a member of the Judge\\-Advocate General's (JAG) corps.\n\nA couple more points not precisely responsive to the question.\n\nFirst, in some science fiction works, including [Kate Elliot's \"The Novels of the Jaran\"](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00GH2G8BA), the future equivalent of pretty much this precise role is called a **Protocol Officer**, effectively envisioning a merger of law, etiquette, and diplomacy in a more civilized world that is not balkanized and instead has only a single universal political system. (See also, e.g., C3PO, a Protocol Droid carrying out a similar role in the Star Wars saga.)\n\nI believe that similar roles (with job titles that have only Chinese or Japanese or Korean language terminology) were present in some of the heavily Confucian influenced monarchies of East Asia, in roles perhaps most analogous to military staff officers for feudal aristocrats and high officials.\n\nSecond, in most civil law countries (in contrast to common law legal system countries), there are lots of people who earn an undergraduate bachelor's level degree in law without seeking to enter a licensed or regulated profession to become a true practicing lawyer in the common law country sense. Instead, these individuals typically seek managerial professional positions in businesses in much the way that a business major with a specialization in marketing or finance or management might. So, unlike, common law countries, in most civil law countries that is a significant population of people with formal legal training who are not lawyers or paralegals in the common law country sense.\n\nI honestly have no idea what kind of job titles people on that career track typically hold, or just how they use their legal training in the course of their careers. It might be that someone like this would sometimes take on the role described in the question, but I don't know enough to know if that is really the case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In modern legal and business contexts, which of the following terms most accurately describes a professional who provides continuous legal counsel and protection to an individual or organization, similar to how a bodyguard provides physical protection?\n\nA) Courtier\nB) Protocol Officer\nC) In-house counsel\nD) Consigliere\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nC) In-house counsel is the most accurate term for a professional who provides continuous legal counsel and protection in modern legal and business contexts.

So that pretty much covers the spectrum here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can be extradited from Country A to Country B even if you are a citizen of neither. What matters is whether B can convince A to do it, which is typically on the basis of a treaty between them as well as provisions of both country's domestic criminal law.\n\nIf you committed a crime in B, then fled to A, your nationality is relevant to the extent that:\n\n* A might not extradite its own citizens, if you are a citizen of A\n* A might have an agreement with C, if you are a citizen of C, that C should have the chance to proscute you instead of B. (This is the *Petruhhin* doctrine in the case where A and C are EU countries and B is not.)\n\nBut you do not have to be a national of B in order for it to have jurisdiction over you in B's domestic criminal law \\- just as if you were *still in B*, they could arrest you in the normal way. They are thus entitled to request A's authorities to arrest you in A, and transfer you to B.\n\nIf your alleged crime was *not* in B, then their claim over you has to be on the basis that their domestic criminal law allows prosecution extraterritorially. This was the case when B was Spain, A was the United Kingdom, and the criminal was former Chilean leader [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet); while his status as a former head of state was relevant, as was whether the crimes were extraterritorial offences in the UK as well, his lack of Spanish nationality was not. A more topical example is B being the United States, A the United Kingdom, and the arrestee being [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange), an Australian who is alleged to have committed various crimes under U.S. law (while not necessarily having been present in the U.S. at the time).\n\nWhile all extradition relationships are different, a common thread of the criminal law *in general* is that what matters is the circumstances at the time of the alleged acts. Retroactively making you a citizen of B may not be satisfactory to A, to the extent that A's criminal law disallows making anything illegal retroactively. The supposed nationality grant by B might trigger provision's of A's domestic extradition law concerning requirements of due process, lack of political interference, and so on, and block the action.\n\nBut equally, renouncing your citizenship of B does not extinguish B's claim over you for acts you did *while* you were a citizen of B.

Stat Ch. 83 Part I](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes./index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0000-0099/0083/0083.html). This is statutorily a tenancy at\\-will unless a contrary agreement is in writing signed by the lessor: the duration of the lease is yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly as determined by the periodicity of rent payments. There are various legal conditions related to rent default and causes for removing tenants, also conditions about premises that are wholly untenantable. Unlike residential leases, there are not any special statutory conditions surrounding the landlords presentation of leases.\n\nFlorida law contemplates and allows the possibility that there are no written documents, and for non\\-residential tenancies has very little to say about it (only pertaining to the distinction between at\\-will vs not at\\-will leases).\n\nTherefore, the matter follows the general rules for contractual disputes: whoever makes the best case for their claims wins. If Bob has a scanned copy, that is excellent proof. If Alice alleges and proves that the scanned copy was modified, that disposes of Bob's evidence. If Alice presents a copy of the contract that says otherwise (I do mean copy), then this anomaly has to be explained. Bob can claim that they tore up Alice's original and renegotiated the deal, but he needs to prove that claim. If Alice presents the original contract, Bob's story becomes much less plausible.

The absence of the original signed lease does not automatically invalidate Bob's claims or favor Alice's position. The unsigned copy stored in the cloud service can be admissible as evidence, but its strength will depend on other factors such as corroborating financial records, photographs, and the credibility of each party's testimony.

It was large text post talking about technology so it's very likely that DMCA notice was without any merit.\n\nI've interacted with support of said website and only recourse they are offering is for me to file counter\\-notice. I obviously don't want to get into that without first at least understand what copyright I'm supposedly infringing upon.\n\nSo, is it possible to request service provider to send me DMCA takedown notice? Isn't there some part of the law that requires them to serve me with notice after post is taken down? This way I don't even know what I would be disputing in counter\\-notice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first question is, would you have any basis for legal action against a service provider in case they arbitrarily delete your contributions: you might, or you might not (read the terms of service, ask your lawyer). Let's assume that there is a legal reason why the provider should leave your material alone. If you are infringing copyright, the provider *might* also get sued for contributing to the infringement, so there is a law DMCA: [17 USC 512](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512)) that says when they are immune to such a suit. The first part of this is that a supposed copyright owner can file a take down notice with the provider, claiming that they are hosting infringing material. But under thatlaw, they must \"take\\[] reasonable steps promptly to notify the subscriber that it has removed or disabled access to the material\". Presumably they did that and inform you about the counter\\-notice provision (although your wording is not clear on this: saying verbatim what they notified you of would be useful).\n\nThat counter\\-notice requires you to identify yourself, etc. and provide\n\n> A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good\n>  faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of\n>  mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or\n>  disabled.\n\nThere is no point in the law requiring the provider to reveal anything about the alleged rights\\-holder, just the fact that the material has been taken down. The law does allow the copyright owner to subpoena requesting information identifying the alleged infringer. There is no provision whereby an alleged infringer can subpoena information about the person filing the original notice. That is because the copyright owner has to file a lawsuit against the infringer (if the infringer files a counter\\-notice and the owner does not file lawsuit, the material must be restored). When you get sued, you will know at that point who is suing you.\n\nYou do not need to know who the rights holder is to file a counter\\-notice. The law says that you have to include\n\n> A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good\n>  faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of\n>  mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or\n>  disabled.\n\nSuppose for example that you illegally copied and pasted the source code for Windows 10\\. You can't seriously believe that you have the right to post that material, so to avoid perjury charges, you would not make such a false statement. Suppose that you copied two lines of protected source code, as examples of some technical point \u2013 then that would be fair use and not infringement. In such a case, the initial take down notice might be found to be abusive and knowingly false. There could be an intermediate situation, where you post a book that you've written and as it happens there is a graphic contained therein which is beyond the scope of fair use \u2013 but you have no idea that this is what they are talking about (maybe you think the graphic is not protected). Then perhaps you can, in good faith, state that the claim \"this work infringes\" is mistaken. This is where you need to talk to a lawyer, to see if you can in good faith deny infringement.\n\nAs the law currently stands, there is little burden of proof on the person filing the take down notice, until the matter is argued in court."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under the DMCA, when a service provider receives a takedown notice and removes content, what is their obligation to the content creator (subscriber)?\n\nA) They must provide the content creator with the full details of the copyright holder who filed the notice\nB) They are required to take reasonable steps to promptly notify the subscriber that the material has been removed or disabled\nC) They must wait for a court order before removing the content or notifying the subscriber\nD) They have no obligation to inform the subscriber of the removal\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, under 17 USC 512 (DMCA), when a service provider receives a takedown notice and removes content, they must \"take[] reasonable steps promptly to notify the subscriber that it has removed or disabled access to the material\".

What happens if I just send the book by mail? Bob would break the law for possession of the banned book, but would I be doing something illegal? What are the possible consequences?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a general rule, most countries have what's called Bi\\-Lateral extradition treaties, which means that Country A (Cedricstan) will only extradite to Country B (Bobtopia) for crimes that were committed in Bobtopia AND are crimes in Cedricstan.\n\nSo, in this scenario, you, a Cedricstan citizen purchase the book \"The Big Book of Banned Things in Bobtopia\" and send it to Bobtopian Bob by international mail. Bobtopian Ministry of Banned Stuff police (BMBS) find Bob in possession of the book and through creative interrogation (cause all countries that ban books are surprisingly creative in interrogation techniques) figure out that you sent it to him. The would file an extradition petition with the Cedricstan Embassy, who then call up the Cedricstan Ministry of Justice (CMJ) and discuss the charges (if there's no extradition treaty, the process is basically the embassy staffer politely taking the note and giving it to the Ambassador, who tries not to laugh too much as he dumps it to the bin. If there isn't even diplomatic relationships, this is the same process, but now it's the Swiss Ambassador laughing instead of a Cedricstan Ambassador).\n\nAnyway, assuming Cedricstan and Bobtopia have an extradition treaty with each other, it's going to be Bi\\-Lateral, meaning Cedricstan will only extradite you for crimes committed in Bobtopia that are also crimes in Cedricstan. So, first off, you did not possess the book while in Bobtopia, so the crime didn't happen in Bobtopia and they have jurisdiction over the crime. The legal ramifications are that of Cedricstan, not Bobtopia, so they apply here. Given you bought the book in Cedricstan, you're likely to not face any legal ramifications (well... more on this in a moment).\n\nSuppose then, we some how get to the point where you are proven to have been in Bobtopia and possessing the book of very naughty knowledge, Bobtopia Ed. In this case, Cedricstan would have to consider if it is a crime here (kinda... more on this as well). Since Cedricstan has Constitutionally protected Freedom of Speech and Press, there is no equivalent crime for possessing Forbidden Knowledge II: Bobtopia Boogaloo, which not only is legal to own, but a Cedricstan Times Best Seller for the 104th week running. So in this case, Cedricstan laughs in Free Speech and refuse to extradite you. There are again, no legal ramifications (well... more on this in a moment... which would be next paragraph).\n\nSo, of course, this assumes you're not going to go to any country ever in the future. Obviously, Bobtopia agents from the BMBS will happily greet you if you ever go to Bobtopia... creatively of course... But you should probably review the diplomatic relationships of other nations with Bobtopia and their laws on banned literature... it could be that their extradition treaties will allow an agent of the third nation to arrest you and extradite you to Bobtopia... if you realize this is about to happen, your best bet is to find a Cedricstan Embassy or Consulate and high tail it there. But otherwise there shoudln't be any issues.\n\nThe other problem here is that nations may have additional rules. For example, the United States does not allow for libel tourism... which is using another nation to sue an American for defamation that doesn't rise to the Defamation under U.S. Law (which is notoriously stricter than most similar nations. Historically, close relations between United States and UK would mean that defamation of a UK person said in the United States could be tried in the UK and the U.S. speaker would be under their jurisdiction... The ban here prevents that by saying the United States would not enforce decisions unless their own courts found the case in a similar way.\n\nOn the other end, Canada will not extradite murderers to the United States, if said Murderer is eligible for the Death Penalty... but a Prosecutor promising to not seek the Death Penalty in sentencing if guilt is found is good enough for Canada to extradite the murderer back.\n\nTL;DR: As long as you stay in your country, you should not be extradited for crimes that are not mutually recognized... be careful when you leave though."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A citizen of Country A sends a book by mail to a friend in Country B, where the book is banned.

Curtilage is the part of your property that is so intimately connected with the home that it treated the same for 4th Amendment purposes. Per [United States v. Dunn](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/480/294/case.html) 480 U.S. 294 (1987\\), a fence doesn't mean everything inside the fence is curtilage (but for a small, city dwelling, the fence is probably going to be considered the curtilage boundary). Not having a fence doesn't mean nothing is curtilage.\n\nAs you say, even if you object to the warrantless inspection, they can probably do a lot of the inspection from outside your curtilage and avoid infringing your 4th Amendment rights.\n\nThe inspectors may choose to return with an inspection warrant. An example statute describing an inspection warrant is [California Code 1822\\.50](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CCP&sectionNum=1822.50):\n\n> An inspection warrant is an order, in writing, in the name of the people, signed by a judge of a court of record, directed to a state or local official, commanding him to conduct any inspection required or authorized by state or local law or regulation relating to building, fire, safety, plumbing, electrical, health, labor, or zoning."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A city government is conducting routine housing inspections.

While inspectors can observe what's visible from public areas without a warrant, they would need to obtain an inspection warrant to enter the curtilage of the property if the homeowner objects. The curtilage is the area immediately surrounding the home that is treated as part of the dwelling for Fourth Amendment purposes. Option D correctly reflects this legal requirement.

The investigation is closed because although the police know who did it, there was no criminality due to the not guilty verdict.\n2. The evidence in the court shows that the accused did not commit the act. Ergo, someone else did. The police will keep looking for that someone else.\n\nNote that the proposed scenario is highly dangerous for you.\n\nFirst, the exculpatory evidence may be inadmissible, particularly if it is an alibi (see [Can I surprise the prosecution with an alibi defense at trial?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/58778/344)). To rely on an an alibi defence, it must be raised with the prosecution before the trial.

The police can continue investigating to find the real perpetrator.

Trespassing is generally defined as entering on property against the expressed will of the owner or lawful occupant, **without lawful authority**. A firefighter is not trespassing when responding to a fire, even if the owner orders the firefighter to leave. A building inspector is not tresspassing while making an inspection (if local law grants an inspector access). Neither is a police officer with a warrant for entry, or a person with a court order to recover property.\n\nIn some cases such lawful authority must be communicated to the owner, in others it need not be, this depends on the nature of the authority and the exact provisions of the governing law.\n\nWhether such a person entering with authority may be armed depends very much on the local law, and the nature of the authority. In some cases and some places such a person is free to be armed, in others this would be illegal.\n\nIf one is lawfully present somewhere and is attacked, one is entitled to defend oneself (or another), although there may be a duty to avoid a confrontation by retreating if this is reasonably possible when not in one's own home in some jurisdictions (such as California). But the use of deadly force (such as a gun) is generally not lawful unless there is an imminent threat of death or serious injury. None of this is legally different when one is lawfully on another's property than when one is in a public place.\n\nCalifornia Law\n--------------\n\nCalifornia Penal Code [section 693](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2020/code-pen/part-2/title-1/chapter-1/section-693/) provides that:\n\n> Resistance sufficient to prevent the offense may be made by the party about to be injured:\n> \n> \n> 1. To prevent an offense against his person, or his family, or some member thereof.\n> 2. To prevent an illegal attempt by force to take or injure property in his lawful possession.\n\nIt should be read together with sections 692 and 694\\.\n\n[Judicial Council of California Criminal Jury Instruction \\#505](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/500/505/) reads:\n\n> The defendant acted in lawful (self\\-defense/ \\[or] defense of another) if:\n> \n> \n> 1.

However, you may only use the degree of force reasonably necessary under the circumstances.\n\nThe page [\"California Self Defense Laws\"](https://www.findlaw.com/state/california-law/california-self-defense-laws.html) from Findlaw reads:\n\n> The right to use force \\-\\- even deadly force if necessary \\-\\- to defend oneself is a broadly accepted principle of the criminal justice system. But while all states allow defendants to claim self defense if they can back up such claims, states differ on the scope of what may be considered appropriate use of force and when it may be applied. ... As a general rule of thumb, any force used against an intruder must be proportionate to the harm reasonably feared.\n\nIn [*People v. King* {Crim. No. 20380\\. Supreme Court of California. August 29, 1978\\.}](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/22/12.html) The California Supreme Court held that self\\-defense was a possible defense to a charge of possession of a handgun by a felon, and wrote about the right of self\\-defense in CA law. The opinion reads:\n\n> \\[I]t is apparent that the conviction cannot stand if the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury regarding the right of self\\-defense as it related to the section 12021 charge. ...\n> \n> \n> When enacting section 12021 and its predecessor statute, the Legislature is presumed to have been aware of the several existing statutes giving any person the right to use force, including deadly force in appropriate circumstances, in defense of self or others. This right has been included in provisions of the Penal Code since its enactment in 1872\\. Section 692 provides:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Lawful resistance to the commission of a public offense may be made:\n> > \n> > \n> > 1. By the party about to be injured;\n> > 2.

Ceballos*, supra, 12 Cal.3d 470\\) none of these sections has been amended to restrict the rights affirmed therein since its adoption over a century ago.\n> \n> \n> Civil Code section 50, affirms the same rights, providing:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Any necessary force may be used to protect from wrongful injury the person or property of oneself, or of a wife, husband, child, parent, or other relative, or member of one's family, or of a ward, servant, master, or guest.\n> > It, too, was adopted in 1872, and it was amended in 1874 to expand the right of defense first declared to encompass guests. Similarly the provisions of sections 197 and 198 governing the circumstances in which homicide is justifiable were included in the Penal Code of 1872, and are traceable to the Statutes of 1850\\.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Use of a concealable firearm in self\\-defense is neither a crime nor an unlawful purpose. ... We conclude, therefore, that the prohibition of section 12021 was not intended to affect a felon's right to use a concealable firearm in self\\-defense, but was intended only to prohibit members of the affected classes from arming themselves with concealable firearms or having such weapons in their custody or control in circumstances other than those in which the right to use deadly force in self\\-defense exists or reasonably appears to exist. Thus, when a member of one of the affected classes is in imminent peril of great bodily harm or reasonably believes himself or others to be in such danger, and without preconceived design on his part a firearm is made available to him, his temporary possession of that weapon for a period no longer than that in which the necessity or apparent necessity to use it in self\\-defense continues, does not violate section 12021\\. As in all cases in which deadly force is used or threatened in self\\-defense, however, the use of the firearm must be reasonable under the circumstances and may be resorted to only if no other alternative means of avoiding the danger are available. In the case of a felon defending himself alone, such alternatives may include retreat where other persons would not be required to do so."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, a convicted felon, is lawfully present on Jane's property to retrieve his belongings as per a court order.

The idea is that when enough states agree to the scheme such that they hold a majority of electors (which can change over time, so to be stable you need more than a simple majority), then they vow to vote for the winner of the national election.

If they don't want to reimburse you, they have to tell you so in writing before you incur any costs. That way it's your decision if you still want to go if you have to pay for expenses yourself.\n\nIt does *not* mean your expenses have to be paid, it means you should *know beforehand* whether they *will* be paid.\n\nSo what I take from your story is that you never actually asked the company for reimbursement, expecting the Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit to pay that for you. Well, no company is going to pay your expenses *if you don't ask for it*. And that's not a crime. You also never *told* the Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit that you were not informed beforehand that your expenses would not be paid. They asked for proof, you delivered proof. It's not their job to find out how or when you got handed this written statement and if that constitutes a violation of \u00a7670\\. \n\nAnd as a little reality check: paying your expenses (probably something along the lines of a cab fare or bus ticket?) is way more cost effective for the AA than suing a small company for the same amount.

In the UK, repair shops generally have a right of lien, which allows them to retain possession of the repaired item until payment is received. However, this doesn't grant them the right to sell the item immediately or claim ownership.

For example, in the United States, works of commentary, criticism, research, teaching, or news reporting may be considered fair use.

All the other videos (source videos) have been released under a permissive license whch permits reuse, and the new video complies with any conditions specified in the license or licenses. (Such conditions probably include giving attribution, that is proper credit, to the source videos. This usually means displaying the author and title, as well as providign a link to the source.)\n\nIf this is true, the use is not copyright infringement. If this is true of only **some** source vids, the new vid will not be an infringement of those vids.\n2. If all the source videos are in the public domain. This is somewhat unlikely, but possible if they are copies of films from sufficiently long ago that their copyrights expired. Also, works created by an officer or employee of the US Federal Government in the course of that person's official duties are generally in the public domain (although not if the work was created by a contractor rather than an employee. For example, many NASA vids are in the public domain.\n\nIf **this** is true, the use is not copyright infringement. Again, if this is true of only **some** source vids, the new vid will not be an infringement of those vids. No attribution is legally required for public domain vids.\n3. If the creator of the new vid has asked for and received permission from the copyright owners of all source videos, and has complied with any conditions of those permissions. This may involve paying a fee to the source owners, and is very likely to involve proper attribution, but each owner can set whatever conditions that owner pleases.\n\nIf **this** is true, the use is not copyright infringement. Again, if this is true of only **some** source vids, the new vid will not be an infringement of those vids. However, all conditions must be carefully com,plied with.\n4. If the creator of the new video is located in or under the jurisdiction of the US (or the copyright owner of the source is under US jurisdiction), and the creator asserts that the use is a ***Fair Use***. Fair use is an intentionally vagus concept, and it is always decided on a case\\-by\\-case basis. Whether a use is a fair use is highly fact\\-based, that is the specific facts of the individual case matter a lot. Often important is whether the use will harm the market for the sourer, and whether the use is **transformative**. A Use is \"transformative\" if it is used for a significantly different purpose than the original was. Transformative uses are more likely to be considered fair uses.

The creator should carefully consider fair use principles, which may allow for the use of short clips for purposes such as commentary or criticism. However, fair use is complex and case-specific, so seeking legal advice is advisable for unclear situations.

There are tax reasons not to make zero interest loans to related parties (unpaid interest at a low market rate is deemed income to the lender for income tax purposes, followed by a gift from the lender to the borrower for gift tax purposes), but no substantive contact law ones in U.S. jurisprudence.\n\nConsideration is a greatly degraded doctrine, but normally, the consideration in this transaction in a suit by a lender to enforce the contract would be obvious. The loan is made for the consideration that it must be repaid later.\n\nA promise to make an interest free loan in the future might face more consideration problems as a barrier to enforcement by someone seeking to now receive a zero rate interest loan from the person who promised to make one without getting anything in return for that promise.\n\nIndeed, there are standard commercial terms for such arrangements that are used routinely, such as \"thirty days net\" which means paid for with an interest free loan due thirty days after the day of the invoice. Similarly, there are examples of zero interest government bonds.\n\nThis said, promissory estoppel remains good law and is often pleaded in the alternative with breach of contract in any remotely atypical basically contractual transaction. Promissory estoppel is almost identical to breach of contract but substitutes detrimental reliance on a promise for consideration.\n\n**Footnote:**\n\n> (N.B.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding ABC Inc's potential legal recourse?\n\nA) ABC Inc can successfully sue XYZ Corp for fraud, as the mere act of submitting a forged document is sufficient grounds for damages.\nB) ABC Inc has no legal recourse, as they didn't rely on or suffer damages from the forged document.\nC) ABC Inc can only pursue criminal charges against XYZ Corp for attempted fraud.\nD) ABC Inc cannot sue for fraud, but may have other legal options including reporting the incident to the court for potential sanctions against XYZ Corp.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate. In a civil fraud case, the plaintiff typically needs to prove reliance on the fraudulent information and resulting damages. Since ABC Inc immediately recognized the document as fake and didn't rely on it, they likely can't sue for fraud successfully. However, submitting forged documents to the court is a serious matter that could result in sanctions or other consequences. The court may impose penalties for attempting to deceive the court, even if the deception was unsuccessful. Additionally, while criminal charges might be possible, ABC Inc as a private party cannot directly \"pursue\" criminal charges - that decision lies with prosecutors.

It seems like the TOS is a contract, and it would specifically need to say in the contract that enforcement is at the company's discretion. Does Facebook have such a clause? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, and yes\n-----------\n\n**The No part**\n\nA right is not an obligation: having the right to free speech does not mean that you have to speak freely for example.\n\nA contract (including ToS) grants rights and obligations on each party. In general these are complementary, one party's right is the other party's obligation: the citizen's right to not be unlawfully detained imposes an obligation on the state not to unlawfully detain its citizens, for example.\n\nEnforcement of a contract (either through internal processes like moderation of content, or externally through courts and tribunals) implies that there is a breach of an obligation by one party and a consequent infringement of a right belonging to the other. The choice to seek enforcement is *entirely* at the discretion of the person whose right was violated \\- if they choose not to enforce their right then this is a [waiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiver).\n\n**The No part**\n\nWaivers happen all the time because contracts are breached in immaterial or inconsequential ways and people just move on. \n\nMany contracts contain a clause to the effect that a waiver does not amount to a permanent waiver and that they reserve their rights on future breaches. This is important because a contract is more than the written agreement; it involves the entire conduct of the parties. Without such a clause in say a lease contract, a lessor who has waived their right to terminate the lease for late payment of the rent in the past may be barred from executing that right in the future.\n\nSimilarly, where a company has the same contract with many parties: their behaviour in dealing with the same breach by Party A, B, C \\& D may be relevant in how they deal with that breach by Party E. If they are not consistent, and the inconsistency is arbitrary, malicious or unlawfully discriminatory, then they can be in trouble.

As explained in the documentation, having the right to enforce rules does not create an obligation to do so. Companies can choose when and how to enforce their ToS, and this selective enforcement is typically considered a waiver of rights rather than a breach of contract. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because inconsistent enforcement alone does not constitute a breach of contract. \n\nAnswer C is partially correct in that unlawful discrimination could potentially create liability, but it's not the most likely outcome in this scenario. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because even without a specific clause stating that enforcement is discretionary, companies generally have this discretion by default."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/75080/can-i-be-held-liable-for-accidental-damage-to-my-company-laptop", "docs_id": 75080, "title": "Can I be held liable for accidental damage to my company laptop?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have resigned from the company I am an employee at and I am currently serving my notice period.

They are civil lawsuits. A civil lawsuit is when someone had a tangible damage because of something someone else did, and now they want money in compensation. When there is no damage, then there is nothing to sue for. So when you want a judge to file an injunction to force an ISP to give them the identity of one of their users, then you would first have to explain to them how much financial damage you had because of that person and that this is enough damage to make it worth everyone's time.

The proper course of action when such attempts are detected is to report the incident to the police.

However, any simple contract may potentially have ambiguities that would make it difficult or impossible to decide if the contract is being fulfilled. For example, if I make a contract for someone to fix my car, I should actually specify what exactly needs fixing and what would constitute being fixed. Otherwise the person could just top off the oil and call it a day.\n\nPresumably at some point, common sense is exercised to decide if some unexpected development follows this spirit and intent of the contract or not. After all, it's difficult if not impossible to state anything with perfect disambiguity. But [some contract authors still try](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement#Criticism). Since EULAs are probably written by some pretty good lawyers, does that mean that such overly detailed documents can be considered the standard of a very good contract? What *is* a reasonable standard for how much a contract should specify, and how much should be left to \"well, let's just hope we can all come to some agreement if and when that weird freak case happens\".\n\nWhen contract lawyers write a contract, how do they decide when it's \"detailed enough\"? Are there rules of thumb that a lay person could use?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary ideology in legal writing is \"use what has worked\". This is a millenium\\-old practice in the common law tradition (predating the development of what is known as \"the common law\"). This explains the substantial similarity between legal documents, and is responsible for the rise of \"legalese\" \u2013 legal writers do not start from scratch. If a given contract form works for one case, it's reasonable to expect that it will work for analogous cases (where \"works\" means \"has the expected outcome in case of legal dispute\"). Rental agreements are exemplars of recycling of contracts which has worked before.\n\nA recycled contract can fail for two main (and related) reasons. First, the legislature may change the law \u2013 for some political reason, it may be decided to forbid a certain condition in a tenancy agreement. Second, appeals courts may \"discover\" that a condition really has a different effect that was assumed (e.g. which words does \"knowingly\" refer to). This can motivate post hoc or preemptive rewriting of contract templates (where the lawyer sees a risk in using the old language but where the courts have not definitively handed down a ruling).\n\nThere are various [principles of legal interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation) which influence legal writing, generally summarized in a Latin expression such as Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius, meaning \"the mention of one thing is the exclusion of others\". The practical effect of that canon of interpretation is, the more explicit your list, the less likely a novel situation will be already covered. For instance, if your present a contract that forbids passengers from \"possessing weapons\" on the boat, you haven't defined \"weapon\", so that is left to common sense. If you define \"weapon\" as \"pistol, rifle, shotgun, explosive, poison gas, knife, flame thrower, sword, bayonet, brass knuckles, nunchuck\", you run a risk that your list failed to include death\\-ray (a new technology). The risk is that in adjudicating the contract, the court will decide (invoking *contra proferentem*) that as the author of the contract you did not intend to exclude the death ray, because you could have included it in your list but did not. (It's not guaranteed that the court will exclude a death ray, but there is a risk). In other words, too much explicitness can work against you, in case there is some slightly different scenario that you did not anticipate.\n\nThere is a distinction between an actual ambiguity which is a property of language, and vagueness. A clause that says \"drive a car or truck owned by a competitor\" can be interpreted by the rule of English as meaning \"drive a car owned by a competitor or a truck owned by a competitor\", or \"drive any car, or else a truck which is owned by a competitor\" \u2013 this is a linguistic ambiguity. Linguistic ambiguity is more easily solved and correspondingly should be more vigorously eliminated. Trying to micro\\-define \"computer\" is more an exercise in imagination (does it include smart phones, smart watches, your car's ignition system?)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the primary approach used in legal writing for contracts, and why is this approach potentially problematic when dealing with new technologies or situations?\n\nA) Starting from scratch to create unique contracts for each situation, which can be problematic because it's time-consuming and may miss important clauses.\n\nB) Using \"legalese\" to make contracts intentionally complex, which can be problematic because it confuses non-lawyers and may be misinterpreted.\n\nC) Recycling previously successful contract language, which can be problematic when dealing with new technologies or situations not covered by existing language.\n\nD) Providing exhaustive lists of every possible scenario, which can be problematic because it's impossible to predict all future situations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The primary approach in legal writing is to \"use what has worked,\" which means recycling contract language that has been successful in the past.

Under what circumstances would this be legally permissible?\n\nA) The marketing company can send the text message without any prior contact, as the electrician has made their number publicly available.\n\nB) The marketing company can send the text message only if they have previously sold a similar product to the electrician and provided an opt-out option.\n\nC) The marketing company can send the text message if they obtain explicit consent from the electrician first.\n\nD) The marketing company can never send unsolicited text messages for marketing purposes in the UK.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to UK regulations, organizations must not send marketing texts to individuals without their specific, valid, and prior explicit consent. This consent must be recorded and kept as proof. The fact that the electrician has posted their number publicly does not constitute consent for marketing messages. \n\nOption A is incorrect because public availability of a number does not equate to consent for marketing.\n\nOption B describes the \"soft opt-in\" exception, but this only applies to previous customers, which is not the case in this scenario.\n\nOption D is too absolute, as there are circumstances (with explicit consent) where marketing messages can be sent.\n\nOption C is correct because obtaining explicit consent from the electrician would make the text message legally permissible."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86982/do-school-zone-knife-exclusions-violate-the-14th-amendment", "docs_id": 86982, "title": "Do school zone knife exclusions violate the 14th Amendment?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the US, most if not all states have some kind of law(s) in place that prohibit the carrying of knives in school zones. While most states define a knife as a weapon by edge length, I can not find any legal definition of what constitutes an edge or what constitutes a knife as a weapon in regards to school zones.\n\nMany things that some people may call a knife are not weapons at all such as palette knives, butter knives, oyster knives, etc. Palette knives are even required school supplies for many schools that have an art program.\n\nThen there are things that look like knives, like nail files, letter openers, etc., which are not called knives, have no cutting edge, but which I've heard of people getting in trouble for purely on the grounds that they \"look like knives\".\n\nThere are also many tools that have an edge sharp enough to potentially cut or stab but not things that people would call a knife, like keys, chisels, box openers, saws, screwdrivers, etc. Many of these tools are allowed on school property by maintenance personnel and are required class materials in certain courses like wood\\-working, and keys are literally carried by everyone who drives into or through a school zone.\n\nThen there are also \"blunted weapons\". \"Wall\\-hangers\" are decorative swords, daggers, etc. that look like they could be real weapons, but are blunted for safety, and so have no effective cutting or stabbing edges. Similarly, a fencing rapier also looks like a full length sword, but has been blunted and is required equipment on school campuses that have fencing teams.\n\nOn top of all of this, a handful of states, such as Louisiana, don't even have edge length restrictions that differentiate a short\\-bladed \"tool\" from a long bladed \"weapon\".\n\nSo the question is: with all the ambiguity and exceptions, are there any rulings in place that would allow a reasonable person of at least average intelligence to determine what constitutes the crime, and if not, could knife restrictions in school zones be considered [void for vagueness](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=2228) under the 14th Amendment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: School administrators have the right to try to express the law in seemingly simpler language, but they do not have the right to enforce their misstatements of the law. [The law of Louisiana](https://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=78741) does not refer to knives at all\n\n> Carrying a firearm, or dangerous weapon as defined in [R.S. 14:2](https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78337),\n> by a student or nonstudent on school property, at a school sponsored\n> function, or in a firearm\\-free zone is unlawful...\n\n\"Dangerous weapon\" is defined so that it \"includes any gas, liquid or other substance or instrumentality, which, in the manner used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm\". The law does not exhaustively list the things that count as firearms or dangerous weapons, so every individual is held responsible for knowing what the courts have held to constitute \"dangerous weapons\". A novice interpretation (not relying on case law) might lead to the conclusion that a speargun is not a \"dangerous weapon\" (perhaps on the theory that it is used underwater to spear fish), but a reasonable interpretation of \"dangerous weapon\" suggests that it is a dangerous weapon because it can be used to kill a person. The same is true of a pencil, as well as a dog.\n\nYou can turn to [this article](https://www.animallaw.info/article/jaws-bite-claws-snatch) for an example of the dangerous weapon status of a dog, a propos [Louisiana v. Michels](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-michels-1), where defendant was \"armed with a dangerous weapon\". That court recited previous case law to the effect that\n\n> \"the dangerousness of the instrumentality because of its use is a\n> factual question for the jury\" State v. Munoz, 575 So.2d 848, 850\n\nRX 14:3 also states that\n\n> The articles of this Code cannot be extended by analogy so as to\n> create crimes not provided for herein; however, in order to promote\n> justice and to effect the objects of the law, all of its provisions\n> shall be given a genuine construction, according to the fair import of\n> their words, taken in their usual sense, in connection with the\n> context, and with reference to the purpose of the provision\n\nwhich means that if faced with a novel application (dog, pencil, or speargun), the jury can decide based on \"context and purpose\", not just narrow words. The article points to a law review article by a lawyer involved in the 1942 codification of Louisiana criminal law that \"the code was to be read as a civilian document, not a mere compilation of common law rules\", thus the code is shorter and uses plain language.\n\nThe article then reviews a number of previous rulings on the scope of \"dangerous weapon\", starting with [Louisiana v. Calvin](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-calvin-4) where it was ruled that teeth and fists are not dangerous weapons, even though you can kill a person with your fists. It therefore turns out that a \"dangerous weapon\" must be an inanimate object, under Louisiana law.\n\nA knife *can* be found to be a dangerous weapon, as reported in [this opinion](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/12/12-41425-CR0.pdf) (deportation dependent on a prior criminal conviction for felony aggravated battery, specifically referring to R.S. 14\\.2(3\\) and deeming a knife to be a dangerous weapon). Since that conviction is no being appealed at the state level, details of the knife\\-usage are omitted, so all we know is that a knife was used.\n\nInsofar as box cutters were the essential weapons that brought about the airplane hijackings on 9/11, it is not unreasonable to at least consider that they are within the scope of \"dangerous weapon\" (I would not, but that's a matter for the jury). A butter knife or especially a pencil cannot reasonably be deemed to be \"dangerous weapons\". But there doesn't seem to be any case law specifically addressing these objects. If a pencil were actually used as a weapon, perhaps the jury might find that a pencil (so used) was a dangerous weapon. However, the question is about a law forbidding the mere possession of a dangerous weapon, eliminating how it was actually used from the calculation.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that I would get arrested for driving past a school with a screwdriver in my car."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under Louisiana law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the definition and interpretation of \"dangerous weapons\" in school zones?\n\nA) Any object with a sharp edge, including butter knives and palette knives, is automatically considered a dangerous weapon in school zones.\n\nB) The determination of what constitutes a dangerous weapon is solely based on the object's physical characteristics and not its potential use.\n\nC) School administrators have the final say in determining what objects are considered dangerous weapons on school property.\n\nD) The classification of an object as a dangerous weapon can be context-dependent and may be determined by a jury based on how the object could potentially be used.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to Louisiana law and related court cases:\n\n1. The definition of a \"dangerous weapon\" is not exhaustively listed in the law, allowing for interpretation based on context and potential use.\n\n2. The law states that a dangerous weapon \"includes any gas, liquid or other substance or instrumentality, which, in the manner used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm.\"\n\n3. Court rulings have established that \"the dangerousness of the instrumentality because of its use is a factual question for the jury.\"\n\n4. The law requires a \"genuine construction\" of its provisions, taking into account context and purpose.\n\n5. While some objects (like knives) have been deemed dangerous weapons in specific cases, the determination can vary based on the circumstances and potential use.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because not all sharp objects are automatically considered dangerous weapons. Answer B is incorrect because the potential use of an object is a crucial factor in determining if it's a dangerous weapon. Answer C is incorrect because school administrators do not have the final legal authority to determine what constitutes a dangerous weapon; this is a matter for the courts and potentially a jury to decide."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19553/is-it-possible-for-a-tenant-to-sue-a-land-lord-for-harm-caused-by-mold", "docs_id": 19553, "title": "Is it possible for a tenant to sue a land lord for harm caused by mold", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Take a case where the mould is caused by an identifiable maintenance issue such as a leaky pipe .

The tenant can pursue damages through either a breach of contract claim or a negligence claim. In both cases, the tenant must prove that the mold was the cause of the health issues (scientific causation) and quantify the damages suffered. For a breach of contract claim, the tenant would need to show that the landlord failed to meet their contractual obligations. For a negligence claim, the tenant would need to demonstrate that the landlord owed a duty of care, breached that duty, and that this breach caused the damage. The other options are incorrect because they either limit the legal options available, misstate the requirements for claiming damages, or incorrectly assert that damages cannot be claimed in this situation."}}
