It aligns with the principles of data minimization and storage limitation mentioned in the documentation. By collecting anonymized aggregate data, the company reduces the risk of processing special category data. Storing data for a limited time and regularly reviewing its necessity adheres to the storage limitation principle. This approach balances the legitimate interest of improving the service with user privacy rights.\n\nOption A violates data minimization and storage limitation principles by collecting excessive data and storing it indefinitely.\n\nOption C, while offering an opt-out, still involves collecting more data than necessary, which goes against the data minimization principle.\n\nOption D is overly restrictive and doesn't allow for service improvement, which could be considered a legitimate interest under GDPR."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45767/how-do-you-serve-a-person-in-small-claims-court-if-they-are-international-but-th", "docs_id": 45767, "title": "How do you serve a person in Small Claims Court if they are International but their Business is here in the USA?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The company subject has two owners, and I was the Third, I am sueing my x partners now for the debt that they did not pay and left for me. \nThey are International but have since started a New company and I know all their information. \n\nHow do I serve them? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ok, so you have a business entity organized/incorporated under US law with three shareholders/partners/owners. You are one of the three owners and the two others are resident abroad. You're assuming that jurisdiction is in the US and your defendandants are the two other partners, not the business entity. To me, it looks like this assumption is correct but I don't know the details of your case.\n\nIn this case, it will likely not be possible to use domestic process service; However, since international process service tends to be a dark art that is associated with a lot of red tape, you should first try to figure if you can use domestic service after all.\n\nOptions for domestic service include:\n\na) Service while travelling: If your defendants travel to the US, you can serve them personally as long as they are on US soil. Residency doesn't matter. You just need to get a US process server to ambush them whereever they are in the US.\n\nb) Service on service agent: If your defendants have arranged a US\\-based service agent who is allowed to be served on their behalf, you can serve the service agent. (I'm mentioning this for the sake of completeness, because international contracts sometimes include a clause that requires the parties to appoint a domestic service agent just in case there will be a lawsuit.)\n\nc) Service on subsidiary, Service on legal counsel: There have been cases where a US court decided that service on 1\\) a lawyer who used to represent the respondant in the past or 2\\) service on a subsidiary of the respondant is sufficient. I would be careful with these options because this looks like making up a service authorisation that doesn't exist.\n\nIf none of the above is available to you, you will have to serve process abroad. (Nota Bene: This doesn't mean that you have to exhaust your options for domestic service before intl service is allowed.) International process service is quite different from domestic service; In many cases, it involves some red tape, costs more than domestic service and it is much slower. In most cases, you are **not** allowed to hire a process server directly as this would (in most cases) be considered a violation of the Hague service convention, a violation of the destination country's national sovereignty and/or assumption of powers without authority.\n\n**The exact procedure varies for serving abroad varies heavily between countries; For further reading, I recommend this blog: <https://www.haguelawblog.com/>**\n\n**If you tell me in which country you need to have your documents served, I may also be able to tell you more about service in that country.**", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a lawsuit involving international defendants, which of the following is NOT a valid method of domestic service according to the information provided?\n\nA) Serving the defendants while they are traveling within the United States\nB) Serving a US-based service agent appointed by the defendants\nC) Serving the defendants' former accountant who is based in the US\nD) Serving a US subsidiary of the defendants' company\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct as the information states that defendants can be served personally while on US soil, regardless of their residency.\nB is correct as the text mentions that if defendants have arranged a US-based service agent, they can be served.\nC is incorrect and not mentioned in the text.

I'll start with the USA since they're basically the only major copyright jurisdiction for which I could find a straightforward answer, then discuss internationally.\n\nUSA\n===\n\nIn the USA, Bob would generally **not hold copyright** in modifications thus there is no copyright for Alice to violate, assuming no copyright exceptions like fair use apply. This is due to [17 U.S.C 103(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/103) (see also *[Anderson v. Stallone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_v._Stallone)*):\n\n> The subject matter of copyright as specified by [section 102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102) includes compilations and derivative works, but protection for a work employing preexisting material in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully.\n\nWhile I couldn't find any commentary on this point, the wording does seem to imply that portions of a derivative with additions far enough removed from the original work might qualify for copyright protection.\n\nInternational copyright law\n===========================\n\nThe main provisions governing derivative works in international copyright law come from [Berne Convention](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698) Article 2(3\\):\n\n> Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work shall be protected as original works without prejudice to the copyright in the original work.\n\nand Article 12 (with a similar provision specifically for translation in Article 8\\):\n\n> Authors of literary or artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing adaptations, arrangements and other alterations of their works.\n\nThere's the argument that since unauthorized derivatives aren't explicitly excluded from protection that they should be protected, however, there's also the argument that granting unauthorized derivatives their own copyright is in itself prejudicial to the original copyright holder. Note I don't think it's debated that non\\-infringing derivatives gain their own copyright, including unauthorized derivatives that nevertheless fall into a copyright exception such as fair use.\n\nDr. Daniel Gervais points out in *[The Derivative Right, or Why Copyright Law Protects Foxes Better than Hedgehogs](https://www.jetlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Gervais.pdf)* section III.B that there's a bit of history here. The original Berne Convention 1886 text stated that \"Lawful translations shall be protected as original works.\" However, the word \"lawful\" was struck out in the 1908 Berlin Convention coming up with wording similar to today's Article 2(3\\). Gervais's article cites *\u00c9tude sur la Convention de Berlin de 1908 pour la Protection des \u0152uvres Litt\u00e9raires et artistiques* by Andr\u00e9 Petit implying disagreement between the countries about whether or not to protect unlawful derivatives, thus leaving it unsaid. Unfortunately, I'm unable to locate any copies of this source.\n\nAdditionally, thanks to a fortunate snippet Google Books displayed, I know that *[La conf\u00e9rence de Berlin (14 octobre\\-13 novembre 1908\\)](https://books.google.ca/books/about/La_conf%C3%A9rence_de_Berlin_14_octobre_13_n.html?id=3wNCAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y)* by Georges\\-Fran\u00e7ois\\-Joseph Martin also discusses this exact point on page 187, quoting someone who thought unlawful derivatives would be protected now, though I couldn't get enough context to really determine anything. While I could find available copies of this book, for now it's a little on the expensive side for me.\n\nOverview of various jurisdictions\n=================================\n\nIn the **EU**, the derivative right is not harmonized and so the question is punted to the Member States. There is no implementation of either Berne Convention Article 2(3\\) or Article 12 in the *[Information Society (Copyright) Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML)*, Article 12 being specifically acknowledged by the Court of Justice in the *[Allposters](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=161609&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1)* case.\n\nIn the **UK**, infringing derivatives are probably protected, see *Redwood Music Ltd. v. Chappell \\& Co. Ltd.*, \\[1982] R.P.C. 109 (Q.B. Div.) at 120\\. I can't find the judgement text outside a paywall, but an [article by William J. Braithwaite](https://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1990&context=ohlj) (PDF) quotes the relevant part on page 209 (the square brackets are his):\n\n> \\[T]he idea that \\[the owner of the underlying copyright] should be entitled to reap the benefit of another's original work, by exploiting it, however extensive such work might be, however innocently it might have been made, offends against justice and common sense.\n\nAdditionally, the justice noted the argument that unlawful derivatives are not explicitly excluded from copyright protection and that parliament has declined to make this explicit.\n\nIf I understand the [English court system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_England_and_Wales) correctly, this decision was two appeals away from the Supreme Court (House of Lords back then), but there doesn't appear to have been any appeal. For what it's worth though, the [justice who issued the decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Goff,_Baron_Goff_of_Chieveley) ultimately became [Senior Law Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom).\n\nIn **Italy**, the Supreme Court has determined that [derivative works can be simultaneously infringing and protected](https://elawnora.blogspot.com/2018/10/italian-supreme-court-holds-that.html).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In international copyright law, how is the protection of unauthorized derivative works generally handled?\n\nA) Unauthorized derivative works are always protected by copyright, regardless of their legality.\nB) Unauthorized derivative works are never protected by copyright in any jurisdiction.\nC) The protection of unauthorized derivative works varies by jurisdiction, with some countries offering protection and others denying it.\nD) The Berne Convention explicitly states that unauthorized derivative works must not be protected by copyright.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question of whether unauthorized derivative works are protected by copyright is not uniformly settled in international copyright law. The Berne Convention, which forms the basis for much of international copyright law, does not explicitly address this issue. Different jurisdictions have interpreted and implemented the relevant provisions differently:\n\n- In the USA, unauthorized derivative works generally do not receive copyright protection due to 17 U.S.C 103(a).\n- In the UK, there is case law suggesting that infringing derivatives are probably protected (Redwood Music Ltd. v. Chappell & Co. Ltd.).\n- In Italy, the Supreme Court has ruled that derivative works can be simultaneously infringing and protected.\n- The EU has not harmonized this aspect of copyright law, leaving it to individual member states to decide.\n\nThis variation in approach across different jurisdictions makes C the correct answer.

It may have a well\\-documented development process which documents where these methods come from and a source control system that can show that the code is independently written. Separation of data (for example, completely unrelated source repositories) and even having different individuals working on the projects. \n\nUsually though there is some kind of documentation exchanged between the contractor and the client at the beginning of the project that outlines very carefully where the intellectual property belongs (and clearly defining the scope of work and any intellectual property output).

This is a huge incentive for the contractor to clearly demonstrate that while the output is similar, it was developed independently.\n\nThe important thing here is to remember that Intellectual Property and Expertise are two different legal concepts.

This is the type of tenancy which most residential tenants have. To be an assured shorthold tenancy:\n\n* You must occupy the property as your only or principal home ([section 1(1\\) HA 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/1))\n* You do not pay a very low rent (\u00a31000 a year or less in London, \u00a3250 a year or less anywhere else) or a very high rent (\u00a3100,000 a year or more), your landlord is not a university, your landlord does not live in the building with you, it is not a holiday let, and none of the other paragraphs in [Schedule 1 HA 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/schedule/1) apply.\n\nStatement of basic terms\n------------------------\n\nSection [20A HA 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/20A) provides that:\n\n> (1\\) Subject to subsection (3\\) below, a tenant under an assured\n> shorthold tenancy to which section 19A above applies may, by notice in\n> writing, require the landlord under that tenancy to provide him with a\n> written statement of any term of the tenancy which (a) falls within\n> subsection (2\\) below, and (b) is not evidenced in writing.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) The following terms of a tenancy fall within this subsection,\n> namely\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) the date on which the tenancy began or, if it is a statutory\n> periodic tenancy or a tenancy to which section 39(7\\) below applies,\n> the date on which the tenancy came into being,\n> \n> \n> (b) the rent payable under the tenancy and the dates on which that rent\n> is payable,\n> \n> \n> (c) any term providing for a review of the rent payable under the\n> tenancy, and\n> \n> \n> (d) in the case of a fixed term tenancy, the length of the fixed term.\n\nA failure by the landlord to do so is a criminal offence pursuant to [section 20A(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/20A) but the landlord does not have to respond more than once in relation to a term which has not changed in the meantime ([section 20A(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/20A)).\n\nLandlord's address\n------------------\n\nUnder [section 48 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/31/section/48), the landlord is also obliged to give you a notice containing an address in England and Wales at which notices can be served on him by you. A failure to do so means that no rent is due until such time as the landlord complies (but he can then request all outstanding rent retrospectively) (section 48(2\\)).\n\nYou can also request the landlord's address from the person you pay the rent to and they must provide that information in writing within 21 days or commit an offence pursuant to [section 1 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/70/section/1).\n\nNote these are two slightly different things. The first is an address in England and Wales to which notices can be served, but doesn't necessarily need to be the landlord's address. The second is the landlord's actual address (which might not be in England and Wales). Usually these will be the same address.\n\nConsequences to the landlord\n----------------------------\n\nNot having a written agreement is generally worse for the landlord than for the tenant. This is because it is typically the landlord who would draft the tenancy agreement and a well drafted one will have lots of terms favouring the landlord and relatively few favouring the tenant.

While the lease terms do require permission and notification for changing locks, the common law doctrine of exclusive possession provides some protection for tenants. The documentation suggests that if tenants change locks back to originals upon leaving, they might not be forbidden from doing so under an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) in England. However, the tenant should have notified the landlord, as this is a common requirement even when changing locks is permitted.\n\nOption A is incorrect because exclusive possession doesn't automatically override all lease terms.

For example, if a science fiction movie presents a race which has a particular habit or nuance which is not known to exist elsewhere, can an author make use of that habit or nuance to create a fictional race which also portrays that habit or nuance? This could apply to many art forms including, written stories and poetry among others.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright never protects ideas as such, whether in movies, novels or text books or any other kind of work. However, if an aspect of work, such as a character, place or fictional society are sufficiently distinctive, and if another work uses that aspect, with **detailed** similarity to the previous work, it might be found to be a derivative work of the original. A derivative work requires permission from the copyright holder of the original work.\n\nFor example, in Ursula K. LeGuin's famous SF novel *The Left Hand of Darkness* a fictional race or species, the Gethenians, is portrayed which is neither male nor female most of the time, but becomes sexually active and gendered a few days a month, and an individual may be male one month and female the next. This is an original and distinctive idea. Another author could create a different group of people with a similar nature without infringing copyright, but if the detailed description of how the process worked, or how it felt to the individuals involved was similar, that might make it a derivative work, and LeGuin's estate might be able to sue and win.\n\nThis is something that gets decided on a case\\-by\\-case basis, and such decisions are highly fact\\-based. But if the new work has a society or species which is clearly different from any previously invented one, even though it shares some aspect, and if there is no detailed, point\\-by\\-point similarity, an infringement suit seems unlikely. Several SF authors have said \"Its not the idea, it's what you do with it that matters.\"\n\nFilmmakers, because of the money involved, tend to be more cautious than book authors. For example, Paramount bought rights to the \"flat cats\" from Robert A. Heinlein before filming the *Star Trek* episode \"The Trouble with the Tribbles\", although the similarity was quite probably not enough for a successful infringement suit (but no one will ever know for sure, since they bought permission). This is described in some detail in David Gerrold's book about the making of that episode. Gerrold wrote that his conscious model was the importation of rabbits into Australia, not RAH's flat cats, but there are some similarities, and DG had read *The Rolling Stone* (where the flat cats appear) years before.\n\nIn any specific case. consulting a lawyer with expertise in the area would be a good idea, as the details will matter.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A science fiction author is writing a novel featuring a unique alien species.

Copyright law does not protect ideas themselves, but rather the expression of those ideas. In this case, the author can use the general concept of a cultural habit introduced in the movie, as long as the overall portrayal and detailed characteristics of the new alien species are distinctly different from the one in the film. This approach avoids creating a derivative work, which would require permission from the copyright holder.\n\nOption A is incorrect because copyright doesn't protect ideas, only their specific expression. Option B is overly simplistic; changing names alone doesn't necessarily prevent copyright infringement if other detailed similarities exist.

When farmers use public roads to move their livestock, they are considered to be operating on the highway similar to other road users. As such, they bear responsibility for controlling their animals and preventing damage to other road users or their property. If a cow under the farmer's control damages a stationary car, the farmer would likely be held liable, as they are expected to maintain control over their animals during the move.

The policy should name the beneficiary, which may or may not include both siblings. Additionally, any requirement to use the money for repairs would typically be specified in the policy, rather than being a default legal obligation.

One user, for instance, discovered the numerical ID referring to the entire text of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, and has distributed the ID to their friends so that they may read the novel at their leisure.\n\nIt's unclear to me where the copyright infringement occurs.

(Though good luck finding a webhost with a hard drive large enough to store it. *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* is roughly 38,000 characters. If I've done my calculations correctly, storing all of the strings of this length or shorter would require something like 1053760 GB of storage. Give or take.)\n\nThe main problem is in distributing the \"index\" of the string containing the text of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*. This index is just the integer obtained by taking the entire text as a string and treating it as a number in base 26 (A \\= 1, B \\= 2, etc.) In other words, all of the information contained in the book is also contained in the index number, and in a relatively simple way.\n\nDistributing this number is therefore entirely equivalent to distributing the text; you don't need the website at all. It's entirely analogous to e\\-mailing the text to someone else; in that process, the text is transformed into a number (in binary, under a different encoding scheme) along the way.

It is also misleading by virtue of being oversimplified.\n\nI don't suppose that advertising is particularly relevant here, but the directive you link to does contain explicit provisions about the notification of air passengers by air carriers, in Article 14\\. This says nothing about information on the web, however, only about what must be displayed \"at check\\-in\" and in the event of denied boarding or flight cancellation:\n\n> Article 14\n> \n> \n> Obligation to inform passengers of their rights\n> \n> \n> 1.

An operating air carrier denying boarding or cancelling a flight shall provide each passenger affected with a written notice setting out the rules for compensation and assistance in line with this Regulation. It shall also provide each passenger affected by a delay of at least two hours with an equivalent notice. The contact details of the national designated body referred to in Article 16 shall also be given to the passenger in written form.\n> 3. In respect of blind and visually impaired persons, the provisions of this Article shall be applied using appropriate alternative means.\n\nIf the company have a compliant notice at the check\\-in counter, and distribute a compliant notice to affected passengers, then they are probably not violating the directive. There could be other laws that apply to the misleading statement, either under EU law or national law.\n\nHowever, the regulation is somewhat complex.

That is, those where the evidence (whatever it is) convinces a jury that you are guilty beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nIf there is insufficient evidence, *for whatever reason* then you would not be convicted. The prosecution can, subject to admissibility, put forward whatever evidence they like in order to convince the jury. This can include a pile of ash that they allege contained convincing and unambiguous evidence of guilt. Of course, if that's all they've got the prosecution would probably be censured by the judge for wasting everybody's time and money, more likely, a prosecutor wouldn't lay charges in the first place.\n\nAs to punishment for an evidence tampering conviction: you have been convicted of evidence tampering, not drug production so you will be punished for evidence tampering, not drug production. The legislature sets different punishments for these for a reason, possibly a reason known only to them but a reason nevertheless.

The parties, and perhaps more importantly their lawyers, also have an obligation of candour to the court. Courts routinely accept unchallenged assertions because there are serious consequences for misleading the court, and the opponent (rather than the court which should remain neutral) is in the best position to investigate and prove any suspected dishonesty.\n\nIt is a matter for the party commencing proceedings (plaintiff or prosecutor) to decide how the parties will be named. People often change their names, and may use multiple spellings. It is not uncommon for typographical or other errors to appear. Generally, it is in the interest of at least one party to name the parties \"correctly,\" ie. consistently with other government records that will be used to enforce any judgment, but a person's name is ultimately a formal matter that can be corrected if necessary.

SW General, Inc.](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/national-labor-relations-board-v-sw-general-inc/). The Executive is not challenging the constitutionality of the statute, though.

Lovett 328 U.S. 303 (1946\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/303/) is another case where Congress went too far. The background here was that Congress passed a law that said \"no salary or other compensation shall be paid to certain employees of the Government (specified by name)\". The court held that: \"Legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial, are bills of attainder prohibited by the Constitution.\"\n\nThis principle was refined in [Nixon v.

While Congress has significant power to enact laws that control Executive branch conduct (as exemplified by various statutes regulating executive agencies), this power is not absolute. The Supreme Court has recognized instances where Congressional action can intrude on core Executive functions, violating the separation of powers (e.g., Zivotofsky v. Kerry). \n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the limitation on Congressional power. Many laws controlling Executive conduct are constitutional, as demonstrated by examples like patent and trademark regulations.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it overstates Executive authority. While the Executive can challenge laws it believes are unconstitutional, it cannot unilaterally reject them. The courts ultimately decide on the constitutionality of such laws.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it overstates the consistency and breadth of Supreme Court rulings on this matter. While many laws regulating executive employees are constitutional, some have been struck down (e.g., United States v.

That selection and arrangement would probably be considered a substantial similarity and, if not for the merger doctrine, infringement.\n\nHowever, given the limited number of ways to express the prime\\-detection algorithm means that the expression of that idea has *merged* with the idea, and thus is not protected by copyright.

The short phrases doctrine indicates that short phrases (like function names) are not copyrightable.\n\n3.

I would like to put up a site where I share the recipes I used. I sometimes use recipes from the cooking book which obviously copyrighted work. Therefore, I decided what if I 'retell' the process involved when I am cooking the dish myself, producing 'my own' 'cooking instruction'? Of course, I would like my recipe to have the same ingredients as the reference book I am using, else the taste is not going to be the same. Is this allowed? How about international law since I am not in the US. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Recipe books can be, and often are, protected by copyright. If the individual recipes are by others, this would constitute a collective work or compilation. See [this recent answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/64800/17500) for more on the rights protected for a collective work.\n\nThe selection of which recipes to include would be a creative element, protected by copyright, and could not be copied or closely imitated without permission. However, division into groups by type of dish would be a \"natural and obvious\" arrangement, and not protected. So would alphabetical or chronological arrangement within a group, or over all. A \"non\\-obvious\" order of recipes would however be a protectable element.\n\nAn individual recipe may be protected by copyright, but this protects less than one might think. Copyright does not protect facts or methods. This means that the list of ingredients is not protected, nor is the general list of steps of preparation. Only the exact wording of the recipe will be protected.\n\nCreating a new collection of recipes based on several different previously published collections of recipes (whether from the web, books, magazines, or other media) and making one's own selections of which ones to include that is significantly different from any of the previous collections would not violate the collection copyrights of any of the previous collections. If the actual recipes were rewritten so that any creative expression from the originals was not copied, then it seems that no copyright infringement has occurred. Most recipes, after all, are not fully original but are modified from older ones.\n\nThere is no set figure for how many recipes could be copied from a given source before this becomes infringement. That would be, if a suit was field, a matter for the judgement of the count as to whether the new book was \"based on\" the alleged source. The more the list in the new work resembles a particular source, the more like a derivative work it seems and the more likely that it would be held to be an infringement. One could always ask for a license from the older source, to avoid any risk of suit, but it might not be available or the copyright holder might demand an excessive fee. Asking for a license risks drawing attention to the new work, as well, and might cause a holder to file suit who otherwise would not.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A cookbook author wants to create a new recipe collection inspired by various existing cookbooks.

For example, the Clay Institute\u2019s [Millennium Prize](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems) does exactly what you propose: it pays people who solve unsolved math problems. Similarly, the the Everglades Foundation used a [prize](https://www.evergladeswaterquality.org/meet-the-teams) to get people to come up with new ways to get phosphates out of the water sources.\n\nTo do what they did, you need to follow their lead, and set up and run a non\\-profit (aka, 501(c)(3\\), named after the relevant provision of the tax code).\n\nBecause non\\-profits are tax exempt under US tax law, you have to apply to the IRS to become a non\\-profit. Speaking broadly, the IRS imposes two requirements on non\\-profits: 1\\) It must serve a charitable purpose; 2\\) It must spend a certain percentage of its money every year doing charitable work.\n\nTo set up a foundation you have to specify the charitable purpose you will serve (\u201cencourage research in mathematics\u201d), and have a plan to do so (\u201cwe will award a cash prize to people who solve important unsolved problems\u201d). If the IRS decides your plan is genuine, then they give you a pass on paying taxes.\n\nTo make sure you are carrying out your charitable plan, the IRS requires you to spend a certain percentage of your money each year on charitable work. (This is called the \"distribution requirement.\") Meeting the distribution requirement may be a problem, since you may not award prizes every year.\n\nYou may be able to get a general idea about how the IRS deals with such situations by searching on line. At some point, however, you will probably need to talk to a lawyer with experience setting up non\\-profits. (FWIW, it looks to me as if the Clay Institute meets its yearly spending requirement by supporting lots of other activities that count towards the spending requirement.)\n\nOne other problem that it seems you won\u2019t have involves giving prizes directly to individuals. For obvious reasons, the IRS is generally suspicious of prizes given to individuals, so they impose restrictions. For example, for the winner to avoid taxes, the prizes have to be for previous work.\n\n**Where to go for more information:**\n\nUSA.gov has a nice overview of the application process [here](https://www.usa.gov/start-nonprofit). The IRS has several publications and websites that you might find helpful: [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4220.pdf), [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf), [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4221pc.pdf), and [here](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/application-process). These cover everything from the general rules to nuts\\-and\\-bolts details about which forms to use.\n\nYou can read more about the IRS treatment of prizes [here](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/a_watch_out_for_private_foundations_offering_prizes#) and [here](https://www.accdocket.com/articles/nonprofit-knowledge-sweepstakes-prize-promotion.cfm).\n\nDepending on how comfortable you are with financial statements, you may learn about how these non\\-profits work by reading their 990 forms.

Which of the following statements best describes the most suitable organizational structure and key considerations for this venture?\n\nA) A for-profit corporation would be ideal, as it allows for the most flexibility in distributing prize money and doesn't require IRS approval.\n\nB) A charitable trust is the best option, as it doesn't have to meet any annual spending requirements and can hold funds indefinitely.\n\nC) A 501(c)(3) non-profit organization would be most appropriate, but it must apply to the IRS, demonstrate a charitable purpose, meet annual distribution requirements, and may need to engage in additional activities beyond prize-giving.\n\nD) An informal association of mathematicians can pool their resources without any formal structure, avoiding legal and tax complications entirely.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: A 501(c)(3) non-profit organization is the most suitable structure for this type of venture, as evidenced by existing examples like the Clay Institute's Millennium Prize. However, establishing such an organization comes with several important considerations:\n\n1. The group must apply to the IRS for non-profit status.\n2. They need to clearly define their charitable purpose (e.g., \"encourage research in mathematics\").\n3. The organization must meet annual distribution requirements, which may be challenging if prizes are not awarded every year. This might necessitate supporting additional mathematical activities or research to meet the spending requirement.\n4.

There may be restrictions on how prizes can be awarded to individuals to maintain tax-exempt status.\n\nWhile other options might seem simpler, they don't offer the same benefits or legal framework for long-term operation and tax-exempt status that a properly structured non-profit provides for this type of mathematical prize-giving organization."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51209/is-there-legal-precedent-for-restricting-us-citizens-from-interacting-with-each", "docs_id": 51209, "title": "Is there legal precedent for restricting US citizens from interacting with each other on private property during a pandemic?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many states (for example, [Washington](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-25%20Coronovirus%20Stay%20Safe-Stay%20Healthy%20%28tmp%29%20%28002%29.pdf)) around the US have issued an executive order prohibiting their residents from interacting with other citizens face\\-to\\-face, unless its a part of an \"essential\" activity:\n\n> All people in Washington State shall immediately cease participating in all public\n>  and private gatherings and multi\\-person activities for social, spiritual and\n>  recreational purposes, regardless of the number of people involved, except as\n>  specifically identified herein.

Or perhaps someone already tried to challenge this rule during the current pandemic? Preventing citizens from going to each others home for a visit seems like the ultimate form of restrictions, so it would be interesting to see if it ever held up in court.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think the Washington law and order is fairly clear: you must stay home unless you are engaged in certain allowed activities. The underlying law, [RCW 43\\.06\\.220(h)](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.06.220) empowers issuing an order prohibiting \"Such other activities as he or she reasonably believes should be prohibited to help preserve and maintain life, health, property or the public peace\". Therefore I can walk my dog. When I do, there are a lot of people also out walking their dogs, so that provides a letter\\-of\\-the\\-law permitted exception to the stay\\-at\\-home order. Nothing in the order specifically addresses the situation where you pause your dog\\-walk to talk to a neighbor (the \"appropriate social distancing\" sub\\-rule only applies to recreational departures from your home).\n\nIt is well\\-established that the central legal issue is what the \"compelling government interest\" is, and whether these restrictions fail on grounds of narrow\\-tailoring or least\\-restrictiveness. The failure to include \"go to your brother's place for lunch, provided you follow appropriate social distancing guidelines\" as a permitted activity is a candidate for not being least\\-restrictive.

In this case, the stores that are in both sections at once can remain open IF the front door is in Baarle\\-Nassau (front door determines where you live), BUT they need to close off the section that's located in Baarle\\-Hertog. I don't know whether this is because Belgium ordered all stores to be closed or because Belgium closed their border, but the end result is that these stores essentially can't sell part of their stock because it's located in the Belgian section.\n\nI'm wondering whether there are other cases where a business that's located directly over the border between 2 legal entities with separate jurisdictions needs to adhere to 2 separate jurisdictions that might even conflict with each other. Someone thought Texarkana in the USA on the Texas/Arkansas border might have that, but they weren't sure themselves, and checking now it appears that the border runs right down the middle of a street at all times, so it might not apply here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Haskell Free Library and Opera House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Free_Library_and_Opera_House) was built on the border between Quebec and Vermont.\n\n> A thick black line runs beneath the seats of the opera house and diagonally across the center of the library's reading room to mark the Canada\u2013United States border.\\[4] The stage and half of the seats are in Canada, the remainder of the opera hall is in the US.\n\nThe library is [run by an American non\\-profit organization](https://haskellopera.com/support-the-library/), so it may not count as a \"business\" for your purposes.\n\nThe Wikipedia article also links to that of [La Cure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Cure), a town on the border between France and Switzerland, where the boundary divides a pub and the [Hotel Arbez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Arbez). The hotel's honeymoon suite is so arranged that each half of the bed is on either side of the border.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding businesses operating across international borders?\n\nA) In Baarle-Hertog/Baarle-Nassau, stores located in both countries must always follow the stricter regulations of either country.\n\nB) The Haskell Free Library and Opera House is subject to both Canadian and US tax laws due to its location on the border.\n\nC) The Hotel Arbez in La Cure must maintain separate accounting records for the French and Swiss portions of the building.\n\nD) During the COVID-19 crisis, some stores in Baarle-Hertog/Baarle-Nassau could remain partially open based on the location of their front door.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, during the COVID-19 crisis, stores in Baarle-Hertog/Baarle-Nassau that were located in both the Belgian and Dutch sections could remain open if their front door was in Baarle-Nassau (the Dutch section). However, they had to close off the portion of the store located in Baarle-Hertog (the Belgian section). This unique situation was determined by the location of the store's front door.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the information doesn't state that businesses always follow the stricter regulations. The COVID-19 example shows that regulations can be applied differently based on specific circumstances.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the information doesn't mention anything about the tax laws applying to the Haskell Free Library and Opera House. It's noted that it's run by an American non-profit organization, but this doesn't necessarily imply it's subject to both countries' tax laws.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there's no information provided about the accounting practices of the Hotel Arbez. While the hotel does straddle the France-Switzerland border, the question doesn't give any details about its financial operations."}}
