Due to his religious belief in nonviolence, he refused to carry a weapon and was eventually allowed to do so, going on to win various medals (including the Medal of Honor) for rescuing casualties in various battles of the Pacific Theatre\u2014his story was later made into the film *Hacksaw Ridge*.\n\nIs it still possible today for somebody to join the armed forces, but to refuse to carry a weapon? Specifically, I am wondering about the US and the UK armed forces, but interesting answers about any other country are welcome.\n\nInitially I thought Doss would have been conscripted which may have changed things, but apparently he *chose* to enlist so that argument doesn't hold up. I've searched but I haven't found anything about whether this would still be possible now or if military law may have changed to disallow it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under [US Army Regulation 601\\-210](https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN6642_AR601-210_ADMIN_WEB_Final.pdf) as of 2016, conscientious objection will normally disqualify someone applying to enlist, but the disqualification can be waived. Under [Army Regulation 600\\-43](https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN4304_R600_43_FINAL.pdf), if they enlist they\u2019ll typically be assigned to the medical field and will receive modified basic training (as conscientious objectors, they won\u2019t be trained in the use of weapons). As for officers and warrant officers, [Army Regulation 601\\-100](https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/r601_100.pdf) says an applicant is disqualified unless they\u2019re applying to the Army Medical Department or to be a chaplain. \n\nServing personnel can also apply for conscientious objector status if they develop beliefs during their service, also under Army Regulation 600\\-43\\. They can either ask to be discharged or ask to do noncombatant service, and if their application is approved then they\u2019ll get whichever one they asked for. While [DOD Instruction 1300\\.06](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/130006_dodi_2017.pdf#page12) (the military\\-wide conscientious objector regulation) says that the services can discharge someone who just requests noncombatant service, the Army policy is to keep them around. If they do ask to be discharged, they can\u2019t decide to enlist again in the future (unlike conscientious objection in general, this disqualification can\u2019t be waived). Lastly, under [Army Regulation 601\\-280](https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN19733_R601_280_FINAL.pdf), enlisted personnel who are conscientious objectors *generally* can\u2019t reenlist unless they\u2019re in the medical field (in which case they can reenlist with a contract that will keep them in the medical field).\n\nOf course, the fact that conscientious objectors are potentially eligible to serve doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be accepted. That depends on the needs of the Army. If the Army has plenty of people, they might not want someone who\u2019s restricted to noncombatant roles.

It is a prosecutor who would file such a charge. The next question is whether there are criminal offenses subsumed under the rubric of anti\\-discrimination laws. There are a lot of anti\\-discrimination laws: numerous types at the federal, state and municipal level and different domains of discrimination (employment, public accommodation, education, voting...). Anti\\-discrimination laws generally describe civil consequences resulting from impermissible discrimination, not criminal penalties. [52 USC\u202f10308a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/10308), part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, provides criminal penalties for anyone who (attempts to)\ndeprive any person of any right secured by section 10301\\-10304 or 10306\\. 10301 is the provision that people cannot be denied the right to vote on the basis of race of color.

What responsibilities does it have in that respect?\n\nAlso, the state is New Jersey.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question of whether it is irresponsible is pure opinion, which we can't answer. We can, however, address the question of legality. Federal regulations apply to \"public water systems\". In the salient definitions, [42 USC 300f(4\\)(A)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300f) says that\n\n> The term \u201cpublic water system\u201d means a system for the provision to the\n>  public of water for human consumption through pipes or other\n>  constructed conveyances, if such system has at least fifteen service\n>  connections or regularly serves at least twenty\\-five individuals.\n\nAssuming that there are at least 25 individuals being so served, it must be determined whether the water is being \"provided to the public\", and that isn't obvious. However, [42 USC 300g](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300g) says that the regulations do not apply to a system\n\n> (1\\) which consists only of distribution and storage facilities (and\n>  does not have any collection and treatment facilities); (2\\) which\n>  obtains all of its water from, but is not owned or operated by, a\n>  public water system to which such regulations apply; (3\\) which does\n>  not sell water to any person; and (4\\) which is not a carrier which\n>  conveys passengers in interstate commerce.\n\nIt is most likely that all of these conditions are true, so federal testing requirements do not apply. This does not preclude there being state regulations, which may well be more stringent (though they tend to copy the federal rules), but we'd need to know the state. \n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nNew Jersey adopted the federal regulations unchanged. The issue over lead in the water is that corrosive water can leach lead from the plumbing into the water. There is a testing procedure and a threshold of acceptable lead where the town doesn't have to do anything, and above that they are supposed to treat the water (and if they don't, you have the Flint problem). The testing involves sampling at the tap, and if there is more that 0\\.015 mg/L lead in more than 10% of samples, the supplier is supposed to take corrosion\\-control steps. There are also lead service line regulations. There being regulations which put the onus of the problem on the water supplier, and no rules which obligate owners of buildings to rip out existing lead plumbing, the public has not generally been aware of the potential hazard, and it is unlikely that a university could be sued because / if it has some lead in its plumbing that leached into the water (assuming that the lead comes from the university, and not the city supply lines).

The university is not considered a \"public water system\" under federal regulations, as it meets the exemption criteria outlined in 42 USC 300g. Therefore, it's not legally required to conduct regular water quality tests (eliminating option A). However, the university isn't entirely free from responsibility (ruling out option B), as it's responsible for its own plumbing system. The university could potentially face liability if it contributed to the lead problem through its plumbing, such as through recent renovations or neglect.

The court found that the US did not provide an adequate level of data protection, in particular due to national security / surveillance laws like FISA 702 and EO 12333\\. While European countries also have surveillance laws, the US laws are fundamentally different because the affected (non\\-US) persons have no real recourse: they can't really sue against overbroad or illegal surveillance.\n\nAdequacy decisions are only one of many \u201ctransfer tools\u201d that can allow international data transfers. Other tools include Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), \u201ccodes of conduct\u201d, \u201ccertification mechanisms\u201d, or as a last resort Art 49 derogations.\n\nSCCs are a pre\\-formulated contract template provided by the EU that sort out responsibilities between the data exporter in Europe and the data importer in the non\\-European country. In essence, SCCs translate enough of the GDPR into contract law.\n\nBut SCCs are not necessarily valid, and this was also discussed as part of the Schrems II judgement. In [their opinion on the new 2021 SCCs, the EDPB\\+EDPS](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/edpbedps-joint-opinion/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-22021-standard_en) summarize the post\\-Schrems challenges to SCCs (edited to add bullet points):\n\n> In order to be valid, SCCs must incorporate effective mechanisms\n> \n> \n> * that make it possible, in practice, to ensure compliance with the level of protection required by EU law\n> * and that transfers of personal data pursuant to these clauses are suspended or prohibited in the event of the breach of such clauses or if\n> it is impossible to honour them.\n\nIn essence, a company can't sign SCCs if they are also subject to laws (such as US spy laws) that are incompatible with these SCCs.\n\nWhether SCCs are valid in a particular context is not for the EU to decide, but for the data controller to determine.\n\n* In particular, it is possible that SCCs alone are not sufficient. They are just a contract and cannot bind the authorities in the host country of the data importer. Thus, it may be necessary to implement supplemental measures to protect the transfer that makes the personal data worthless if it falls into the wrong hands. After Schrems II, the [EDPB published recommendations on such supplemental measures](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/recommendations/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en), for example end to end encryption where the data importer never gets access to the keys. But this prevents use of nearly all SaaS/cloud services, perhaps with the exception of dumb backup storage.\n* In a different direction, industry has focused on a \u201crisk based approach\u201d to data transfers. For example, the IAPP has a [transfer impact assessment template](https://iapp.org/resources/article/transfer-impact-assessment-templates/). While this departs from the CJEU/EDPB interpretation, it might be a valid approach for EU\u2013US transfers if and ony if you believe that US laws have since changed, so that Schrems II would be outdated.\n\nIn all of this, the new 2021 SCC templates do not quite help. I think the new SCCs are very good since they address many issues with the previous (pre\\-GDPR) templates, but they do not magically negate Schrems II issues. Nothing the EU commission can do by itself can help here, whether this is new SCCs or negotiations for a new Privacy Shield treaty. The Schrems II issues can only be resolved (a) by amending the GDPR to drastically lower the protections for international transfers, or (b) by an act of the US Congress introducing stronger checks and balances into relevant spy laws, in particular providing real legal recourse for affected non\\-US persons.\n\nSo yes, you can absolutely use the US\\-based Google Firebase Auth service, if one of the following holds:\n\n* Your analysis has determined that Google is not subject to problematic surveillance laws.\n* The EU or US legal environment have significantly changed since Schrems II.\n* You believe that you and Google have implemented sufficiently strong supplemental measures so that the US couldn't get their hands on your user's data even if it wanted to.\n* You subscribe to the \u201ctransfer risk assessment\u201d school of thought and, as a result of such an assessment, believe that Google is unlikely to receive problematic requests from US intelligence agencies regarding your user's data.\n* (unethical: considering how unlikely it is to get sued or fined, do the transfer anyway)\n\nGiven all of this trouble, it might end up being easier using a different authentication service.

In England and Wales the usual practice in negotiation is that any offer is made \"without prejudice\".

Also any (English speaking?) legal system's terminology would work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You\u2019ve presented a number of different scenarios, without a lot of specifics, so I\u2019ll start from the top, and from a US perspective.\n\nA *very* generic term that would come up in this situation is material misstatement. one might say that an account or line item is overstated or understated, or a misstatement could arise from the omission of a necessary note, because notes are an integral part of the financial statements. Financial statements are said to be materially misstated if the misstatement would affect the choice of a typical decisionmaker. There\u2019s no explicit standard for what is or isn\u2019t material, but in practice, auditors often choose some small fraction of net income as the threshold. Materiality can also be caused by positive vs. negative earnings, or other thresholds, like financing agreements which might oblige the company to keep its current ratio above a certain level, for example. In the US, the rules to which the statements have to be materially correct are known as GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and they are codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC).\n\nDepending on how the scheme is arranged, issues in the realm of \u201cbuying stuff as a \u201ccustomer\u201d to make the business look good\u201d include:\n\nSubstance over form: it may not be appropriate to recognize as a sale at all. If the net effect is a transfer of cash from the owner or manager to the business, while the goods find their way back into the company warehouse, that could be considered as paid\\-in\\-capital, or even a liability, rather than a sale. Owner bought some product to inject cash, and put the goods back in the inventory? That\u2019s cash from the stockholder, not a customer sale. Somebody in management moved a truckload of product to his storage unit, only to return it after year end? That might be more accurately characterized as a loan, not a sale. I don\u2019t know of any specific terms for this exclusively, but there have certainly been cases where companies moved inventory to undisclosed warehouses in an effort to hide fictitious sales from their independent auditors. **Edit**: Another term for certain sales without commercial substance is a \u201c**roundtrip transaction**\u201d or \u201c**roundtripping**.\u201d\n\nDisclosure notes: even if there is commercial substance to the transaction, it may require disclosure notes, such as those for related party transactions, as required by ASC 850\\. Transactions with related parties must be disclosed even if they are not given accounting recognition (ASC 850\\-05\\-5\\). Examples of related parties are given in ASC 850\\-05\\-3, including \u201can entity and its principal owners, management, or members of their immediate families,\u201d among others. Under the relevant definition, a person does not need a formal title to be considered a member of management (ASC 850\\-10\\-20\\). The related party disclosure is not required in consolidated financial statements, for transactions that are eliminated in the consolidation process (ASC 850\\-10\\-50\\-1\\). For sales from a public company to a bona\\-fide external customer, there\u2019s also the major customers disclosure, but the threshold for that is 10% of revenue, which is much more than enough to materially impact the bottom line.\n\nGenerally, transactions between a parent company and a subsidiary will be eliminated in the preparation of the parent\u2019s (consolidated) financial statements (ASC 810\\). This means if the parent company A sells goods with a carrying value of $30 to its subsidiary, B, at a price of $50, A doesn\u2019t recognize that $20 gross profit until B sells the goods to an outside party. Internally, B might carry the goods at $50 on B\u2019s books, but A would have to cancel it out so that only $30 of that appears on A\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. The consolidation method is applied when one business has a controlling interest in another, and in summary it means that the parent company reports A\\+B\u2019s financials as if it was all a single entity. That means B\u2019s assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, are all reported as part of A. It also means any transactions between B and A are transactions within the entity; you wouldn\u2019t recognize a gain or loss (nor revenue and GP) if your marketing department sold office equipment to your engineering department, and you don\u2019t get to with subsidiaries either. Consolidation requires not only eliminating revenues, cost of goods sold, and excess carrying value of inventories on intra\\-entity transactions; it's also gains and losses on things like equipment, meaning the same transaction could require a consolidation adjustment twenty years later to eliminate excess depreciation expense. Long story short, ASC 810 deals with consolidation, and those rules apply when you create or purchase a subsidiary to buy your stuff, or use a subsidiary to pass the same $200,000 back and forth.\n\nWhen the parent entity does not have a controlling interest in the investee (the basic threshold is 50% of voting shares, or by some other agreement) but does have significant influence (representation on the board or other factors in ASC 323\\-10\\-15\\-6\\), then it will be treated as an equity method investment.

According to copyright law, the creator of an original work automatically owns the copyright to that work at the moment of its creation, without the need for formal registration. In this case, the startup founder who created the sample images owns the copyright, even though they were shared via email with someone in another country. The act of creating the images grants the founder copyright protection, regardless of whether they've registered the copyright or not. \n\nOption A is incorrect because formal registration is not required for copyright protection, though it can provide additional benefits. \n\nOption B is false because receiving images doesn't grant the recipient copyright ownership. \n\nOption D is incorrect because copyright protection does apply to original images, including product concepts, and international borders don't negate this protection under most circumstances due to international copyright treaties."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60839/are-there-databases-that-collect-historical-state-and-local-government-initiated", "docs_id": 60839, "title": "Are there databases that collect historical state and local government-initiated lawsuits against corporations?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For instance, [this database](https://corporate-prosecution-registry.com/) collects federal lawsuits against corporations.\n\nIs there an equivalent one that collects state and local government initiated lawsuits?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short Answer**\n\nNot really.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\nThere are two kinds of court documents.\n\nThe ones primarily used by lawyers in cases other than the actual case being litigated are published court opinions in appeals, and sometimes of trial court rulings on motions or bench trials or legal issues. These cases are assembled by legal publication companies in what used to be long sequential series of hard bound books called \"reports\" although this is not predominantly done electronically.\n\nBut every court case produces a court file which is maintained by a court clerk. Historically this has usually been done at the trial court clerk level in each county, with appellate court filing that are not published maintained by court clerks for each appellate court.\n\nThe federal courts have modernized this into a single online record keeping system for non\\-sealed court documents available to the general public over the Internet for a modest charge known as PACER (there is a parallel system linked to it in which lawyers and parties and judges can file documents after getting an account in that system).\n\nSome states have partially or fully consolidated state court files into on online system and there is considerable variation in the degree to which non\\-lawyer can access these files over the Internet (anyone can go to a court clerk's office and get copies of the non\\-sealed court files maintained by that clerk in paper form at a modest charge). But most state court records aren't searchable by members of the general public and aren't available to members of the general public over the Internet.\n\nIf there is an equivalent database to the one you mention that collects state\\- and local\\-government initiated lawsuits against corporations on a comprehensive basis, I've never seen it or heard about it.\n\nIf I wanted to, I could do a search of the court records of all of the post\\-digitized court cases brought by a particular governmental entity in Colorado's court records (except in municipal courts and the Denver County Court which are not part of the state record keeping system). I could likewise do a search of all post\\-digitized court cases brought against a particular corporation in Colorado's courts (with the same exceptions).\n\nBut I could not do a search of all records of all cases brought by any governmental entity (there are about 30,000 of them in the U.S.) against any corporation (there are several million corporations in the U.S.), and there really isn't an efficient way to compile such a list. It would take pure brute force pouring through case captions, without cooperation in a research agreement with the state court e\\-filing system administrator and a human subject committee review approval (which could probably both be obtained with enough work).\n\nThere are private companies, primarily credit reporting agencies for business debtors, such as Dun and Bradstreet, and Standard \\& Poors, that systemically pay for and process bulk downloads of all case fillings in almost every court at great expense to prepare a system of credit reports, and their data is available for a substantial fee, generally on a per party search basis, or on a subscription basis, which also isn't cheap. I had a subscription to D\\&B for a year or two since I had a case where this was necessary to finance the expense, and it wasn't crushingly expensive, but it wasn't cheap either.\n\nAnother private database is Lexis Nexus. It is best known for its legal search database, mostly of published and unpublished appellate court decisions that competes primarily with Westlaw, the other major online commercial database of published and unpublished court decisions. But Lexis Nexus also maintains a database of newspaper and magazine and scholarly research articles, and an appropriate search of that database would reveal lawsuits by governments against corporations that were reported upon, not only in the national news, but by local media sources and in industry journals. It isn't the most expensive of private sources, but it isn't the cheapest either, unless you have an academic subscription.\n\nThere is also a service called the jury verdict reporter the maintains as comprehensive a list of civil jury verdicts as it can, but that wouldn't be a great fit to the search criteria and would also be quite expensive to utilize outside paper copies in a law library.\n\nIt might be somewhat manageable for someone with a lawyer's access to the e\\-filing system to set out to list all lawsuits filed against 100 to 500 large publicly held corporations in a single state, and then to manually purge those lists by the governmental or non\\-governmental character of the plaintiffs, during the e\\-filing era, although it would still be an epic and expensive task. But there isn't any free source that has done it. Any publicly available databases are extremely fragmentary.\n\nAnother way to dramatically focus the search would be to limit the scope of government plaintiffs searched. There are roughly 30,000 state and local governments in the United States. But State governments would bring the lion's share of interesting lawsuits against publicly held corporations and there are only 50 of those (plus D.C. and territorial governments) to search. If you limited it to state criminal prosecutions against corporations (which are extremely rare), that would narrow your search even further, although it would still be cumbersome to winnow down.\n\nAfter state government plaintiffs you'd want to focus on the county and municipal governments in the place where each corporation has its headquarters, on county and municipal governments in state capitols, and on county and municipal governments in places where each corporation has its largest operations other than its headquarters (especially central cities in major metropolitan areas).\n\nFor cases filed prior to the e\\-filing system, you would have even more work, realistically, having to go from court house to court house in every single county to review paper based indexes of court files (although at least you could sort cases based upon case names alone without reviewing the content of the files).\n\nFinally, there is a non\\-court record source that is available for publicly held corporations, of which there are several thousand. This is EDGAR which is the databased of federal corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that contains annual and quarterly reports from publicly held companies and also supplemental disclosures from those companies in some circumstances. Publicly held companies are required to mention in their SEC reports available on the Internet via EDGAR all material lawsuits against the company. So, if you wanted to develop a database of material lawsuits in all jurisdictions filed by governments against say, all corporations in the S\\&P 500, EDGAR reports would be a fairly efficient way to go about it, even though these reports also contain lots of non\\-lawsuit related information.\n\nBut closely held companies don't have to file reports with the SEC so an EDGAR search would not reveal lawsuits filed by governments against privately held corporations.\n\nIf you were primarily interested in criminal cases against corporations, select reports of the U.S. Sentencing Commission and a handful of U.S. states also have similar commissions that might sometimes discuss sentences for corporations as criminal defendants, although these would be quite rare.\n\nThere are also likely to be databases specific to suits commonly brought by governments against corporations, such as anti\\-trust cases, labor law cases, and environmental cases.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the availability of comprehensive databases for state and local government-initiated lawsuits against corporations?\n\nA) There is a single, easily accessible database that collects all state and local government lawsuits against corporations, similar to the federal corporate prosecution registry.\n\nB) While no comprehensive database exists, PACER provides full access to all state and local government lawsuits against corporations.\n\nC) There is no single comprehensive database, but a combination of state court e-filing systems, private services like Dun & Bradstreet, and SEC EDGAR filings can provide partial information on such lawsuits.\n\nD) LexisNexis maintains a complete and freely accessible database of all state and local government lawsuits against corporations across the United States.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The novel is set in the year 2373\\. Obviously there is no way to be sure what the law will be at that date, so I am asking what the law for a similar situation would be in the year 2022, in New York State, although I would also be interested in the law in other jurisdictions. \\[This question includes spoilers for the earlier books in the series.]\n\nIN this novel the main character, Captain Ishmael Wang, has a chance to purchase a used spaceship designed for both freight and passengers at the bargain price of 35 million credits (about 1/3 of the market price). Not having that much money of his own, Ishmael hires a financial advisor, William Simpson. Simpson sets up a company with nine shares of stock, each with a face value of ten million credits. He arranges for four venture capital investors to buy one share each at face value, which would give Ishmael the purchase price plus additional start up funds. In return the stock will pay 5% dividends annually, starting after five years. But at the last moment, one investor backs out of the deal. Simpson arranges a 90\\-day loan of 8 million, at 6%, backed by one share of the company.\n\nAs the end of the 90\\-day period approaches, the company ios doing well, but has not earned the required eight million credits. Here is the relevant conversation between Ishmael Wang and William Simpson (from chapter 65 of *Oner's Share*)\n\n> \u201cSo, how can I help you today, Captain?\u201d Mr. Simpson asked with a small smile and a sidelong glance.\n> \n> \n> \u201cI\u2019ve come about the note, sir. It\u2019s due in a couple of days and the ship hasn\u2019t earned enough in so short a time. I wondered if you\u2019d found a buyer for the stock so that we might avoid default.\u201d\n> \n> \n> He reached over and patted my forearm with one bony hand. \u201cHere\u2019s what will happen on the twenty\\-sixth, my boy.\u201d He laced his fingers together across his chest and continued. \u201cAssuming you haven\u2019t the liquid assets needed to repay the loan, you will default. Larks, Simpson, and Greene will take ownership of the single share of stock that you\u2019ve assigned as collateral. Once that happens we\u2019ll sell it to an investor, removing ourselves from ownership, and leaving you to deal with your board of directors.\u201d\n> \n> \n> \u201cYou already have an investor, sir?\u201d\n> \u201cWe do, my boy. We do.\u201d\n> \n> \n> \u201cThen why not sell them a share of unencumbered stock, and let me pay off the loan without incurring the default?\u201d\n> \n> \n> He turned his head toward me. \u201cIf we did that, we\u2019d forego the opportunity to earn a profit of two million credits.\u201d He shook his head, and turned back to gaze out through the armorglass. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested a great deal of time and money in getting you started up, Captain. You\u2019ll walk away with an unencumbered company, and the opportunity to succeed or fail on your own without long\\-term liabilities. Please don\u2019t deny us a modest profit on the transaction.\u201d\n\nIt seems to me that the Simpson character, a paid financial advisor who knows that Wang is relying on his advice, is in the position of a fiduciary (or would be under current law) and would be ethically and legally required to but his client's interest first, and not take the two million additional profit, on top of his fees and the 6% interest on the loan. Is that correct?\n\n\\[I will add that I recommend this series, which consists of the novels *Quarter Share*, *Half Share*, *Full Share*, *Double Share*, *Captain's Share*, and *Owner's Share*.

His role appears rather to be that of a business advisor: a financial advisor offers investment advice whereas a business advisor offers business and corporate capital advice. In most jurisdictions, financial advisors are heavily regulated, business advisors aren\u2019t.\n\nTo be a fiduciary, the person must come from a recognised class where the relationship is fiduciary by its nature, or the relationship must be one of special trust and confidence.\n\n> Such relationships will possess the \u201ccritical feature\u201d spoken of by Mason J in *Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation* (1984\\) 156 CLR 41 at 96\\-97, namely:\n> \n> \n> \u201c... that the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense. The relationship between the parties is therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position.\u201d\n\nIs Simpson in a class recognised to have a fiduciary duty?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nProbably, but not to Wang.\n\nOne class the law recognises as owing a fiduciary duty is that of Promoter of a company: *Tracy v Mandalay Pty Ltd* (1953\\) 88 CLR 215, Dixon CJ, Williams and Taylor JJ at 241\u2013242\\.\n\nHowever, that duty is owed to the *company*, not to any particular shareholder. Indeed, a duty to the company is incompatible with a duty to potential investors in that company, If the loan default is by the company, this would appear to breach that duty.\n\nHowever, Wang is not owed such a duty if the loan is in his name.\n\nWe can\u2019t really tell if the loan is owed by the company or by Wang: either is possible on the information given.\n\nDoes Simpson\u2019s relationship to Wang possess the \u201ccritical feature\u201d?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the facts given (here and probably in the book), it\u2019s impossible to say.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that this relationship is a contractural one and fiduciary duties are rarely found in such relationships. As with most things involving contract law, the terms of the contract are critical.\n\n> The imposition of fiduciary duties in contractual relationships can be problematic. In *Hospital Products*, Mason J spoke in terms that came to be endorsed by the High Court in *John Alexander\u2019s Clubs v White City Tennis Club* (2010\\) 241 CLR 1 at 36; \\[2010] HCA 19\\. Sir Anthony Mason examined cases where contract provides the foundation for a fiduciary relationship:\n> \n> \n> \u201cIn these situations it is the contractual foundation which is all important because it is the contract that regulates the basic rights and liabilities of the parties. The fiduciary relationship, if it is to exist at all, must accommodate itself to the terms of the contract so that it is consistent with, and conforms to, them. The fiduciary relationship cannot be superimposed upon the contract in such a way as to alter the operation which the contract was intended to have according to its true construction.\u201d\n\nIf the terms of the contract create a fiduciary relationship, either explicitly or implicitly, then there will be one. However, almost all contracts don\u2019t do this: the rights and responsibilities in most contracts are incompatible with a fiduciary relationship.\n\nWhat does the contract say?\n---------------------------\n\nIf the contract explicitly allows Simpson to behave in this manner then that\u2019s the end of it. It says he can so he can.\n\nIf the contract gives Simpson discretion to act in this manner, or if it is silent, then it gets a bit jurisdiction specific. In the US, there is an obligation to act in good faith to achieve the purposes of a contract. Other common law jurisdictions do not impose this positive duty: they impose a negative duty to not act in bad faith.\n\nWhile Simpson\u2019s actions are certainly not those of a good faith actor, they are not obviously bad faith. Good faith requires powers to be exercised reasonably and not arbitrarily. Bad faith requires an intention to mislead or deceive by performing the contract dishonestly or fraudulently. There is a gap in between and Simpson might be in that gap.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described from the novel \"Owner's Share\", which of the following statements is most accurate regarding William Simpson's fiduciary duty to Ishmael Wang?\n\nA) Simpson definitely owes a fiduciary duty to Wang because he is acting as a financial advisor.\n\nB) Simpson owes no fiduciary duty to Wang because their relationship is purely contractual.\n\nC) Simpson's fiduciary duty, if any, would depend on the specific terms of their contract and the nature of their relationship.\n\nD) Simpson owes a fiduciary duty to the company, which by extension applies to Wang as a shareholder.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the existence of a fiduciary duty in this case is not clear-cut and would depend on several factors. As explained in the passage, Simpson's role appears to be more of a business advisor than a financial advisor, which affects the likelihood of a fiduciary relationship. The nature of their relationship and the specific terms of their contract would be crucial in determining whether a fiduciary duty exists. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because being a financial advisor doesn't automatically create a fiduciary duty, especially since Simpson's role is more accurately described as a business advisor.\n\nAnswer B is too absolute; while contractual relationships rarely involve fiduciary duties, it's not impossible for such duties to arise from a contract.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while Simpson might owe a duty to the company as its promoter, this doesn't necessarily extend to individual shareholders like Wang. Additionally, it's unclear whether the loan is to Wang personally or to the company.\n\nThe correct answer emphasizes the complexity of the situation and the need for more specific information about the contract and relationship to determine the existence of a fiduciary duty."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37168/priority-between-signed-contract-and-adoption-agreement", "docs_id": 37168, "title": "Priority between signed contract and adoption agreement", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When a contract is signed, then the adoption agreement (that is supposed to mirror the contract) has a conflicting statement, which takes priority?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> which takes priority?\n\nBased on the context as stated in [your comment](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37168/priority-between-signed-contract-and-adaption-agreement?noredirect=1#comment67017_37168), I assume that the client is **not** the draftsman of the contract.

If the adoption agreement is detrimental to the company/draftsman, the best approach is to amend it as soon as possible.\n\nA situation where the adoption agreement is detrimental *to the non\\-draftsman* of the contract sounds in company's unilateral alteration of the contract.

How will this gain be taxed?\n\nA) It will be taxed at a flat capital gains rate of 25%.\nB) It will be tax-free as the musician's income is below the tax-free threshold.\nC) It will be taxed as regular income, potentially pushing the musician into a higher tax bracket with a marginal rate of 42%.\nD) It will be taxed as \"sonstiges Einkommen\" (other income) using the progressive income tax scale, with an effective tax rate around 30% on the total income.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: In Germany, cryptocurrency sales held for less than a year are considered \"privates Ver\u00e4u\u00dferungsgesch\u00e4ft\" (private sale) under \u00a723 EstG and classified as \"sonstiges Einkommen\" (other income). This means the gains are subject to regular income tax, not the flat capital gains tax. The tax is calculated on the entire taxable income using a progressive scale, not just the highest marginal rate. With a total income of \u20ac76,000 (\u20ac6,000 + \u20ac70,000), the effective tax rate would be around 30%, not the highest marginal rate of 42%.

It does not mean that employees excluded by these rules would be unable to whistleblow at all. Rather, the government channels through which they are able to seek protection are likely through a different office. In so far as I can tell, USOSC might restrict the FBI from protection services because they protect employees who go to the Media. FBI agents often handle classified material which would not be allowed to be disclosed to the media and many intel agency employees are required to submit any documents they intend to publish based off knowledge aquired from their employment for a pre\\-publishing review to make sure no classified material is leaked, and would thus limit the way the employee could whistleblow.\n\nJust because this particular office does not provide protection services to the listed employees, it does not mean there is an agency or department that does provide them (Usually the Office of General Inspector for the particular agency in question. While they are attached to the agency they cover, they are not within the chain of command of the agency itself and are independent to them.).\n\nFor that reason, just because the rules that apply to most do not cover FBI Whistle Blowers, it does not mean an FBI employee cannot become a whistle blower.

Instead, they must use alternative channels, typically their agency's Office of Inspector General, for whistleblowing and protection. This exclusion is likely due to the sensitive nature of FBI work and the need to protect classified information.

The negative result to the consumer is that this chip caused reliability issues with the system resulting in blank screens. If the chip is disabled manually or by the use of a 3rd party device (blinking light win) then it is much more reliable.\n\nThe top loader model of the NES later released removed this chip making it more reliable in that respect. My question is, would disabling or using the BLW violate the DMCA or any other US law?\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIC_(Nintendo)>\n\n<https://www.arcadeworks.net/blw>\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [The function of the 10NES / CIC Chip](https://youtu.be/sJFCwDJq1gU?list=TLPQMjQwOTIwMjK-hrfOcqorbQ)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CIC chip was used first at the SNES, and was the base for most authentication. It ran proprietary software that would be seeded with random numbers, and it aborts the game in case that some calculations did come to a bad result.\n\nBypassing it was done with one of three methods:\n\n* modifying the console and disabling the chip, which is legal.\n* use a specialized chip that...\n\t+ answers to the CIC with the authentic answers.\n\t+ just freezes the CIC chip by giving it a Zap.\n\n### Faking Authentification\n\nThere's basically two ways to fake authentication: either you use a copy of the actual chip's proprietary code, or mimicking the proper output. And here the legal trouble starts:\n\nWholesale copying the code or even the significant portions is copyright infringement and illegal.\n\nTricking the US copyright office to get a hold of the trade secret copyrighted code, like Atari did? **Highly** illegal. Copying portions of that illegally obtained code? [Copyright infringement and illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Games_Corp._v._Nintendo_of_America_Inc.), and the court even denied Atari many defenses because they had fooled the copyright office to get the code. [You can read the verdict here](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15866317401594691669), but I want to quote this paragraph (emphasis mine):\n\n> In this case, the source code obtained from the Copyright Office facilitated Atari's intermediate copying of the 10NES program. To invoke the fair use exception, **an individual must possess an authorized copy** of a literary work. See Harper \\& Row, 471 U.S. at 562\\-63, 105 S.Ct. at 2232 (Knowing exploitation of purloined manuscript not compatible with \"good faith\" and \"fair dealings\" underpinnings of fair use doctrine.). **Because Atari was not in authorized possession of the Copyright Office copy of 10NES, any copying or derivative copying of 10NES source code from the Copyright Office does not qualify as a fair use.**\n\nBut reconstructing a workaround chip? That actually is legal, as the very case determined in the very next paragraph:\n\n> Reverse engineering, untainted by the purloined copy of the 10NES program and necessary to understand 10NES, is a fair use. \\[Explanation of the process used before Atari resorted to tricking the Copyright office] This \"reverse engineering\" process, **to the extent untainted by the 10NES copy purloined from the Copyright Office**, qualified as a fair use.\n\nAnd deconstructing the chip to show the results? That's actually legal. Even the court in the Atari\\-case said so, and had Atari succeeded in their tries, they would have not had to result to illegal methods to get a hold of the code.\n\n### Zapping the chip\n\nWhile Atari's \"Rabbit\" chip was ill\\-gotten gains, other companies made different legal workarounds: Interrupt the function of the chip by *shocking* the CIC? That's legal.\n\n[GameBoy Authentification](https://youtu.be/I1cUIGHZLGA?list=TLPQMjQwOTIwMjK-hrfOcqorbQ)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe [GameBoy](https://youtu.be/I1cUIGHZLGA?list=TLPQMjQwOTIwMjK-hrfOcqorbQ) used a variant system. It did not rely on code secrecy but worked with the Trademark \\- offering a different venue to strike at infringers. The GB BootROM relied on loading and then checking if the game was offering the Nintendo logo. If the logo wasn't readable, it would not boot. To make a game run, the most simple way would be to include the Nintendo Logo. There is a more complex solution that first displays the maker's logo and then offers the Nintendo Logo for verification in the second step.\n\n### The simple solution: just display Nintendo\\-TM\n\nIf the game simply offered the official, registered Nindendo logo, it would offer to be endorsed or made by Nintendo. This would be a violation of the Nintendo trademarks, and illegal.\n\n### Tricking the chip\n\nBy displaying the own logo on the step 1 but offering the Nintendo\\-TM Logo in the 2nd step, the solution is very akin to the [Lexmark Cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexmark_International,_Inc._v._Static_Control_Components,_Inc.).

Garner*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/471/1/):\n\n> The use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony suspects, whatever the circumstances, is constitutionally unreasonable. It is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape. Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.\n\n> Where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.\n\nThis case does not generally prohibit using deadly force to arrest someone who is fleeing in a vehicle, as vehicles are deadly weapons. A person fleeing police in a car poses a threat to pursuing officers and the general public so it is up to local policy and the officers on scene to weigh the risk of public harm against the interest of taking suspects alive and the risk of attempting to use deadly force against them. However, most if not all police departments do not allow the use of deadly force merely because someone is fleeing in a vehicle and also prohibit using firearms against a vehicle in this way, and at least according to the [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-30/no-justification-for-shooting-by-long-beach-school-safety-officer-experts-say) this is true of the Long Beach Police Department as well:\n\n> According to a use\\-of\\-force policy from Long Beach Unified\u2019s school safety office, officers are not permitted to fire at a moving vehicle.

I'm also equally assured of users' familiarity with the Amendment that follows, and they are thus aware of the rights it affords to the defendant, which includes one to confront adverse witnesses and obtain favourable ones via a compulsory process.\n\nIn my opinion, the rights that I have stated in the previous paragraph are in conflict with each other in certain scenarios. For example, what happens if the state's witness invokes their Fifth Amendment right on cross\\-examination or a defence witness, whom the state refuses to give immunity, does the same on direct examination?\n\nI am aware that a witness may not want to expose themselves to prosecution, but would they deprive a defendant's right to a full defence in doing so?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, there is indeed a conflict, often described as a balancing act. Similarly, the principle of free speech protected by the First Amendment requires that the public tolerate lies in political rhetoric, and hateful public speech and insults, but can be balanced against an individual's interest in reputation in a libel case. See *Near vs Minnesota* and *NY Times vs Sullivan* for leading cases on this issue. There is also tension between the right of a newspaper to report on a current criminal case again under the First Amendment, and the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial before an unbiased jury, which might be influenced by newspaper publicity.\n\nIn these and similar situations, there is no way to fully serve both protected interests, and courts must strike a balance and prefer one right over another, or find some compromise.\n\nIn the 5th vs 6th situation, courts have mostly favored the 5th. That is, the court will not require a witness to give up the right not to self\\-incriminate, and usually will not grant a defendant an acquittal because desired testimony is unavailable.\n\nIt might be that a defendant expected to rely on the testimony of a witness who has since died, or has fled the country and cannot be brought before the court. The sixth does not and cannot assure perfect justice, and the courts do not attempt to make it do so.\n\nIn the situation described, the defendant may compel the witness to appear and be asked the relevant questions. The jury will hear the answer, and may assume what it would have been without the invocation of the Fifth. The defendant's lawyer can try to find a question that the witness will answer, and can argue that the refusal to answer is consistent with a not\\-guilty verdict. That is all that the courts provide.\n\nWhen the **prosecution** calls a witness, knowing or having good reason to know that the witness will invoke the 5th on more or less every relevant question, the US Supreme Court in *Namet v.

In situations where there is a conflict between a witness's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to present a defense, courts have generally favored the Fifth Amendment right. The defendant can compel the witness to appear and be asked relevant questions, but cannot force the witness to answer if they invoke their Fifth Amendment right.

Disbursements can include 'fees' which are paid by a lawyer on a client's behalf \u2013 the dictionary definition includes the example of expert witness fees, but a more common example is a filing fee charged by a court to commence a lawsuit. However, when used in contrast to 'disbursements,' 'fees' often refer to lawyers' professional fees. These tend to be charged by the hour and form the majority of litigation costs.

The source you have quoted from explains a common feature of the law of costs in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada: disbursements are often recoverable in full, while professional fees can only be recovered in part. This ensures that the loser is not responsible for the winner's decision to hire unusually expensive lawyers, although in many jurisdictions even an average lawyer will charge fees well in excess of the recoverable amount.

In practice, there is very little middle ground. \n\nMost companies either have just a handful of owners and investment debt holders (i.e. are closely held), or have a great many (typically thousands), while few are near the threshold between being closely held and public held.

Someone who saw the full video prior to the trial would be ineligible to serve as a juror in the case in much the same way that witnesses of a crime can not serve on the jury in a trial arising from that crime.\n\nThe fact that he was acquitted meant that the case could never be retried.

As I know in many countries companies are obliged to withhold and pay income tax on employees' behalf. So it's company's responsibility to pay the tax. Who has to pay the tax in this situation? In case no one pays the tax will Revenue Department inquire this tax from the person or from the company? Assume the USA Law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So these are the basic rules of the tax game:\n\n1. The taxpayer (employee, in this case) is liable for tax on income earned by him.\n2. On occasion, the payor of the income to be received by the taxpayer is required to withhold tax on the payment, remit the withheld tax to the IRS/state/local tax authority and pay the balance over to the taxpayer. If that happens, the taxpayer is entitled to a credit against his taxes for the amount withheld by the payor.\n3. Failure by the payor to withhold the required amount of tax does NOT excuse the taxpayer from paying tax on the income he earned.\n\nSo company B is right.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John worked for Company X from January to September, earning $60,000. Company X withheld and paid income taxes on John's behalf. From October to December, John worked for Company Y, earning an additional $20,000. Company Y, assuming John had no prior income that year, did not withhold any taxes. What is the most accurate statement regarding John's tax situation?\n\nA) John is not responsible for any additional taxes, as Company X already paid taxes on his behalf for most of the year.\n\nB) Company Y is solely responsible for paying the taxes on John's $20,000 income, as they failed to withhold taxes properly.\n\nC) John is responsible for paying taxes on the $20,000 earned from Company Y, regardless of Company Y's failure to withhold.\n\nD) The IRS will only pursue Company Y for the unpaid taxes, as employers are always responsible for tax payments.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to U.S. tax law, the ultimate responsibility for paying income taxes lies with the individual taxpayer, regardless of an employer's withholding practices. While employers are generally required to withhold taxes, their failure to do so does not exempt the employee from tax liability. In this case, John is responsible for paying taxes on the $20,000 earned from Company Y, even though Company Y did not withhold taxes. John will need to report all of his income, including the $60,000 from Company X and the $20,000 from Company Y, on his tax return and pay any additional taxes owed. Company Y's failure to withhold does not transfer the tax liability to them, nor does Company X's proper withholding earlier in the year cover John's total tax obligation for the full year's income."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83237/does-it-actually-do-anything-legally-to-state-this-is-not-financial-advice-aft", "docs_id": 83237, "title": "Does it actually do anything legally to state &quot;this is not financial advice&quot; after giving financial advice?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When people talk about investing online they often say \"this is not financial advice\" after giving financial advice.

The former can be done by anyone; the others require a licence.\n\nYou can tailor factual information to someone about whom you have specific information (such as someone who asked a question on [Money SE](https://money.stackexchange.com)) without crossing into advice. The examples in the ASIC document are illustrative:\n\n> **Scenario**\n> \n> \n> An organisation without an AFS licence includes on its website a list of financial products of a particular class available from third\\-party product providers, together with some objectively ascertainable factual information about specific product characteristics, with the aim of providing useful information for consumers to assist them to make a decision about the class of financial product.\n> \n> \n> **Commentary**\n> \n> \n> Because the information is factual and does not involve a qualitative judgement about, or an evaluation or assessment of, the features of the products, it is not financial product advice.\n\n> **Scenario**\n> \n> \n> A client contacts an insurer\u2019s call centre and requests a quote for comprehensive car insurance. Noting the client\u2019s car is old and of low value, the call centre operator mentions the possibility of third party property damage cover and explains the difference between it and comprehensive cover. At the client\u2019s request, the call centre operator provides a quote for the annual premiums for each product.\n> \n> \n> **Commentary**\n> \n> \n> This is factual information. Although the call centre operator has been provided with some personal information about the client, and has used this information to provide relevant information to the client about an alternative product, the operator has not given an opinion or made a recommendation that is intended to, or that could be reasonably regarded as being intended to, influence a decision about a financial product.\n\n> **Scenario**\n> \n> \n> A superannuation fund would like to provide a brochure containing general advice about retirement planning issues to some of its members via a mailout. The general advice would be most relevant to members aged 55 and over.\n> \n> \n> **Commentary**\n> \n> \n> The fund can use personal information that they have about their members\u2019 age to send the brochure to members who are 55 and over. Using the personal information about fund members in this way does not mean that the fund is providing personal advice. Instead, the fund is using personal information to provide general advice to a particular audience.\n\nThe disclaimer will not turn what is clearly advice into information but it makes clear that what is being presented is and is intended to be factual information.

The blogger is making specific predictions about a particular stock's performance and suggesting it as an opportunity for investors. This goes beyond providing general, factual information and enters the realm of recommendations that could influence financial decisions.\n\nThe disclaimer alone (option A) does not provide full protection if the content of the message contradicts it. The statement is not clearly just general information (option B) as it contains specific recommendations. However, it's also not definitely illegal (option D) as the legal implications would depend on the specific jurisdiction, the blogger's overall activities, and how the statement is contextualized.\n\nThe key takeaway is that simply adding a disclaimer doesn't automatically prevent a statement from being considered financial advice if the content suggests otherwise.

Co\\-founders B and C will be continuing their work on the same startup project, and wouldn't want to deal with any future consquences.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The three partners presumably created some variation of an \u00a7 705 BGB partnership (*Gesellschaft b\u00fcrgerlichen Rechts*). Their rights and obligations are established via their mutual contract, which does not even have to be written as long as no real estate is involved. However, this contract is bounded by the BGB.\n\nThe partner A who wants to leave can terminate the partnership contract at any time. Depending on the terms of the contract, this will dissolve the partnership (default consequence), or the partnership will continue with the other members B and C. In either case, A will receive their share of the assets of the partnership. The BGB provides a default procedure:\n\n* objects that were handed over to the partnership are returned, without compensation for use or accidental loss\n* outstanding debts of the partnership are discharged, or sufficient assets are set aside for later discharge\n* from the remaining assets, A's capital contributions are returned. This includes both monetary and non\\-monetary contributions, but not services performed by A.\n* if there is a surplus/profit, it is divided among the members. However, the correct division can be difficult to determine since it shall depend on the member's share/contribution to the profit, not necessarily on their capital contributions to the partnership.\n* similarly, if there is a deficit, everyone has to make further contributions to the degree that they are responsible for those losses\n\nSo this means that yes, for all practical purposes the partners B and C can \u201cbuy out\u201d A, if A voluntarily terminates the contract. B and C would have to pay to A either according to the terms set out in the contract, or by default:\n\n* A's capital contributions to the partnership\n* plus/minus the profit/losses for which A is responsible\n\nSince you mention that the founder's agreement describes an allocation of \u201cequity\u201d, this may help with the division of profits.\n\nBut starting with a non\\-notarized partnership and presumably shoddy bookkeeping, trying to reconstruct all contributions and everyone's share of the profit/losses is going to be an utter mess \u2013 the typical divorce is probably easier to sort out. If there are non\\-negligible sums involved, everyone (and especially A) should get a lawyer to represent them in the ensuing negotiations. Nothing prevents the partners from reaching an unanimous agreement, but everyone would still be interested in getting this agreement negotiated by legal professionals to make sure that no future demands remain. Legal professionals are costly, but if this startup idea works out these DIY contracts will end up being far more costly.\n\nFurther potential factors that might complicate things:\n\n* depending on the goals or the structure of the partnership, different rules might apply. In particular, this might be the case if the goal of the partnership was trade.\n* Some of the non\\-monetary assets that would return to A might be essential for the continuation of the partnership by B and C. This would give A substantial leverage during negotiations, unless there are already contractual provisions for continued use. For example, the comments point out issues around intellectual property.\n* A is not required to exit the partnership. B and C can exclude A from the partnership only with cause, and only if the partnership will continue to exist when one member leaves. Of course, B and C have the same termination rights as A, so they could terminate the partnership and start a new partnership.

But I gather that the last bullet encompasses the sense of your question *whether the calculation of overtime depends on the sequence of schedules*. The answer is no.\n\nThe language in (iii) has no indication that the 11\\-hour schedule needs to precede the 9\\-hour schedule even if it is written in that order. Notice how (iii) is in terms of \"*any **other** day*\" instead of \"*a **later** date*\". The term \"*other*\" is more flexible or wider encompassing \\-\\-in terms of chronology\\-\\- than a term such as \"*later*\".\n\nThus, as an example, suppose an employee worked three days giving a total of 27 hours in a week. Clearly he did not exceed 38 hours (also assume for simplicity that (ii) and the clause on \"roster cycle\" are inapplicable). If the employee's schedules were 10, 10, and 7 hours, he gets no overtime because he never exceeded 11 hours.\n\nBy contrast, if the employee's schedules were 12, 2, and 13 hours, respectively, then gets (13\\-11\\) \\+ (12\\-9\\) \\= (13\\-9\\) \\+ (12\\-11\\) \\= 5 hours at overtime rate.

The documentation suggests that downloading and storing HTML is probably not a copyright violation, especially given that major web browsers include functionality to view and save source code. However, processing and extracting information from the stored HTML could potentially be prevented by copyright holders. The company should be careful about how they use the stored data, particularly if websites have terms of service that prohibit certain uses. This answer best reflects the nuanced legal situation described in the documentation, acknowledging both the likely legality of the practice and the need for caution."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81028/contradictory-laws", "docs_id": 81028, "title": "contradictory laws", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If there are multiple laws:\n\na) in a country (all the laws in one country)\n\nb) in multilple different countries and / or multinational unions (all laws in different entities, e.g. all in a different country)\n\nthat contradict each other, what is a person supposed to do to follow the law?

This apply both between contradictory laws and also to internal contradictions within laws.\n* New laws trump old laws.

While it's true that federal law generally trumps state law (as mentioned in option A), and newer laws can supersede older ones (as suggested in option B), the key principle highlighted in the passage is that courts try to avoid disregarding laws entirely. Instead, they attempt to find ways for seemingly contradictory laws to coexist, even if it results in an unusual or perhaps unintended interpretation. This is exemplified in the passage by the statement: \"If federal law says, 'do X', state law say 'do Y', and the only way to do both is some weird, perhaps-not-intended Z, then the court will typically respond to a violation by saying, 'you should have done Z,' rather than saying, 'the state law was preempted.'\" This approach aims to respect the intent of both federal and state legislatures while resolving conflicts."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25650/is-a-second-location-of-a-restaurant-required-to-honor-gift-cards-purchased-at-t", "docs_id": 25650, "title": "Is a second location of a restaurant required to honor gift cards purchased at the first location?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I received a gift card for a local restaurant about a year ago.

Is this location limitation printed on the card? Is it posted in the restaurant? If there are no written or visible limits on the location of usage, you can reasonably argue that the card should be used in any location because that limitation was not expressed in the beginning.\n\nIf there is no expiration date and no terms regarding the use at different locations, it sounds like the ramifications of giving gift cards wasn't clearly thought out by the restaurant.\n\nYou can argue with them; give them a bad review on Yelp; or take them to small claims court.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer in Lincoln, NE received a gift card for a local restaurant one year ago.

If there's no printed expiration date, the customer can reasonably argue that the card is still valid. However, the law doesn't explicitly require businesses to honor cards indefinitely if no expiration is stated. \n\nRegarding use at different locations, this depends on the terms and conditions of the gift card.

He left saying: \u201cI have no idea what happened\u201d. Next day, another guy \\- \u201csomeone\u201d just to quote what the landlord said \\- came over, left with the same result. Nothing happened for 8 days, and then, at 3rd of September another investigator came, who also left with: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d.\n\nHe's just asking for the property management company, and... they repaired the lift in 2 months, so not much hopes.\n\nAs I\u2019ve read, in the UK law, the landlord must carry out repairs in a reasonable period of time. Not too sure if carry out means completing the works, or just starting the process, but if he chooses the cheapest slowest workers, it may end up even one year, and I\u2019ll have to live in a hotel for that long just because the landlord says: \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any delay on my side\u201d.\n\nSo when can I sue the landlord for disrepair \\- not fixing the problems in time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Pretty much any time a contractual, statutory or case law precedent uses the word \"reasonable\" what it means is that the decision regarding what is and is not reasonable is vested in the trier of fact (i.e. the judge in a U.K. landlord\\-tenant case) to decide on a case by case basis in light of all of the facts and circumstances presented at trial, rather something to be decided as a matter of law by an appellate court absent of extreme abuse of discretion by the judge in determining what is reasonable.\n\nPut yourself in the judge's shoes and consider the range of opinion that people who are judges in a case like this might have, and you have your answer.\n\nA reasonable amount of time balances out factors like the availability of repair contractors at a reasonable price, the magnitude of the repair, and the extent to which the repair impairs the habitability of the premises, and assumes a time frame that would apply if the landlord is diligent and trying to solve the problem in good faith. A reasonable time to fix a broken heating element is different in July than in January.\n\nIf three different inspectors failed to determine the cause of the problem, that is going to work in favor of the landlord for a longer period of time. So will the significant extent of the damage (apparently). On the other hand, the fact that the repair rendered the premises completely uninhabitable argues for a shorter time period.\n\nStarting late to address an urgent problem could be breach, although it doesn't sound like this has happened here if some action has been taken that would seem to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results have been inconclusive about what to do. Unnecessary foot dragging could also be a fact in reasonableness, because ultimately the duty is to get the job done.\n\nThere may also be a parallel duty of the landlord to provide a habitable premises and to compensate you for time when this is not provided, in addition to the duty to repair within a reasonable time. Asking to be paid for alternative accommodations while diagnosis and repairs are underway would be a logical demand to make before suing for a fairly small dollar amount in an ongoing lease.\n\nYou would probably focus on failure to repair in a reasonable time more if you seek to terminate the lease entirely and rent elsewhere instead in the face of repair delays, hoping to avoid the duty to pay rent for the remainder of the lease term due to the landlord's breach of the duty to repair under the lease.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in the UK has been forced to move out of their rented property due to a serious water leak that has also caused electrical issues.

According to the documentation, the concept of \"reasonable time\" for repairs is not strictly defined and is subject to judicial interpretation based on the specific circumstances of each case. Factors such as the severity of the issue, the landlord's efforts to address it, and the impact on habitability are all considered. While 8 days might seem long to the tenant, the fact that multiple inspections have been conducted and the complexity of the issue could influence a judge's decision on what constitutes a reasonable timeframe.

However, contracts with minors are generally voidable by the minor. This means that the agreement would be enforceable against the other party (the potential investor in this case), but the minor would have the option to void the contract if they choose to do so. This protects the minor's interests while still allowing them to enter into agreements. In the context of an NDA where the minor is the disclosing party, this arrangement actually works in their favor, as they can enforce confidentiality against the other party while retaining the option to void the agreement if necessary."}}
