An AI however **isn't** a legal entity, it is classified as a *widget*. Widgets are not able to sign contracts on their own, and to gain access to webspace, one usually has to agree to a contract.\n\nThe contracts the AI tries to sign would thus be void *ab initio* and have no force.

The analysis states that the creator who knowingly releases such an AI would be criminally liable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) for unauthorized access to protected computers. This is because:\n\n1. The AI, as a non-legal entity, cannot enter into valid contracts to gain authorized access to new systems.\n2. Any attempt by the AI to spread to other systems would therefore be unauthorized by default.\n3. The creator, knowing the AI's capability to spread, would be treated similarly to someone releasing malware.\n4. The CFAA specifically prohibits intentionally accessing protected computers without authorization, even if the damage is caused recklessly.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because compliance with hosting terms of service does not override the fundamental issue of unauthorized access. \nAnswer B is incorrect because liability under the CFAA does not require proof of financial damages.\nAnswer D is incorrect because even with safeguards, the AI cannot legally obtain authorization to spread, making any proliferation unauthorized."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58551/what-might-be-an-analog-for-frustration-of-purpose", "docs_id": 58551, "title": "What might be an &quot;analog&quot; for &quot;frustration of purpose?&quot;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a contract, [frustration of purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustration_of_purpose) occurs when \"unforeseen\" events prevent the operation of a contract from achieving its intended results, even if it can technically be fulfilled.

Would the rights of the caterer to do the work and get paid differ from the first case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that you are referring to the **[prevention doctrine](https://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prevention-doctrine/#:%7E:text=Prevention%20doctrine%20is%20a%20common,not%20complain%20of%20such%20nonperformance.)** also known as the **performance doctrine** of the common law of contracts.\n\n> Prevention doctrine is a common\\-law principle of contract law which\n> says that a contracting party has an implied duty not to do anything\n> that prevents the other party from performing its obligation. A party\n> who prevents performance of a contract may not complain of such\n> nonperformance.\n\nThe Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 245 (\"Effect of a Breach by Non\\-Performance As Excusing the Non\\-Occurrence Of a Condition\") explains the doctrine as follows:\n\n> Where a party's breach by non\\-performance contributes materially to\n> the non\\-occurrence of a condition of one of his duties, the\n> non\\-occurrence is excused.\n\n*See, e.g., Meson v. GATX Tech. Servs. Corp.*( 507 F.3d 803, 806 (4th Cir. Md. 2007\\), *Barnhill v. Veneman (In re Peanut Crop Ins. Litig.)*, 524 F.3d 458 (4th Cir. 2008\\); *General Datacomm Indus. v.

The duty of good faith and fair dealing can also involve many other fact patterns that are outside the prevention doctrine.\n\nUsually, the frustration of purpose defense involves actions or events not caused by a party to the contract.\n\nThe tort of tortious interference with contract generally involves a non\\-party's action intended to interfere with the ability of one party to fulfill contractual obligations to another party, while the prevention doctrine applies to a party's interference with the ability of a counter\\-party to the contract to perform the contract.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A property developer, Acme Corp, contracts with Deluxe Catering to provide food and service for a grand opening event of a new office building. Two weeks before the event, Acme Corp decides to delay the building's completion by three months due to design changes. Deluxe Catering has already purchased perishable ingredients and hired temporary staff for the original date. Which legal doctrine best applies to this situation, and what are the likely consequences?\n\nA) Frustration of purpose - Acme Corp can cancel the contract without penalty\nB) Prevention doctrine - Deluxe Catering is excused from performance and can seek damages\nC) Tortious interference - Deluxe Catering can sue the building designers for damages\nD) Duty of good faith and fair dealing - The contract remains valid but must be renegotiated\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The prevention doctrine is the most applicable legal concept in this scenario. This doctrine states that a contracting party has an implied duty not to do anything that prevents the other party from performing its obligation. In this case, Acme Corp's decision to delay the building completion directly prevents Deluxe Catering from fulfilling its contractual duties on the agreed-upon date.\n\nThe consequences of applying the prevention doctrine are that Deluxe Catering would be excused from performance on the original date and could likely seek damages for costs incurred (such as perishable ingredients and temporary staff wages). Acme Corp, having materially contributed to the non-occurrence of the contract's conditions, cannot complain about Deluxe Catering's non-performance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because frustration of purpose typically involves unforeseen events not caused by either party. Option C is wrong because tortious interference generally involves a third party, not a party to the contract.

In FlowerPoly, instead of estates and streets, there are lands and farms, and instead of buying a hotel or a house, the player buys a Nature Reserve. The currency used in the game is Nature\\-points instead of dollar bills. Despite these changes, the gameplay remains exactly the same and players who have played both games would recognize the similarities immediately.\n\n**Note:** The original game does not hold a patent. I understand that copyright protection applies only to the design and names, not the mechanics, so using a different design should be acceptable. However, I seek clarification on whether claiming the game is similar to the original would infringe on the original game's intellectual property. (Maybe Trademark? because i am connecting it to the original game)\n\n**Edit:** To clarify my main question is whether claiming the copycat is similar to the original would infringe on the original game's intellectual property.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: IP in Game Rules\n----------------\n\nGame rules and other game \"mechanics\" are not protected by copyright. They are considered to be \"ideas, methods or procedures\". [17 USC 102(b)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102) provides that:\n\n> (b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\n\nIf the wording of the rules is not the same, and no art or visual design was copied or imitated, the fact that the gameplay is the same does not afford any copyright claim.\n\nClaims of Similarity\n--------------------\n\nA comment from the OP says:\n\n> I seek clarification on whether claiming the game is similar to the original would infringe on the original game's intellectual property.\n\nIf the maker or distributor of the new game states that it is similar to the old game, something like \"*This is a Flower version of Monopoly.*\" would that be any sort of IP infringement?\n\nSuch a statement would in no way infringe any copyright. Would it infringe the trademark rights on the mark \"Monopoly\". That is harder to say.\n\nThe key question in a trademark case is whether the use of a mark, or of words or images that refer to or suggest a mark, would cause reasonable people to falsely think that the new product or service is endorsed, sponsored, or approved by the makers of the old, or to falsely believe that the new product or service comes from the same source as the old one, that is, is made by the same firm or the same people. Whether a particular statement of similarity would do that is a question of fact, and would depend on the details of the statement and the overall presentation of the new game. But a disclaimer can and often does avoid a potential trademark infringement issue. A statement something like:\n\n> FlowerPoly is not endorsed, approved, or sponsored by Hasbro, the makers of Monopoly, and holders of the trademark on that name. FlowerPoly was created by a completely different group of people. One should not rely on the reputation of Monopoly when deciding to purchase or play FlowerPoly.\n\nIt would be wise to have the exact details of any statement of similarity, of any disclaimer, and of the name itself, reviewed by a lawyer with experience specifically in trademark law.\n\nIn general, merely suggesting a similarity is not trademark infringement. Specifically, comparative advertising is not infringement. For example, a new drink could advertise that \"*NewCola is better than Cokle.*\" That would not be an infringement of the trademark \"Coke\", because it makes clear that the products are different, and come from different sources.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company creates a new board game called \"CityTycoon\" that has similar gameplay mechanics to the popular game \"Monopoly\", but with different visual designs, card content, and terminology. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential intellectual property infringement?\n\nA) The company can be sued for copyright infringement because the gameplay mechanics are the same as Monopoly.\n\nB) The company can freely advertise CityTycoon as \"similar to Monopoly\" without any legal concerns.\n\nC) The company cannot mention Monopoly at all in their marketing, as it would constitute trademark infringement.\n\nD) The company can reference Monopoly in their marketing, but should include a clear disclaimer to avoid potential trademark issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Copyright does not protect game mechanics or rules, so using similar gameplay is not copyright infringement. However, referencing the Monopoly trademark in marketing could potentially lead to trademark issues if consumers might be confused about the game's origin or endorsement. The safest approach is to include a clear disclaimer stating that CityTycoon is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or produced by the makers of Monopoly. This allows for comparative advertising while avoiding potential legal complications."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28776/is-the-gdpr-applicable-to-data-stored-in-human-memory", "docs_id": 28776, "title": "Is the GDPR applicable to data stored in human memory?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If data is stored in human memory, is the GDPR applicable?\n\nSay, an employee of a company remembers an email address of a client, their date of birth, or even what their face looks like, does the client have a right of access to this data, or even a right for this to be erased?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: GDPR forces companies **and employees** to keep personal data confidential and to use it only for its allowed uses.

This is generally seen as a way to give manufacturers a \"head start\" in crafting a solution to the problem before the increased knowledge of the flaw can lead to increased exploitation.\n\n\\*If John Doe asks for money to delay or stop the announcement that may constitute extortion, but that is outside of the scope of this question.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Computer scientist John Doe discovers a critical vulnerability in a popular smartphone's fingerprint storage system.

Simply taking the printer home (option A) would be considered commingling of assets and could potentially pierce the corporate veil. Paying the original purchase price (option B) doesn't account for depreciation and could be seen as the company selling an asset above fair market value. Option D, listing it as a company gift, could have tax implications and might be seen as self-dealing.\n\nThe correct approach is option C: John should determine the current fair market value of the printer and pay that amount to the company.

The most likely order from a court would be \"compensate X for your actions or inactions\". Barring some peculiar circumstance, either you or the HOA would be liable to the downstairs person. You can look at the CCRs to see who is responsible for what, which mainly involves finding boundaries (where is the unit, and where are the common areas?). At some point, someone has to figure out what caused the damage. It is possible that via negligence, you caused damage (maybe the plumber was simply wrong); or maybe this is about rain, the ventilation system, and the common areas where the HOA is responsible. Whatever the case may be, the person below would sue to recover his cost of fixing the problem.\n\nProperty owners often have insurance that insures against damage to their property \u2013 it sounds like you have such insurance, and the guy below has insurance. It's also possible that the HOA has insurance. Each insurer has a duty to their client, so the company of the guy below has a duty to him (they protect his interest), your insurer protects your interest, etc.\n\nThe guy below is not required to figure out what the problem is and who to sue, he just has to notify his insurance company of the problem, and start the process of making a claim. That company naturally wants to limit their losses and collect from whoever is ultimately legally liable. You are under no legal obligation to respond to a neighbor's accusation, until the issue is formally escalated (the threat of a lawsuit, directly filed by him or by his insurance company). You don't have to accept or reject his beliefs.\n\nIf there are no insurance companies involved, and if you are certain that this is the responsibility of the HOA, then you would probably not consider taking on unnecessary expenses to diagnose the problem.

I think this might be helpful to put together a realistic case.\n\n> The electronically monitored house arrest (e\u00fcH) is the most recent form of execution in Austria, it was introduced in autumn 2010\\. Basically, people who are sufficiently socially integrated and whose (remaining) sentence does not exceed twelve months are eligible for this form of execution. The e\u00fcH, colloquially often called \"ankle cuff\", must be applied for and can replace the execution of the prison sentence in the prison in its entirety (\"front door variant\") or shorten it (\"back door variant\"). The decision on granting the e\u00fcH is made by the respective management of the prison as the enforcement authority. Numerous requirements must be met, the existence of which is carefully checked. The criteria to be met include in particular:\n\n> * The time to be served or still to be served does not exceed twelve\n> months or\n> * is not expected to exceed 12 months because, for example, a\n> conditional discharge can be expected.\n> * Suitable accommodation in the country\n> * Suitable employment\n> * Income for subsistence\n> * Health and accident insurance coverage\n> * Written consent of the people living in the same\n> household\n> * Prediction that after examining the living conditions, the\n> social environment and any risk factors as well as compliance with\n> the conditions to be imposed, this form of implementation will not be\n> misused\n\n> The necessary surveys to clarify the prerequisites or to create the supervisory profile are carried out with the support of the \u201cNeustart\u201d association by social workers. This association is a contractual partner of the Federal Ministry of Justice and is also responsible for providing assistance to released prisoners, probation assistance and reconciliation of offenses. The employees of the Neustart Association are also responsible for social work support and, if necessary, for looking after the subjects of electronically monitored house arrest.\n\n> On August 1, 2020, 324 people and thus 3\\.79% of the prisoners were in electronically monitored house arrest.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Based on the Austrian Federal Ministry of Justice's criteria for electronically monitored house arrest (e\u00fcH), which of the following scenarios would most likely qualify an individual for this form of detention?\n\nA) A foreign national convicted of aggravated assault with a remaining sentence of 18 months, who has stable employment and housing in Austria.\n\nB) A local resident convicted of petty theft, with a 6-month sentence, who is currently unemployed but lives with family members who consent to the arrangement.\n\nC) A citizen with no prior convictions, sentenced to 10 months for fraud, with a stable job, suitable housing, and health insurance, whose cohabitants have provided written consent.\n\nD) A repeat offender with a history of violating parole, sentenced to 11 months for drug possession, who has recently secured temporary housing and part-time work.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C meets the most criteria for e\u00fcH eligibility:\n1.

Should some data be anonymized?\nShould the resume be returned from prospective clients?\nIs there any way to enforce a client to treat it confidential?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In answer to your questions, always get potential clients to sign a contract which covers the GDPR personal data processing requirements at a minimum, prior to giving them a copy of a consultant resume to retain. If you were sat in a meeting with them it is much simpler to record in your logs that the client had sight of the resume but was not left a copy of it in any format, than it is to keep track of which clients have a copy of which data and chasing up to ensure it is erased/destroyed when appropriate.\n\nTo ensure clients treat the resumes as confidential, make sure they are labelled in the header and footer as confidential. They could also be kept in an envelope clearly marked confidential. There could also be a footnote in small print that informs anyone with a copy, who the data controller is, and that processing is strictly subject to the terms of the 'client contract' or whatever you call it, and that it should be returned or shredded within X days of receipt for example. \nIf you have a computer system generate these it could even specify the client's name and the specific date it should be shredded by. Your notice could include a reminder that the personal data is protected under the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016 and that (client name) as a data processor could be held liable in the event of unauthorised disclosure or processing, if they act outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the data controller. \n\nWhilst this won't enforce responsible processing at least it will ensure that your business has done its best to ensure any recipients are fully aware of their responsibilities to protect the information and it would be very difficult for a client to claim they weren't aware the information was confidential or that they had legally binding responsibilities to protect it.\n\nIt's also worth noting that simply sending CV's/resumes (or other personal data) out via email (unless suitably encrypted) would not meet the requirement in GDPR recital 39 for personal data to be \"processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing.\" Email technology whilst convenient does not offer any guarantees regarding privacy and confidentiality, therefore instead of sending resumes as email attachments it might be better to use a web\\-based extranet system which authenticates users before granting access to view resumes. Emails could just let clients know there is a new resume or X number of resumes waiting for them to review and give them a link/button to login.\n\nThe records of processing activities are in GDPR Article 30 on page 50, and it does not specify a retention period nor that we can choose the retention period, but simply states that data controllers make the records available to the supervisory authority when requested to do so \\- this may imply indefinite retention of processing records even beyond the life of the processing system (e.g. discontinued products/services), however we may need to await further clarification on this issue from supervisory authorities to be sure.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: As a consultant providing resumes to potential clients, which of the following approaches best aligns with GDPR requirements and best practices for protecting personal information?\n\nA) Email resumes as attachments to clients after they verbally agree to keep the information confidential\nB) Have clients sign a contract covering GDPR requirements, provide labeled confidential resumes with specific destruction dates, and use a secure web-based system for access\nC) Anonymize all personal data in resumes before sending them to clients via regular mail\nD) Allow clients to view resumes during in-person meetings but never provide physical or digital copies\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B incorporates several best practices mentioned in the documentation:\n1.

However, the HOA maintains common areas and roads, and has been invoicing residents for these services. The homeowner initially paid the invoices believing they were voluntary contributions. Recently, the HOA dramatically increased the invoices without explanation. Under these circumstances, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the homeowner's legal obligations?\n\nA) The homeowner has no obligation to pay the HOA fees since they never signed a contract with the HOA.\nB) The homeowner is only obligated to pay the original invoice amounts, but not the increased amounts.\nC) The homeowner may be compelled to pay reasonable HOA fees based on the principle of unjust enrichment, but may challenge dramatically increased fees.\nD) The homeowner is fully obligated to pay all HOA fees, including the increased amounts, as they implicitly agreed to the HOA's terms by living in the community.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Even without a signed contract, the homeowner may be compelled to pay reasonable HOA fees based on the principle of unjust enrichment or quantum meruit, as they benefit from the HOA's maintenance of common areas and roads. However, a dramatic increase in fees without explanation may not be enforceable, especially if deemed unreasonable. The homeowner could challenge these increased fees in court. Option A is incorrect because unjust enrichment can create an obligation even without a signed contract. Option B is too limited, as the homeowner may be obligated to pay more than just the original amounts if reasonable.

As was stated, US mail carries risk.\n\n*Or are they in some cases risking a breach of client confidentiality even if they do?* If they do... what? inform clients of risks?\n\nIt is up to the lawyer to inform the client of the danger of using email. Certain cases warrant more precaution than others. The lawyer will need to weigh all of this. It is also possible that a heightened level of security makes communication too cumbersome or expensive. What if the client does not want to pay for the extra time it takes you to encrypt/decrypt? What if the client cannot figure out the software? No matter how sloppy the client is, it is incumbent upon the lawyer to protect communication.\n\nIt's ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1\\.6(a) that explains this for us. \n*A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent*...\n\ncontinuing to paragraph (c):\n\n*(c) A lawyer shall make **reasonable efforts** to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information relating to the representation of a client.*\n\nComment 18 in part (relating to safeguarding information): *unauthorized access...does not constitute a violation of paragraph (c) if the lawyer has made **reasonable efforts** to prevent the access or disclosure.*\n\ncontinuing:\n\n*Factors to be considered in **determining the reasonableness** of the lawyer\u2019s efforts include, but are not limited to, the sensitivity of the information, the likelihood of disclosure if additional safeguards are not employed, the **cost** of employing additional safeguards, the **difficulty** of implementing the safeguards, and the extent to which the safeguards adversely affect the lawyer\u2019s ability to represent clients (e.g., by making a device or important piece of **software excessively difficult to use**).*\n\nComment 19 in part:\n\\*When transmitting a communication that includes information relating to the representation of a client, the lawyer must take **reasonable precautions** to prevent the information from coming into the hands of unintended recipients. This duty, however, does not require that the lawyer use special security measures if the method of communication affords a reasonable expectation of privacy. **Special circumstances, however, may warrant special precautions**. Factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of the lawyer's expectation of confidentiality include the sensitivity of the information and the extent to which the privacy of the communication is protected by law or by a confidentiality agreement.\n\nBoth instances require reasonable efforts \\- those an ordinary person would use.\n\nABA Formal Opinion 1\\-459 tells us that\n*A lawyer sending or receiving substantive communications with a client via e\\-mail or other electronic means ordinarily must warn the client about the risk of sending or receiving electronic communications using a computer or other device, or e\\-mail account, where there is a significant risk that a third party may gain access.*\n\nThis comment pertains to specific situations, like a client emailing a lawyer from the client's work\\-computer. It does not specifically apply to hacker\\-threat.\n\nAnd to muddy all of this up, it's not only communication and information that is at risk. Property is also at risk and the duty to protect property is higher than the duty over communication. Secret recipes, customer lists, strategic plans \\- these are all forms of property and lawyers have special duties to safeguard client property. Comment (1\\) to Rule 1\\.15 says that *a lawyer should hold property of others with the care required of a professional fiduciary.* This is **higher than the reasonableness requirement for protecting information**. The fiduciary duty is the highest standard of care recognized by our legal system (the California rule calls on the lawyer to protect client secrets \u201cat every peril to himself or herself\u201d Cal.

According to ABA Formal Opinion 1-459, a lawyer must warn the client about the risk of sending electronic communications using a computer where there is a significant risk that a third party may gain access, such as a work computer. Additionally, the case involves trade secrets, which are considered property and require a higher standard of care (fiduciary duty) than general information.

This waiver does not contain any provision requiring Stack Exchange (or anyone else) to moderate \"fairly\" or to be \"neutral,\" nor does it say anything about terms of service. Regardless, it's hard to see how they could violate these terms anyway:\n\n> Stack Overflow reserves the right to refuse, suspend or terminate your access to the public Network if it determines, **in its sole discretion**, that you have in any way violated these Public Network Terms or are otherwise ineligible to access or use the Network or Services. If your actions are determined by us to violate these Public Network Terms, Stack Overflow may, **in its sole discretion**, try to remediate that violation by working with you individually, but is under no obligation to do so, and if any such remediation efforts are unsuccessful (in Stack Overflow\u2019s sole discretion), then Stack Overflow may revoke your rights to the Network.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nPublic forum\n------------\n\nA \"public forum\" in American Constitutional law normally refers to a situation where an agent of the government contracts with a private entity to set up a space in which the general public may speak or otherwise express themselves. Because the private entity acts on behalf of the government, the First Amendment is extended to the private entity, at least in the context of the space which it has set up. Stack Exchange, to the best of my knowledge, has no such relationship with either the federal or any state government. So the doctrine is inapplicable.\n\nIn California, the state constitution has a stronger provision which has been applied to private actors notwithstanding their lack of a relationship with the government. This case was [*Pruneyard v. Robins*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/79-289).

It is not considered a public forum in the Constitutional sense, as it lacks a relationship with the government (eliminating option B).

There is nothing in the GDPR that exempts a data controller from its provisions because the data is \"B2B\". It is true that the GDPR does not protect data that identifies businesses and other entities that are not natural persons. But a natural person is still a natural person when s/he is an employee. Data that identifies or is associated with an employee is still personal data.\n\nThe question also seems to assumes that publication of any data associated with a person requires that person's consent under the GDPR. That is also incorrect. The GDPR requires a ***lawful basis*** for any processing. Storage is processing. So is posting to a web site, whether internal to a business or on the open internet. All such processing requires a lawful basis. Consent is only one of the six possible lawful bases available under the GDPR.\n\nA company that wants to post an employee directory, or the contact info of selected employees so that a customer can send communications to them, may obtain the consent of those employees, which may be the simplest basis to establish. Or it might also use legitimate interest. It certainly seems to me that a business has a legitimate interest in letting its customers know how to reach the proper employee to deal with the customer's needs.\n\nIt does not matter who pays for a telephone, a telephone number that is associated with a specific natural person is still personal data (PD).

The GDPR requires a lawful basis for processing personal data, including publishing an employee directory. While consent is one possible basis, it's not the only option.

According to the information provided, any employee directly involved in a negligent act can potentially be sued, regardless of their position within the company. This principle applies to high-level executives, mid-level managers, and even low-level employees like janitors or plumbers if their actions directly led to damages.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the possibility of individual employee liability.

A gift implies a donative intent directed at you. When there is an understanding that you are acting at Alice's direction, you aren't receiving a gift, you are acting as Alice's agent.\n\nThis said, this scheme, or the alternative it seeks to prevent, has no impact on Betty, because gift taxes are imposed on the donor rather than the recipient of the gift. And, in most cases, a gift in excess of the $14,000 per person per year gift tax exemption will have only a minimal impact. This is because each person is entitled to make a combination of gifts in excess of the exemption during life and transfers to non\\-spouses and non\\-charities at death of [$11,200,000 per lifetime](http://www.willkie.com/~/media/Files/Publications/2017/12/2018_Estate_Gift_and_GST_Tax_Exemption_Increases.pdf) (adjusted annually for inflation). \n\nUsually, all that is necessary if the limit is exceeded is for the donor to file form 706 (a federal gift tax return) at the same time as the donor's income tax return, and this form is very simple if the only gifts given are cash gifts.\n\nTransfers to a U.S. citizen spouse are gift and estate tax free, as are gifts to foreign and domestic charities.\n\nSpouses who file a Form 709 in a year may treat gifts given by one spouse as actually given half by each spouse.\n\nIf someone dies not having used their entire $11,200,000 (adjusted for inflation) lifetime exemption, their surviving spouse, if any, inherits that unused portion and can use it at their death in addition to their own lifetime exemption.\n\nSo, Alice and Betty are trying to evade a tax law that is easy and trouble free to comply with, and may provide future benefits by documenting the intent of the parties with respect to a large gift (so that someone doesn't later try to characterize it as a loan or contribution to a trust estate, for example).\n\nWhile it isn't a crime, it is ill advised and won't benefit them materially in the end.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Alice wants to give Betty a $20,000 cash gift.

Mike Tyson even bit a guy's ear off. Why aren't they charged for assault and sentenced to jail time?\n\nI understand that athletes might get hurt *within the context of the game*, and that they can't sue anyone for that (because they knowingly take those risks by playing the game). But [punching someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl4ViIwy7KA) or biting their ear is clearly outside the context of the game \u2013 why no criminal charges?\n\nEdit: [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl4ViIwy7KA) is a good example.\n\nClarification: I'm asking whether or not it's technically legal to do these sorts of things. Not whether they are or should be enforced.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (Note that some of the below may be UK specific, but the general principle applies in many other jurisdictions)\n\nWell the first thing is to stop working from this from the wrong direction: There is no law that makes it legal to assault someone: the law only makes it illegal to assault someone (eg in the UK, the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 apply). The law states that it is illegal to assault someone. So let's explore how sport works.\n\nIn most legal systems, you are able to give **consent** for certain activities or risks. This is also why certain other activities (for example, things a couple may enjoy in their own home) are not necessarily assault if consented to.\n\nEssentially, therefore, your consent gives the person doing the hitting the *legal excuse* (a little different to a normal excuse for forgetting your homework or being late to work): or a defense that their actions were reasonable. This stops the issue being the law, therefore, and becomes an issue of what does/doesn't constitute an \"excuse\".\n\nIt is not therefore a question of \"**What law allows you to commit a crime during sport**?\" instead it is really one of \"**Exactly how much consent can a person give, to allow consent to be used as an excuse, and at what point is that consent no longer an excuse**?\"\n\nFor example in *R v Brown* (UK Case Law) it was established that you cannot give unlimited consent. Similarly in every jurisdiction I'm aware of, that consent is only able to be given within the realms of the rules of the sport. As soon as the rules are broken, a crime may have been committed.\n\nI won't go into the details of R v Brown here, as I'm not convinced that it's suitable for SE (although I'm sure you can find it), but to give a more sport\\-related example, R v Donovan established that\n\n> No person can license another to commit a crime, if (the jury) were satisfied that the blows struck ... were likely or intended to do bodily harm ... they ought to convict ... only if they were not so satisfied (was it) necessary to consider the further question whether the prosecution had negatived consent.\n\nAgain, similar case law or exemptions exist in most jurisdictions. Essentially what this establishes is that if the intent is to cause harm, rather than to undertake the sport or activity to which consent has been given, it is still a crime\n\nThe question after this is then generally one of whether it is in the public interest to prosecute, and often (but not always) the victim's wishes are taken into account.\n\nIn some cases, the sportsman *is* prosecuted: [for example this British football player](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6252157.stm) who assaulted an opponent. In other cases there is either insufficient evidence, or insufficient interest in the prosecution.\n\nIn many cases where the rules are broken but no serious harm is done, for example where rules are broken accidentally or in a minor way, the police or prosecution service (or equivalent) may simply regard the matter as sufficiently dealt with. This is the same as with most other cases, where not every instance of assault is necessarily prosecuted: two teenage brothers fighting may not result in a prosecution, or an assault in the street may not carry enough evidence.\n\n*And to indirectly answer the question* \\- the reason players are often not prosecuted is because \"In the public interest\" incorporates an element of public opinion. If a certain action has become (or always been seen as) acceptable, it is unlikely to be prosecuted. For example minor fouls in games, or accidental fouls causing injuries. The other primary reason is that the victim chooses not to press charges (although this isn't required, and the police are able to press charges themselves, it is often taken into account)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of sports and potential assault charges, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Athletes have blanket immunity from assault charges for any actions during a sporting event.\nB) Consent given by athletes to participate in a sport provides unlimited legal protection for any physical contact.\nC) Actions that fall outside the rules of the sport and are intended to cause harm may still be prosecuted as assault.\nD) The law explicitly states which actions in sports are legal and which are illegal.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that while athletes give consent to certain risks within the context of the sport, this consent is not unlimited. Actions that fall outside the rules of the sport and are intended to cause harm can still be considered assault and may be prosecuted. The key factors are whether the action was within the rules of the sport, whether there was intent to cause harm, and whether prosecution is deemed in the public interest. Option A is incorrect because athletes do not have blanket immunity. Option B is wrong because consent is not unlimited, as established in cases like R v Brown. Option D is incorrect because the law doesn't explicitly list legal and illegal actions in sports; instead, it's a matter of interpretation based on consent, intent, and public interest."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29676/can-i-use-avenir-next-a-font-built-in-to-ios-on-an-ios-app", "docs_id": 29676, "title": "Can I use Avenir Next (a font built-in to iOS) on an iOS app?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Avenir Next comes installed on every iPhone running iOS 9 and newer.

The Restatement of Torts sets forth a variety of absolute immunities from defamation liability (a common law tort) that are almost universally honored by state courts.\n\nBoth parties to litigation and witnesses have absolute immunity from defamation liability for statements made in connection with a judicial proceeding.\n\n> A party to a private litigation or a private prosecutor or defendant\n> in a criminal prosecution is absolutely privileged to publish\n> defamatory matter concerning another in communications preliminary to\n> a proposed judicial proceeding, or in the institution of or during the\n> course and as a part of, a judicial proceeding in which he\n> participates, if the matter has some relation to the proceeding.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 587 (1977\\)\n\n> A witness is absolutely privileged to publish defamatory matter\n> concerning another in communications preliminary to a proposed\n> judicial proceeding or as a part of a judicial proceeding in which he\n> is testifying, if it has some relation to the proceeding.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 588 (1977\\).\n\nThere are also similar absolute privileges from defamation liability for judicial officers (Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 585\\), attorneys' at law for a party (Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 586\\), and jurors (Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 589\\).\n\nThe absolute privilege from defamation liability for attorneys for a party in connection with court proceedings has been described as follows:\n\n> Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 586 (1977\\), adopted in *Colorado in\n> Renner v.

Valencia Associates*, 712 P.2d 1024, 1027 (Colo. App. 1985\\)\n\nThere is also a widely recognized (and arguably constitutionally required) qualified immunity from defamation liability for people making an accurate report of what was said in court that would otherwise be defamatory, so long as it is indeed a substantially accurate account:\n\n> \\[U]nder the common law doctrine of fair report, reports of in\\-court\n> proceedings containing defamatory material are privileged if they are\n> fair and substantially correct, or are substantially accurate accounts\n> of what took place. *See Rosenberg v.

It is a crime, perjury, to make a false statement under oath in a court proceeding (although perjury is rarely prosecuted in practice relative to how frequently it occurs).\n\nA judge can strike scandalous and unnecessary materials in court documents that would be defamatory, can order court documents placed under seal, can order that the public be barred from court proceedings in certain kinds of circumstances, can bar parties to court cases and their attorneys from disclosing otherwise secret matters in court cases, and can hold someone in contempt of court for improperly making defamatory statements public when they were ordered not to do so.\n\nFinally, if a trier of fact does not believe a false statement made in a court proceeding, the judge or jury can rule against that person on the claim that the false statement supports, and a judge can say that the judge believed that the statement made was false.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A local businessman, Mr. Smith, files a completely baseless lawsuit against his competitor, Ms. Johnson, alleging fraud.

Bob's school has a policy that allows the school to confiscate Bob's phone if he does not use for \"educational purposes\" or misuses it during class. At the beginning of the year, the school sends out a document where Bob and his parent/guardian are supposed to place their initials which means they agree to the handbook. Bob and his parent/guardian return the document, however, do not sign/agree to the handbook. What gives the school the right to legally confiscate Bobs phone without his consent? (Please be specific)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A teacher of children and more general the school is *[in loco parentis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_loco_parentis)* while the children are at school, which means that the school has the authority of a parent over a children in the parent's absence.\n\nThis authority arises under state common law, rather than federal law, so the relevant legal authority would differ from state to state, but would be present in almost every state.\n\nFor example, an analysis of this concept in the context of random drug testing of students engaged in extracurricular activities where the school's common law authority is balanced against constitutional concerns about privacy under the 4th Amendment is found in the U.S. Supreme Court case *[Vernonia School District 47J v.

The school's authority to confiscate a student's cell phone, even without explicit consent to the handbook, is primarily based on the doctrine of in loco parentis. This common law principle, which varies slightly by state but is widely recognized, grants schools parental-like authority over students while they are in the school's care. This allows schools to implement and enforce policies they deem necessary for maintaining an educational environment, including the confiscation of disruptive items like cell phones.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no specific federal legislation granting schools the right to confiscate personal property. School policies are typically governed by state and local laws, not federal legislation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while there may be some argument for implied consent, the primary legal basis for the school's authority does not rely on this concept. The school's authority exists regardless of whether a student chooses to attend or not.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the Fourth Amendment is relevant to searches in schools, it does not specifically grant schools the authority to confiscate items.

Therefore, it would stand to reason that \"they we're unable to contact\" the responsible party would not be a very solid legal defense, no? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The ordinance is not very specific about how notice is to be given: therefore, it need not be in writing, and it need not be sent by mail. It would not be surprising if the \"notification\" came in the form of a city person inspecting the reported obstruction, walking up to the house and knocking and finding nobody home (thus triggering the \"In case the owner cannot be found\" condition), whereupon the city removes the rocks. That clause does not mean \"In case we do not know who the owner is\", it almost certainly means \"in case the owner cannot be contacted immediately\". Article III is in general about obstructions on streets, which are not allowed, except by permit in section 78 under \"Permit to Obstruct Traffic Lane\". Assuming that no obstruction permit was obtained, what usually happens is that an officer is sent to tell the owner to remove the obstruction (more or less immediately), and if nobody is at the site whom they can tell, they probably won't go any further (e.g. asking neighbors where the owner is).\n\nThere is no legal definition of \"reasonable time\", instead the law simply takes that to mean \"the amount of time a reasonable person would require\".

While the code doesn't specify how notice should be given, it implies that some attempt at notification should be made. The \"reasonable time\" would depend on factors like the size of the obstruction and traffic volume.

To what country could we go?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. \n\nThe repeal of pro\\-LGBT legislation is not sufficient. To be a refugee you must have a real and imminent fear of persecution which is generally defined to include matters like bodily harm or arbitrary detention or seizure of property on account of your status.\n\nThe generalized protections existing under the law from private violence and civil rights violations in the U.S., while imperfect, is not going to suffice as a general matter to establish refugee status, particularly because many of those protections arise under federal law.\n\nA generalized fear of a \"civil war\" someday, and a general dissatisfaction with the amount of corruption present in the government and the bad policies of the government, in the United States, is not sufficient.\n\nAlso, the United States is a free immigration zone, which means that people can freely travel and relocate to other parts of the United States, and while some places in the United States might be quite unfriendly to LGBT individuals, there are other places in the United States that are much more welcoming both in theory, based upon enacted laws, and in practice.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, there are state anti\\-discrimination laws, one of the leading candidates for Governor is a gay man who is currently one of our Congressmen, we have had lesbian speakers of the state house, a high official in Denver's school district is a gay man who was a former state legislator, and a DA in a fairly conservative suburb of Denver vigorously prosecuted and obtained a conviction against a man who murdered a transwoman on account of her trans\\-status including a hate crime count, and a transman serves in the U.S. military in one of the state's federal military bases. When I walk the halls of my children's high school in Denver, the walls are full of official administration proclamations of support for LGBT students that is backed up by action and reflected in how my children's many LGBT friends were treated in their school. Denver's clerk's office proudly proclaims that it marries hundreds, if not thousands, of same sex couples every year.\n\nThis doesn't mean life is perfect in Colorado, but it isn't official persecution of the kind that would rise to refugee status either. And, since anyone in the U.S. can move to Colorado or other relatively LGBT friendly states, there would not be any ground to claim refugee status. Canada, for example, would not admit someone as a refugee based upon persecution for LGBT status if that person did not demonstrate that they could not escape persecution by moving to metropolitan Denver or San Francisco or New York City.\n\nThe U.S. is not necessarily the very best place in the world to be LGBT, but it is certainly near the top, despite the fact that the struggle for LGBT rights is ongoing and will be indefinitely and it isn't perfect.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under what circumstances could a U.S. citizen who identifies as LGBTQ+ potentially qualify for refugee status in another country?\n\nA) If their city repeals local anti-discrimination ordinances protecting LGBTQ+ individuals\nB) If they face generalized economic hardships and dissatisfaction with government policies\nC) If they have a well-founded fear of imminent persecution, such as bodily harm or arbitrary detention, based on their LGBTQ+ status, which cannot be avoided by relocating within the U.S.\nD) If they are concerned about a potential future civil war in the United States\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: To qualify for refugee status, an individual must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution that is real and imminent. This persecution typically involves threats to life or freedom, such as bodily harm or arbitrary detention, specifically because of the person's protected status (in this case, LGBTQ+ identity). \n\nOption A is incorrect because the repeal of local anti-discrimination ordinances, while concerning, does not alone rise to the level of persecution required for refugee status, especially given the existence of federal protections and the ability to relocate within the U.S.\n\nOption B is incorrect because general economic hardships and dissatisfaction with government policies do not constitute persecution in the context of refugee status.\n\nOption C is correct because it describes a situation that could potentially meet the threshold for refugee status: a well-founded fear of imminent persecution based on LGBTQ+ status that cannot be avoided by internal relocation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a generalized fear of potential future conflict is not sufficient to claim refugee status.

While you may not have direct control over Google's data collection, you should disclose the use of third-party services in your privacy policy and inform users that these services may collect data. Simply stating that third-party data collection is not your responsibility (option D) is insufficient. You don't need to provide a detailed list of all data Google collects (option B), as this may be beyond your knowledge. Option A is incorrect because you do have some responsibility regarding privacy disclosures.

Political campaigns routinely buy such lists and use them to organize door\\-to\\-door campaigning, as well as postal appeals.\n\nSome years ago I was a (losing) candidate for local office in NJ. I bought such a list covering the township I was running in. It showed each voter's name, address, age, party of registration, if any, and which of the last several elections the person had voted in.

According to the information provided, in most US states, anyone can purchase voter lists that include detailed information about registered voters, including their voting history in recent elections. These lists are not restricted to political parties or candidates, though they are commonly used by political campaigns. The lists typically contain information such as voter names, addresses, age, party registration (if any), and which recent elections each person voted in. \n\nOption A is incorrect because access is not limited to political parties. Option B is false, as these lists are not strictly confidential and can be purchased by individuals or organizations. Option D is also incorrect, as access is not restricted to candidates, and no proof of candidacy is required to obtain the lists.\n\nIt's worth noting that purchasers usually need to agree not to use the information for commercial marketing purposes, and there may be a cost associated with obtaining these lists.

The death penalty was partially abolished by the state supreme court in Washington in [State v. Gregory](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8854659891232700142) \u2013 for the third time. The court states that \"None of these prior decisions held that the death penalty is per se unconstitutional, nor do we\". Instead, it was found unconstitutional in its application: it is \"invalid because it is imposed in an arbitrary and racially biased manner\". This is similar to the situation with [Furman v. Georgia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/408/238/), where\n\n> The Court holds that the imposition and carrying out of the death\n> penalty in these cases constitute cruel and unusual punishment in\n> violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The judgment in\n> each case is therefore reversed insofar as it leaves undisturbed the\n> death sentence imposed, and the cases are remanded for further\n> proceedings\n\n4 years later in [Gregg v. Georgia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/428/153/), SCOTUS found that the revised procedure was consistent with the 8th Amendment. In these cases, imposition of the death penalty was invalidated, so any person so sentenced could therefore not be executed. These rulings were time\\-independent, that is, they refer to the imposition and carrying out of sentence, regardless of when the crime was committed.\n\n[Dobbert v. Florida](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/432/282/) interacts with these cases. Dobbert committed murder in the period when there was no constitutional execution, but the trial was carried out under a modified procedural regime that constitutionally allowed for execution. The court states that\n\n> The new statute simply altered the methods employed in determining\n> whether the death penalty was to be imposed, and there was no change\n> in the quantum of punishment attached to the crime\n\nso the revised procedures could be followed even though the statutory change was enacted after the crime was committed. This is one way in which a sentence could be \"abolished\" when the act was committed. and yet imposed at sentencing.\n\nIn the ruling, the court attempts to clarify the no ex post facto law clause of the Constitution. Citing [Beazell v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/269/167),the court observes that\n\n> It is settled, by decisions of this Court so well known that their\n> citation may be dispensed with, that any statute which punishes as a\n> crime an act previously committed which was innocent when done, which\n> makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime after its commission,\n> or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available\n> according to law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited\n> as ex post facto\n\nSo for instance suppose that a legislature decides to modify the statutory penalty for murder to 10 years in prison. That is therefore the penalty for any murder carried out at the time. If a person person commits murder in that period, even if they are not tried or sentences until after the legislature re\\-imposes the death penalty, that new sentence cannot apply to murder in question. The crucial difference involves distinguishing changes in the law of procedure, vs. what the actual penalty will be.\n\nAs also stated by the court, the concept of \"ex post facto law\" involves not just change in law, it crucially involves making things worse for the defendant:\n\n> It is axiomatic that for a law to be ex post facto it must be more\n> onerous than the prior law\n\nThere is no general US legal finding that a person is entitled to a lesser penalty when the legislature statutorily reduces the penalty for a crime, however that effect could come from appropriate legislative action, as plays a role in [Concepcion v. US](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1650_3dq3.pdf). Congress enacted a retroactive *amelioration* of the law (pertaining to weight thresholds related to sentencing in drug laws). SCOTUS presupposes in their ruling that this is possible because of this act of Congress (the issue in this case is about court discretion in what information is considered \u2013 a procedural question).

The person is finally arrested and convicted in 2020. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their potential sentence?\n\nA) The person can still be sentenced to death because the crime was committed when the death penalty was legal.\nB) The person cannot be sentenced to death due to the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.\nC) The person cannot be sentenced to death due to the legislative act's explicit retroactive application.\nD) The person can be sentenced to death if the state supreme court finds the abolition unconstitutional.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key factor here is that the legislative act explicitly stated that the abolition of the death penalty applies retroactively to all cases. This scenario aligns with the concept of retroactive amelioration discussed in relation to Concepcion v. US, where Congress enacted a retroactive reduction in penalties. When a legislature specifically enacts retroactive application of a reduced penalty, it can apply to crimes committed before the law changed.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it ignores the retroactive nature of the legislative act.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the ex post facto clause prohibits increasing punishment retroactively, not decreasing it.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the question doesn't mention any constitutional challenge to the abolition, and even if there were one, the legislative intent for retroactive application would likely be respected unless found unconstitutional."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25628/is-it-legal-to-file-a-formal-sexual-assault-complaint-anonymously", "docs_id": 25628, "title": "Is it legal to file a formal sexual assault complaint anonymously?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recently, I was told that I cannot file a sexual assault complaint anonymously.

But for the sake of argument, here is the [US courts criminal complaint](http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/ao091.pdf) form. Notice that you are required to give your name and swear to the truth of the accusations. So it is impossible to file an official criminal complaint anonymously. (The form does not mean that a citizen could file a criminal complaint in US courts: it means that the person filing the complaint *must identify himself*). However, you can anonymously describe the facts to the police or the prosecutor, which could *lead to* an official complaint. Incidentally, if you believe that the person actually committed rape, notifying HR is not an appropriate response.\n\nGiven what you describe, there was no sexual assault. An employee saying something like that could constitute \"having a hostile workplace\", with respect to sex, and the company could get sued. There is no law whatsoever pertaining to a person alerting HR to such a problem. Instead, it would all be a matter of company policy. It is possible that company policy precludes accepting anonymous complaints of inappropriate workplace behavior. The consequences of such a policy could be costly.\n\nUnder EEOC rules, sexually discriminatory statements are sexually discriminatory statements, no matter who they are said to. The company is expected to take action if it know, or should know, about the conduct. By refusing to accept a complaint (anonymous or otherwise), the company could be mistakenly thinking that they are protected if they don't actually know.\n\nYou yourself might file a complaint with EEOC, or with HR, but no official legal complaint can be anonymous. You will eventually have publicly accuse the wrongdoer. You can anonymously report the facts to HR, and they can ignore that information at their peril, if someone later files a formal complaint.

Additionally, the described behavior, while inappropriate, does not constitute sexual assault.\n\nOption B is partially true in that many companies require identification for formal HR complaints, but it's too absolute and doesn't account for the possibility of providing anonymous information.\n\nOption C is incorrect because EEOC complaints, like other official legal complaints, cannot be filed anonymously. The complainant's identity would eventually need to be revealed in a formal process.\n\nOption D is correct because it accurately reflects the information provided. While an anonymous report may not be treated as a formal complaint by HR, the company cannot simply ignore such information without risking increased liability. If they are made aware of potential sexually discriminatory behavior, even anonymously, and fail to act, they could be considered to have \"should have known\" about the conduct if formal complaints are filed later."}}
