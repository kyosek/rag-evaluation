Suppose that the University wants to hire a new professor of mathematics but can't find any qualified LDS candidates for the position, and so gives the job to Alice, knowing full well that she is an atheist. Some time into Alice's contract, the university finds Bob, who has similar qualifications as Alice but is an LDS member.\n\nCould the university terminate Alice's contract on purely religious grounds in order to give her professorship to Bob? (That is, assume that there exist no other grounds on which the university could justify a dismissal\u2014i.e., Alice has been maintaining satisfactory job performance, has not been violating the school's honour code, etc.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on whether Alice is a \"minister.\"\n\nThis case plays on the tension between employment\\-discrimination laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, and the First Amendment, \u201cwhich protects a religious group's right to shape its own faith and mission through its appointments.\u201d [*Hosanna\\-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church \\& Sch. v. Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n*, 565 U.S. 171, 188 (2012\\)](https://casetext.com/case/hosanna-tabor-evangelical-lutheran-church-sch-v-equal-empt-opportunity-commn).\n\nWe resolve the question by asking whether Alice is a \"minister,\" i.e., whether the religion has entrusted her \u201cwith the responsibility of educating and forming students in the faith\u201d [*Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey\\-Berru*, 140 S. Ct. 2049, 2069 (2020\\)](https://casetext.com/case/our-lady-of-guadalupe-school-v-morrissey-berru). If so, she falls within the First Amendment's \"ministerial exception\" to employment\\-discrimination laws.\n\nBut the precise definition of that term remains rather squishy, so we don't really have a test that can give us a reliable answer. In *Hosanna\\-Tabor*, for instance, a teacher at a religious school brought an ADA claim after the school fired her after she missed a semester on disability leave. The court rejected her claims based on the religious character of her work, and the Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that she was a minister based on the job title she received (Minister of Religion, Commissioned), her own use of the minister title, the religious character of many of her job responsibilities, her religious training, and other factors.\n\nAlthough she was a minister who was replaced by another minister, the Court suggested that the outcome might be the same if she were not a minister. Noting that the school in that case \u2013 just like in your hypothetical \u2013 hired lay teachers only when ministers were not available, it rejected the argument that an employee falls outside the ministerial exception simply because there are non\\-ministers with the same job functions:\n\n> Though relevant, it cannot be dispositive that others not formally recognized as ministers by the church perform the same functions\u2014particularly when, as here, they did so only because commissioned ministers were unavailable.\u201d *Hosanna\\-Tabor* at 193\\.\n\nAnd a few years later, the Court indicated that perhaps none of those factors from *Hosanna\\-Tabor* are actually required. Instead, it directed courts to ask whether the school \u201centrusts a teacher with the responsibility of educating and forming students in the faith.\u201d *Our Lady of Guadalupe School* at 2069\\.\n\nSo in your hypothetical, the courts would probably look to see whether BYU treats its professorships as ministerial positions. Although the answer could vary from one religious school to the next, it seems quite likely that the courts would treat BYU professors as ministers, given their Personnel Conduct Policy:\n\n> It is a condition of employment that all personnel (including student employees) act in accordance with university policies and the Church Educational System Honor Code, including the Dress and Grooming Standards, and refrain from behavior or expression that seriously and adversely affects the university mission or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\\-day Saints. Examples include behavior or expression that\n> \n> \n> * Contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy;\n> * Deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders; or\n> * Violates the Church Educational System Honor Code.\n> \n> \n> All personnel are expected to be role models of a life that combines the quest for intellectual rigor with spiritual values and personal integrity, and to conduct their work in a professional manner consistent with the values espoused by the university and the Church. Members of the Church in nonstudent positions also accept as a condition of employment the standards of conduct consistent with qualifying for temple privileges. The university regularly contacts ecclesiastical leaders concerning the temple eligibility of all nonstudent personnel who are members of the Church.\n\nI couldn't find any cases applying the ministerial exception to Brigham Young, but given its expectation that employees act as \"role models\" for the church's \"spiritual values\" and conduct their work in a manner consistent with \"values espoused by ... the church,\" I would be surprised to see a court get in the middle of the school's decisions to fire Alice and replace her with a member of the church, even if she had not run afoul of those policies herself.\n\n> The interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important. But so too is the interest of religious groups in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out their mission. When a minister who has been fired sues her church alleging that her termination was discriminatory, the First Amendment has struck the balance for us. The church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its way.\n\n*Hosanna\\-Tabor* at 196\\.\n\nStill, Alice could have other bases for suing the school. Based on your tags, I'm assuming you're most interested in employment\\-discrimination claims. While those might be barred by the First Amendment, *Hosanna\\-Tabor* explicitly held open the possibility that a contract claim might still be viable. *Hosanna\\-Tabor* at 196 (\u201cWe express no view on whether the exception bars other types of suits, including actions by employees alleging breach of contract or tortious conduct by their religious employers.\u201d).\n\nSo if the school signed a contract agreeing to employ Alice for three years, she would have a strong argument that it had waived its right to discriminate on the basis of religion for that period.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Brigham Young University (BYU), affiliated with the Church of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), hires Dr. Alice Smith, a non-LDS member, as a mathematics professor due to a lack of qualified LDS candidates. Two years into her contract, BYU finds an equally qualified LDS candidate, Dr. Bob Jones. The university wants to replace Dr. Smith with Dr. Jones solely based on religious affiliation. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) BYU can legally terminate Dr. Smith's contract without any potential legal consequences, as religious institutions have absolute immunity in hiring and firing decisions.\n\nB) BYU cannot terminate Dr. Smith's contract under any circumstances, as it would be a clear violation of employment discrimination laws.\n\nC) BYU may be able to terminate Dr. Smith's contract, but the legality would depend on whether her position is considered \"ministerial\" and how the university's policies frame the role of professors in relation to the institution's religious mission.\n\nD) BYU can only terminate Dr. Smith's contract if they can prove her job performance is unsatisfactory, regardless of the religious affiliation factor.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the legality of terminating Dr. Smith's contract would hinge on whether her position as a mathematics professor at BYU is considered \"ministerial\" under the First Amendment's ministerial exception to employment discrimination laws. This exception allows religious institutions to make employment decisions for certain roles based on religious criteria.\n\nThe courts would likely examine BYU's policies and expectations for faculty members to determine if professors are considered to have a role in \"educating and forming students in the faith\" (as per the Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru case). Given BYU's Personnel Conduct Policy, which expects employees to be role models of spiritual values and conduct work consistent with church values, there's a strong possibility that professors might be considered ministerial employees.\n\nHowever, it's not an absolute certainty, and the specific details of Dr. Smith's contract and role would be relevant. Additionally, while employment discrimination claims might be barred by the First Amendment in this case, Dr. Smith might still have grounds for a breach of contract claim if her contract specified a certain duration of employment.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they present overly absolute scenarios that don't account for the nuances of the ministerial exception and potential contract issues. Option D is incorrect because it ignores the potential religious exemption and focuses solely on job performance, which is not the central issue in this scenario."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49697/taking-back-my-stuff-from-my-ex", "docs_id": 49697, "title": "Taking back my stuff from my Ex", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Long story short, \n\nMy ex stopped answering my calls and seemed to have blocked me.

However, I do not know to a what degree in detail \\- usually there are CAN bus pin\\-outs on the OBD\\-II connector.

Your vehicle is comprised of things like brakes, ABS, fuel injection, gear box. Nowadays, these parts are operated by electronic controllers.\n\nThe physical path by which the controllers receive and transmit electronic signals is called a bus. (It performs the same function as the internal bus in your computer, which connects the CPU, memory, etc.) CAN is simply a protocol for how information travels on the bus. So it does all the things you'd imagine a protocol does (boring things like dictating message formats be 64 bits and exciting things like determining priority).\n\nProtocols are defined by standards. Prior to widespread implementation of CAN, there were other standards (four, I believe) used by various manufacturers. CAN is widespread, but it's important to note that it's only standard on lighter vehicles.\n\n> **40 CFR 86\\.005\\-17(h)(3\\)**\n> \n> \n> Beginning with the 2008 model year and beyond, ISO 15765\\-4\\.3:2001 \u201cRoad Vehicles\\-Diagnostics on Controller Area Network (CAN)\u2014Part 4: Requirements for emission\\-related systems\u201d, (December 14, 2001\\) shall be the only acceptable protocol used for standardized on\\-board to off\\-board communications for vehicles below 8500 pounds.\n\nThe statute goes on to discuss other standards for heavier vehicles.\n\nWhat's unique about CAN? It's faster, but more importantly, it's a protocol that doesn't require a central computer. All the controllers get all the messages. It's kind of like having a bunch of people in a room yelling things out: everyone hears everything. And that's what you want in a car. However, the messages have to be interpreted by the controllers themselves, and that requires a separate \"higher\\-layer\" protocol.\n\nElectronic components *need* CAN to function, and if you have a car with electronic components, you *need* CAN in order to make it run. On the other hand, a vehicle can run without OBD\\-\\-it's just a nice secondary feature to help diagnose system performance (and problems). It obtains access to component information like speed, RPM, fuel trim, etc. Likewise, that pesky \"check engine\" light gets activated by a diagnostic code.\n\n**CAN is not mandatory for OBD.** OBD is designed to use a number of different standards, and CAN is one of those (remember, light vehicles makes beginning with 2008 use CAN, but OBD is in use in other types of vehicles, too). At it's heart, OBD II is just another protocol: it specifies message format and the connector's pinout. In the best teaching document I've seen on the CAN vs. OBD subject, [Michael Wen](http://www.oneminuteinfo.com/2014/02/can-bus-obd-ii-explained-for-dummies.html) mentions you can often deduce which signaling protocol is in use by looking at the pins in the connector (remember, CAN should be standard for light vehicles after 2008, but you might see one of the other four formats in older vehicles).\n\n**How do OBD and CAN work together?** OBD sends messages over the CAN bus (that is, the vehicle bus with the CAN protocol). OBD basically queries components by sending specially formatted messages via the CAN bus. The components respond via the CAN bus.

This answer is focused on conceptual misunderstandings in the question itself.\n\n> Where does fault lie in the following situation; and what tickets if\n> any should be issued according to Illinois Motor Vehicle Code and why?\n> \n> \n> Again who is at fault or what %'s of fault should be applied and why?\n\n**Lawsuits v. Traffic Citations**\n\nIt is important to understand that whether tickets could be issued according to the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code, and legal fault in a lawsuit arising from an accident involving a motor vehicle are two very different legal concepts.\n\nAlso, there isn't necessarily only one person at fault or only one person who has violated the Motor Vehicle Code.\n\n**Motor Vehicle Code Violations**\n\nViolations of the Motor Vehicle Code are analyzed one by one in a criminal or quasi\\-criminal traffic court proceeding where the issue is whether a fine or other punishment should be imposed for violating it. One person being cited does not mean that another person can't be cited as well. These proceedings would be brought by the \"People of the State of Illinois\" against each defendant by a government official at government expense.\n\nThe government also has no legal obligation to bring charges for every violation that could in theory be legally supported by the facts.\n\nThe outcome of the traffic court proceedings would be inadmissible evidence in a lawsuit arising out of the accident. Usually the police report will also be inadmissible evidence unless the police officer who wrote it is brought into court to testify in support of it, or the parties stipulate otherwise.\n\n**Civil Liability In A Lawsuit**\n\nIn a lawsuit, brought by the private lawyer for a person who has suffered damages from the accident (called a \"plaintiff\") must show that someone else was negligent, which means that they failed to act with reasonable care under the circumstances to prevent harm to others, that this caused their damages, and must prove their damages. Private lawyers for the defendants whom the Plaintiff seeks to assign fault to are usually paid for by the defendants' insurance companies and argue against their clients having liability.\n\nA jury hears all of the evidence and assigns a percentage of fault to each party including the plaintiff. If the person injured is found by a jury to be at least 50% at fault, then there is no recovery. If the person injured is found to be less than 50% at fault, then the other parties at fault have legal liability to the plaintiff based upon their percentage of fault. *See*\n735 ILCS 5/2\\-1116\\.\n\nNegligence in a lawsuit doesn't necessarily have to involve a violation of the Motor Vehicle Code. A jury can find, for example, that someone was driving too fast for the conditions despite not violating the speed limit, or stopped too abruptly, even if those aren't Motor Vehicle Code violations and can find a percentage of fault based upon that conduct.\n\nA violation of the Motor Vehicle Code does not automatically translate to fault either. Violations of the Motor Vehicle Code are a basis for a finding of fault, in what is called *negligence per se*, if the code section violated was intended to prevent the kind of accident that actually happened. Failure to use a turn signal, for example, will rarely constitute *negligence per se* in an accident where one car rear ends another car.\n\nThere are very simple cases where one can truly state with absolutely certainty that only one party is at fault for purposes of a negligence lawsuit.\n\nFor example, comparative fault is hard to argue in a case where a garbage truck hits and damages a building while the driver isn't paying attention and the building owner sues the garbage truck driver and his employer, although even then the issue of what damages should be awarded can be litigated. (Full disclosure: I litigated this case for a building owner until it had to be transferred to new counsel due to a merger of my law firm with another law firm that represented the other side in the case.)\n\nBut usually (at least in cases that go to trial) there is at least some colorable argument that more than one person involved failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances and if so, the jury must allocate fault percentages on a basis that it feels best allocates responsibility for the harm caused to a particular plaintiff by the accident as it sees fit in their good judgment using common sense. And, this allocation of percentage fault is almost impossible to overturn on appeal if there is any argument based upon any evidence introduced at trial that the people to whom fault were allocated indeed not totally without fault.\n\n**It is impossible to say, as a matter of law, what percentage of fault should be assigned to each at fault party when more than one party is potentially at fault.** This is question purely for the finder of fact (usually a jury, but the judge in a bench trial).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Illinois, how does the legal analysis of fault in a civil lawsuit arising from a motor vehicle accident differ from the analysis of violations in a traffic court proceeding?\n\nA) In a civil lawsuit, only one party can be found at fault, while in traffic court, multiple parties can be cited for violations.\n\nB) Traffic court violations automatically determine fault percentages in a civil lawsuit.\n\nC) Civil lawsuits use a comparative fault system where multiple parties can share responsibility, while traffic court only determines if specific code violations occurred.\n\nD) The outcome of traffic court proceedings is always admissible as evidence in a related civil lawsuit.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In a civil lawsuit arising from a motor vehicle accident in Illinois, fault is analyzed using a comparative fault system where multiple parties can be assigned percentages of responsibility based on their negligence. This is determined by a jury (or judge in a bench trial) considering all evidence of whether parties failed to exercise reasonable care.\n\nIn contrast, traffic court proceedings focus solely on whether specific violations of the Motor Vehicle Code occurred, without considering comparative fault. Each violation is analyzed independently, and multiple parties can be cited for different violations in the same incident.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because in both civil lawsuits and traffic court, multiple parties can be found at fault or in violation, respectively.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because traffic court violations do not automatically determine fault percentages in a civil lawsuit, though they may be considered as evidence of negligence.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the outcome of traffic court proceedings is generally inadmissible as evidence in a related civil lawsuit."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4975/my-nickname-violate-the-google-names-policy-how-about-my-privacy", "docs_id": 4975, "title": "My nickname violate the Google+ Names Policy, how about my privacy?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to use my [nickname](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/86257/22759) instead of full name when commenting on random posts within Google network.\n\nHowever when I wanted to enforce that (by changing my Full Name into nickname), I found out that:\n\n> The nickname that you've chosen appears to violate the [Google\\+ Names Policy](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1228271).\n\nI believe they meant this [policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/+/policy/content.html).\n\nHowever I am worried about my privacy and this was applied quite recently.\n\nBy which law I am enforced to share my personal details (such as my full name) on forum publicly to on\\-line people which I even don't know (when commenting on random posts)?\n\nIn other words, based on what law Google tries to enforces its restrictive policy, if any?\n\nCan I do anything in that situation (e.g. my privacy is protected by any law), so I can enforce on my privacy rights without removing my Google Plus account?

For example, there is no law explicitly permitting me to wear a top hat, but there is no law against it either, so wearing a top hat is permitted \"by default\".\n\nDoes this principle actually have a formal foundation in law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Strictly speaking, that principle isn't even *true* everywhere in the US. The maxim \"nulla poena sine lege\" (i.e. \"no punishment without a prior penal statute\") was historically applicable to *civil* law systems, such as are found in continental Europe. In common\\-law systems, there was never a tradition in which a crime wasn't a crime unless it violated a penal law, because crimes themselves were traditionally defined by court precedent instead of by statute.\n\nIn US federal court, the only allowable common\\-law offense is contempt of court. This is due to a court decision (*United States v. Hudson*), in which the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts do not have the constitutional authority to hear a case in which someone is accused of committing a common\\-law crime. Even so, and even though there is a federal contempt statute, the Supreme Court has ruled that contempt is an inherent power of any court, and statutes around it only regulate the power (but the power would be there even without a statute).\n\nAt the state level, some states have explicitly passed laws saying something is not a crime if it doesn't violate the penal code (although this doesn't necessarily apply to contempt); see section 6 of the California Penal Code for an example. In other states, like Florida, common\\-law crimes still exist; Florida has a statute saying that any common\\-law offense is still a crime unless a statute has explicitly covered that same subject matter (section [775\\.01](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.01.html)), and specifies a generic penalty for anything which is an offense at common law and not addressed by any Florida penal statute (section [775\\.02](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.02.html)).

In fact, it would be super helpful if Bob had filed the lawsuit and served it together with the GDPR request, so there is a [pending case](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/pending-case)... and added a paragraph that he demands the preservation of all evidence at that point.\n\nIn either case, the sudden deletion of the files by their DPO Charly, after Alice Corp was put on legal notice that they have to preserve evidence, is [**spoliation**](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/w-015-7809?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true), indeed, it would be the very definition:\n\n> The intentional destruction or alteration of relevant evidence in existing or pending litigation. 1\n> \n> \n> The main remedy for spoliation is the imposition of a rebuttable presumption of fact that the lost or destroyed evidence would have been unfavourable to the party that destroyed it. This presumption can be rebutted by evidence showing that the \u201cspoliator\u201d did not intend to affect the litigation by destroying the evidence ([McDougall v. Black \\& Decker Canada Inc., 2008 CarswellAlta 1686 (Alta. C.A.)](https://ca.vlex.com/vid/mcdougall-v-black-decker-681243737)).\n\nSo, we have the DPO performing spoliation, and thus the lawsuit for the beating will assume that the destroyed video showed exactly what Bob alleged that Alice Corp's security team did to him.\n\nin [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") DPO Charly can be further sued for destroying evidence under [Section 2 (16\\) Criminal Justice Act 1987](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/38/section/2).\n\nSpoliation might even happen before the case begins with filing \\& summons\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[According to an article by Chris Dale](https://chrisdaleoxford.com/2010/03/07/pre-action-spoliation-of-evidence-in-english-law/), discussion spoliation in [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") the case of [Earles v Barclays Bank Plc \\[2009] EWHC 2500 (Mercantile) (08 October 2009\\)](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Mercantile/2009/2500.html) was named as one of the best descriptions of spoliation in English law.

However, the leading text book in this area \u2013 Documentary Evidence by Charles Hollander QC\\- suggests in paragraph 10\\-06 of the 10th edition that \"there might be cases where it was appropriate to draw adverse inferences from a party's conduct before the commencement of proceedings.\" **In my judgment there would have to be some clear evidence of deliberate spoliation in anticipation of litigation before one could legitimately draw evidential \"adverse inferences\" in those circumstances.** There is no such evidential basis in this case.\n> \n> \n> 29 After the commencement of proceedings the situation is radically different. In Woods v. Martins Bank Ltd \\[1959] 1 Q.B. 55 at 60, Salmon J. said \"It cannot be too clearly understood that solicitors owe a duty to the court, as officers of the court to make sure, as far as possible, that no relevant documents have been omitted from their client's list\".\n> \n> \n> 30 In the case of documents not preserved after the commencement of proceedings then the defaulting party risk \"adverse inferences\" being drawn for such \"spoliation\": Infabricks Ltd v.

The DPO's actions in destroying or omitting damaging footage can be considered spoliation of evidence. This can have serious legal consequences:\n\n1. In a civil lawsuit, courts may draw adverse inferences, assuming that the destroyed evidence would have been unfavorable to the party that destroyed it (in this case, the store).\n\n2. The DPO could face criminal charges under Section 2(16) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 for destroying evidence.\n\n3.

Law enforcement and prosecutors have broad discretion regarding which crimes they prosecute and for which charge. \n\nAbout 1% of people arrested for committing rape are female, and while some of those cases involve materially aiding and abetting a male perpetrator (e.g. by holding down a victim while the male perpetrator engaged in the act), some of those arrests involve the fact pattern that you describe. \n\nIn part, the low rate of female arrest for rape arises from the fact that women commit violent acts, in general, at a much lower rate than men. The low rate of female arrest for rape also almost surely involves underreporting of rapes committed by women against women, in part, because women are less likely to conceptualize what they have experienced as rape and, in part, because law enforcement is often insensitive or dismissive of these charges in many places.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the U.S. Department of Justice's definition, which of the following scenarios would NOT be considered rape?\n\nA) A woman forcibly penetrating another woman with an object\nB) A man orally penetrating another man without consent\nC) A woman groping a man's genitals without his permission\nD) A man penetrating a woman's anus with his finger against her will\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe U.S. Department of Justice defines rape as \"Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\"\n\nOption A involves penetration with an object and would be considered rape.\nOption B involves oral penetration by a sex organ without consent, which fits the definition.\nOption C involves unwanted sexual contact but does not involve penetration, so it would likely be classified as sexual assault or battery, not rape.\nOption D involves penetration of the anus with a body part (finger) without consent, which meets the definition of rape.\n\nThe question tests understanding of the specific elements required for an act to be classified as rape according to the DOJ definition, highlighting that gender is not a determining factor and that various forms of penetration (not just penile) can constitute rape."}, "19": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22751/software-developer-in-a-startup-company", "docs_id": 22751, "title": "Software Developer in a Startup Company", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a software developer who developed a SAAS (software as a service) system for a startup company.

I'm seeing now that, while it used to be AGPL and CC0, it's now entirely AGPL, and by some mechanism which I do not fully understand this seems to apply to products and meshes created with it.\n\nThat is, if I produce a model while using this software, I am required to release the model, and any software dependent on the model (say, a game or a web app), under the same license. This feels extraordinarily aggressive.\n\nThis is very strange to me. It feels like a paintbrush manufacturer demanding royalties on all paintings done with their brush. Additionally, when AGPL was created, it was apparently to close a gap in GPLv3 which allowed companies to alter software on a server and open it to the public via a web interface; which was phrased loosely enough to potentially apply to all products created by the program.\n\nWhile I'm historically a big fan of GPL\\-created works and feel that they have done wonders for the whole of the software and multimedia community, this AGPL oddity is a total deal\\-breaker for the software\\-in\\-question.

Additionally, the software is not based in an English\\-speaking country, which may have thrown the interpreted meaning of \"derivative product\", as opposed to simply \"product\".\n\nThe AGPL is indeed in almost all ways the same as the GPL version 3; in fact you can see this by `diff`ing the two documents. The only extension of the GPLv3 made for AGPL applies to software being run on a server. While it is indeed possible to include code in the final files, which might, in theory, constitute a significant portion of this program, that does not happen.\n\nThe AGPL is apparently also meant almost exclusively for software, though the wording does include the ambiguous phrase \"and other products\"; this concerned me as it felt as though it might apply to the resources created by the work.

It does not extend to the products created using the software, such as 3D models or games that incorporate those models. The license's reach is often misinterpreted, particularly regarding \"derivative products.\" In this case, creating a 3D model using AGPL-licensed software does not make the model itself or any product using that model subject to the AGPL. The license would only apply if the 3D modeling software itself was being distributed or modified.

The use of localStorage for this purpose is analogous to the shopping cart example provided in the ICO guidance, where consent is not required.

This prompted research into Massachusetts state law and I got a call back from the Town Clerk themselves who told me there were two issues with me getting a business certificate:\n\n* Minors could not be notarized.\n* Minors cannot enter a legal agreement.

A writ of Mandamus is a court order that requires a government official or body to properly fulfill their official duties or correct an abuse of discretion. In this case, if the minor believes the Town Clerk's office is incorrectly interpreting or applying the law, they could seek a writ of Mandamus to compel the office to issue the Business Certificate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because discrimination laws typically don't apply to age restrictions for minors in business contexts. Option B, while potentially addressing the issue long-term, doesn't solve the immediate problem and is not a direct legal action.

The concept of ostensible authority, as explained in the documentation, is key here. Even if the office manager lacked actual authority to make such a large purchase, they likely had ostensible authority in their role to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation. The supplier, dealing with the office manager in good faith, would reasonably believe the manager had the authority to make such a purchase. The lack of internal authorization (no board minutes) or the manager exceeding their usual spending limit are internal issues between the corporation and the employee, and cannot be used to invalidate the contract with the third-party supplier.

But having an intention and be right at the start of doing the offense (details are complicated) is sometimes punished as an attempt of the offense (*Versuch*). This is defined in \u00a7 13 [*Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz*](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/owig_1968/) ([Act on Regulatory Offences](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_owig/)).\n\n> \u00a7 13 OWiG (\\= \u00a7\u00a7 22\\-24 [*Strafgesetzbuch*](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/) ([Criminal Code](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/)))\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Whoever, in accordance with his understanding of the act, takes a direct step towards the realisation of the factual elements of the offence, shall be deemed to have attempted a regulatory offence.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) The attempt may be sanctioned only if expressly provided by law.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) If the perpetrator voluntarily renounces further execution of the act or prevents its completion, he shall not be sanctioned for attempt.

However, his voluntary and earnest efforts to prevent the completion of the act shall suffice if the act is not completed without his contribution or is committed independently of his earlier participation.\n\nIf you started the offense but stopped, so you don't fulfill offense, you don't get sanctioned, if you stopped **voluntarily** (*freiwillig*), \u00a7 13 III OWiG. (The details are more complicated.) This may be the case in your example, but beeing seen by a police officer is no reason for *Freiwilligkeit*.

The simple act of purchasing in these circumstances provides no proof of the alleged dishonesty: the prosecution must add something else. For example, testimony that defendant declared \"Crikey!

According to the Theft Act 1968, the prosecution must establish that the defendant knew they had no legal right to the goods at the reduced price. The exclamation in option C clearly demonstrates the customer's awareness of the malfunction and their intent to exploit it, which could be used as evidence of dishonesty.\n\nOption A is unlikely to be considered theft as the customer genuinely believes it's a promotion, showing no dishonest intent.\n\nOption B aligns with section 2(1)(b) of the Act, which states that appropriation is not dishonest if the person believes they would have consent if the circumstances were known.\n\nOption D shows an intent to inform the store, which could be interpreted as acting in good faith, making it difficult to prove dishonesty.\n\nThe key factor in option C that makes it the correct answer is the clear verbalization of knowledge about the malfunction and the intent to exploit it, which provides the additional evidence needed to establish dishonesty beyond the mere act of purchasing at a reduced price."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26218/interpretation-of-code-and-programs", "docs_id": 26218, "title": "Interpretation of &quot;Code&quot; and &quot;Programs&quot;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've recently came across a paragraph in the [Merchant User Agreement](https://help.bigcartel.com/merchant-user-agreement) of [Big Cartel](http://bigcartel.com), specifically paragraph 5\\.2, called \"*Prohibited and Restricted Activities*\"\n\nThe paragraph states that offering the following is illegal\n\n> Code or similar automatic items, programs, or processes, such as automated software, data mining software, scrapers, and \u2018bots\n\n*I'm quite sure that this paragraph was taken into the agreement to forbid the selling of (automated\\-)bots, that are for example used in online games to \"farm\" experience and/or items, as well as data\\-miners/scrapers, that \\- for my understanding \\- grab information off the internet of from other data\\-sources, ie. corporate adresses from the web.*\n\n1\\) Regarding \"*Code or similar automatic items*..\" for my understanding as a software developer of 18 years, code is inherently not an automatic item nor is it similar to being automatic.

This would make every soldier ever to serve in war a murderer according to civilian rules.\n\nSo, what is the cutoff for soldiers in an active war to commit murder?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As with all international law, it depends on \"who says so\": I will draw on the [Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/geneva-convention-relative-protection-civilian-persons-time-war) as most relevant. Article 3 distinguishes combatants from non\\-combatants, saying that\n\n> Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of\n> armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de\n> combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in\n> all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction\n> founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or\n> any other similar criteria.\n\nThey then specifically prohibit murder:\n\n> Violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds,\n> mutilation, cruel treatment and torture\n\nbut this only applies to non\\-combatants. There simply is no prohibition against killing combatants (unsurprisingly). Liberia acceded to that treaty, so for instance if one of their soldiers murdered a non\\-combatant, in principle they should try that soldier for the crime of murder under Liberian law. If some random dude (not a soldier) murders anybody in Liberia,\nin principle they should try him for the crime. Soldier may kill enemy soldier, even when the killed soldier is sleeping and poses no immediate threat to the soldier who kills him. That's the nature of war.\n\nIn the case of Massaquoi, he might have been prosecuted by Sierra Leone, but negotiated immunity in Sierra Leone in exchange for information on his RUF colleagues. There was no such tribunal or arrangement w.r.t. his involvement in Liberia, and Finland opted to conduct an extraterritorial trial based on war crimes (not the killing of combatants).

Option A and B describe situations where enemy combatants are being killed, which is generally considered a part of warfare and not prohibited. Option C involves killing a civilian, which is indeed prohibited, but option D presents the most clear-cut war crime scenario. A combatant who has surrendered and laid down their weapons is explicitly protected under the Convention, as they are now considered \"hors de combat\".

That's all I have found for US stuff, is there any more to be found in terms of legal documents? Then the main part of the question is, what about finding this similar information for other legal systems around the world, is there any straightforward way to do that? Or must I go dig into each country's website and figure it out for each specific case, there is nothing centralized/standard?\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large) has a statutes at large in text format starting it seems, but nothing in the US goes back to the 1700's in computer readable text format it seems, unless I missed it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Nowhere Collectively\n====================\n\nThe US doesn't know the number of laws on all the federal, state, and city books. Often the lowest level of laws and ordinances are only in a city database, and sometimes not on the internet.\n\nAs a result, there is already an impossibility to get all the laws in the US in one database \\- and there are even countries that have not taken any steps to make their laws accessible on the internet at all. For example North Korean Law.\n\nThis is compounded by different entities proclaiming their laws and regulations in only their own language and on different proclamation platforms. Where available at all, the countries have country\\-wide laws and ordinances on their own dedicated websites. But again, federalism for the win: there will be different proclamation platforms for lower levels of legislation.\n\nFor example [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\") has its justice department host [https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/) which hosts all federal german laws. Schleswig Holstein hosts their state\\-level laws in corporation with the service Juris on [https://www.gesetze\\-rechtsprechung.sh.juris.de/jportal/portal/page/bsshoprod.psml](https://www.gesetze-rechtsprechung.sh.juris.de/jportal/portal/page/bsshoprod.psml) and the town of Kiel has all of its ordinances and special orders on <https://www.kiel.de/de/politik_verwaltung/ortsrecht_bekanntmachungen/index.php>\n\nWhy a conglomerate is a bad idea\n================================\n\nNow, making a conglomerate of all the laws is actually a bad idea for several reasons:\n\n1. Updates. The different entities that are in making regulations with the force of law only update their official proclamation site. Often, such changes are not announced too loudly for the lowest levels, and with the number of cities in a single federal state, it's near impossible to keep the database up to date on a complete level. This is why different databases usually only scrape the federal levels.\n2. Scraping will break *quickly*. Each of the websites I pointed to in Germany has a different system setup, making scraping these websites for the relevant information basically useless. Compounding that, City ordinance pages are redesigned at a somewhat elevated pace, resulting in the scraping of these pages to break quickly, even if you manage to set it up.\n3. Citability. In a court of law, only the official text is relevant. If an update is missed, then the whole text is useless \\- you'll have to look up the actual, currently in\\-force version of the law or ordinance, so the conglomerate is not helping.\n4. You want a ginormous database. In some countries, judgments also make law as precedent. So you want **every** judgment in your database.

Citability: Only official, current versions of laws are legally relevant, limiting the usefulness of a third-party database.\n4. Vast scope: Including all levels of legislation (federal, state, local) and court precedents from multiple jurisdictions would create an enormous and complex database.\n\nThese factors combined make creating and maintaining a comprehensive global legal database impractical and potentially unreliable for legal use."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30045/can-a-psychotherapist-offer-lower-rates-to-african-american-clients-as-reparatio", "docs_id": 30045, "title": "Can a psychotherapist offer lower rates to African-American clients as reparations?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a friend who has started offering lower rates to African\\-Americans, as her contribution to reparations.

Yet, the Google platform is a commercial product and is there to make money by displaying ads. Even non\\-profit websites like [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) or [CC search](https://search.creativecommons.org/) which ask for donations (i.e. money making albeit not for profit), thereby using images in a ['commercial' (money making) context](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jxKFa.png).\n\nIn the UK, commercial use of images *may* require a licence (a written permission). The licence must be obtained from **the author** (the photographer) **and** sometimes **the landowner** (I believe this is a branch of what is collectively known as 'third\\-party' rights, property rights in this instance, assuming the author didn't obtain such permissions).\n\nOne example could be the UK's famous [Durdle Door](https://www.google.com/search?q=Durdle+Door) which requires a [licence](https://lulworth.com/the-estate/services/film-photography-locations/location-enquiry/), if photographs are to be used for commercial purposes. It appears to be a very similar story for sites belonging to [National Trust](http://www.nationaltrustimages.org.uk/photographic-access) and [English Heritage](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/our-people/terms-and-conditions/). Yet, there is no shortage of images used in a commercial context without obtaining such licences (apparently) e.g. [CC Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/search?q=durdle%20door&license_type=commercial), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/images/search/durdle%20door/), [Trip Advisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g1420384-d546417-Reviews-Lulworth_Cove_and_Durdle_Door-West_Lulworth_Dorset_England.html), Google and many others.\n\nI appreciate this is a branch of the civil law and requires a 3rd party to actually raise it as an issue. I highly doubt any of the websites showing images in a commercial context request a permission from landowners around the UK \\- an unmanageable task. Yet, it feels like Google (or other websites) would not risk a lawsuit to show images unless they had solid basis they are allowed to do so.\n\n**Question**: given that photos of many landmarks in the UK require a written permission (i.e. a licence) to be used for a commercial use, how exactly do websites (e.g. Google, TripAdvisor, Wikipedia and others) operate without infringing on 3rd party copyrights?\n\n---\n\nClarification: I am less concerned with the author's copyright claims (like those in [Perfect 10, Inc. vs Amazon.com, Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_10,_Inc._v._Amazon.com,_Inc.)) and more with the 3rd party claims. The [UK's government website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/open-access-land-management-rights-and-responsibilities) is pretty clear on that (emphasis mine):\n\n> What people cannot do on your land\n> The CROW Act has a list of general restrictions that limit what people using their open access rights may do, unless you give them permission to do something on the list, or the right to do something already exists.\n> \n> \n> They cannot:\n> \n> \n> \\[..]\n> \n> \n> run commercial activities on the land such as:\n> \n> \n> * trade or sell\n> * charge other visitors for things they do on your land\n> * film, **photograph** or make maps\n> \n> \n> \\[..]\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends.\n\nWikipedia is quite strict on its policies, and it only allows uploading images (and other media) that either are in the public domain or with a licence that allows to be reproduced (often, Creative Commons, CC).\n\nIf you go to the [details of the image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Durdle_Door_Overview.jpg) it claims that the picture is licenced under CC, with attribution to Saffron Blaze. So most probably Saffron Blaze got permision to take the picture, and he distributed it with the CC\\-Attribution licence.\n\nWhen scrapping a web site for data, Google and other engines usually search for metadata (the *robots.txt* file) that tells them what to index and what to not. If a user gives them permission to index a picture by not stating restrictions in the robots.txt, they can do index it.\n\nOf course, in both cases it might be that someone uploads a picture that he does not have permission to share. In this case the situation will, of course, depend on jurisdiction, but many laws have provisions that ensure that, if the content provider is dilligent in addressing copyright issues caused by the users, they are protected.\n\nFor example in the USA the [Digital Millenium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) establishes \"safe harbor\" provisions that protects content providers if they give a way to denounce copyright infringiments and address those in a given timeframe.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A popular travel website displays user-uploaded photos of Durdle Door, a famous landmark in the UK, without obtaining explicit permission from the landowner.

While UK law does require permission for commercial use of photographs of certain landmarks, websites that host user-generated content often operate under \"safe harbor\" provisions. These provisions, similar to the DMCA in the US, protect content providers if they have a system in place to address copyright complaints and remove infringing content promptly when notified. This allows websites to operate without obtaining individual permissions for every image, while still providing a mechanism for rights holders to protect their interests. Options A and C are incorrect as they represent extreme positions that don't reflect the nuanced reality of online content hosting.

Foo is, however, planned to also be produced in large numbers for a market segment which is unable or unwilling to pay for Bar, but it has a very small profit margin. Bar, on the other hand, is planned to be sold at a very high profit margin.\n\nThe problem is, that Foo can be converted into Bar by adding a relatively simple mechanical part.

Selling a kit specifically designed to convert Foo into Bar could be considered contributory patent infringement under 35 U.S. Code \u00a7 271(c). This is true even if the kit's components themselves are not patentable, as long as they constitute a \"material part of the invention\" and are knowingly sold for use in infringing the patent. The fact that Acme may or may not sell its own conversion kits doesn't change this legal principle.

They publish a standard, [NFPA 1710](https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=1710), which outlines emergency response time goals. Unfortunately, the only places I can find the actual standard requires membership in the NFPA to view it.\n\nI have, however, been able to find summaries. In [this summary](https://services.prod.iaff.org/ContentFile/Get/30541) you can see Emergency Medical Services (EMTs, Paramedics) are expected to leave the station within one minute of a call being dispatched. Note that being dispatched isn't the time from when one initially calls emergency services; it is the time from when emergency services is able to determine what is needed and issue the dispatch request. [This article describes](https://www.lexipol.com/resources/blog/understanding-and-measuring-fire-department-response-times/) how fire and rescue organizations differ in how they measure responsiveness including identifying how some organizations start measuring response time at the point a call is first received.\n\nFirst arrival on scene for EMS is targeted at four minutes after \"turnout,\" when EMS is dispatched. EMS treatment levels include:\n\n* First responder (includes provisioning of an Automatic External\nDefibrillator (AED))\n* Basic Life Support (BLS)\n* Advanced Life Support (ALS)\n\nNote that this standard is based on how quickly life sustaining measures can be delivered to the person or people who need them. Transportation times to hospitals will depend on the specific transportation protocols that will be implemented once EMS has assessed the situation.\n\nThe State of Maryland, as an example, manages protocols through the [Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems](http://miemss.org/home/) (MIEMSS). Their [current protocol is available](http://www.miemss.org/home/Portals/0/Docs/Guidelines_Protocols/MD-Medical-Protocols-2018-WEB.pdf?ver=2018-04-11-134820-493) for reading.

Is this really how the law in Virginia works? What are the limits of what you are legally permitted to do to an unconscious person?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\nNo. This is not legal under Virginia law. It is a serious crime.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\n### The basic reasoning\n\nThis would be actionable as aggravated sexual battery and punishable by up to 20 years in prison, because the facts demonstrate a touching of intimate parts with an intent to molest (i.e. sexual abuse) and this is accomplished through the victim's physical helplessness, which includes being unconscious at the time for any reason.\n\n### Intent to Molest, Gratify or Arouse\n\nContrary to user6726, I don't think that groping in the factual context of the question can be reasonably interpreted as lacking an intent to molest under the statute. An interpretation that requires an effect on the victim would be contrary to the fact that the statute is talking about the intent of the perpetrator and to the fact that the statute expressly authorizes prosecutions in cases where the victim is physically helpless a definition that includes unconscious or drugged. One could probably get the court to provide an extra non\\-standard jury instruction if this was raised by the defense at trial as an issue.\n\nThe intent to molest, gratify or arouse intent requirement is designed to distinguish between, for example, giving a sponge bath to an unconscious patient at a medical facility or by a family member, or touching someone's breasts in order to get a bra size for a tailor, and \"groping.\" The intent requirement also excludes unintentional conduct such as slipping and falling into someone by accident. The admission by the perpetrator in the question doesn't suggest any possible non\\-sexual reason for the contact, and is inconsistent with unintentional conduct.\n\n### Corroboration From Actual Recent Prosecutions\n\nThis reading is consistent with the fact that Virginia prosecutors have brought charges in similar circumstances such as [the rape of an unconscious woman at a house party](http://www.eveningsun.com/story/news/2017/03/22/two-men-charged-rape-unconscious-woman-house-party/99453734/?cookies=&from=global) and [charges against a Virginia DJ for his conduct towards unconscious women](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Man-Accused-of-Assaulting-Unconscious-Women-215867991.html). The only material difference between rape and aggravated sexual battery under Virginia law is that rape requires penetration, while sexual battery merely requires sexual contact.\n\n### Additional Commentary\n\nReaching this conclusion is a bit tricky, because usually aggravated sexual battery would have a narrower definition of the crime than \"plain vanilla\" sexual battery.\n\nBut, in Virginia, there is conduct that constitutes aggravated sexual battery which does not constitute \"plain vanilla\" sexual battery, including molestation by accomplished through physical helplessness which is defined broadly in the relevant statute.\n\nIn other words, in this fact pattern, \"sexual battery\" is not a lesser included offense of \"aggravated sexual battery\" under subsection A(2\\) of \u00a7 18\\.2\\-67\\.3 of Virginia's statutes. Plain vanilla sexual battery includes the circumstances of subsection A(4\\) of \u00a7 18\\.2\\-67\\.3 of Virginia's statutes and some special \"statutory rape\"/\"position of trust\" type conduct that is outside of the scope of both A(4\\) type conduct and aggravated sexual battery generally.\n\nI would attribute the statements of the investigator as symptom of poor training about sexual assault cases and a generally regressive state of law enforcement attitudes about sexual assault in Virginia. Your friend should insist on talking to the investigator's supervisor and reviewing the relevant legal citations, with a lawyer, if necessary, if she wants to press charges.\n\nOf course, the prosecutor has no obligation to prosecute the case even if the prosecutor had a videotaped confession to every element of the crime. But, there is no reason for a prosecution to be prevented due to a non\\-lawyer investigator's misunderstanding of the law. A letter of complaint to the investigator's supervisor or the head of the department or the politician to whom the department reports would also be in order.\n\nThe Statutes\n============\n\nThe statute creating the crime is as follows, with all of the pertinent language in bold. I have put the word \"or\" when necessary to see how the statute fits together (which could be omitted in a block quotation showing omissions with \". . .\") in italics and have left the remainder of the relevant statutes in plain text to allow a reader to confirm that the reading I am giving to the statute is correct.\n\n> \u00a7 18\\.2\\-67\\.3\\.

Self-defense laws in most Western countries, including the US, generally allow the use of deadly force only when there is an imminent threat of death, rape, abduction, or serious bodily harm, and when there are no other options available to prevent this harm. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because using deadly force solely to protect property is typically not legally justifiable. The law values human life over material possessions.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because self-defense laws are designed to prevent harm, not to allow for punishment or revenge.

Prosecutors have almost unassailable discretion in their decision-making processes. This is designed to prevent them from having to legally defend every decision they make.

Option B is incorrect because Acosta's protection from prosecution is not tied to his position in the Trump administration, but rather to the general protections afforded to prosecutors.

If the radar catches you driving at 41 mph but the error margin of the radar is 5%, you could argue that you were driving at 39 mph and that the reading is due to the error in the radar1.\n\nThat would enable you to challenge the evidence (but here the point is not that you are allowed to drive at 41 mph but that there is no proof that you were driving at 41 mph). From what I know, most police forces will be aware of that and avoid issuing fines unless you are well above that margin of error2.\n\n---\n\n1In fact, in Spain word of the street is that radars are set to account to possible margin of error of the radar, plus possible margin of error of the vehicle speedometer \\-*even if it is the vehicle owner's responsibility to ensure that it works correctly*\\- and some leeway.\n\n2Some people post on the internet the \"magic formula\" of how many % of speed you can go over the posted speed limit based on those calculations.

I am not sure if this \"respectively\" means \"parties to the Agreement, parties to the Schedule, and parties to the Attachment\" or \"incorporates respectively\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is a general rule of legal interpretation that all words are to be given effect, which means that you don\u2019t just throw words away, you have to include them in the interpretation. The word \u201crespectively\u201d distributes referents and their attributes, in the specific order given, and that means we have to have at least two things. For example, \u201cThe mother and father shall receive $100 and $20, respectively\u201d means that the mother shall receive $100 and the father shall receive $20\\. \u201cThe mother and father shall receive $100, $20 and $5, respectively\u201d violates the grammatical rule pertaining to \u201crespectively\u201d (each thing is to be distributed to a different referent and we have one too few referents given the items to be distributed), so such a structure would be technically meaningless. It does *not* mean \u201ceach\u201d, that is it does not mean that both shall receive $125\\. In such a case, the courts would have to discern some deeper intention or principle of justice where the mother gets $100 and the father gets $20\\+$5, though it could go $100\\+$20 and $5 \u2013 the wording does not tell you.\n\nApplying this tool to the final clause in the snippet, we first look for three things to be distributed (Agreement, Schedule and Attachment). If the text had said \u201cAgreement, and Schedule and Attachment\u201d, we could parse this as two things to be distributed \u2013 but that\u2019s not what it says. If \u201crespectively\u201d distributes Agreement, Schedule and Attachment, that would have to mean three different parties: the agreement\\-parties, the schedule\\-parties, and the attachment\\-parties. The problem is, you can be a party to an agreement, but it makes no sense to be a party to a schedule or an attachment. The interpretive canon known as the last antecedent rule favors assigning meaning to the nearest preceding referent (the three\\-term conjunction), but that has to give way to \u201csensible interpretation\u201d, and the problem of being a \u201cparty to a schedule\u201d. (\u201cAgreement\u201d is both a document and an act: being a party being \u201cbeing a party to an act\u201d).\n\nThe clause can, however, be sensibly divided at the level of the verb \u201cincorporate\u201d, though the interleaving of conjunctions makes this hard to see. Editing the snippet down to essentials, it says \u201cThis agreement \u2026 incorporates by this reference\u2026 \\[the terms and conditions set forth in the Schedule \u2026], and \\[the Agreement and Attachment(s) set forth \u2026by \u2026 the parties to the Agreement, Schedule and Attachment], respectively\u201d. The first bracking is the noun phrase \u201cT\\&C\u201d terminating with the first comma (for conjunction). The second comma, \u201cin such Schedule, by and between the parties\u201d is the non\\-restrictive relative clause reducing comma, which is equivalent to \u201cin such Schedule, where the Agreement and Attachment(s) are set forth by and between the parties\u2026\u201d. That comma is necessitated by the fact that \u201cin such Schedule\u201d has been shoved in between \u201cset forth\u201d and \u201cby and between\u201d.\n\nWe still have to deal with the meaning of \u201cparties to the Agreement, Schedule and Attachment\u201d. It makes no sense if you interpret this as identifying three independent sets of parties. However, you don\u2019t have to interpret this as a three\\-way conjunction of parties, instead, it refers to simple unconjoined parties, and they are parties to the \\[Agreement, Schedule and Attachment], that is, the whole shebang. \n\nGiven the linguistic challenges of the text, the courts will probably have to look at the entire document and surrounding circumstances to discern the true intent of the parties.\nIt would be better to rewrite the sentence.

It doesn't clearly modify either the parties or the verb \"incorporates\" in a way that makes logical sense. Being a party to a schedule or attachment is not a common legal concept, ruling out options A and C. Option B is unlikely because the incorporation is not described as happening in any particular order. The correct answer is D because the use of \"respectively\" here creates ambiguity and doesn't serve a clear grammatical function.

A plaintiff in a civil case can compel disclosure prior to trial of all evidence in the custody, control, or possession of the defendant that is relevant or is reasonably calculated to be relevant to a disputed issue identified in the complaint, answer, and other pleadings (e.g. counterclaims, replies to counterclaims, third\\-party complaints, cross\\-claims, etc.).

First of all, a failure to disclose when there is a duty to do so is a ground to exclude presentation of that evidence at trial.
