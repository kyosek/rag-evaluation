But here goes:\n\nLast summer my family and I took a two week road trip all over western Canada, visiting Victoria, Edmonton, and lots of stops along the way. I noticed during our trip that practically every hotel we stayed at had a pool with a water slide. Some of these water slides were very high; being two and three stories tall even. \n\nI've worked in the hospitality industry before, and I know that \\-\\- in America at least \\-\\- very few hotels have water slides because they are an insurance nightmare for the property. If you own a hotel with a water slide in the US, you pay through the nose for insurance because it's practically a given that at some point, there will be an accident, someone will get hurt, and you will likely get sued over it regardless of whose fault it may have been. That's why the few that do have water slides have limited hours and charge you extra to use it. The slides always empty into a special pool or at least a roped\\-off area in the main pool that is off\\-limits to regular swimmers. There is usually a lifeguard posted to shoo people toward the exit so that the pool is clear for the next rider. There are also signs *everywhere* warning swimmers about how dangerous it can be. This is just the kind of thing Americans expect to see at a water park.\n\nWhat was peculiar to me is that the slides I encountered in Canada generally just emptied right into the main pool where other people are swimming. There were no lifeguards, few warning signs, and they were free to use as long as the pool was open. I used them a few times and you come out of them pretty fast. Very fun, but I thought it was strange that it was entirely up to me and my wife to keep our kids away from the slide so they didn't get hit by people coming down (which I'm fine with by the way \\-\\- it's called *parenting* and I'm totally OK with that).\n\nMy point is that it's a common criticism in America that we are a sue\\-happy country where we just expect that there will be a lawsuit when somebody gets hurt, whereas in Canada I got the distinct impression that people are fully expected to take their own personal responsibility to not be stupid around the water slide.\n\nIs this impression correct? Are Canadians less litigious than Americans are? If so, why? Or am I just off\\-base in my observation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, but the USA is *special*!\n-----------------------------\n\nIn [COMPARATIVE LITIGATION RATES](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/papers/pdf/Ramseyer_681.pdf)  from HARVARD, JOHN M. OLIN CENTER FOR LAW, ECONOMICS, AND BUSINESS, the authors J. Mark Ramseyer \\& Eric B. Rasmusen argue that for routine normal cases, the US is no more or less litigious than anywhere else in the developed world, specifically, they make comparisons with Australia, Canada, France, Japan and the UK.\n\nHowever, they do say:\n\n> Why, then, the American notoriety?

Instead, it derives from the peculiarly dysfunctional way courts handle several discrete types of disputes. **In several discrete areas, American courts function in a manner one can only describe as disastrous.** \n> \n> \n> American courts have made the bad name for themselves by mishandling a few peculiar categories of law suits.

However, the U.S. has gained a reputation for being overly litigious due to \"peculiarly dysfunctional\" handling of certain types of disputes, such as securities class actions and mass torts.

This is implemented by many organisations (eg. [cifas](https://www.cifas.org.uk/dsar)) by requiring the subject to provide documents such as photo id (driving license or passport) and one from a list of documents of which I only have a bank statement.\n\nThese documents contain a lot of personal information that I THINK the organisation does not have and I do not want to provide without good reason.

What can a data subject do to prevent further distribution of PII when trying to access data from a potentially untrustworthy data controller? Is there actually a solution that both provides for data security for the subject and verification of identify to the data controller?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Overview\n--------\n\nThe GDPR requires data controllers (DCs) to exercise reasonable care when responding to an access, modification, or deletion request, to ensure that it comes from the actual Data Subject (person whose data is involved, here a DS). The GDPR does not specify just what methods must or may be used to ensure that an access (or other) request comes from the DS. It does say, in Article 12, that \"additional information\" may be requested from the DS by the DC for this purpose that is \"necessary to confirm the identity\" of the DS.\n\nIf a DC receives data for identification purposes, it must be used only for those purposes, and retained no longer than needed.\n\nPersonal Data (PD) in general must be limited according to article 5, so that data is used only for the purposes it was collected for, retained for no longer than needed, adn appropriately secured against unauthorized use or access. The DC is responsible for adhering to these limitations. Recitals 57, 59, and 77 (quoted below) confirm this, and discuss identification.\n\nIf a DC violates these restrictions, it is subject to the same enforcement as it would be for violating any other GDPR provision.\n\nIf a DS thinks the data requested to support identification of the DS is excessive, the DS may first complain to the DC, and then to the relevant supervisory authority if the response from the DC is not acceptable (allow at least 1 month for a response). But perhaps knowing that the GDPR forbids the DC from distributing or using this data except for the purpose it was collected, that is, to identify the DS, and from retaining it longer than need be, might offer some reassurance.\n\nA DS could also ask the DC what is the minimum data needed for identification, and redact data beyond this. The DC might need more than name and address, but not all that is on a bank statement or other ID document.\n\nGDPR Sources\n------------\n\n[Article 12](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/) (section 6\\) of the GDPR reads:\n\n> Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.\n\nThat includes access requests.\n\nParagraph 1 of [Article 11](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-11-gdpr/) reads:\n\n> If the purposes for which a controller processes personal data do not or do no longer require the identification of a data subject by the controller, the controller shall not be obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with this Regulation.\n\nParagraph 1(b) of [article 5](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) specifies that personal data shall be :\n\n> collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;\n\nParagraph 1(c) of art 5 specifies that such data shall be:\n\n> limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ...\n\nParagraph 1(e) of art 5 specifies that such data shall be;\n\n> kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for **no longer than is necessary** for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; \\[emphasis added]\n\nParagraph 1(f) of art 5 further specifies that such data shall be:\n\n> processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing\n\n[Recital 59](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-59/) reads:\n\n> Modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject\u2019s rights under this Regulation, including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for requests to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed by electronic means. The controller should be obliged to respond to requests from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one month and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any such requests.\n\n[Recital 57](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-57/) reads:\n\n> If the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person, the data controller should not be obliged to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject in order to support the exercise of his or her rights. 3Identification should include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log\\-in to the on\\-line service offered by the data controller.\n\n[Recital 77](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-77/) reads:\n\n> Guidance on the implementation of appropriate measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the controller or the processor, especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the processing, their assessment in terms of origin, nature, likelihood and severity, and the identification of best practices to mitigate the risk, could be provided in particular by means of approved codes of conduct, approved certifications, guidelines provided by the Board or indications provided by a data protection officer.

But all these patterns are at least derivative of the original work. But in fact, they *full encode* the message, only in a different format, and are reversible. This means we don't just make a derivate, we made a **copy**, which can be read with the proper means.\n\n**It is the sole right of the author or rightsholder to license making copies**, no matter how they are encoded.\n\nOr to rephrase: If it is reversible, it is a copy.

Period. No way around.\n* The one downloading the file committed copyright infringement by copying the unlicensed copy.

Deleting the file btw does not make the copyright infringement go away.\n\n> can that person make a legitimate argument in court that he just randomly generated the \"abstract art\" \\[...] ?\n\nThat would be perjury.

Which incidentally can be easily proven if the algorithm is reversible \\- it will prove the input.\n\n> is the person who wrote the program \\[...] make the argument that the program isn't meant to specifically decode copyright material\n\nThey can, but they are not even on the hook for copyright infringement in the first place. They provide a tool with legitimate uses, such as transmitting messages in a secure way. Encoded files inside other images are for example used by journalists to get files out of oppressive regimes. The liability araises only at the user who uses it illegally.\n\n> But if so, would it then make a difference if the offline program decodes the file into system RAM only, and not to a file on disk?\n\nNo. Think about an ISO file. ISO files are 1:1 copies of how a CD is written. They can be burned 1:1 onto a CD without any extra preparation, which is their legitimate use: be easy to distribute and verify copies of for example installation files. ISO files can also be mounted in a virtual CD drive, which emulates a CD drive.\n\nIf you legitimately got the Windows ISO from Microsoft (or a licensed retailer) directly, you can mount it or burn it, or use it for all legitimate purposes.

What legal recourse do I have if I want to do that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Musical compositions can be, and if recent almost always are, protected by copyright. This is separate from the copyright on a recording of a performance of the work.\n\nIf you reuse a musical passage, the new work may be a *derivative work*, that is a work based on an earlier work. Or an extended musical quotation could be considered to be copyright infringement.\n\nIf this is in the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") the use of a section from a previous work **might** be considered to be a *fair use* ([fair\\-use](/questions/tagged/fair-use \"show questions tagged 'fair-use'\")). This is a specifically US concept in copyright law, although several other countries have a concept of *fair dealing* which is somewhat similar, although narrower.\n\nWhether a use is a fair use is an inherently fact\\-based determination. There is no clear and simple bright line for what is and is not a fair use. US law ([17 USC 197](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107)) specifies four factors which are to be weighed by a court in considering the matter:\n\n1. **The purpose and character of the use**. If your use is commercial that weighs against fair use, but does not at all preclude it. This factor also includes whether the use is *transformative* or not. A transformative use is one that takes the part used for a very different sort of purpose than the original. Parodies are normally transformative, for example. A quote for purposes of commentary and analysis, or criticism is normally transformative. Transformative uses are more likely to be considered fair uses.\n2. **The nature of the copyrighted work**. Creative works such as fiction and *music* are more strongly protected than works such as textbooks and news stories. This probably weighs against fair use in the case described.\n3. **The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole**. If only a short section of a longer work is used, that weighs in favor of fair use. However very short quotes can still fail, to be held to be fair uses. In [*Harper vs Nation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_%26_Row_v._Nation_Enterprises) a quote of about 300 words from a 500 page book was held not to be fair use because it was \"the heart of the book\".\n4. **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.** A use that significantly harms the market value of the original, or serves as a replacement for it, weigh strongly against fair use. This was a major factor in *Harper vs Nation*.\n\nEach case of claimed fair use is evaluated by looking at all four factors, and the specific facts of the case.\n\nFrom the description in the question, such a use might well be held to be fair use. Musical quotations often are. But there is no way to be sure unless a court evaluates the specific case. A lawyer specifically experienced in not only copyright law, but copyrights on music, might be able to give more specific advice.\n\nOr you could, of course, seek permission from the copyright holder, quite likely the original composer or artist. If you get permission, there is no further issue. There might be a charge, but when the use is minor, and has no commercial effect, the charge might be small or even zero provided that the source is acknowledged.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A musician wants to use a short musical riff from a copyrighted song in their new composition, significantly altering it in the process.

If challenged, a court would evaluate the use based on four main factors:\n\n1. The purpose and character of the use (including whether it's transformative)\n2. The nature of the copyrighted work\n3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used\n4. The effect on the potential market for the original work\n\nThe question describes a potentially transformative use of a small portion of the original work, which could weigh in favor of fair use. However, this determination is complex and fact-specific, and there's no guarantee of how a court would rule. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the fair use doctrine or make absolute statements that don't reflect the nuanced nature of copyright law in these cases."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46998/how-can-nasa-images-videos-not-be-copyrighted", "docs_id": 46998, "title": "How Can NASA Images/Videos Not Be Copyrighted?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> NASA content \\- images, audio, video, and computer files used in the rendition of 3\\-dimensional models, such as texture maps and polygon data in any format \\- generally are not copyrighted.\n\n* <https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/guidelines/index.html>\n\nAren't works automatically protected by copyright upon creation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a special exception in [17 USC 105](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105):\n\n> Copyright protection under this title is not available for any work of\n>  the United States Government, but the United States Government is not\n>  precluded from receiving and holding copyrights transferred to it by\n>  assignment, bequest, or otherwise.\n\nIn the [definitions](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101),\n\n> A \u201cwork of the United States Government\u201d is a work prepared by an\n>  officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that\n>  person\u2019s official duties.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: NASA releases a series of high-resolution images of Mars taken by the Perseverance rover.

They already know the contents of the email, because they are either the sender or the receiver, so the only additional information the tracking pixel gives them is the timestamp of your access to the email.\n\nYou could perhaps stop this by instructing your browser or other email program not to download images, or to prompt you for permission on each image.\n\nSince the Irish company you are doing business with is in the EU (and you are also), the GDPR should apply. Thus they ought to have a lawful basis to process any personal data (PD) relating to you under GDPR [Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/). Under \\[Article 13], when a Data Controller (DC) obtains Personal Data (PD) from the data subject, it is supposed to notify the subject that it has done so, and provide certain information to the subject. Article 13 paragraph 1 states:\n\n> Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information:\n> \n> \n> * (a) the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller\u2019s representative;\n> * (b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;\n> * (c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing;\n> * (d) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1\\), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party;\n> * (e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;\n> * (f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1\\), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available.\n\nArticle 13 paragraph 2 states:\n\n> In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing:\n\n> * (a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\n> * (b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right to data portability;\n> * (c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 9(2\\) \\[consent], the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;\n> * (d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\n> * (e) whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible consequences of failure to provide such data;\n> * (f) the existence of automated decision\\-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1\\) and (4\\) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\n\nNote that the DC need not provide this information if the DS already has it. It might be buried in a long ToS document or privacy policy.\n\nThere is a somewhat similar set of information, albeit different in detail, to be provided under [Article 14](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/) when the DC obtains PD from a third party. The obligation under article 14 does not apply when the DS already has the information, when it is impossible or unreasonably hard to comply, or in any of several other conditions.\n\nYou could request of the Irish DC that they supply you with the information required under article 13 or 14\\. You could make the same request of the \"third party company\" but they are probably acting as a Data Processor (DP) in which case the obligation is on the DC.\n\nYou could also make a data access request under [Article 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/) winch states:\n\n> The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information:\n\nThis is followed by a list of the details to be provided by the DC.\n\n> 2. Can the third\\-party, which is based in the UK, collect this data\n\nIf the third\\-party is acting as a Data Processor, in accordance with a contract with the DC, they have to same right to collect the information as the DC would have if the DC did this directly, and must abide by the same restrictions, They may share this data with the DC, and with others only at the DC's direction, for which direction the DC is responsible.\n\nUnder [article 27](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-27-gdpr/) a Processor not established in the EU must appoint a representative within the EU to with requests and complaints may be addressed. If the data begin processed does not include \"special\" data (mostly Personally Identifiable Information) \" and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons\" no representative is required. You are entitled to request the contact info of the representative. (A DC not in the EU must also have a representative.)\n\n> 3. Can the third\\-party share it with a company in EU country\n\nUnder \\[Article 44] transfers to counties outside the EU are restricted:\n\n> Any transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country or to an international organisation shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from the third country or an international organisation to another third country or to another international organisation. 2All provisions in this Chapter shall be applied in order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by this Regulation is not undermined.\n\nArticles 45 thru 50 specify the specific situations under whch such transfers are lawful. Under article 13(1\\) (f) the DS should be informed of any intention to make such a transfer when the data is collected.\n\n> I \\[can't] see any legitimate business requirement that either company could have for tracking me.\n\nAs I mentioned above, knowing whether and when you read a communication is probably legitimate. Additional tracking might not be. I can find no law or regulation prohibiting such tracking,. but the results are surely PD subject to the GDPR and all its applicable provisions.\n\n> Legally, where do I stand?\n\nIt seems that the Irish Company may have violated the GDPR (arts 13 or 14\\) by not informing you of the information collected.

The motive suggested for dual citizenship thus does not seem to make sense.\n\nTo acquire citizenship in the country of study the student would need to go through whatever process that country's laws specify. In most countries that includes a statement of intention to remain permanently in that country, and some evidence supporting that intention. The process is also likely to take rather longer than a typical course of graduate study. It is unusual for a student to gain citizenship in a country of study while still a student. It is still more unusual for a student to gain such citizenship and then return, not for just a visit, to the student's birth country.\n\nSome countries allow people being naturalized to retain citizenship in another country, some do not. Some countries allow a person who gains citizenship in another country to retain his or her birth citizenship, others do not.\n\nIf the country of study permits migrants to retain another citizenship while being naturalized, and the birth country permits a citizen to retain citizenship while being naturalized elsewhere, **and**, the student complies with the laws of the country of study for gaining its citizenship, then the student will have obtained dual citizenship. This is unusual, but it is perfectly possible if the laws om the countries involved permit it, and a good many do. But obtaining citizenship in a new country with which one had no previous connection is generally not a simple or quick process.\n\nNow, if one of the student's parents had been a citizen of the country of study, then the student might be able to obtain citizenship there by inheritance. Some countries allow this under some conditions.

Studying abroad does not automatically cause a person to lose citizenship or voting rights in their home country.\n2. Obtaining citizenship in the country of study (US in this case) typically requires a separate, lengthy process beyond just completing studies there.\n3. Dual citizenship may be possible, but it depends on the laws of both countries and is not automatically granted upon completing studies abroad.\n4.

A good overview of the issues is present [at the Wikipedia post on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_student_employee_unionization), whose supporting citation links have mostly rotted.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) denied the right of graduate students at private colleges to unionize in 2004 in a case involving Brown University which was reversed by the NLRB on August 23, 2016\\.\n\nThis did not prevent graduate students at public universities, which are outside the jurisdiction of the NLRB from unionizing, however. Graduate students at the University of Illinois at Urbana\\-Champagne had their union recognized when the Illinois Court of Appeals held that they were entitled to unionize under state laws related to public employees' unions. This was one of the first cases to successfully recognize a graduate student's union after a long lull in campuses organizing.\n\nThe Wikipedia article claims that this was a 2002 decision (this could be the date that the University and the union [reached an agreement](https://www.uigeo.org/2002/06/) ([stipulations](https://humanresources.illinois.edu/assets/docs/AHR/Stipulations.pdf)) regarding who was covered by the union), but the case in question appears to be *Graduate Employees Org. v.

Send your request to the address on your notice. For more information, see Form 12153, Request for a Collection Due Process or Equivalent Hearing. At the conclusion of your hearing, the Office of Appeals will provide a determination. You\u2019ll have 30 days after the determination to challenge it in the U.S. Tax Court.

This is not unusual with professional or managerial workers.\n\nHowever, even where both employer and employee might acknowledge this as the reality in a particular case, the courts tend to reject this analysis as too complicated and uncertain to adjudicate upon.\n\nInstead, the courts impose law upon the parties, holding that the primary obligation for which a salaried worker is remunerated are the hours of attendance, and a \"day's pay\" is reckoned accordingly.\n\nEmployers are free to use salaries as an alternative to hourly pay or per\\-diems, but when pro\\-rating disputes come to be adjudicated by the law, the employers have a clear understanding for how the calculation will be performed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A salaried employee in the UK who works 5 days a week (Monday to Friday) is awarded \"8 days' worth of pay\" as part of a termination agreement.

According to the legal approach outlined in the documentation, courts typically interpret salaries as compensation for \"time work\" when pro-rating is required.

The top of the front page of a summons and of a legal complaint (which also usually appears at the top of the front page of every other document filed in a case, although sometimes in abbreviated form) in a civil lawsuit is called the **caption** of the case.\n\nSecond, it doesn't sound to me like the business is \"fictitious\". If it truly didn't exist, you wouldn't be suing it, because you could never serve anyone associated with it with process and couldn't collect or enforce a judgment against anyone if you won the lawsuit.\n\nInstead, it is fair to assume that there is a real business that someone or some group of people conduct business under that has a certain name, which isn't registered with the Secretary of State or other appropriate official in the state in which you are bringing suit, or in any other state known to you.\n\nSuppose that that name under which business was conducted by this firm was \" S.H.

What is the situation in the USA? Should I split my question into two questions, one asking about EU and the other one about USA?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, nothing that you describe is clearly a parody. Parody is different from making a reference or allusion to another work or including an homage to another work. As a good rule of thumb it is very hard to parody something that is already in the light/comedy genre, and simply reimagining someone else's work in a new context is not a parody. Instead, a parody generally makes a point that the author of the original work would find unpleasant or distasteful rather than being honored by it. The main point of the parody exception is that the targets of it would rarely consent to let you use their works for that purpose.\n\nSecond of all, you don't have a \"right\" to do anything of these things. Almost everything you describe is a derivative work which infringes a known copyright. The question is whether you have a defense to the claim of infringement.\n\nThe things that you describe may or may not be fair use. The fair use defense to a claim of derivative work copyright infringement is something that is evaluated in a rich factual context on a case by case basis, usually enriched by testimony from expert witnesses regarding what is commonly accepted and not accepted as permissible in this context and genre. Nothing you suggest is 100% certain to escape infringement liability, and nothing you suggest is 100% certain to be infringing. You are in a gray area and you are rolling the dice.\n\nIn addition to the \"fair use\" defense, you might also be able to resort to the \"scene a faire\" doctrine which states that elements of a work which would otherwise be infringing are permissible if they are pervasive conventions of a genre of work.\n\nFor example, the fact that your dark stormy castle in a gothic horror work looks like every other dark stormy castle in the genre, because that is what \"gothic horror works\" do, is a defense to a derivative work infringement claim. \n\nSimilarly, lots of standard cord progressions in popular music in a song you wrote would be protected by this doctrine. \n\nTo the extent that works in the genre you are creating in are almost always awash with references to other works in the genre, this would be a helpful boost to your argument that a defense would apply to your infringement of a derivative work because \"fair use\" is a matter of community custom and standards.\n\nOn the other hand, to the extent that you go beyond mere references to other works in the genre and instead are really just writing fan fiction, you are probably infringing and the fair use defense would not apply.\n\nIf you were sued you could probably not be able to get the case resolved one way or the other without a full presentation of all of the relevant facts by both sides in the case. These examples would not be amenable to summary resolution.\n\nOn the other hand, on the merits, I think that there is a good case to be made in each of the examples that you identify that it is a \"scene a faire\" or is \"fair use\". But, you have to understand that you are appealing to community indulgence of technically illegal activity, rather than truly doing so as a matter of \"right\" which is not a helpful way to think about what you are doing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal status of including references or homages to other works in your own creative content?\n\nA) You have an absolute right to include any references or homages to other works as long as they are brief and insignificant compared to your overall work.\n\nB) All references or homages to other works are considered parody and are therefore always protected under fair use.\n\nC) Including references or homages to other works is a gray area that may or may not be considered fair use, depending on various factors and context.\n\nD) References or homages to other works are always copyright infringement and should never be included without explicit permission.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The legal status of including references or homages to other works is not clear-cut and falls into a gray area. While there are defenses such as fair use and the \"scene a faire\" doctrine, these are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and depend on various factors including the context, genre conventions, and the extent of the reference. It's not an absolute right (ruling out A), not always considered parody or protected under fair use (ruling out B), and not always copyright infringement (ruling out D).

As it says, \"Your voting residence is your address in the State in which you were last domiciled, immediately prior to leaving the United States.\"\n\nLaws about domicile vary from state to state, and sometimes for different purposes; in one state, the law about domicile for state income tax might be worded differently than the law about domicile for getting a driver license. The general idea is it is the place you intend as your permanent home, and intend to return to when you are temporarily absent.\n\nSo if, while you were in Maryland, you thought of it as a temporary absence from Pennsylvania, then Pennsylvania was still your domicile. Likewise for New Jersey. And since it's about your intent, if you tell all the government officials you encounter or correspond with that even on your last day in New Jersey, you always intended to return to Pennsylvania, the government would be hard\\-pressed to prove otherwise.\n\nKeep in mind that whichever place in the US was your last domicile is now your voting residence. It may be that the place is no longer your domicile. Reasons why it may not be your domicile could be that you now intend to stay in your current overseas home permanently. Or perhaps the US place has been torn down and an office building built on the site.\n\nA voting residence is a different concept from a domicile, because if you move permanently overseas, you might not be entitled to a US driver license, you probably don't have to pay income tax to any state\\*, but you're always entitled to vote in US elections.\n\n\\*You still have to file US income tax returns, and possibly pay tax.\n\nAs the web page linked above mentions, a person who never lived in a state may not be able to vote in federal elections, because the people elected in federal elections, like representatives, senators, and electors of the electoral college, all represent a particular place.

According to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, a U.S. citizen's voting residence is typically the address in the state where they were last domiciled immediately before leaving the United States.

This does not mean that sleep apnea is \"not a disability under the law\", it means that \"defendant is not disabled under the law\", that is, the conclusion is based on the particulars of the individual condition, which is why the answer is \"maybe yes, maybe no\". There is a two\\-prong inquiry into the condition. First is a determination whether the person is \u201csubstantially limited in any major life activity other than working, such as walking, seeing, or hearing\u201d, compared to the general population. If not, then an inquiry into work\\-related substantial limitations. A six month delay in seeking treatment undermined Keyes' argument that his condition was a substantial limitation, furthermore he *had* a CPAP machine, so essentially his condition was fixed \u2013 circumstances not application to the case you describe.

The employee has informed their employer about the issue and is awaiting a back-ordered medical device for treatment. The employer has threatened termination if the employee cannot arrive on time. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) Sleep apnea is automatically considered a disability under the ADA, and the employer must provide accommodations.\n\nB) Sleep apnea is never considered a disability under the ADA, and the employer has no obligation to accommodate the employee.\n\nC) The employee's sleep apnea may be considered a disability under the ADA, depending on how substantially it limits major life activities, and the employer may need to provide reasonable accommodations.\n\nD) The employee's sleep apnea cannot be considered a disability under the ADA because it is treatable with a medical device.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the legal status of sleep apnea as a disability under the ADA is not clear-cut and depends on the individual circumstances. As noted in the documentation, courts have ruled differently in various cases involving sleep apnea. The key factors in determining whether sleep apnea qualifies as a disability under the ADA include:\n\n1. Whether the condition substantially limits a major life activity compared to the general population.\n2. The severity and impact of the individual's specific case.\n3. The availability and effectiveness of treatment.\n\nIn this scenario, the employee's sleep apnea appears to be significantly affecting their ability to arrive at work on time, which could be considered a substantial limitation of a major life activity. Additionally, the employee is actively seeking treatment but is unable to obtain it due to back-order issues, which differentiates this case from others where treatment was available or delayed by the employee.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because sleep apnea is not automatically considered a disability under the ADA. Answer B is incorrect because sleep apnea can potentially be considered a disability under the right circumstances. Answer D is incorrect because the mere fact that a condition is treatable does not disqualify it from being considered a disability, especially when the treatment is unavailable to the employee."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6156/is-what-constitutes-outrageous-conduct-clearly-defined-in-the-statutes", "docs_id": 6156, "title": "Is what constitutes outrageous conduct clearly defined in the statutes?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Are there any objective rules or guidelines used to determine whether a police officer's conduct was outrageous?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"outrageous conduct\" has sometimes been a factor in holding police action invalid under the uS Federal constitution.

Is such a contract binding or void, and can the writer get into trouble for doing so (eg. for misrepresentation)? Two types of scenarios that I want to ask about:\n\n1. When a defined term in the contract carry a much narrower, or much broader meaning than the common meaning. For example, can a contract define a term \"Image\" (as in a picture) to mean any computer file, or to mean any image showing a red flower?\n2. When the defined meaning is completely incompatible with the common sense meaning. For example, can a contract define an \"Text file\" as a file with the `.png` extension?\n\nDoes the answer change if the defined term, when used normally, starts with a capital letter (eg. if \"SVG file\" is defined as a `.png` file), so the reader is less likely to suspect the term has been defined in the contract itself?\n\nDoes the answer change if this happened in another legal document, such as a EULA, where the person agreeing does not have a chance to call the writer of the document out?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is it legal to redefine a term against common sense in a contract?\n\nGenerally speaking, yes. What matters is that the contract be clear enough for the parties to be aware of the terms and conditions to which they are committing. Both of the scenarios you outline seem lawful. They are binding to the extent that the definitions \\& language therein duly inform the parties of the substance of the contract. Definitions in a contract are most pertinent where the meaning of a term is intended to supersede and replace the commonplace meaning thereof.\n\nA contract would become null and void if the substance of that contract contravenes legislation. If legislation outlaws not only the effect of a clause but also its meaning, then the \\[un\\-]lawfulness of that clause is not altered simply by crafting definitions of terms. In other words, laws or legislative intent cannot be elluded by relabeling concepts in a contract.\n\nWhenever lawful, the attempt to trick a party with tactics (such as the use of uppercase you mention) is likely to be voidable by that party. The rationale is the same: The draftsman's attempt to confuse the user contravenes the contract law tenet that the parties *knowingly* enter the contract at issue.\n\nNotice that in the preceding paragraph I wrote \"*whenever lawful*\" rather than \"*although lawful*\". The reason for that choice is that, in some contexts, the draftsman's tricky attempts might constitute a *deceptive practice* and thus be in violation of the law (for instance, consumer protection laws).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company includes the following clause in its End User License Agreement (EULA):\n\n\"For the purposes of this agreement, 'Personal Data' shall mean any computer file stored on the user's device, regardless of its content or format.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this clause?\n\nA) The clause is automatically void because it contradicts the common understanding of \"Personal Data\"\nB) The clause is likely enforceable, but may be challenged if it's deemed a deceptive practice under consumer protection laws\nC) The clause is unenforceable because EULAs are not considered legally binding contracts\nD) The clause is enforceable only if \"Personal Data\" is capitalized throughout the entire EULA\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. According to the documentation, it is generally legal to redefine terms in a contract, even if the definition differs significantly from common understanding.

Just by searching google news for [is suing over trademark violation](https://news.google.com/search?q=is%20suing%20over%20trademark%20violation) leads to many articles regarding a trademark lawsuit. In many of those cases there is a statement from at least one of the sides. Are all those results (I know, many are about the same case, but still, a lot) full of stupid clients?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's a bit like talking to the police: anything you say might be used against you, so the conventional wisdom is to say nothing. It is a good rule of thumb. When you are paying a professional to represent you, why make things complicated by speaking on your own behalf about the same issue?\n\nAs you point out, not everyone follows this rule. In some circumstances there might be benefits to discussing your case publicly, such as fundraising or deterrence. Whether the risk outweighs the benefits will depend on the details of the legal case and your role in it. Lawyers are likely to emphasise the following risks:\n\n* If you are a witness whose credibility is in issue, any public statement could potentially become a [prior inconsistent statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_consistent_statements_and_prior_inconsistent_statements) which is used against you in cross\\-examination. Again, one of the purposes of hiring a lawyer is to be careful about how you communicate your position on a litigious matter and reduce the risk of careless remarks having unexpected consequences. Speaking publicly undermines this goal.\n* In Commonwealth countries, there is a significant risk that public comment on a case before the court could amount to [sub judice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_judice) contempt of court. Attempting to litigate the case in the media can be perceived as undermining the authority of the court. Lawyers are expected to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice and would be reluctant to condone anything that could be regarded as a contempt. This contributes to a culture where discussing active litigation is \"not the done thing\" and may itself cause problems with a witness's perceived credibility, aside from the risk of a contempt allegation.\n\nSpeaking publicly about litigation is risky and the consequences are difficult to predict, which is why people often engage lawyers to do it. When the client continues to make their own statements without legal advice, it makes the lawyer's risk management job more difficult, so they are likely to advise against it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A plaintiff in a trademark lawsuit decides to do a public Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) about their case.

Public statements can be used against the plaintiff in court, may be seen as an attempt to influence the case outside the courtroom, and could potentially lead to contempt charges in some legal systems.\n\nOption D, however, is not a primary reason for a lawyer's objection to public discussion.

The review of the application of the law is more on the decisions the judge made and not the prosecutor. Typically if the judge was in error, the case is vacated and remanded to the lower court to be tried again with the recommended corrections to avoid the past mistake. This essentially means that the case that was appealed never happened (thus removing Double Jeopardy concerns and allowing the Prosecutor to try the defense again, if he still has sufficient cause to retry. Many cases where new evidence is produced will do this as the evidence might not be enough to change a Jury Panel's mind.).\n\nA successful first level appeal also unfetters the Prosecutor from Double Jeopardy restrictions. In the U.S., the ban on Double Jeopardy essentially bans the prosecutor from making an appeal after the verdict of the case is read, regardless of outcome (a finding of Not Guilty ends the whole matter then and their and the accused cannot be retried by that specific jurisdiction for that specific crime... They might have to deal with the Feds, but the Feds have specific guidelines on when they can try a case that has been tried by the state.).\n\nThere are a few cases where the successful appeal can be a career ending move on the prosecution and that is through some evidence of Prosecutorial Misconduct, i.e. the Prosecution did something wrong that resulted in the case being swung in his favor. This commonly is a Brady Disclosure Violation or failure on the Prosecution's part to turn over all evidence they have, including exculpatory evidence.

A reversal doesn't automatically impact the judge's or prosecutor's record negatively. The judge's decisions may be reviewed, but this is part of the normal appeals process.

Normally, health insurance claims made by current employees can increase MoneySavers health insurance renewal rate.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's probably not unlawful to ask, but an answer cannot be *required* immediately.\n\nPer the [Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/publications/an-employees-guide-to-health-benefits-under-cobra.pdf), Susan has 60 days to elect COBRA coverage (the qualifying event here being the termination of Susan's employment):\n\n> Your plan must give you at least 60 days to choose whether or not to elect COBRA coverage, beginning from the date the election notice is provided or the date you would otherwise lose coverage under your group health plan due to the qualifying event, whichever is later.\n\nIt would be unlikely for an employer to discourage an employee from electing COBRA coverage due to costs to the employer, as you suggest:\n\n> Susan is still employed and thus could be treated differently in her last two weeks depending on how she responds because the company is struggling financially and is looking for every opportunity to save money.\n\nSusan electing to use COBRA coverage is unlikely to cost the company money, because the employer is [permitted to charge her the entire cost of the coverage, plus 2 percent to cover the cost of administering it](https://www.bizfilings.com/toolkit/research-topics/office-hr/what-is-cobra-what-employers-need-to-know) ([additional DoL source](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/cobra-continuation-health-coverage-for-employers.pdf)).\n\nAs far as privacy goes, I don't think anything illegal has occurred here. The most prevalent law regarding privacy of health information, HIPAA, [generally does not apply to employers](https://ogletree.com/insights/what-all-employers-need-to-know-about-protecting-employee-health-information/). Susan could, of course, request a private discussion, and any response from Emily could not rise to the level of illegal harassment or create a hostile work environment.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Susan, an employee at MoneySavers, is about to leave her job and inquires about COBRA coverage. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the legal and procedural aspects of this situation?\n\nA) Emily, the HR representative, is legally required to ask Susan if she plans to use COBRA coverage before providing the paperwork.\n\nB) Susan must decide whether to elect COBRA coverage immediately when asked by Emily, as there is no grace period for this decision.\n\nC) MoneySavers can legally charge Susan the full cost of COBRA coverage plus an additional 2% for administration fees.\n\nD) HIPAA laws prevent Emily from discussing COBRA options with Susan in an open office environment where others can overhear.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because there is no legal requirement for Emily to ask Susan if she plans to use COBRA before providing paperwork.\n\nB is incorrect because according to the Department of Labor, Susan has at least 60 days to elect COBRA coverage from the date of the election notice or loss of coverage, whichever is later.\n\nC is correct. Employers are permitted to charge the entire cost of COBRA coverage plus 2% for administration fees to the former employee.\n\nD is incorrect because HIPAA generally does not apply to employers in this context. While it might be more considerate to have this conversation in private, it's not illegal to discuss COBRA options in an open office environment."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64370/remedy-for-employee-regarding-provident-fund", "docs_id": 64370, "title": "Remedy for employee regarding Provident Fund", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What are the possible charges an employee can take against an employer regarding Provident Fund \\- An employee works in a company for a short duration i.e., less than a year.

The situation described could potentially lead to charges under both Section 406 and Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code, depending on the employer's capacity and the full facts of the case. Section 406 applies to criminal breach of trust in general, while Section 409 specifically addresses breach of trust by public servants, bankers, merchants, or agents. The exact charge would depend on the employer's role and the details of the case. Option A is incorrect because this can be treated as a criminal offense. Option B is partially correct but incomplete, as Section 409 could also apply in certain circumstances. Option D is incorrect because paying the owed amount and penalty does not necessarily preclude criminal charges, especially if there was intentional misappropriation of funds."}}
