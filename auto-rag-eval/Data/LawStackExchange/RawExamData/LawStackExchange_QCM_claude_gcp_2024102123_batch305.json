            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It is a known fact that [Li\\-Ion batteries will die and become useless much faster when kept fully charged 100% and always topped up 100%](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/114412/how-do-i-stop-charging-the-battery-way-prior-to-100-in-openbsd) as compared to when they're only charged to, say, about 50% or 80%, and never topped up prior to going below 46% or some such (or at the very least, never below 96%, say). Which is why IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad series has a very visible and apparent option which lets the user specify the exact start/stop charges (they even have the option to automatically discharge the battery to 50%), and why the batteries in ThinkPads have an overwhelmingly much better lifespan in the stationary scenarios than the competitors.\n\nMost laptops and mobile phones (with hotspots) by other manufacturers, however, don't have any such options, and, as a result, suffer premature battery failure when they are merely used as stationary devices. It would not be uncommon for such batteries to [fail and even deform even prior to their advertised 300 cycles](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/76797/swollen-pregnant-battery-on-a-macbook-13-aluminium-late-2008) or whatnot, sometimes taking back with them the whole use of the device ([mobile phones](https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/63078/dont-charge-to-100-when-always-on-wall-plugged-in) may not even turn on without a battery, even if USB power is present; and what do you do if the battery has bulged so much as to no longer fit?), or individual features of the device (battery bulging in a MacBook may cause the buttons on the trackpad to stop working; or if you remove it, there goes your CMOS RTC).\n\n**It would seem that companies like Apple, Dell, HTC etc, can't possibly not know these issues that have been known to IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad designers since a long time. Are there grounds for some sort of a class action case here, for negligence and/or fitness?** Can we sue these manufacturers for failing to provide options for shutting the charger off at 50%, and for needlessly trickle\\-charging the batteries ad nauseam, resulting in premature failures, including loss of capacity and bulging? \n\nWouldn't this be an example of **negligence** to know about these things ([and it is widely known that batteries are best stored at 50% charge, even ***apple.com***/batteries/maximizing\\-performance/ has a memo](http://archive.is/zuddn#selection-404.0-415.390)), yet not doing anything in their products to accommodate stationary laptop and phone (w/ hotspot) usage?\n\nSome laptops are even explicitly advertised as desktop replacements \u2013 wouldn't it be a **fitness** issue if the manufacturer fails to provide a 50% charge option for extended desktop use? (Wouldn't it also be *fraud* if they subsequently sell replacement batteries at a nice profit, after ensuring their circuitry will effectively ruin Li\\-Ion and Li\\-Polymer batteries through such trickle charging as above?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Negligence**\n\nLiability for negligence relies on the existence of a duty to do something (or to not do something). The plaintiff must suffer some injury as a result of a breach of that duty. Damages will be awarded to remedy that injury.\n\nDoes Apple have a duty to provide software and hardware functionality to maximise the life of the batteries included with their products?\n\nProducts come in a variety of qualities and standards. Courts will impose some standards (e.g. ginger beer should not have dead snails in it: *Donoghue v Stevenson* \\[1932] UKHL 100\\), but there is no duty to ensure that ever product implements the state of the art. \n\nOne of the factors taken into account by a court in determining the existence of a duty to prevent injury is the cost of taking steps to prevent that injury. Adding additional features to a product would increase its cost. Given that the product is sold for a particular price which takes into account its features, is it reasonable to impose a duty on the manufacturer to include additional features, not bargained for, in the product?\n\nA court is unlikely to find that Apple is under a duty to include all possible battery\\-preserving features in its phone, thereby prohibiting the sale of phones at a particular price point.\n\nDetermining a negligence case requires the court to create social policy by drawing lines between, say, failing to put a fence at the edge of a cliff and digging the ground out from under someone near a cliffface. Is a failure to implement battery\\-maximising features the same as crippling a battery? Given that the starting point, historically, is a battery that is naively used, and 50% charge (etc) is an innovation that was added later, a court is unlikely to hold that Apple is somehow 'crippling' their batteries by not including batter\\-maximising features.\n\n**Consumer guarantees (fitness for purpose)**\n\nSome jurisdictions have consumer protection laws which include what the Australian legislation calls 'consumer guarantees', which are rules that a person supplying goods or services to a consumer must comply with. One such guarantee is fitness for purpose.\n\nWhat is the purpose of a laptop? Is a laptop totally useless if its battery will stop working at some point?\n\nAt one end, a laptop with a battery that never works does not serve the purpose of a laptop. At the other extreme, a laptop with a battery that dies after 100 years would nonetheless serve most people's purposes.\n\nHow long must the battery last? How long is a piece of string?\n\nConsumer guarantee legislation will sometimes specify factors for determining how long the piece of string is. These factors include price and any statements made by the consumer to the supplier about what they intend to use the product for.\n\nApple laptops are expensive but that is because they have a divinely\\-inspired aesthetic. After accounting for the divinely\\-inspired aesthetic, it is not surprising that there is no money left for battery\\-maximising features.\n\nA court is unlikely to conclude that the purpose of an Apple laptop requires the battery to last for the same period as a Thinkpad.\n\nTo put it another way, the rule about fitness for purpose is about fitness for purpose. There is no rule that any product must be state of the art.\n\n**Fraud**\n\nIf Apple said 'This battery will last for 300 cycles' and they knew that the battery would not, then that might be fraud. If, however, Apple said 'this battery might last for 300 cycles' or 'in lab tests, similar batteries lasted for an average of 300 cycles' or didn't say anything at all, then there is no fraud.\n\nKnowing that something will cost someone money is not fraud.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer purchases a smartphone from manufacturer X. After 18 months of regular use, the battery life has significantly degraded, and the phone no longer lasts a full day on a single charge. The consumer claims that manufacturer X was negligent in not including advanced battery preservation features, such as limiting charging to 80% capacity. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the consumer's potential legal claim?\n\nA) The consumer has a strong case for negligence, as manufacturer X had a duty to implement all known battery preservation techniques.\n\nB) The consumer can easily prove fraud if the manufacturer advertised the battery life without mentioning potential degradation over time.\n\nC) The consumer has a valid claim under consumer guarantee laws, as the phone is clearly not fit for its intended purpose after 18 months.\n\nD) The consumer is unlikely to succeed in a negligence claim, as courts generally do not impose a duty on manufacturers to include all possible battery-preserving features in their products.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. Courts are unlikely to find that manufacturers have a duty to include all possible battery-preserving features in their products. The law recognizes that products come in various qualities and standards, and there is no obligation for every product to implement state-of-the-art technology. Courts consider factors such as the cost of implementing additional features and the overall price point of the product. Additionally, the starting point for battery technology historically did not include advanced preservation techniques, so courts are unlikely to view the absence of such features as 'crippling' the battery. While consumers may desire longer-lasting batteries, the legal standard for negligence or fitness for purpose does not typically extend to requiring manufacturers to implement every possible battery-saving feature."

How often do two circuit courts issue contradictory legal opinion (my layman's understanding is that they would tend to use the earlier opinion as precedent, so that shouldn't happen too often?)\n2. If that happens, and Supreme Court doesn't get involved in the issue \\- for example by refusing to hear either of the two cases \\- what happens then with the issue as far as subsequent cases arising in legal system?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How often do circuit splits arise?\n==================================\n\nThe number of currently outstanding circuit conflicts on legal questions is probably in the range of many dozen on the low end and several hundred to several thousand on the high end. New circuit splits arise somewhere on some issue many times each year.\n\nIt is difficult to quantify this because there are lots of subtle differences of wording or application of the law between circuits that ordinarily are not considered circuit conflicts but could lead to a different result under some highly unusual set of facts. Establishing the existence of a circuit conflict, and becoming familiar with the conflicts that are most promising to see resolved, is one of the particular skills of lawyers who practice before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIt is also worth noting that state courts can also enunciate questions of federal law that are presented to them without regard to the rule adopted by the federal circuit in which they are located (federal courts in U.S. territories and possessions are bound by the precedents of their federal circuit on questions of federal law). So, there are 50 states and each of the 13 federal circuits (1\\-11, DC and Federal) which are directly subordinate to the U.S. Supreme Court and could take a position on a question of federal law that could conflict with another jurisdiction leading to a split of authority that can only be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWhat happens when a circuit split is not resolved?\n==================================================\n\nWhen a circuit split is not resolved courts in each circuit follow the precedents set by their particular circuit. Meanwhile, trial courts and appellate courts in circuits that have not taken a position in the circuit split give particularly careful and reasoned consideration to which side the court should take in an undecided circuit as a matter of first impression.\n\nUnresolved circuit splits are not uncommon and can last for decades on issues that the U.S. Supreme Court deems unimportant.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A circuit split has occurred between the 9th and 11th Circuit Courts regarding the interpretation of a federal statute. The Supreme Court has declined to hear cases related to this split for the past 5 years. What is the most likely outcome for future cases involving this statute?\n\nA) All federal courts will be required to follow the 9th Circuit's interpretation.\nB) The circuit split will be automatically resolved in favor of whichever interpretation was issued first.\nC) Federal courts in the 9th and 11th Circuits will follow their respective interpretations, while other circuits will carefully consider both interpretations when the issue arises.\nD) The statute will be considered unenforceable until the Supreme Court resolves the split.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: When a circuit split occurs and the Supreme Court does not resolve it, each circuit continues to follow its own precedent. In this case, the 9th and 11th Circuits would continue to apply their respective interpretations of the statute. Other circuits that haven't yet ruled on the issue would carefully consider both interpretations when confronted with a related case, potentially choosing one side or developing their own interpretation. This situation can persist for years or even decades if the Supreme Court considers the issue unimportant or chooses not to address it. Option C accurately reflects this reality, while the other options present incorrect outcomes that do not align with how the federal court system handles unresolved circuit splits."

It seems the view expressed boils down to \"An MOU is not a contract/binding agreement\".\n\nA senior negotiator responded asserting that an MOU IS an actual contract. Commentators poked fun at the head\\-of\\-state \"not knowing that an MOU is an agreement\".\n\nMy belief loosely mirrored those expressed of the head\\-of\\-state's \\- ie that an MOU is more of a \"guidance document\" from which contracts/agreements follow. I expect a court might consider it as part of a understanding larger picture of an unclear agreement, but that an MOU is not a reliable legal document, often falling short of an agreement and are not binding to anything like the same extent that a contract is. \n\n(To the extent anyone may be aware of the specific MOU controversy in question, I do not believe that an MOU is meaningless, rather that it is an imprecise document with very limited enforce\\-ability. I do accept that the contents of the MOU make all the difference and some may be more enforceable then others depending the extent to which they contain all the elements of a contract) \n\nSo 2 questions \\- \n\n1.

Both Georgia (under Georgia Code 16-3-23) and Indiana (under Indiana Code 35-41-3-2) have laws that provide a defense for occupants who use force against what they reasonably believe to be an unlawful entry, even if it turns out to be a legal no-knock police raid.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer discovers that a vendor has mishandled their credit card information by scanning a hand-written order form with a personal smartphone and sending it via unencrypted email. The customer wants to take action against the vendor for violating PCI-DSS regulations. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the customer's options?\n\nA) The customer can successfully sue the vendor for violating PCI-DSS regulations, even without incurring actual damages.\n\nB) The customer should report the vendor to federal authorities, as PCI-DSS compliance is mandated by federal law.\n\nC) The customer's best course of action is to report the noncompliance to the relevant card brands, such as Visa.\n\nD) The customer can issue a legally binding cease and desist order to the vendor for violating PCI-DSS regulations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most accurate statement is option C. According to the information provided, PCI-DSS is not required by federal law, and legal action without actual damages is unlikely to succeed. However, card brands like Visa have the ability to enforce merchant obligations related to credit card processing. Reporting the noncompliance to these card brands is likely the most effective way for the customer to address the issue. Option A is incorrect because legal action without damages is unlikely to succeed. Option B is wrong because PCI-DSS is not mandated by federal law. Option D is incorrect because a customer cannot issue a legally binding cease and desist order in this situation."

I understand how one person can be charged with multiple offences for the same crime (because both can be proved to a jury), but how does this work with the conviction? Does the principle of *ne bis in idem* apply?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sentences will be imposed for all three crimes (in eight weeks following preparation of a pre\\-sentence report, briefing and a sentencing hearing), but because they arise out of the same incident, will be served concurrently. Thus, one year in prison counts against the up to 40 years on the first count, the up to 25 years on the second count, and the up to 10 years on the third count, that is imposed.\n\nIn practice, the longest sentence (usually, but not necessarily the charge with the longest authorized sentence) is really the only one that matters if all three charges survive appeal. But separate sentences are important to determine what sentence is left in force if one or two, but not all three charges, are reversed on appeal. Since different charges have different elements that have to be proved, the possibility that some but not all charges could be reversed on appeal is a distinct possibility.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the case of Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of multiple charges for the same crime, how are the sentences typically handled and why is it important to have separate sentences for each charge?\n\nA) The sentences are always served consecutively, with the defendant serving the full term for each charge one after another.\n\nB) Only the longest sentence is applied, and the other charges are dismissed upon conviction.\n\nC) The sentences are served concurrently, with the longest sentence effectively determining the time served, but separate sentences are maintained for each charge.\n\nD) The jury decides which single charge should be applied for sentencing, disregarding the others.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, when a defendant is convicted of multiple charges for the same crime, the sentences are typically served concurrently. This means that one year in prison counts towards all the sentences simultaneously. However, it's crucial to maintain separate sentences for each charge for several reasons:\n\n1. If some charges are reversed on appeal while others are upheld, the remaining sentences will still be in effect.\n2. Different charges have different maximum sentences, so keeping them separate ensures the appropriate range for each offense is considered.\n3. It provides a more comprehensive record of the conviction, reflecting the full extent of the criminal act as determined by the jury.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the sentences are not served consecutively in this case. Option B is wrong because all charges are maintained, not just the longest one. Option D is incorrect because the jury does not decide on sentencing or which charge to apply; they only determine guilt, and the judge handles sentencing based on all convictions."

Trademark law primarily concerns the use of marks in commerce or in ways that might confuse consumers about the source of goods or services. In this context, users mentioning trademarked names in game cards for personal use is unlikely to infringe on trademark rights. The app is not using these marks commercially or in a way that suggests endorsement. However, while not strictly necessary, it may be prudent for the developer to include terms of service that prohibit users from using the app to infringe on intellectual property rights, which can help protect the developer from potential legal issues."

Both twins had means, motive, and opportunity for the murder.\n\nIt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that one of them committed the crime. A witness actually saw one of the twins stab someone, to death but he can't tell which one. The knife has been found, and has the twins' DNA on it. Of course, their DNA is identical, so it is evidence that one of them did it, but tells us nothing about which one. Neither twin has been able to establish an alibi.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that a conviction is impossible, because either twin could argue that the other did it? What if one twin established an alibi, would that be sufficient to convict the other?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A conviction isn't ever impossible, but it could well be highly unjust. Indeed, there is a [current case](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-identical-twins-murder-confession-met-20160922-story.html) where a man alleged that he was the murder, though his identical twin brother was convicted. [This article](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2012/07/05/gr.136598.111) indicates that identical twins are not necessarily genetically indistinguishable. Assuming there is a lack of positive evidence such as fingerprints or an alibi which clearly identifies one versus the other, then one would predict no conviction because there would be a highly reasonable doubt. See the case of [Orlando Nemnhard](http://www.maricopacountyattorney.org/pdfs/news-releases/2011-08-19-Chandler-Homicide-involving-twin-suspects.pdf), where one of two twins did it but the DA concluded that they couldn't prove which one, so the charges were dropped.",

While a conviction in such a case is not impossible, it would be extremely challenging due to the presence of reasonable doubt. The scenario presents a situation where it's difficult to definitively prove which twin committed the crime, even with DNA evidence. This aligns with real-world cases mentioned in the documentation, such as the Orlando Nemnhard case, where charges were dropped due to the inability to prove which twin was responsible.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while difficult, a conviction is not impossible. There could be other forms of evidence or circumstances that might lead to a conviction.\n\nOption B is incorrect because establishing an alibi for one twin doesn't automatically convict the other. While it would strengthen the case against the other twin, prosecutors would still need to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nOption D is incorrect because DNA evidence alone, especially when it matches both twins, is not sufficient for conviction. It proves that one of them was involved but doesn't distinguish between the two.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the complexity of such cases in the legal system, where the standard of \"beyond reasonable doubt\" plays a crucial role in determining convictions."

However, I was wondering if this applies to crimes committed before the limitation act was passed.\n\nIn other words, if I had committed a fraudulent breach of trust in 1975; could be taken to court in 2017?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Limitations Act of 1980 and its predecessors apply to civil actions brought by private individuals. It is not a criminal statute of limitations. I will answer with regard to civil cases, rather than criminal ones.\n\n[Section 40 of the Limitations Act of 1980](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/40) incorporates by reference a [schedule of transition provisions](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/schedule/2) that govern this question, and when a cause of action is not governed by the 1980 Act it usually defaults to the predecessor 1939 Act.\n\nThe problem is both bigger than just the fraudulent breach of trust unlimited statute of limitations under Section 21 of the Act, since the deadline only runs from when an action accrues that can be long after the act giving rise to the claim actually happened, and smaller, because the act (and [also its predecessor 1939 act](https://www.aplf.org/time_limitations_in_pursuit_of_damages_ukeurope/index.html)) allow statutes of limitations to be extended for equitable reasons under certain circumstances. \n\nThe [1881 Limitations Act, Section 27](http://moj.gov.jm/sites/default/files/laws/Limitation%20of%20Actions%20Act.pdf) had an exception to the general rule for concealed fraud tolling the statute so long as it was concealed, which probably carried over into the 1939 Act.\n\nSection 9 of the transition provisions states in the relevant part that:\n\n> (1\\)Nothing in any provision of this Act shall\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a)enable any action to be brought which was barred by this Act or (as\n>  the case may be) by the Limitation Act 1939 before the relevant date;\n\nThe [1939 Act limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitation_Act_1939) ran from when the act was committed, not when it was discovered, until the [1963 Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitation_Act_1963) changes that.\n\nA full analysis of the breach of trust issue is found [in this law review article](https://academic.oup.com/tandt/article-abstract/23/5/527/3868255/Statutory-limitation-periods-for-claims-related-to?redirectedFrom=fulltext).",

Based on the information provided about the Limitation Act 1980 and its predecessors, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the possibility of bringing this action?\n\nA) The action can definitely be brought because the Limitation Act 1980 allows for fraudulent breach of trust to be prosecuted at any time.\n\nB) The action is barred because the Limitation Act 1939 would apply, and it ran from when the act was committed, not when it was discovered.\n\nC) The action can likely be brought due to the concealed fraud exception that existed in previous acts and was likely carried over.\n\nD) The action is definitely barred because more than 40 years have passed since the act was committed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the Limitation Act 1980 does allow for fraudulent breach of trust to be prosecuted at any time, this question deals with an act committed before the 1980 Act was passed. The 1939 Act would typically apply in this case, which ran from when the act was committed. However, the 1881 Limitations Act had an exception for concealed fraud, tolling the statute as long as it was concealed. This exception likely carried over into subsequent acts. Given that the fraud was only discovered in 2017, this concealed fraud exception would likely apply, allowing the action to be brought.

According to the documentation, obligations remain between the customer and the original company (Company A) unless there is a merger or a specific contract altering this arrangement.

Even if Company A no longer exists as an operating business, it may still be legally responsible for its prior commitments.

It's entirely possible for a work of fiction to be written by \"Jay Wood\" the author and stares a seperate person named \"Jay Wood\" as the lead actor, who just happens to land the lead role. Even fictional names are not protected as Anakin and Kal\\-el (or Kalel) are both names of people in the United States that were specifically introduced by fiction (On the Superman note, the name of Supergirl \"Kara\" was a Hebrew name but wasn't popularly used until after Supergirl's first issue appeared on comic stands).\n\nOne possible source of confusion is that in the U.S., Movie and TV actors will frequently take stage names because the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) has a specific rule that no members can have the same name, and one's name in film credits will be your SAG name as it appears on your membership card (or whatever they use). So if \"Jay Wood\" is a SAG actor, then you cannot be a second \"Jay Wood\" in SGA. Though the rules are specifically say \"No more than two Jay Woods\" so you can be \"Jay A. Wood\" or \"J. Wood\" or \"Jay Wood Jr\" without any issue. One of the more fun examples is that the guy who played Marty McFly in back to the future, Michael J. Fox, took his name to distinguish himself from another SAG member named Michael Fox. What does the \"J.\" stand for? Andrew! Michael J. Fox realized that he could use his legal name if he included an initial, but since his real middle name is Andrew, this would mean he'd be billed in all films and tv shows as \"Michael A. Fox\" and realized that it would get some snickers thrown his way. J rhymes with A and was available in the format, so that's why we have Michael J. Fox. It's also why most actresses will never \"take\" their husbands name as far as the public is aware. If they were SAG before marriage, they will still appear with SGA credits on their post\\-nuptial films, and would have to do promotions under that name. They may change their name and legally answer with their husband's sir name for all legal purposes. She might be Sarah Michelle Geller on all Buffy The Vampire Credits, but it's possible the actress by that name is legally Sarah Michelle Prince (married Freddie Prince Jr.) and would use that name at the bank or on her tax forms. It also affords some privacy as she would never advertise this to the public so legal documents requiring her legal name will slip past the Hollywood reporters looking for court documents on famous people in the court systems.",

Authors are free to use pen names, even if they match existing trademarks or celebrity names, as long as they're not attempting to impersonate someone else or cause deliberate confusion. The restrictions mentioned for the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) only apply to members of that organization for acting credits, not to authors using pen names. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the author can freely use \"Jay Wood\" as a pen name, regardless of existing trademarks or celebrities, as long as they're not trying to impersonate someone else."

Option C is correct because simply changing prices to align with competitors, without evidence of collusion or prior agreement, is generally not considered a violation of competition law. This practice is often referred to as \"conscious parallelism\" and is typically legal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mere fact of matching competitors' prices doesn't necessarily indicate illegal price fixing. There needs to be evidence of an agreement or concerted practice.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the legality doesn't depend on all competitors raising prices by the exact same percentage. Companies can independently decide to match or approximate competitors' prices.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the relationship to inflation is not a determining factor in whether this practice violates competition law. The focus is on whether there was an agreement between competitors, not on the specific amount of the increase."

This immediately made me suspicious, and when I asked for more information, they simply stated that they could not give me any more information. I told them that the person they were looking for was not available, and they stated that they would call back later. Before I could tell them not to, they had hung up. I looked up the company, and found that they are a debt collection agency, and on their website, it states that \n\n> This communication is from a debt collector, and is an attempt to collect a debt. Any information obtained will be used for that purpose.\n\nAs far as I am aware, if it is a debt collection agency calling, don't they have to inform of this, before I tell them any information? There is not automated message that states this, and it is from a different number each day.\n\nThe reason I am certain that it is a debt collection agency calling, is because the person that they are looking for, has told me about debts that they have, and have received letters attempting to collect a debt.\n\nWhat steps can I take in this situation to either prevent them from calling, or have them at least let me know who they are?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: They don't have to inform you that they are a debt collector. Because that can be a violation of [15 U.S.C. Section 1692b(2\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1692b) by exposing that the person they are attempting to collect from has a debt.

Section 1692b(3\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1692b). Also, send them a notice in the mail. If they continue to attempt to contact you, report them to the FTC. You **may** also be entitled to monetary damages as well. See [FTC](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0149-debt-collection)\n\n> The judge can require the debt collector to pay you up to $1,000, even if you can\u2019t prove that you suffered actual damages.

The Employee Polygraph Protection Act (29 USC Ch. 22) generally prohibits private employers from requiring polygraph tests. However, there are specific exemptions to this law, and security firms are one of the categories explicitly mentioned as being exempt. This means that while the employee can refuse to take the test, the employer is within their rights to require it as a condition of continued employment. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because polygraph tests are not universally prohibited in employment settings; there are specific exemptions.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the employer's request is likely legal due to the exemption for security firms.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the request may be in the employment contract, federal regulations still apply and the employee has the right to refuse (though refusal may have employment consequences).\n\nThis question tests understanding of the nuances in employment law regarding polygraph tests, including the general prohibition, specific exemptions, and the implications of those exemptions for both employers and employees."

The matter of intent, in any event, is for a court to decide (if the prosecutor determines that the question should even be presented to a court). For example, someone seeking to rob a bank in a mask would probably fall afoul of this law, and it's not likely that using a mask of a political figure would enable a successful first\\-amendment defense.\n\nFor a political protestor, it could be easy to show that the intent was to make a political statement and not to conceal identity, in which case it would not be necessary to consider the constitutional question, for a critical element of the crime would be missing. That is, if you say \"I wasn't trying to hide my identity,\" and the court believes you, then you haven't violated the statute. That is a separate question from whether the statute is constitutional.\n\nFor the law itself to be unconstitutional, it would have to be unconstitutional in every application, generally.

The law itself is not necessarily unconstitutional on its face, as it has legitimate applications (such as preventing masked individuals from committing crimes). However, in the case of political protest, the application of the law becomes more complex.\n\nThe key factor here is the intent of the person wearing the mask.

The \"novel rule\" referred by Posner is:\n\n> If, then, the Courts are to regard the Constitution, and the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the Legislature, the Constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.\n\nBut how's Marshall's announcing this rule a \"**trick**\"? Marshall can't be blamed for the Judiciary Act of 1789's unconstitutionality ? If it were constitutional, then Marshall's rule WOULD apply. Thus this trick doesn't depend on Marshall. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here's how a court decision would normally go:\n\n> 1. Do we have jurisdiction?\n> \n> \n> \t* If no, terminate the case.\n> \t* If yes, proceed to step 2\\.\n> 2. Decide the case.\n\nHere's how the Marbury v. Madison decision went:\n\n> 1. Decide the case.\n> 2. Do we have jurisdiction?\n> \n> \n> \t* If no, we cannot implement the particular remedies, but the rulings on the constitution and law from step 1 are still binding.\n> \t* If yes, we implement the remedies, and everything's binding.\n\nIn other words, what the decision basically did was implicitly start with \"Suppose we had jurisdiction...\" and then drew a bunch of conclusions. They could review acts of Congress and declare laws unconstitutional (which was not an accepted power of the Supreme Court at the time; Jefferson thought this power should be the President's), even laws that had already been repealed. They could review (some) acts of the Executive branch, and force it to do (some) acts; in particular, they said they could serve a writ of mandamus to certain officers of the Executive branch. This was, again, not something that was accepted as a power of the Supreme Court before this decision.\n\nBut then they said \"But the assumption that we have jurisdiction is faulty, because we just declared the law that gave us the requisite original jurisdiction\u2014the case was filed directly to the Supreme Court and did not go through a lower court\u2014to be unconstitutional.\" Thus the court would not actually force anyone's hand: Madison would not, in fact, be ordered to deliver Marbury's commission. This is important because Jefferson had a very adversarial attitude towards the Court, and was extremely likely to completely ignore any attempts by the Court to force the Executive branch to do anything. Doing so risked neutering the powers of the Judicial branch, and maybe worse. Similarly, that the decision struck down a law that was already repealed meant the Court avoided angering Congress.\n\nMarshall had his cake, and ate it, too.",

Madison, Chief Justice John Marshall's decision is often described as a \"trick\" because:\n\nA) He declared the Judiciary Act of 1789 unconstitutional, thereby limiting the Supreme Court's own power.\n\nB) He established judicial review while avoiding direct conflict with the executive branch.\n\nC) He ruled in favor of Marbury's right to the commission but refused to issue a writ of mandamus.\n\nD) He reversed the normal order of addressing jurisdiction before deciding the merits of the case.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThe \"trick\" in Marshall's decision lies in option B. By establishing judicial review (the power to declare laws unconstitutional) while simultaneously avoiding a direct confrontation with President Jefferson's administration, Marshall managed to significantly expand the Supreme Court's power without risking its authority being challenged or ignored.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while Marshall did declare part of the Judiciary Act unconstitutional, this was not the core of the \"trick\" and actually served to expand judicial power overall.\n\nOption C is partially correct but doesn't capture the full strategic nature of Marshall's decision.\n\nOption D, while technically true, doesn't explain why this reversal was considered a \"trick\" or its broader implications.\n\nThe brilliance of Marshall's approach was that he asserted the Court's power to review and strike down laws (a novel concept at the time) in a way that didn't require immediate enforcement, thus avoiding a potential showdown with a hostile executive branch while setting a crucial precedent for future cases."

What should I do now?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Chapter VII of [The Aadhaar Act of 2016](https://uidai.gov.in/images/the_aadhaar_act_2016.pdf) specifies the punishments. Section 40 may be applicable:\n\n> Whoever, being a requesting entity, uses the identity information of\n>  an individual in contravention of sub\\-section (3\\) of section 8,\n>  shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to three\n>  years or with a fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees or, in\n>  the case of a company, with a fine which may extend to one lakh\n>  (100,000\\) rupees or with both.\n\nand sect. 41 similarly penalizes violation of 8(2\\) with a lesser prison term of 1 year.\n\nFrom the definitions in section (2\\),\n\n> \u201crequesting entity\u201d means an agency or person that submits \n>  the Aadhaar number, and demographic information or biometric\n>  information, of an individual to the Central Identities Data\n>  Repository for authentication\n\nSect. 8(2\\) requires that \n\n> A requesting entity shall\u2014(a) unless otherwise provided in this Act,\n>  obtain the consent of an individual before collecting his identity\n>  information for the purposes of authentication in such manner as may\n>  be specified by regulations; and (b) ensure that the identity \n>  information of an individual is only used for submission to the\n>  Central Identities Data Repository for authentication.\n\nand 8(3\\) requires that\n\n> A requesting entity shall inform, in such manner as may be specified\n>  by regulations, the individual submitting his identity information for\n>  authentication, the following details with respect to authentication,\n>  namely:\u2014 (a) the nature of information that may be shared upon\n>  authentication; (b) the uses to which the information received during\n>  authentication may be put by the requesting entity; and (c)\n>  alternatives to submission of identity information to the requesting\n>  entity.\n\nNote that a \"requesting entity\" is technically one who submits card data to CIDR for authentication, and there is no guarantee that the suspected copier did so. \nThere do not seem to be any general restrictions on civilian use of the card, for example there seems to be no law prohibiting a person from requesting a copy of the card and not actually submitting the information to CIDR.\n\nYou are entitled to know about authentication requests, if any were made:\n\n> 32.

I do not know if filing a police complaint would be effective. I take it that businesses are using the card informally as identification without the step of authentication.",

In the case of a company, the fine can extend up to 100,000 rupees. The correct answer is D, which includes both the individual and company punishments.

You can use the inline format:\n\n```\n![Text](https://stackoverflow.com/image.jpg)\n\n```\n\nOr you can click the \"Image\" icon in the toolbar, and paste the link there. This latter method will result in the image being uploaded to imgur and the link to that site included in the post, while the former method will result in a hotlink to the original site.\n\nFrom [these](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5089/can-you-be-accused-of-hotlinking-copyright-violation-if-you-use-an-iframe) [two](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38575/who-is-infringing-copyright-when-hotlinking-is-involved) questions it seems like hotlinking is generally safe from a copyright perspective. I would assume that uploading an image to a third party site would very much not be safe, as it is clearly causing a copy to be made.\n\nThe example that prompted this question was [this post](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/101765/what-is-the-weight-percentage-of-all-people-as-compared-to-all-natural-life/101770#101770), where the results of two papers are discussed with reference to the figures from the paper. I would have thought that with hotlinking it is used exactly in line with the aims of the site, to stimulate discussion of the issues raised in the paper with reference to the results. I would not expect anything to happen in this case, but academic publishers have been quite defensive about their intellectual property and I would expect them to have a case if they complained about the reupload of the images to imgur.\n\nWhat are the legal considerations here? Should we all be avoiding the \"Image\" icon in the toolbar unless we have the right to make copies of any included images? Is there a copyright exception that allows reupload of images available on the web? Is there something else that make this OK? Or is even hotlinking copyright breach and so no images should be included unless we have the right to make copies?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ahem, questions about \"should\" are requests for legal advice, so I assume you did not ask what should be done, instead you asked what the law is. The main legal consideration regards [\"fair use\"](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info). This is a canonical instance of fair use. This (the first graphic) use does not undercut the copyright holder's financial benefit (the article is not even behind a paywall), and the purpose of including the graphic is \"for comment\", which is why the fair use exception exists. The authors, who retain copyright, are not exactly clear on the license under which the article is released, but one of those links points to CC BY\\-NC\\-ND 4\\.0, which says that this is *not* a licensed use. So the cited post would have to rely on a fair use defense, in case the authors decide to sue.\n\nIt is also true that the graphic could have equivalently been presented via a [hotlink](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/25/6506/F1.large.jpg), but that method is much less effective. That does not change the legal situation.",

Hotlinking images directly from academic papers for the purpose of commentary or discussion on a Q&A site like Stack Exchange may often fall under fair use. This is because it doesn't create a new copy, and it's being used for educational or commentary purposes, which are key factors in fair use consideration.\n\nHowever, uploading images to a third-party site like Imgur (as happens when using the \"Image\" icon) creates a new copy of the image. This action carries more legal risk because it involves reproducing the copyrighted work without explicit permission. While fair use might still apply in some cases, the creation of a new copy makes it harder to justify under fair use doctrine.\n\nOption A is incorrect because hotlinking isn't always safe, and uploading isn't always a violation - it depends on the specific circumstances.\n\nOption B oversimplifies the issue by treating hotlinking and uploading as equally safe, which isn't accurate given the different legal implications of each method.\n\nOption C is incorrect because uploading to Imgur is generally riskier from a copyright perspective than hotlinking, not safer."

A court might order X to do something if Y petitions, but X is notified of the proceeding to which they are a party, and X will (should) object to the petition on the grounds that the petitioned relief is impossible or imposes an extreme burden on them. If, having objected that it is impossible to comply the court still orders you to do the impossible, you have to appeal the ruling. Ultimately the Supreme Court may order you to squeeze blood from a stone, and there is nothing practical that you can do \u2013 you must do the impossible, or suffer the consequences. However, courts do not order people to squeeze blood from a stone.\n\nA government agency may make such a demand, with minimal opportunity for you to object. Your recourse is very similar to the case where a party petitions the court to order you to do something. A law may exist whereby an agency is authorized to \"order\" a person to act in a certain way: there may be a requirement for a hearing, or you may have to sue the agency to overrule their demand. It is possible that you can appeal agency\\-internally that it is impossible, or too burdensome, to comply, or you may have to make that argument in court. It is usually best to persuade the agency that they are asking the impossible, since the courts tend to defer to government agencies that issue orders, unless your case is particularly egregious.\n\n\"It would be inconvenient for us\" is generally not a viable defense.

You also have no way of ever contacting them again, as their email address was single\\-use just for this job and they'll never access it again.\n\nWould this violate any laws? Does it matter if you pay them as an individual or as a business entity? For the sake of this question assume that the person/entity paying is located in the US.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You cannot do this legally\n==========================\n\nGeneral rules\n-------------\n\nUnder US law you are required to file a [Form 1099](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc) with the IRS for this payment if it was for a trade or business purpose. ( $1,000\\.00 is above the current reporting limit of $600\\.) This you cannot do without the recipient's name (personal or business) and address. You will also need their SSN or TIN. Failure to file the 1099 may be a violation of law.\n\nPrivate people, as well as businesses, get 1099s which are also filed with the IRS. I myself have received 1099s as a private individual for freelance work.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It is possible to avoid trademarks by changing them slightly, such as replacing words if a name is a combination of multiple common language words? I have seen various media (video games, films) re\\-using names from other media and changing words of such names. (Them call this as \"pop culture references\". And the owners/creators of such media don't disclose if they have gotten authorization to do this).\n\nExample of a such change: \"Blackrock\" to \"Bluerock\" or similar.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The legal standard, evaluated on a case by case basis, when one firm uses a trademark that is similar to another firm's trademarks to market its goods or services in the same industry is whether the trademark is \"confusingly similar\" and in some cases whether it \"dilutes\" the first in time famous trademark.\n\nMany people writing fictional media, or making academic hypotheticals, make changes to an existing famous mark along the lines of those described in the question, in the hope of making a popular culture reference, while avoiding a feared exposure to trademark infringement and defamation liability. But that fear is mostly misguided.\n\nA trademark is not a right to have monopoly use of the mark in writing or other media. \"[Nominative use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_use)\" of a mark is legal and does not expose the person making nominative use of a mark to liability.\n\nWhat is prohibited is using the protected mark to market goods or services in commerce, in a market where the trademark one fears being infringed currently exists and is being used to market goods or services of that trademark owner, to give the false impression of an association, affiliation, or endorsement by the trademark owner.\n\nThe gravamen of a trademark infringement lawsuit is fraud and deception perpetrated on consumers to the detriment of the trademark owner. This is almost never a real risk in a fictional work.\n\nTo the extent that there is a legal concern at all about distinguishing a fictional firm from a real one, the bigger legal exposure is to defamation liability.\n\nIn other words, the bigger concern is the risk that the fictional work is viewed as making a thinly veiled false factual statement about the real world firm that damages its reputation (e.g. if it were to depict a fictional analogy of the real world firm \"Taco Bell\" making tacos out of horse meat as the real world firm has often, falsely, been accused of doing in real life because its prices are so low).",

Bluerock Industries is portrayed in the game as engaging in questionable environmental practices. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal issues?\n\nA) The video game company is likely to face a successful trademark infringement lawsuit from Blackrock, Inc. due to the similarity in names.\n\nB) The video game company is at high risk of a defamation lawsuit, but not trademark infringement, due to the negative portrayal of the fictional company.\n\nC) The video game company is unlikely to face any legal issues as long as they include a disclaimer stating that all companies in the game are fictional.\n\nD) The video game company might face some risk of a defamation claim, but is unlikely to be liable for trademark infringement given the context of use.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate based on the information provided. The use of a similar name in a fictional context is unlikely to constitute trademark infringement, as it's not being used to market competing goods or services in a way that could confuse consumers. This falls more under \"nominative use\" or a pop culture reference.\n\nHowever, there is some risk of a defamation claim if the portrayal of \"Bluerock Industries\" could be reasonably interpreted as making false factual statements about the real Blackrock, Inc. that damage its reputation. This risk exists even with the name change, as the similarities in business model and structure might make it a \"thinly veiled\" reference.\n\nOption A is incorrect because trademark infringement typically requires use in commerce to market goods/services, which isn't the case here. Option B overstates the defamation risk while incorrectly dismissing trademark concerns. Option C is overly simplistic; a mere disclaimer doesn't automatically protect against all legal issues."

Obviously I don't think it's very likely that a landlord would forego an entire lease worth of rent instead of pro\\-rating, but landlords can be sleazy and weird. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The key here is the provision \"through no fault of his own\". A landlord who relies on this provision would need to be able to demonstrate what the cause of the delay was, and that s/he had not been reasonably able to avoid it. Nor could a landlord simply fail to take steps to repair the problem, whatever it might be. If the problem will clearly take more than 30 days to fix (Isay the building burned down), the prospective tenant would have the right to cancel the lease at once. True, in such a case the tenant would be put to the trouble and expense of finding another place at short notice, but then the landlord would have lost his income from the property. The provision allocates the losses between the parties in such a case.\n\nIf the property is not available at the specified time for the lease to start, but could be available a few days later, the quoted provision would not allow the landlord to just ignore the situation and end the lease. The landlord is allowed only a \"reasonable time\" to fix the problem, and taking significantly longer than is needed would not be \"reasonable\".",

On the day John is supposed to move in, Sarah informs him that the property isn't ready due to unexpected plumbing issues. After 25 days, the property is still not ready, and Sarah has not provided any updates or taken visible steps to address the problem. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this situation?\n\nA) Sarah can unilaterally terminate the lease after 30 days without any consequences, as long as she never delivers the premises to John.\n\nB) John can terminate the lease immediately, as Sarah has not shown reasonable efforts to deliver the property within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nC) Sarah is obligated to provide pro-rated rent abatement for the 25 days, and this constitutes full settlement of all damages caused by the delay.\n\nD) As long as Sarah can prove the initial delay was not her fault, she can continue to delay delivering the premises for up to 30 days without any obligation to John.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While the lease allows for a reasonable time to deliver possession, Sarah's lack of communication and apparent inaction for 25 days would likely be considered unreasonable. The provision requires that the delay be \"through no fault of his own,\" and the landlord must make reasonable efforts to resolve the issue. Sarah's failure to provide updates or take visible steps to address the problem over such an extended period suggests she is not meeting this obligation. Therefore, John would likely have grounds to terminate the lease before the 30-day mark due to Sarah's unreasonable delay and lack of effort to resolve the situation."

That seems highly unlikely to me; surely if an on\\-duty, not undercover cop saw for example a stash of illegal weapons in the open trunk of a car, with the criminal sleeping inside it, they would be obligated to act?\n\nMy suspicion is this: there isn't really a point where they're no longer allowed to use discretion. More likely, I think they always possess discretion and duty at the same time; they have a duty to stop crime to the best of their power, and they have the discretion to decide whether they're capable of stopping the crime at that point with more benefit than loss. No matter the situation, they technically possess the right to deem the situation too *something* to not intervene; their duty lies in making that judgement earnestly.\n\nWhich is where the practical line between discretion and duty comes in: as said, I think they probably exist at the same time, but certain situations are of a nature that it becomes clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer did not exercise their discretion earnestly. In these cases, they would face reprecussions not because they used a discretion that they didn't have, but rather because they **clearly** violated their duty to use that discretion earnestly. In the kinds of situations where e.g. a criminal is aiming a gun at someone, a cop may decide to not intervene due to their tactical/psychological/whatever judgement of the situation/criminal telling them that intervention would be more likely to cause more harm, and thus I expect a lot of violent situations to fall on the discretion side of this line. So, then the questions arise:\n\n1. Does such a line exist, and if so, what does (if anything) the law say about it?\n2. How is this line evaluated in practice?\n\n---\n\nI'm interested in the US jurisdiction. Someone mentioned that this depends extremely on the particulars of the situation. I'm more looking for an overview of the categories of situations that are usually treated as an \"officer's discretion rules\" versus the categories of situations where this isn't the case.\n\nTo aid in this, I'd like answers containing constructed scenarios (like my example of the criminal sleeping in his gun\\-loaded car) where discretion practically doesn't rule (*practically doesn't rule* in the sense I described above), and constructed scenarios where discretion definitely rules, and lastly, the constructed scenarios where it very much falls in a gray area that needs to be scrutinized due to a high contingency on the particular detials.\n\nOf course, the constructed scenarios could be replaced with real\\-life cases.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is an important distinction between moral duty and legal obligation. Even if an officer should arrest a person, given some moral standard, they are not legally obligated to do so. A test for legal obligation is whether an choice results in a negative legal outcome \u2013 is the officer sued or criminally penalized for acting or not acting? Unsurprisingly, the answer to the legal question is highly dependent on jurisdiction. I only consider US jurisdiction here (which incidently is not a single coherent jurisdiction, it is a phylum of jurisdictions), though some aspects of the answer extend to other countries.\n\nThe clearest cases are obligations to not act in a certain way \u2013 prohibitions. Police may not beat a suspect in order to obtain information. Period, end of story, no discretion. There is a putative bright line that police cannot cross, namely violating an individual's rights, and that constitutes a major exception to the doctrine of police immunity. If X is a clearly established right, police cannot violate that right and if they do, they can be sued or even prosecuted. Sometimes courts \"discover\" a particular right in a certain case, so the individual (plaintiff in a civil case) may be vindicated but the officer will not be subject to legal sanctions, since LEOs are not held to be appellate court justices who can divine the future discover of a legal right. [18 USC 242](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/242) statutorily describes certain circumstances where a choice is criminally proscribed, and [42 USC 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) allows for civil suits. This pertains to things that an officer does, saying what an officer does not legally have the discretion to perform an act.\n\nNow setting aside proscriptions where \"you may not...\", the doctrine of sovereign immunity prohibits civil or criminal actions against the government (including LEOs) unless a specific exception has been carved out. I recommend [this (open access) journal issue](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol47/iss4/) on Discretion in Law Enforcement. There do exist statutory obligations to act imposed on LEOs, for example see [this AG legal opinion](http://www.myfloridalegal.com/ago.nsf/Opinions/85E4F114E318503185256570006E05B3) from Florida, stating that\n\n> A law enforcement officer, including a police officer, has a legal\n> duty to provide aid to ill, injured, and distressed persons who are\n> not in police custody during an emergency whether the law enforcement\n> officer is on\\-duty or acting in a law enforcement capacity off\\-duty.\n\nA famous case regarding (non)liability for police inaction is [Castle Rock v. Gonzales](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/04pdf/04-278.pdf). In this case, police declined to enforce a Temporary restraining order (TRO) against plaintiff's estranged husband (who then murdered the children). The Supreme Court observes that\n\n> the Due Process Clause does not \u201crequir\\[e] the State to protect the\n> life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by\n> private actors\u201d\n\nand also noted the lack of express statutory obligation to enforce that law. In [Everton v. Willard](https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/supreme-court/1985/63440-0.html), the Florida Supreme Court addressed the question of whether\n\n> discretionary police power authority to make or not make an arrest and\n> whether a decision not to take an individual into custody constitutes\n> a basic judgmental or decision\\-making function that is immune from\n> tort liability\n\nand they do\n\n> hold that the decision of whether to enforce the law by making an\n> arrest is a basic judgmental or discretionary governmental function\n> that is immune from suit, regardless of whether the decision is made\n> by the officer on the street, by his sergeant, lieutenant or captain,\n> or by the sheriff or chief of police\n\nThere have been disagreements on sovereign immunity, for example [Huhn v. Dixie Insurance Co.](https://casetext.com/case/huhn-v-dixie-ins-co), 453 So. 2d 70, which held that\n\n> when an individual suffers a direct, personal injury proximately\n> caused by the negligence of a municipal employee while acting within\n> the scope of his employment, the injured individual is entitled to\n> redress for the wrong done\n\n(the relevant action was not arresting a person for DUI).\n\nAs employees of the government, LEOs are subject to the over\\-arching rules of their employer. They may be ordered by their superiors to refrain from arresting a law\\-breaker during a riot, on the grounds that doing so will exacerbate a tense situation. The police department might be sued for such a decision, but it is unlikely that the government will be held liable for an essentially political decision. Likewise, enforcement of \"no public camping\" laws is highly variable, and the courts will most likely not sanction a city for not arresting homeless people who are camping on public property in violation of the law.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In 2018, Patreon removed content creator Carl Benjamin (Sargon of Akkad) from their platform over violations of their terms of service by using racial and homophobic slurs.\n\nRecently, calls seem to have emerged within Benjamin's fanbase for followers to pursue arbitration claims against Patreon over his removal. Claims have further been made that due to the specific way in which the Patreon terms of service are structured, dealing with a sufficiently large barrage of complaints would bankrupt Patreon, *even* if all the claims ultimately fail. In particular, I came across the following YouTube comment which sets out the specifics:\n\n> Patreon's ToS is a contract of adhesion. Non\\-negotiable.\n> \n> \n> Within that contract, two things were stipulated\u2014both the drafter of the contract (Patreon) and the user agreed: 1\\) that binding arbitration would be the method by which disputes were resolved, and 2\\) both parties waived their rights to legal action based on class grouping. Each complaint would be dealt with on an individual basis.\n> \n> \n> Under California law, any non\\-drafting party to a contract of adhesion who requests binding arbitration: 1\\) if an employee, is subject to a one time fee of $400; 2\\) if a consumer, is subject to a one time fee of $250\\.\n> \n> \n> All other costs of arbitration (est. $10,00 per complaint) are payable in advance by the drafting party. These costs are, under California law, unrecoverable. I believe if the deposit is not used in full by the arbitration process, they are entitled to a refund of the unspent money. But if they spend the entire thing and win, they can't recover their costs. The non\\-drafting party bears no financial liability beyond that initial one time payment of $250\\.\n> \n> \n> Patreon has already arguably violated its own contract by grouping the 72 plaintiffs into a class for the purpose of requesting emergency injunction against these arbitration requests. They should, by the terms of their own contract, have filed 72 separate motions for emergency injunctive relief.\n> \n> \n> It doesn't matter whether the arbitrations are decided in Patreon's favor. Their own contract requires that they address each complaint individually, and win or lose, foot the bill for the arbitration.\n> \n> \n> And here's the thing. Even if the abritrators are biased in Patreon's favor, they can't get around the law. All they can do is minimize the costs to Patreon by ruling early and in Patreon\u2019s favor. They can't eliminate the costs to Patreon, or order any plaintiff to reimburse Patreon for them.\n> \n> \n> It's literally the perfect Chinese finger trap.\n\n[![YouTube comment by user karen straughan setting out a legal argument that upcoming arbitration claims will bankrupt Patreon - full comment transcribed in question text](https://i.stack.imgur.com/v53vu.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/v53vu.png)\n\nAll of this seems believable enough, but I know better then to take a legal argument made in a YouTube comment at face value. Hence my questions here:\n\n1. Do Patreon's terms of service cause Patreon to lose a minimum sum of money to arbitration costs in all cases, even if the claim is immediately rejected?\n2. If yes, is Patreon required to go through full arbitration for each individual claim made? Or is there some mechanism to avoid additional costs for subsequent claims that are essentially identical to one that was already decided?\n3. If yes, roughly what number of plaintiffs would be required for the combined claims to bankrupt (or seriously damage) a company like Patreon?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [This](https://web.archive.org/web/20190429192321/http://www.patreon.com/policy/legal) is the earliest dispute resolution clause I can find for Patreon. Some points to note:\n\n* It calls up (as do all subsequent revisions) [JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules \\& Procedures](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/),\n* These allow the consolidation of arbitration\u2019s between different parties over the same issue,\n* Patreon\u2019s liability is limited to the amount collected from the particular user.\n\n> 1. Do Patreon's terms of service cause Patreon to lose a minimum sum of money to arbitration costs in all cases, even if the claim is immediately rejected?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nAs stated above, Patreon can ask that the arbitrations be consolidated. I see no reason why the request wouldn\u2019t be granted. That way they only pay for one.\n\nAlternatively, they can simply pay out their maximum liability if that is less than the expected costs. For many users, it\u2019s likely the commissions they have paid will be less than their $250 filing fee.\n\n> 2. If yes, is Patreon required to go through full arbitration for each individual claim made? Or is there some mechanism to avoid additional costs for subsequent claims that are essentially identical to one that was already decided?\n\nThere are no precedents set in arbitration so each has to be decided individually. However, it\u2019s likely there will be only one arbitration, see above.\n\n> 3. If yes, roughly what number of plaintiffs would be required for the combined claims to bankrupt (or seriously damage) a company like Patreon?\n\nWell, it depends if they are insured or not.\n\nIf they are insured for legal costs then the question is how much to damage their insurer. And the answer is \\- a lot. Patreon has revenues in the tens of millions \\- insurance companies work in the billions.\n\nIf they aren\u2019t insured, there would need to be a significant number (far more than 72\\).\n\nRealistically, this is little more than a minor inconvenience.",

The documentation states that Patreon can request consolidation of arbitrations between different parties over the same issue, as allowed by the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures. This means Patreon is not required to go through separate arbitrations for each claim if they are similar, which can significantly limit their costs. \n\nOption A is incorrect because Patreon is not required to go through full arbitration for each individual claim if they are identical. Option B is incorrect because grouping plaintiffs into a class action lawsuit would violate Patreon's own terms of service, which waive rights to legal action based on class grouping. Option D is incorrect because Patreon does not necessarily lose a minimum sum of money for every arbitration claim, as they can use strategies like consolidation or paying out maximum liability if it's less than arbitration costs."

The customer sues and seeks to pierce the corporate veil and hold the business owner personally liable.\n\nThe customer is able to present evidence of misconduct satsifying the state's test for piercing the corporate veil, but only based on actions that occured *after* the injury. In other words, the business was being operated up to the time of the injury, but the owner began mismanaging it some time later.\n\nCan the customer still hold the owner personally liable? I'm looking for cases addressing this question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several concepts that are very closely related: piercing the corporate veil, the alter ego doctrine, and fraudulent transfer laws.\n\nLots of conduct that does not qualify for piercing the corporate veil, or the alter ego doctrine, can still be used to hold the owner liable for a fraudulent transfer.\n\nUsually, if the owner transfers an asset from the company (even something intangible, like business prospects) without substantially equivalent value being paid in exchange, or if the owner takes actions calculated to make the entity debtor affirmatively hinder a creditor or conceal assets, there is a fraudulent transfer and the transferred asset can be recovered by the entity's creditors.\n\nPaying bona fide valid insider debts before paying third\\-party creditors can also constitute a fraudulent transfer that can be recovered.\n\nThe remedies available against the business owner personally would also depend upon the precise nature of the misconduct.\n\nKeep in mind that in an action for a tort, like negligence causing personal injury or professional malpractice, anyone who participated in the negligence that caused the personal injury has personal liability, notwithstanding the fact that this person was acting in their official capacity for the company while doing so. So, the details of who was involved in causing the injury to the customer matter. In a small closely held limited liability company, the owners is often personally involved in tortious conduct.\n\nFor example, suppose that a small closely held company makes a defective product and sells it to a customer who is injured by the defective product.\n\nCertainly, the company that sold the product would be exposed to product liability claims from the injured customer.\n\nBut, if the small company only has one or two people who design and manufacture the product, and one can prove that they were involved in designing and manufacturing this particular product (e.g. a custom item), then the individuals involved in designing and manufacturing the defective product have personal liability in tort in a product liability suit, not just the company.\n\nOn the other hand, if the liability is purely for a breach of contract, or the company is liable vicariously for conduct of someone other than the owners or managers or officers, and if the company made no fraudulent transfers, and was operating with proper formalities at the time of the incident, piercing the corporate veil, or applying the alter ego doctrine could be much more challenging (although, of course, the law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this is largely a matter of state law).",

A customer, Sarah, purchases a custom-made chair that collapses due to faulty design, causing her injury. Sarah sues the company. Six months after the incident, John begins to transfer company assets to his personal accounts and fails to maintain proper business records. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's potential personal liability?\n\nA) John cannot be held personally liable because the misconduct occurred after the incident that caused Sarah's injury.\n\nB) John can only be held personally liable if Sarah can prove he was directly involved in designing the faulty chair.\n\nC) John can be held personally liable for fraudulent transfer, regardless of when it occurred in relation to the incident.\n\nD) John can only be held personally liable if Sarah can prove the LLC was undercapitalized at the time of the incident.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While piercing the corporate veil might be challenging if the company was operating properly at the time of the incident, John's subsequent actions of transferring company assets to his personal accounts without equivalent value being exchanged constitutes a fraudulent transfer. This action, even though it occurred after the incident, can make John personally liable. Fraudulent transfer laws can be applied regardless of when the transfer occurred in relation to the incident that caused the liability. Additionally, as the designer of the custom chair, John might also face personal liability for his direct involvement in creating the defective product, but this would be a separate basis for liability from the fraudulent transfer."

The executive orders regarding TikTok were issued under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This act allows the President to regulate transactions with foreign entities deemed a national security threat. If Google and Apple continued to offer TikTok in their app stores, this could be interpreted as engaging in prohibited transactions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because criminal charges would be an extreme and unlikely first step. Option B is incorrect because the government would likely have some legal options under IEEPA. Option D is incorrect because it mischaracterizes the nature of the executive orders, which focus on business transactions rather than individual use.\n\nOption C is the most plausible outcome. Civil penalties under IEEPA could potentially be applied if Google and Apple were found to be in violation of the executive orders. However, the companies could potentially argue that merely maintaining an existing app in their stores does not constitute a new transaction, which could lead to legal debates over the interpretation and scope of the orders."

Most usually the mortgage is offered as security for a loan taken out by the mortgagors (landowner), however, mortgages can be given for all sorts of other reasons. For example, I might give a mortgage to guarantee a loan by someone else. Or as surety for bail.\n\nThe Registrar General [says](https://rg-guidelines.nswlrs.com.au/deposited_plans/conversion_os/possessory_title):\n\n> The effect of adverse possession is to destroy the title of the person who is dispossessed, however, it does not destroy the rights of other persons who have an enforceable interest in the land such as easements or restrictive covenants.\n\nSince a mortgage is a type of restrictive covenant the mortgagee would retain the right to seize and sell the property if whatever trigger for that to happen, happened.\n\nSo, to keep it simple, if we assume that the original owner offered the mortgage as security for a loan, then, if they stopped paying the loan *one of* the lender's options would be to seize and sell the land irrespective of who owns it.",

According to the documentation, adverse possession destroys the title of the dispossessed person, but it does not destroy other enforceable interests in the land, such as mortgages. The mortgage is considered a type of restrictive covenant that remains attached to the property. The mortgagee (lender) retains the right to seize and sell the property if the conditions that would trigger such action occur, regardless of who currently owns the property. This means that while ownership may change through adverse possession, existing financial obligations tied to the property remain in effect."

This section prohibits sleeping in \"any other room or place which does not comply with the provisions of this Code for a sleeping room, or in which sleeping is dangerous, or prejudicial to life or health by reason of an overcrowded condition; a lack of light, windows, ventilation or drainage; fire hazard, dampness or offensive, obnoxious or poisonous odors in the room or place.\" A small storage closet with no windows or ventilation clearly lacks proper light, ventilation, and potentially poses fire hazards.\n\nOption A is not correct because a spacious, well-ventilated conference room with windows and proper fire safety measures might not necessarily violate the code, although it would still require inspection to ensure compliance.\n\nOption C is less likely to be a violation as it's not a designated sleeping area, though prolonged or regular sleeping arrangements might still be scrutinized.\n\nOption D, while possibly more acceptable, would still require inspection to ensure it meets all building code requirements for a sleeping area in a commercial building."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've just been reading [this article in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html) which expounds on the business practices of mobile apps which collect your location data and use it/sell it.\n\nThe article gives examples of apps which give a vague/misleading message on the permissions screen (\"you'll get personalised weather data\"), but which actually sell the data to tens of different companies.  \n\nAs far as I'm aware (which isn't very far), the data processor only has the right to use the data for a purpose which you have agreed to.\n\nSo are apps which do this in violation of GDPR? (Or, would they be if they do it in Europe?)\n\nOne thing to note is that the apps usually associate the data with a unique ID assigned to the device rather than your name or phone number, for example. However, it's well\\-known (and shown in the article) how it is usually trivial to tie back \"anonymised\" data to individuals.  \n\nHow does this use of a unique ID affect the GDPR situation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, this violates the GDPR if the user is in Europe.\n\nData which is tied to a personal device can be tied to the person who owns it. From \"*[What Is Personal Data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/)*\" by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) (emphasis added):\n\n> * Personal data is information that relates to an identified or **identifiable** individual.\n> * What identifies an individual could be as simple as a name or a number or could include other identifiers **such as an IP address or a cookie identifier**, or other factors.\n> * If it is possible to identify an individual directly from the information you are processing, then that information may be personal data.\n> * If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, then you need to consider whether the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account the information you are processing together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify that individual.\n\nThe bit about \"all means reasonably likely\" in the last bullet includes the kind of de\\-anonymisation tactics described in the NYT article.\n\nThere are [6 lawful bases for data processing](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/) in the GDPR, and all processing must fall under at least one of them.\n\n> (a) Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose.\n> \n> \n> (b) Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.\n> \n> \n> (c) Legal obligation: the processing is necessary for you to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations).\n> \n> \n> (d) Vital interests: the processing is necessary to protect someone\u2019s life.\n> \n> \n> (e) Public task: the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.\n> \n> \n> (f) Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, unless there is a good reason to protect the individual\u2019s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests. (This cannot apply if you are a public authority processing data to perform your official tasks.)\n\nSelling data isn't covered by any of the others, so consent must be obtained. Permission must be clear and positive, and you cannot predicate delivery of a service on the processing of data that isn't necessary for that service. So for instance you cannot say \"You can use this service as long as we are allowed to collect and sell your data\" because selling the data isn't necessary to the provision of the service. From \"*[Consent](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/consent/)*\" by the ICO:\n\n> * Consent requires a positive opt\\-in. Don\u2019t use pre\\-ticked boxes or any other method of default consent.\n> * Explicit consent requires a very clear and specific statement of consent.\n> * Keep your consent requests separate from other terms and conditions.\n> * Be specific and \u2018granular\u2019 so that you get separate consent for separate things.\n> * Vague or blanket consent is not enough.\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> * Avoid making consent to processing a precondition of a service.\n\nThis applies to any processing of data about [individuals within the EU](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/), so just being an American company doesn't get you a free pass to ignore the GDPR if your app gets used by Europeans.\n\nThe \"Legitimate interests\" basis is more problematic, in that the company collecting the data has to conduct a vague \"balancing test\" to determine if this basis applies. For direct marketing the [ICO has written this](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/legitimate-interests/when-can-we-rely-on-legitimate-interests/), which says that direct marketing *may* be a legitimate interest, especially if you can show that the user has expressed interest in such adverts. For instance a location service which promises to tell you about nearby special offers would fall into this category. Against this, the impact on the user's privacy has to be considered, and location data is \"[special category data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/)\" because it can reveal medical information (e.g. hospital attendance) or religious affiliation (e.g. which church you go to). So unless the relationship between the recorded location data and the service is very direct its not going to pass the balancing test. The company would also need to distinguish between knowing the current location and keeping a record of historical locations; the two need separate justification.\n\nAnd of course nothing about this covers the sale of the data; this is considering a company which sells advertising space in it's app, not one that sells the data itself.",

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the app's compliance with GDPR?\n\nA) The app is compliant with GDPR as long as it doesn't collect users' names or phone numbers.\nB) The app violates GDPR unless it obtains explicit consent for selling the data, separate from the consent for collecting location data for weather forecasts.\nC) The app can claim \"legitimate interests\" as a lawful basis for selling the data without additional consent.\nD) The app is GDPR compliant if it informs users that their data will be used for \"personalized services\".\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because GDPR considers data associated with a unique device ID as personal data, even if names aren't collected.\nB) is correct because GDPR requires explicit, granular consent for each purpose of data processing. Selling data is a separate purpose from providing weather forecasts and requires its own clear consent.\nC) is incorrect because selling personal data to third parties is unlikely to pass the \"balancing test\" for legitimate interests, especially for sensitive location data.\nD) is incorrect because vague or blanket consent is not sufficient under GDPR.

If Mr. Suda, as alleged, took the victim's hand and touched it to his own genitals, without her consent, he committed an assault and battery. Any touching can constitute a battery, from a tap on the shoulder to a bullet in the head.\n\nLikewise, at common law, \"violence\" is any degree of physical force. If he tricked her into touching his genitals, that would not be a crime of violence; if he physically moved her hand to his genitals with his own hand, then he used physical force, or violence, to commit the crime.\n\nAgain, what actually needs to be proven will depend on specifics you would need a Maltese lawyer to go into\\-\\-but under general common law principles, neither \"assault\" not \"violence\" are particularly surprising.",

Trickery or deception alone doesn't constitute violence under common law principles.\n\nC) This is the correct answer because it involves both elements of assault and violence as defined in common law. The forcible moving of someone's hand without consent is an unwanted touching (battery, which includes assault), and the use of physical force to do so meets the definition of \"violence\" under common law.\n\nD) While unwanted sexual comments may be harassment, they do not involve physical touching or the threat of it, so this scenario doesn't meet the definitions of either assault or violence under common law."

It is both good law and good sense that he may do, but only do, what is reasonably necessary.\n\nIn the case of a fist fight, this is sometimes expressed as if someone punches you, you are allowed to punch them but not allowed to pick up a bottle and hit them with it. However, many fights end up in a grapple on the ground ([estimates vary from 42% to 95%](https://martialarts.stackexchange.com/questions/1342/is-it-true-that-most-fights-end-on-the-ground-what-is-the-evidence)). Traditional ways to end a grapple involve causing cerebral hypoxia (chokeholds and strangles) or dislocation (joint locks). These have potentially [life changing](https://www.brainandspinalcord.org/faqs/abi/can-choking-cause-acquired-brain-injury/) or [life ending](https://judoinfo.com/chokes6/) consequences, particularly when a submission is impractical. Other techniques such as biting and eye gouging are less likely to be fatal but more likely to cause life changing injuries.\n\nHow have court cases interpreted reasonable force in cases where an attacker suffered serious injuries as a result of a fight they initiated ending in a grapple?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The same way it is for every other self\\-defence case\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nWhether the force used in a particular case is a matter of fact for the jury to decide, not a matter of law for the judge to dictate.

In particular, the jury must decide if the *defendant* believed their actions were necessary in the circumstances.\n\nIn [australia](/questions/tagged/australia \"show questions tagged 'australia'\") the leading case is Zecevic v DPP (1987\\) 162 CLR 645 which [says](https://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/5022/self-defence-law-in-australia.aspx):\n\n> The question to be asked in the end is quite simple.

This approach is consistent with the principle outlined in Zecevic v DPP, which emphasizes that the key question is whether the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that their actions were necessary for self-defense.

Is the act of downloading those movies and TV episodes for free, editing them, and publishing them legal **in America**?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Evaluating a potential copyright violation is very fact\\-intensive, so we don't have enough information to answer the question.\n\nMaking a copy is generally going to be a copyright violation, but there's still going to be a lot of breathing room under the fair use doctrine. Again, we'd need more details to provide a useful answer, but you may be able to analyze the question yourself using the following information.\n\nAnalysis of fair\\-use defenses looks at four questions, and the answers to the questions can tip the scales in favor of or against a finding of fair use:\n\n1. **Does your kind of copying affect the market for the original?** To what extent can your copy fulfill the demand for the original? What if there were widespread copying of the kind you're considering? The more potential there is for the copies to replace the original, the less likely it is to be fair use. *This is the most important factor in the analysis.*\n2. **Why did you make the copy?** If you made the copy for purposes of news reporting, criticism, or commentary, it's more likely to be fair use. If you made a copy just so you could watch again later whenever you feel like it, that's may still be fair use, but it is somewhat less likely. If you made a copy so you could sell it for profit, that's almost certainly not fair use.\n3. **How much did you copy?** Did you copy the whole thing, or did you copy only as much as you needed to achieve your purpose under Question 2? If you copy \"too much\" \\-\\- both in the raw amount and as a fraction of the whole work \\-\\- it's less likely to be fair use.\n4. **What did you copy?** Such works can be copyrighted but are not part of the Highly creative works, such as poems, music, and movies, are at the \"core\" of copyright principles. A fair use analysis will be more stringent in these cases than when copying a purely factual work, such as a phone book, biography, or list of statistics. *This is the least important factor in the analysis.*\n\nSo take all of those and imagine the answer to each on a spectrum. If you see things generally tipping in the direction of fair use, that's a good indication that you're going to be safe. If you see things tipping in the other direction, you may want to reconsider.\n\nAgain, these can be notoriously tricky questions. If you're dealing with a real situation, you should consult an attorney to get an answer specific to your situation.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A YouTuber wants to create a video essay analyzing the evolution of special effects in science fiction movies. They plan to use short clips from various films throughout the decades, totaling about 5 minutes of footage in a 30-minute video. The video will be monetized on YouTube. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the fair use doctrine in this scenario?\n\nA) This is definitely not fair use because the video is monetized, violating the principle that fair use should not be for profit.\n\nB) This is likely fair use because the creator is using only short clips and the purpose is educational and analytical.\n\nC) This cannot be fair use because the creator did not obtain permission from the copyright holders of the film clips.\n\nD) Fair use cannot be determined without knowing the specific movies used and their box office performance.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario likely falls under fair use for several reasons:\n\n1. Purpose and character of use: The video is being created for educational and analytical purposes, which favors fair use.\n\n2. Amount used: Short clips totaling 5 minutes in a 30-minute video suggest a reasonable amount of copying relative to the purpose.\n\n3. Effect on the market: Using short clips for analysis is unlikely to significantly impact the market for the original films.\n\n4. Nature of the copyrighted work: While movies are creative works, the use here is transformative and for commentary purposes.\n\nThe fact that the video is monetized does not automatically disqualify it from fair use (A is incorrect). Permission is not required for fair use (C is incorrect). While knowing specific movies could provide more context, we have enough information to make a reasonable assessment without it (D is incorrect)."

He also said:\n\n> \"I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case,\n> especially in a manner that's disrespectful to the rule of law and to\n> the judicial branch and our function.\"\n\n*Source: [https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/judge\\-blasts\\-us\\-rep\\-maxine\\-waters\\-abhorrent\\-comments\\-about\\-chauvin\\-trial\\-2021\\-04\\-19/](https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/judge-blasts-us-rep-maxine-waters-abhorrent-comments-about-chauvin-trial-2021-04-19/)*\n\nI've heard that there are stronger protections against the improper influence of sitting jurors in Canada than in the U.S. I'm interested in how they work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ultimately this raises a question of balancing two fundamental rights: The right of the accused to a fair trial within due process of law \\& the right to freedom of expression (or in the case of press publications as in most of the cases cited by this answer, the very related freedom of the press). Both the US \\& Canada safeguard these rights in their constitutions (Amendments I, V, XIV \\& *Charter* ss. 2(b), 11(d) respectively) so any differences would be in their approaches to balancing these rights.\n\nUnited States\n=============\n\nI've found *[Some Aspects of the Law of Contempt of Court in Canada, England, and the United States](https://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/wp-content/uploads/pdf/3251710-ziegel.pdf)* (Jacob S. Ziegel, 1960\\) to be highly informative on the historical development of contempt of court and provided a good baseline understanding. In reference to *[Bridges v. California](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/314/252/)* 314 U.S. 252 (1941\\), it states\n\n> Although the Court recognized that \"free speech and fair trials are two of the most cherished policies of our civilization\" and that \"it would be a trying task to choose between them\", it held nevertheless that an abridgment on the freedom of the press was only permitted by the Constitution when there was \"a clear and present danger\" that the offending publication would actually interfere with a fair and impartial trial. The majority opinion rejected the \"reasonable tendency\" test which had been applied by the lower courts, and still is the yardstick by which such publications are measured in England and Canada.\n\nI'd also like to quote the following paragraph from *Bridges* as it raises two points I'd like to comment on:\n\n> What finally emerges from the \"clear and present danger\" cases is a working principle that the substantive evil must be extremely serious, and the degree of imminence extremely high, before utterances can be punished. Those cases do not purport to mark the furthermost constitutional boundaries of protected expression, nor do we here. They do no more than recognize a minimum compulsion of the Bill of Rights. For the First Amendment does not speak equivocally. It prohibits any law \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" It must be taken as a command of the broadest scope that explicit language, read in the context of a liberty\\-loving society, will allow.\n\nThe first point is that due to its broad language, the court gives a certain priority to the First Amendment.\n\nThe second point involves the age of my citations: the \"clear and present danger\" test is from *[Schenck v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States)*, largely considered to be overruled by the more stringent *[Brandenburg v. Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio)* 395 U.S. 444 (1969\\) \"immediate lawless action\" test.\n\nThis does raise the question of whether *Bridges* can then be considered good law. I unfortunately can't find any good references discussing *Bridges* in a post\\-*Brandenburg* context, however, I would argue it is still valid. While the *Schenck* test has been overruled, the *Bridges* citation I gave in fact foreshadows the *Brandenburg* test by using the language of \"imminence\" and stating the *Schenck* test was not necessarily the limit of the First Amendment, but just a minimum bar. I would then argue that *Bridges* can quite easily be considered good law by simply substituting the *Schenck* test with the *Brandenburg* one without really affecting the court's *ratio decidendi*.\n\nCanada\n======\n\nZiegel's article is even more out\\-of\\-date when it comes to Canada as it is pre\\-*Charter*. For a modern Canadian overview of out\\-of\\-court contempt of court I've found *[A Comment on \"No Comment\": The Sub Judice Rule and the Accountability of Public Officials in the 21st Century](https://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=scholarly_works)* (Lorne Sossin \\& Valerie Crystal, 2013\\). The article cites *[Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1204/index.do)* \\[1994] 3 SCR 835 as directly tackling the balance of these rights. In it the court acknowledged the pre\\-*Charter* common law of giving deference to the accused's right to a fair trial, but noting that the *Charter* now requires a balancing of these rights\n\n> The traditional common law rule governing publication bans \\-\\- that there be a real and substantial risk of interference with the right to a fair trial \\-\\- emphasized the right to a fair trial over the free expression interests of those affected by the ban and, in the context of post\\-*Charter* Canadian society, does not provide sufficient protection for freedom of expression. When two protected rights come into conflict, *Charter* principles require a balance to be achieved that fully respects the importance of both rights. A hierarchical approach to rights must be avoided, both when interpreting the *Charter* and when developing the common law. The common law rule governing publication bans must thus be reformulated in a manner that reflects the principles of the *Charter* and, in particular, the equal status given by the *Charter* to ss. 2(b) and 11(d).\n\nUltimately, the court concluded that a balance of these rights was the following test:\n\n> A publication ban should only be ordered when:\n> \n> \n> (a) Such a ban is necessary in order to prevent a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial, because reasonably available alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and\n> \n> \n> (b) The salutary effects of the publication ban outweigh the deleterious effects to the free expression of those affected by the ban.\n\nWhile *Dagenais* more clearly explains the balancing of these two rights, the article also cites *[R. v. Vermette](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/332/index.do)* \\[1988] 1 SCR 985 which is a much more similar situation to Maxine Waters commenting on an ongoing trial. The article summarizes as follows:\n\n> While the trial was ongoing, the premier of Quebec, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, denounced one of the defence witnesses in the National Assembly, despite warnings by the Speaker that such comments would be prejudicial to the accused.\n\nThe [trial decision](https://www.canlii.org/en/qc/qccs/doc/1982/1982canlii3672/1982canlii3672.html) even contains the following comment from the judge:\n\n> When speaking in the National Assembly, however, the Premier enjoyed the privilege of Parliamentary immunity. Had it not been for this immunity, he could\n> have been cited for contempt of court.\n\nComparison\n==========\n\nAt a constitutional level, it can be seen that the balancing of these two rights are not the same in the US and Canada. The US gives much greater weight to freedom of speech, while Canada allows restriction of speech if doing so more greatly benefits another *Charter* right and there is no reasonable alternative.\n\nOn a practical level, there are also differences in how jury trials are run, maybe even as a direct result of the constitutional differences. In *Dagenais*, the court quotes the following:\n\n> Generally speaking, however, the approach taken in the United States seems to be to allow for the widest possible latitude in media reporting of events transpiring prior to and during the course of the trial of an accused person. This is counterbalanced, in the interests of ensuring an impartial and unbiased jury, in a number of ways including, during the jury selection process, by an often searching examination into the attitudes, biases and even the personal and financial affairs of potential jurors and, after the jury selection process has been completed, by the sequestration of the members of the jury while the trial is in progress to reduce the risk of their exposure to the media and other publicity generated by it.\n> \n> \n> In Canada, by contrast, the process of jury selection is neither as prolonged nor as exhaustive as a general rule; indeed the kind of questioning and probing into the affairs of potential jurors that is sometimes seen in the United States would be unlikely to be permitted under our system. Moreover, in Canada the sequestration of jurors throughout a trial occurs only exceptionally. The strong bias of our system is to prevent the dissemination before the conclusion of the trial of media publicity that might be prejudicial to the accused's fair trial.\n\nThe US \\& Canada simply follow different constitutional approaches here and have slightly different priorities when it comes to balancing rights.",

The United States, as established in cases like Bridges v. California and later refined in Brandenburg v. Ohio, uses a stringent test (originally \"clear and present danger,\" later evolved to \"imminent lawless action\") to determine when speech related to ongoing trials can be restricted. This approach gives significant weight to the First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nIn contrast, Canada, as outlined in cases like Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., uses a balancing approach that gives equal consideration to both the right to free expression and the right to a fair trial. The Canadian approach allows for restrictions on speech if they are necessary to prevent a substantial risk to trial fairness and if the benefits outweigh the harms to free expression.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the US does give more weight to free speech, Canada doesn't always favor fair trials over free speech but rather aims for a balance.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it's actually the opposite \u2013 the US typically allows for more extensive questioning of potential jurors than Canada.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the two countries clearly have different approaches to this issue."

Donald Trump's Twitter account, when used in his capacity as President, was considered a public forum because it represented governmental action. As a result, blocking users was seen as a violation of the First Amendment. \n\nIn contrast, YouTube is a private company, not a government entity.

This means the installation of a non-original battery is legal, and the technician who performed the replacement would not face legal consequences. However, Apple, as a private company, has the right to refuse service on a device with third-party modifications, especially if the device is no longer under warranty.

There is no such tag and I am told I cannot create one until my reputation is at least 150\\.]\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, no one can tell you what is \"generally taught\" in the thousands of law schools across hundreds of jurisdictions.\n\nSecond, *dishonesty* is defined by the OED as \"deceitfulness shown in someone's character or behaviour\" and *deceit* is defined as \"the action or practice of deceiving someone by concealing or misrepresenting the truth\".\n\n\"Someone\" can be the person who makes the statement so if you deceive yourself *or* someone else you are being dishonest. You do not have to make a statement to be dishonest; not saying something can be deceitful.\n\nHowever, dishonesty is not in and of itself a crime or a tort; it only becomes so when the law imposes a duty to be honest. When that happens, the statute (if applicable) and the case law is usually pretty clear about what honesty requires. This will differ between jurisdictions and within jurisdictions with context.\n\nFor example, many jurisdictions impose an obligations on business not to engage in \"false or misleading\" conduct. However, you can tell lies and still comply with the law because obviously outrageous advertising claims (e.g. \"Sale of the Century\", \"The greatest thing since sliced bread\") while (probably) false are not misleading.\n\nAlternatively, you can be scrupulous about not telling lies and still be dishonest. A case in NSW (name escapes me) where a potential buyer of a restaurant asked \"How many does it seat?\" and receiving a reply of \"X\", a perfectly accurate answer based on the number of place settings, was able to successfully sue when he discovered after the purchase that it was *licenced* to seat \"Y\"; substantially less than \"X\". The judge held that while the statement was a factually accurate response to the literal question posed, it was dishonest in the context of the transaction the parties were contemplating.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A restaurant owner is selling their business. When asked by a potential buyer \"How many does the restaurant seat?\", the owner responds with the number of place settings they have, which is higher than the actual licensed seating capacity. Which of the following best describes this situation from a legal perspective?\n\nA) The owner is not being dishonest because they provided a factually accurate answer to the literal question asked.\nB) The owner is being dishonest, but it's not legally problematic as there's no specific law against such statements in business sales.\nC) The owner is being dishonest and could potentially be held liable for misleading conduct, despite providing a technically true answer.\nD) The owner is only being dishonest if they knew the buyer was specifically interested in the licensed seating capacity.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question is based on the case mentioned from NSW, Australia. While the restaurant owner's response is technically accurate based on the literal question asked (similar to the \"X\" number of seats in the example), it fails to provide the crucial information about the licensed seating capacity (\"Y\" in the example). In the context of a business sale, this omission could be considered misleading and dishonest, even though no explicit lie was told. The correct answer is C because, as the example case showed, one can be \"scrupulous about not telling lies and still be dishonest\" in a legal context, especially in business transactions where there's an obligation not to engage in false or misleading conduct. Options A and B are incorrect because they don't account for the legal concept of misleading conduct in business contexts. Option D is incorrect because the owner's knowledge of the buyer's specific interest doesn't determine whether the conduct is misleading; the context of the transaction itself is sufficient to create this obligation for honesty."

The landlord cannot legally remove the current tenant or change the locks without a court order, even if that tenant has overstayed their notice period. This is to protect tenants from unlawful evictions. However, by failing to deliver the apartment to the new tenant on the agreed date, the landlord may be in breach of the new lease agreement.

It is acceptable to do so, so long as your business is indeed a corporation.

The offer letter I was sent also did not mention about it, it said there is a privacy agreement that will need to be signed, but the privacy agreement was not sent to me. I assumed this is a standard privacy agreement to keep information private and I took the offer. May be this was my mistake, I should have explicitly asked to send the privacy document before accepting the offer. \n\nOne day before the start date, the company sent me the privacy agreement, to my surprise, includes a non\\-compete clause, which states if I am terminated by myself or by the company for any just or unjust cause, I cannot take employment of any of their competitor for 12 months. There is no clarification what is meant by competitor. \n\nBy this time, I have already resigned from my old job and made significant plans to join the new one. When I asked the new company why they kept it hidden or what is the definition of competitor, they do not provide any straight answer, just keeps hinting this is not a big deal, everyone signs it. They say they cannot strike out the clause and want me to sign with acknowledgement that it was done voluntarily and without any duress or undue influence by the Company. I do have emails where I expressed my concerns and their reply. \n\nI would not have taken the offer if I knew about the non\\-compete or at least negotiated before I resigned from my previous company.

Is this breaking copyright?\n\nI guess what I don't get about [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) is it says it can be used for study, so does that mean as long as you don't actually use it you're ok? For example you're learning how to speak German and you make notes from your book, this is ok but if you actual speak German then you're using it so fair use doesn't apply? Obviously this isn't how it works so I'm curious as to how it does.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **It depends on where you are**\n\nFor example, in USA copyright exists in a literary or artistic work stored in permanent form like a book, a movie, an audio recording, a building etc.\n\nIn contrast, in Australia there is no requirement for the work to be stored \\- that means copyright can exist in a spoken lecture.\n\nThe owner of the copyright (usually, but not necessarily the creator) has the right to choose if and how their work is copied and if and how any derivative works may be made from it.\n\nFor your example, the book is an original work in which copyright vests with the author(s), your notes are a derivative work in which copyright vests in you.\n\nHowever, you presumably did not have permission to make your derivative work so that makes it *prima facie* a copyright infringement.\n\nFortunately, in the USA there exists a Fair Use defence and in Commonwealth countries the slightly less permissive Fair Dealing defence (if you are somewhere else you will need to do your own research). Search this site or read the copyright article on Wikipedia to learn about these defences.\n\nLong answer short (too late!), taking notes to aid your own study is almost certainly Fair Use/Dealing. So is sharing it with your friends. Publishing it may or may not be depending on all sorts of factors; for example, if you were to write a study guide for say a *Harry Potter* book for use by English literature students this is probably OK even if it is a for profit activity, because criticism is Fair Use/Dealing.\n\nCiting work is not necessary to comply with copyright law.

Refuse to act on the request.\n\nOption C is the most appropriate because it allows the company to continue complying with GDPR while discouraging excessive requests. The company should first inform the individual about the frequency of their requests and that future requests may incur fees. This approach balances the individual's right to access with the company's need to protect against abusive requests.\n\nOption A is incorrect because GDPR does allow companies to take action against excessive requests. Option B is too extreme as an initial response and could be seen as non-compliance. Option D is incorrect because ignoring requests outright violates GDPR principles."

The description mentions the law section which I would like to refer to (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(b)), but this law section does not deal with \"denial of application\", but with failure to adjudicate (i.e. make a determination regarding an application).\n\nIt is [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421(c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1421) which actually deals with denial of application.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your surmise is correct.\n\nBut, even if you got it wrong, there would be no litigation sanction for doing so. This portion of the civil cover sheet is used solely for purposes of gathering accurate statistics about the case load of the federal courts for policy\\-making and budgetary purposes.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a federal civil lawsuit against the government for failure to adjudicate a naturalization application within 120 days after the initial interview, which \"Nature of Suit\" code should be selected on the civil cover sheet?\n\nA) 890 - Other Statutory Actions\nB) 440 - Other Civil Rights\nC) 462 - Naturalization Application\nD) 899 - Administrative Procedure Act/Review or Appeal of Agency Decision\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct \"Nature of Suit\" code is 462 - Naturalization Application. Although the description provided in the official document seems to conflate 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(b) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421(c), code 462 is still the most appropriate for this type of case. It specifically mentions both \"review of denial of an application for naturalization\" and \"alleging failure to make a determination regarding an application for naturalization,\" which encompasses the scenario described in the question.\n\nOption A (890 - Other Statutory Actions) is too broad and would only be used if no other specific category applies. Option B (440 - Other Civil Rights) is not specific to naturalization issues. Option D (899 - Administrative Procedure Act/Review or Appeal of Agency Decision) could be considered, but it's less specific than the naturalization code.\n\nIt's important to note that while selecting the correct code is preferable for accurate court statistics, there are no legal consequences for choosing the wrong code on the civil cover sheet."
