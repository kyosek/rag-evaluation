If they have no warrant, they can search only if you permit them to, or they have probable cause (meaning, pretty good evidence that you committed a crime) and there are \"exigent circumstances\", for instance if they are in hot pursuit of a felon, or you fired a gun from your house. If there is some other evidence (such as a drug\\-sniffing dog) plus accusations by someone, then a third\\-party tip could constitute probable cause. It's rather difficult to say when a third party's say\\-so would constitute probable cause, but [Illinois v. Gates](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/462/213/) gives an example of how specific details can constitute probable cause. \nThey can also search if they have consent from someone they reasonably believe can legally give consent.

A person who the police reasonably believe has the authority to consent to a search (like a roommate) can give legal permission for the search, even if you object.\n\nC) Threats or pressure from the police do not create a legal right to search.

All one has to say is they maintained some portion of land for 10 years undisputed and now they can claim they \"own\" the property.\n\nMy mother owns a vacant land and I notice someone is mowing the lawn. One of the claims of adverse possession is that they make the land theirs undisputed (\"Planting your flag\" so to speak) and they make it known to the supposed owner that they maintain and control the land.

Then there are cases of building a shed or structure or fence over/just before someone's property line and one can make a claim that a part of a property is theirs.

In Virginia, most of these requirements are laid out in judicial decisions, not statutes. However, the one requirement [set by statute](https://vacode.org/8.01-236/) is that the possessor has to have \"possessed\" the land **for 15 years.**\n\nAs for the rest of the requirements, they are the usual ones. Ten years ago, the [Supreme Court of Virginia](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1058407/helms-v-manspile/) gave a nice, concise summary. It said that to \"establish title...by adverse possession,\" your neighbor would have to prove that their possession was:\n\n1. actual,\n2. hostile,\n3. exclusive,\n4. visible, and\n5. continuous...\n\nHere is what the Court said each element requires:\n\n> Use and occupation of property...constitutes proof of actual possession. One is in hostile possession if his possession is under a claim of right and adverse to the right of the true owner. One's possession is exclusive when it is not in common with others. Possession is visible when it is *so obvious that the true owner **may be presumed** to know about it.* Possession is continuous only if it exists without interruption for the statutory period.\n\n**Two things to notice:**\n\n1. Because your neighbor's possession must be *adverse,* you can stop the 15 year possession \"*clock*\" by simply *giving them your permission* to mow the lawn.\n2. It does not matter that your neighbors are mowing \"in secret and without letting us know it.\" That you are here asking about it shows the mowing so \"visible\" that you know what is going on.\n\n**For more information**\n\nWhether your neighbors can claim your land depends on how Virginia courts have interpreted the law. Luckily for you, several Virginia lawyers have gone online to explain those details. These two, (one in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/realestate/2003/03/22/the-rules-of-adverse-possession-determine-who-is-entitled-to-occupy-land/a6b88fc8-352f-445d-9336-a26a66f53c82/)), give nice [overviews](http://richfishlegalblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/supreme-court-of-virginia-affirms-law.html), while [this guy,](https://www.hovplc.com/blog/2016/october/squatters-rights-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not/) says mowing alone probably won't do it. [This guy](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/who-can-claim-property-based-adverse-possession-virginia.html) says, \"Virginia courts don\u2019t make adverse possession easy,\" but he's a [NYer](https://www.arentfox.com/attorneys/brian-farkas), through and through, so who knows whether he knows what he's talking about?\n\nOf course, none of this is a substitute for talking to a Virginia lawyer with experience in adverse possession.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John has been mowing the lawn of a vacant lot owned by his neighbor Sarah for the past 12 years without her knowledge or permission.

I am renting this property and do not own it.\n\nLong story short I had a NEMA 14\\-50 EV charger installed in my rental house in Seattle, with the permission of the owner. This was roughly a year ago. The electrician lied to me and told me I did not need an inspection. His company then called me saying that I did, and they went ahead and had charged me for it. It then failed inspection because he hadn't installed a GFI. On an exterior circuit... So they came back and fixed it (for free) but completely botched my panel and disconnected my water heater. I then didn't have hot water for 3 days. I tried to let them fix it (again) and they promised to send out an emergency dispatch that day. I called 4 times and was told they were coming, and sat around all day waiting; they never showed up. The next day I called a different company who came out on an emergency call and fixed it. The new electrician made many comments about things they'd done incorrectly and fixed some of their minor mistakes for me, free of charge. Since this was an emergency call on Labor day they charged me their holiday \\+ emergency rate of $500\\. No cheap, but I wanted to take warm showers again and the other company did not seem inclined to fix their mistakes.\n\nI was understandably angry and called them, demanding them to reimburse me for the emergency service after I tried repeatedly to allow them to fix the mistake and they failed to. I received a verbal agreement from the site manager that he would. Nothing happened, of course, and then they started ignoring or not returning my calls. Eventually I gave up as the frustration was not worth it.\n\nNow I actually do not recall if an inspector came by a second time to approve the fix. Over the past week they have been calling and emailing me saying that they failed to document that the GFI was installed and that another inspection is required, or I could photograph the panel for them. I am inclined to tell them to go pound sand and to stop contacting me. I may also tell them I will send a picture of the updated panel, if they reimburse me the $500 as agreed upon last year.\n\nShould they be unwilling and I just continue to ignore them, is there anything negative that can happen to me?

The owner was consulted before the work was done. They \"fixed\" it and in the process disconnected my water heater. I attempted to allow them to correct this but they no\\-showed, so I had a 3rd party fix the panel. Now they are asking me for a picture of the panel to confirm they did install the GFI but after so much consternation and money spent fixing the issue, I am disinclined to work with them unless failing to do so can cause me issues.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are some consequences for you, under the [Seattle Residential Code](https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/SDCI/Codes/SeattleResidentialCode/2015SRCChapter1.pdf). Per R103\\.5\n\n> Any person violating or failing to comply with the provisions of this\n> code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not\n> to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation\n> occurs or begins until compliance is achieved.\n\n$182,500 per year.\n\nAlso under R103\\.4,\n\n> Whenever any building or structure is being occupied contrary to the\n> provisions of this code, the building official may order such\n> occupancy discontinued and the building or structure, or portion\n> thereof, vacated by notice.\n\nThere *should* be a notation on your panel indicating permit number and approval, but if you have the permit number, you can check if the inspection was done and the work was approved (I think [this](https://cosaccela.seattle.gov/portal/welcome.aspx) will report status). The legal burden of assuring that the work was done correctly and paperwork is in order ultimately falls on the owner, though the city at least initially talks to the contractor.\n\nInsofar as a customer taking a picture doesn't count as an actual final inspection, I suspect that some cost\\- and time\\-saving short\\-cuts were taken.\n\nFollowing up on the new information about being a tenant, the primary legal question is whether you have a duty of care towards the landlord, since in engaging this company, the landlord's interest may be put at risk. The landlord may have protected his interest via a clause in the lease saying \"you must get written permission to modify the property, and you assume full liability for resulting damages\", so first thing to check is what the lease says (perhaps look for a \"Tenant's duty of care\" clause). In lieu of clear evidence that you caused damage to the owner (economic damage, by negligence w.r.t. his need to have proper permits and the whopping fines that follow), I don't see what the risk to you would be in just washing your hands of the problem.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant installs an EV charger in their rental property with the landlord's permission, but the electrician performs faulty work and fails to complete proper inspections.

The phrase \"through the developer\" in this context doesn't mean direct purchase from the developer, but rather that all lots in the subdivision originate from the developer's initial division of the land. Even if the property changes hands multiple times, it is still considered to have been acquired \"through the developer\" originally.

It seems like this is just so the cops can bully the suspect and be able to dominate them, and so is there a legal basis allowing them to do that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the police order you to sit in an interrogation room and you are not permitted to leave, *by definition*, you have been arrested. Detaining someone against their will for longer than necessary to answer a few questions on the spot (which is a lesser imposition on your freedom called a \"Terry stop\") is what it means to be arrested. Legally, the police are only allowed to arrest you if they have probable cause to believe that you have committed a crime.\n\nI believe that you are confusing arrested (being detained by law enforcement against your will for more than a Terry stop), with being booked, or being charged with a crime. Generally speaking people are arrested first, and then booked next, and then charged with a crime after that, although this isn't always the order in which this happens.\n\nIn much the same way, if the police observe someone committing a crime, they will first handcuff them which places them under arrest, and then book them sometime not too long later when they arrive at the police station, and then formally charge them sometime after that after a conversation with the prosecuting attorney to see if the prosecuting attorney is willing to pursue the case. Booking generally involves bringing someone to a police station, getting identifying information, taking a mug shot, taking finger prints, and depending upon what the police want to do, searching your person and inventorying your possessions prior to putting you in a jail cell in jail garb.\n\nUsually, however, the grand jury or the prosecuting attorney (it varies by jurisdiction) does have subpoena power to compel you to provide information under oath prior to trial as a witness, following the service of a subpoena upon you a reasonable time in advance as set forth in the relevant court rules, unless you invoke your 5th Amendment right against self\\-incrimination and are not granted immunity from prosecution based upon your testimony in exchange, or you invoke some other legal privilege against having to testify.\n\nThey can, of course, simply ask you to come to an interrogation room and answer questions, and merely imply that it is mandatory without actually saying that you must and without clarifying the situation. **In that case, which is extremely common, their legal right to interrogate you flows from your own consent.** If you answer their questions, your answers could provide the police with probable cause to arrest you that they didn't have when they started asking questions.\n\nIndeed, often, when police interrogate you before booking you, they are doing so because they need your statements to establish the probable cause needed to legally arrest you. This is why criminal defense attorneys counsel people to immediate ask for a lawyer and refuse to answer any questions other than those needed to establish your identity.\n\nYou can also ask if you are under arrest and if you are free to leave (which are mutually exclusive).\n\n**If they say you are not under arrest, you are free to leave,** unless you are appearing pursuant to a subpoena.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John is asked to come to the police station for questioning about a recent burglary in his neighborhood.

According to the information provided, if the police say you are not under arrest, you are free to leave. In this scenario, when John asks if he's under arrest and the officer says \"No,\" it indicates that John is not being legally detained and has the right to leave at any time.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the police cannot legally require John to stay and answer questions if he's not under arrest, even if they've told him to sit down.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because John has explicitly been told he's not under arrest.

So, if you think that the defendant might not answer and the original complaint was wrong, you need to not seek a default on the original complaint, amend the complaint and reserve the amended complaint.\n\nThe idea behind this rule is that the defendant should be able to make a rational decision about whether or not to fight a lawsuit based upon what is at stake in the lawsuit and not be surprised if the defendant decides to default to avoid litigation costs.\n\nBut, if a party answers the Complaint, then damages are determined based upon the evidence provided at trial and may ultimately be determined at trial to be either higher or lower than the amount claimed in the Complaint.\n\nThe idea behind this rule is that if the defendant had decided to litigate that the ultimate outcome should prefer reality to procedure since each party has input into how the decision is made by the court.\n\nIt also isn't uncommon for events that take place after the filing of the Complaint to change the amount of damages that are owed. Sometimes the damages go down, for example, if it is possible to mitigate damages in some way such as by selling defective goods that were delivered at a discount.

Do any UK consumer or product liability laws apply?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Note** \\- I'm not asking legal advice. I already have a basis of claim in my actual case. But the case prompted a question mark over an apparent loophole in UK consumer protection/product liability law, and I'm wondering if it's covered in some consumer law I don't know about.\n\nBackground\n==========\n\nI bought an expensive computer networking product, some years ago. The firmware hadn't been updated since, so I decided to do so. The manufacturer puts new firmware on their website, together with \"release notes\" (guidance and instructions concerning the update, and procedures to follow in updating). The instructions state simply, to upload the firmware to the device, and restart the device. No warnings or caveats are stated.\n\nOn following these instructions, the product was rendered inoperable \\- \"bricked\". I found numerous threads on the manufacturers support website where many people had exoerienced this exact same issue, often with this exact same model, over a period of months or years. The manufacturers staff members' response was invariably that this update, applied as in the release notes, can irreparably break the product in some circumstances. Specifically, if the product still had old/original firmware, then the procedure in the release notes would render the product irreparable. A completely different procedure, not in the notes or mentioned by them, should be followed instead. If the broken product was in warranty, it would be replaced, but otherwise nothing could be done except pay the very high price for out\\-of\\-warranty replacement/repair.\n\nI'm happy to rely on tort in my own actual claim (see below), but it never hurts to know your law fully. I am trying to understand whether any specific product safety laws apply as well, since the Consumer Rights Act 2015 seems to exclude this (it falls in various loopholes?):\n\n* CRA2015 for the update and release notes as \"digital content\". But s.33 says it is only covered if a price was paid (1\\), it was supplied free \"with\" other paid items (2\\), or it is not generally available unless some paid item was purchased (2\\). The update was free, it was supplied separately and independently from any paid product, and it is available freely to all, so this doesn't seem applicable.\n* CRA 2015 for the update and release notes as a \"service\". But s.48 seems to require a contract, and no explicit contract was required to be clicked for download or installation. Would a court impute a contract, sufficient to meet this requirement, regardless? If not, this doesn't seem applicable either.\n\nNegligence seems clear (duty of care, reliance, defective software usage instructions known for years to cause serious damage, defective instructions continue to be provided with no warning, predictable damage resulted), so I'm happy about my own actual case, but I'm really surprised not to find any UK consumer protection for harm\\-causing product updates if they are made freely available after and separate from purchase, by a manufacturer, as this is such a common situation.\n\nAre there any UK consumer laws or product safety/quality laws that might be applicable to free but defective software update?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It might be a lot late now yet I suggest that relying solely on your interpretation, the manufacturer appears to have negligently offered goods or services without warning you of known potential consequences.\n\nThat you had no contract with the manufacturer should not matter any more than if I rocked up on your doorstep and offered to clean your car, with or without mentioning that I proposed to use Agent Yellow, which then wrecked your paintwork.\n\nIf you really had no contract then how could the manufacturer make any conditions about what you did with the update you downloaded, including any conditions restricting liability?\n\nBeyond that I cannot go and you should consult a lawyer.\n\nIt seems fairly clear what happened in your case should be actionable but let's remember, whether it's *worth* taking action over is a very different Question.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a consumer who downloaded a free firmware update from a manufacturer's website that rendered their expensive networking product inoperable, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal recourse in the UK?\n\nA) The consumer has no legal recourse because the firmware update was provided for free and therefore falls outside the scope of the Consumer Rights Act 2015.\n\nB) The consumer can only claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 if they can prove an explicit contract was formed when downloading the update.\n\nC) The consumer's best course of action is likely a claim in negligence, as the manufacturer had a duty of care and provided defective instructions known to cause damage.\n\nD) The consumer is automatically entitled to a replacement product under UK product safety laws, regardless of warranty status.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the Consumer Rights Act 2015 may not apply directly due to the update being free and potentially not covered under digital content or service provisions, the consumer still has a strong case for negligence. The manufacturer had a duty of care, provided instructions known to cause damage in certain circumstances, and failed to warn users of potential risks.

I rent an apartment with far too few spots for the amount of people in my building. This is remedied by there being excess spots in front of other apartment buildings within the same property (same company, same apartments, different buildings). However, people are just too lazy to walk the extra 100 feet so rather than parking in one of the open spots elsewhere, they park in the fire lane in front of the building. The lanes are very narrow to drive in as it is so I\u2019ve been trapped and unable to leave for work some days because those cars block me off. I call the management office, they don\u2019t open until 8 but I have to leave for work at 6 to get there. So nothing gets done in time.

By the time management sees the email, the cars gone and they say they\u2019ll \u201cgive them a warning\u201d but nothing changes.\n\nCan I have cars towed that are illegally parked in the fire lane overnight in front of my apartment? I\u2019m tired of relying on management who does nothing and having to miss or be incredibly late to work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Had a similar situation in a home I lived in. We lived on the street closest to a High School's footbal stadium and the inadequate parking would cause fans to park in a manner that took a street that could handle bi\\-direction traffic to an unsigned one\\-way road. The school did make frequent announcements that fans parked there could be towed (it helped that I was one of many alums that lived there). The police informed me that unless there was some signage, they actually couldn't do anything. So you have the benefit of signage that says people cannot park there.\n\nI would recommend calling the fire marshal. In Washington State (I assume your not in DC) the Fire Marshal is a division of the Washington State Patrol, the state police organization. Giving them a call in the evening when the parking is observably bad, will likely get the ball rolling. I would not expect towing, but I would expect to see tickets under offending vehicles if they come out.\n\nIf they fail too, I would start taking pictures of offending vehicles and present it to the local branch of WSP. I would minimize the inconvenience to your commute and the safety hazard of blocking space allocated for use by Emergency Service Vehicles. Try to get a name of someone who you can personally work with to assist you in the manner and who you can contact to report further issues. If they won't provide, ask if there is a way you can submit complaints to them.\n\nI would, after contacting the WSP, notify your building's staff in person and through e\\-mail, that you have made them aware of the situation and that they have taken no action on previous attempts and that you have gone to the WSP over this matter. This serves two purposes, first you are notifying the building managment of a potential violation of law (the fire code is a law and is there because it's easier to fight deadly fires by removing hazards that make fires deadly in the first place. If a fire truck is blocked from the fire lanes, the fire fighters are going to have to deal with that before they can get to doing their real job.). The other benefit is to create a paper trail, which you can present to the WSP to show the building is compliant in fire code violations despite being made aware of the problem. Your building is likely not doing anything because there's no documentation that they are aware of the problem, so they can claim they didn't know anything about this if it goes to court.\n\nFinally, I would recommend you seek an attorney that specializes in teneat or real estate matters and ask for a consultation. You do not have to employ their services, but most law offices will have a \"client intake\" process where you can explain your case and they can offer you some advice or other avenues. Even if you don't intend to sue your landlord(s), and even if you are reporting a crime to police, having a lawyer when dealing with the police and landlords can only help as they will be able to better advise you so you can do this safely without exposing yourself to civil or criminal liability. You can bet they have lawyers that will be more than willing to screw you for their clients.

[This 2020 ACLU article](https://www.aclu.org/news/reproductive-freedom/a-tennessee-law-requires-doctors-to-lie-to-their-patients-were-suing) summarizes several examples.\n\n> In four states, doctors have to tell their patients that abortion increases the risk of breast cancer, even though that is factually wrong. Eight states insist that physicians include \u201cnegative emotional response\u201d among the lists of risks associated with the procedure, even though mainstream medical associations have uniformly determined that this is false. Four states require doctors to lie to their patients about the risk having an abortion could have on their future fertility.\n\nThese are clearly established as lies by actual medical research, e.g. obtaining an abortion objectively does not increase one's risk of breast cancer.\n\nAs Martin points out in the comments, if doctors are permitted to explain that the information is false they can avoid actually lying. \"I am required by law to tell you that if you get an abortion you are more likely to die by suicide or breast cancer, but that is not actually true.\"\n\nI am unfortunately unfamiliar with the best way to find the actual text of each state's laws, so I am unable to determine if any of the abortion laws in question forbid doctors from revealing that false information is false.

However, a \"lie\" in the legal sense would be a statement of fact that is objectively and demonstrably false. There are lots of disclosure laws that require lots of people in different professions to do and say all kinds of things to and for their clients that might even be widely regarded as stupid, but that does not make them lies.\n\nTaking the ACLU's claims at face value (I'm sure these laws exist but I'm not going to take the time to look them up), requiring doctors to disclose potential negative side effects of a drug or surgical procedure to a patient is clearly within the legislature's authority to do if they've determined that there is sufficient evidence to warrant it. It's ultimately up to the courts to decide, but courts generally give wide latitude to legislatures and administrative agencies in this regard unless the statute is egregiously unreasonable.\n\nEither way, the doctor does not have to assert the disclosures as statements of fact, and they are free to tell their patients that they do not believe them to be true, so there is no compelled speech involved.\n\n---\n\nI'm not trying to express support or opposition to abortion here, so please don't start a dumpster fire in the comments. But the ACLU article you linked is a straight\\-up opinion piece. The ACLU believes that the statements are lies. There are a lot of weasel words just in the paragraph you quoted. Out of curiosity, I did a search on their claims.\n\nThe top search result for \"abortion and breast cancer\" is [this article from the American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html), which contains this statement:\n\n> The results of studies looking at the possible link between breast cancer and induced abortion often differ depending on how the study was done. Cohort studies and studies that used records to determine the history of abortions have not found an increased risk. Some case\\-control studies, however, have found an increase in risk.\n\nIn other words, we don't really know for sure. So it's not as \"factually wrong\" as the ACLU says.\n\nA search for \"abortion effects on future fertility\" yields [this study from the U.S. National Institute of Health](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2225607/)\n\n> ... Women whose pregnancy is terminated by dilatation and evacuation may have an increased risk of subsequent premature delivery and a low birthweight baby. Very little has been published and no conclusions can be made regarding the effects of instillation procedures and repeat abortions on future reproduction.\n\nSo there's definitely a risk from a *particular kind* of abortion (a D\\&E, which are performed usually for mid\\-late term pregnancies), but no significant risk from an instillation abortion (a vacuum catheter in early pregancy). This study is from 1990, so medication\\-induced abortions were not available then. It was just the first search result that wasn't a news article.\n\nAnd then there's the \"negative emotional response\" risk. I'm not even going to tackle that one it's so weaselly. What does that even mean exactly? \"...Mainstream medical associations have uniformly determined that this is false.\" Which medical associations? And what constitutes \"mainstream?\" I highly doubt there is uniformity of opinion.\n\n---\n\nBottom line is, no, a law cannot require you to lie.

Which of the following best describes the legal basis for the HOA's claim to recover these fees?\n\nA) The HOA cannot recover the fees because they did not directly pay them out of pocket.\nB) The HOA can recover the fees based on the principle of subrogation, where the insurer stands in the shoes of the insured.\nC) The HOA can only recover a portion of the fees that represents their insurance deductible.\nD) The HOA's insurance company, not the HOA, must directly sue the homeowner to recover the fees.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In this scenario, the principle of subrogation applies. Even though the HOA did not directly pay the legal fees, their insurer paid on their behalf. The law treats this situation as if the HOA had paid the fees themselves. The insurance company \"stands in the shoes\" of the HOA, and the HOA retains the right to recover these fees from the losing party. This is a standard practice in insurance law and maintains the integrity of the legal process by preventing the losing party from benefiting from the winner's insurance coverage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the fact that the HOA didn't directly pay the fees doesn't negate their right to recover them. Option C is wrong because the HOA can recover the full amount of fees, not just a deductible.

This means that, outside of unique situations like the military, an employer cannot keep you as an employee against your will. Any contract that denies you the right to quit your job is illegal. A contract might require a reasonable notice period or something along those lines, but it cannot bind you to work for the company for as long as the company wants.\n\nWhile you can sign an employment contract without it being involuntary servitude, the Thirteenth Amendment is also generally read to mean that your employer can only sue you for money if you refuse to work. A US court cannot order you to work for an employer and threaten to hold you in contempt of court if you refuse.

The question is not whether the policy have an *abstract* \"civil\" duty to enforce the law, but whether they have a *specific* \"constitutional\" duty to do so. If they do have such a specific duty, then, as they OP says, they could \"be sued for not doing their job.\"\n\nAs ohwilleke explains thoroughly, the answer to this question is \"no.\" The Supreme Court has consistently held there is no constitutional right to police enforcement of the law. In particular, the SCt has held that police aren't violating the 14th Amendment when they don't \"do their job.\" According to the Court, someone who is hurt when the police don't enforce the law, is *not* deprived of \"life, liberty or property *without due process of law.*\" This in turn means that the people who are hurt can't sue the police under [\u00a71983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983), which allows people to sue state or local officials who violate their constitutional rights.\n\nAs you point out, the [Nevada statute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) clearly requires officers to make an arrest in some cases. However, this requirement is *not absolute;* the statute also creates an exception to the requirement:\n\n> a peace officer *shall,* **unless mitigating circumstances exist,** arrest a person when the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has...committed a battery upon his or her spouse..\n\nThe statute goes on to explicitly exempt the officer and her department from liability if she decides not to make an arrest:\n\n> *Nothing in this section* shall be construed to *impose liability* upon a peace officer or his or her employer for a determination made in good faith by the peace officer *not to arrest a person* pursuant to this section.\n\nThus, the statute sends mixed signals to police officers. On the one hand, it requires them to make arrests in some domestic violence cases; on the other hand, it says they are not liable if they ignore this requirement.\n\nTaken together, the Nevada statute and the SCt's decisions mean people who are hurt if police don't make an arrest under 171\\.137 cannot sue the police under either state or federal law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of domestic violence laws and police obligations, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Police officers have an absolute constitutional duty to make arrests in all domestic violence cases, and failing to do so always results in liability under federal law.\n\nB) State laws requiring arrests in certain domestic violence cases override any Supreme Court decisions regarding police duties and create an enforceable right for victims.\n\nC) While some states have laws requiring arrests in certain domestic violence situations, these laws often include exceptions and do not necessarily create liability for officers who choose not to make an arrest.\n\nD) The Supreme Court has ruled that police have a specific constitutional duty to enforce domestic violence laws, but state legislatures can choose whether to implement this duty.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the complex interplay between state laws, Supreme Court decisions, and police obligations in domestic violence cases.

I was asked if we had a way to track how many users have declined analytics in case we needed that information for an audit.\n\nWe are, of course, storing a strictly necessary cookie to remember a decline decision on the user's browser (client side only). However, wouldn't collecting server side analytics about a user declining analytics (even if anonymous) be an inherit violation of GDPR.\n\nThe more I think about this the more I'm getting a headache. Would a GDPR audit ever ask for this information or would we shoot ourselves in the foot by collecting this information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you could *count* decline\\-events, but not *track* users who declined tracking. But I also think such information isn't useful for demonstrating compliance. Therefore, you should avoid storing extra data about people who do not give consent.\n\nWhen consent is required for analytics.\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe GDPR provides a general framework for processing personal data. The ePrivacy Directive (ePD) overrides this general framework when it comes to cookies and similar technologies related to accessing information on the end user's device. Per ePD, such access is only allowed when it is strictly necessary to provide the service explicitly requested by a user, otherwise consent is required. Thus, analytics cookies require consent and setting an analytics\\-declined cookie is strictly necessary.\n\nBut this consent requirement relates specifically to storage cookies, not to collecting analytics data. Thus, you might have a legitimate interest in collecting data with cookie\\-less analytics, which could involve counting cookie\\-consent decline events. Unfortunately, most analytics systems collect very broad categories of data and cannot be limited to a necessary subset. Even such limited analytics (unless they are truly strictly necessary for operating the site) should support an opt\\-out. I don't think you could legitimately gather analytics about such opt\\-out events.\n\nGDPR audits.\n------------\n\nYour motivation for collecting statistics about consent\\-decline events is to be prepared for a GDPR audit. This is probably not necessary, but it depends.\n\nIt might be useful to distinguish between internal/voluntary audits and data protection audits by the supervisory authority.\n\n* You might voluntarily review your compliance to convince stakeholders that you're compliant, and such voluntary audits might be part of the *appropriate technical and organizational measures* a data controller has implemented in accordance with Art 24, Art 25, and Art 32 GDPR.\n\nYou should collect any statistics you need for this purpose, e.g. to ensure that the opt\\-in rate looks realistic. But since you can set the parameters of this audit, it makes no sense to collect data \u201cjust in case\u201d.\n* Under Art 58(1\\), your supervisory authority can audit your data processing and can compel you to provide any information it requires. This is similar to how a tax authority can compel you to produce business records for auditing purposes.\n\nThis is closely related with your general obligation to be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR (Art 5(2\\)). More specifically, the controller is required per Art 7(1\\) to be able to demonstrate that the data subjects have given valid consent, but does not prescribe how to demonstrate this.\n\nHow to demonstrate that valid consent was given.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFor demonstrating that consent was given, there are no clear best practices. However, this topic is briefly discussed in [EDPB guidelines 05/2020 on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en). They recommend that you retain records about the following:\n\n* that a data subject in a given case has consented\n* how consent was obtained\n* when consent was obtained\n* information provided to data subject at the time\n* that the controller's workflow meets all relevant criteria for valid consent\n\nSome of these are process\\-level concerns about how you ask for consent. For example, you might record video walkthroughs of your consent management solution to demonstrate how consent can be declined, given, and revoked. You should definitely keep a version history of the text and information that was displayed to users when they were asked for consent. I think you should also be able to explain in your front\\-end code how the result from your consent management solution is used to load relevant features (and that they aren't loaded before consent is given). If a feature or service is made conditional on consent, it might be good to have a short written analysis that consent is still freely given under the requirements of Art 7(4\\).\n\nBut other aspects relate to the individual data subject and the individual consent\\-giving event. Some consent management solutions send a small record about the consent to a backend server where it is stored with a timestamp, so that it can be later traced that and when consent was given. I've also seen consent management tools that show a timeline of events to the user (when consent was requested, and when consent for which purpose was given and revoked). I think such detailed insight into an pseudonymous individual's consent status is a very powerful way to demonstrate compliance.\n\nWhat is not relevant here is information about data subjects who declined consent in the first place. Consent means opt\\-in. The default is that no consent is given. To demonstrate that consent was obtained in a valid manner, information about data subjects who didn't consent isn't necessary or useful.\n\nSo I expect that you would be fine in an audit without collecting such data. In fact, the lack of a clear purpose and necessity for collecting this data could be argued to be without legal basis and violate the GDPR's data minimization principle.

But from what I read online it seems that a processor is anyone that deals with any personal data, even partial data, as part of a service provided to the controller. So it sounds like *everyone* that deal with personal data as part of their job is a processor, except the end users of the service. But since processors must be bound by a specific contract to deal with the needs of the controller (article 28 says \"processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller), then I'm afraid it will soon become a huge mess with a gazillion contracts to sign.\n\nFor example, John Doe has a website with a contact form. The contact form collects data, and the end user should accept the privacy policy written by John Doe. John Doe is the controller. However, John Doe's website is managed by a web agency! Is this web agency a processor? I guess so. So John doe needs to write a contract and have the web agency sign it. If every website owner does this, the web agency will have to read and sign hundreds of contracts. But the web agency hosts the sites on a web hosting provider, which in turn becomes another processor! And they use Gmail, provided by Google, which in turn is yet another processor that will have to sign millions of contracts. And so on, in an potentially endless cycle, just thinking that if you read your work email from your iPhone you might have to send a contract to Apple too. \n\nIt seems a huge mess to me, but I'm not sure I get it right. It looks like everyone is a processor except the end user, but the confusing thing is that the the law seems to say that it's the controller the one who decides the contractual terms, so it's not just a matter of accepting a privacy policy like we have been doing so far. So far, Google has provided a service to you, and you agreed to their privacy policy. Now it seems it's you, if you are a controller or a processor, that have to come up with a contract and Google has to accept it (if they want to). Like it's the other way around compared to the usual privacy policies. Of course this will probably never happen, and Google will probably come up with predefined contracts that both parties can agree on, but at that point what difference would there be between the contract required by GDPR and the usual privacy policies everyone has been using so far?\n\nI hope the question is clear enough. I'm basically very confused about the actual role and duties of processors in real\\-world scenarios.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You premise is correct. The processor is someone that processes data on your behalf, and since the GDPR definition of processing is extremely broad, that is about *every third party subcontractor* that you use for data processing, including various cloud providers.\n\n> I'm afraid it will soon become a huge mess with a gazillion contracts to sign.\n\nI disagree. Yes, the GDPR says that a contract between the controller and processor must exist, but [Article 28](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/) of the GDPR does not say anything about *how* the controller shall document these instructions. Basically, in cases like the one you describe where John Doe relies on a web agency for having a contact form on the web, there will be a standardized (by the web agency) service agreement between the John Doe (controller) and the web agency (processor). There is nothing stopping the parties from agreeing that this service agreement that John Doe accepted as part of the onboarding procedure is *also* the DPA as required by the GDPR.\n\nPutting something like the following in the service agreement would do it:\n\n> The parties agree that this Service Agreement between You (controller) and Us (processor) set out Your *complete and final instructions* to Us in relation to the processing of Personal Data and that processing outside the scope of these instructions (if any) shall require prior written agreement between You and Us. You also agree that We may engage Sub\\-processors to process Personal Data on Your behalf. The Sub\\-processors currently engaged by Us and authorized by You are listed in Annex A.\n\nI think we will se a lot of amendments in service contracts as the GDPR gets better understood, but I don't really see a flood of DPAs in *addition* to these amended service contracts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the GDPR, what is the most efficient way for a controller (like John Doe with his website) to establish a legally compliant relationship with a processor (like a web agency managing his website)?\n\nA) The controller must draft a separate, detailed Data Processing Agreement (DPA) for each processor they work with.\n\nB) The processor must provide a standardized privacy policy that the controller agrees to, similar to pre-GDPR practices.\n\nC) The existing service agreement between the controller and processor can be amended to include GDPR-compliant instructions for data processing.\n\nD) The controller must obtain individual consent from each end-user before allowing any third-party to process their data.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that while the GDPR requires a contract between controllers and processors, it doesn't specify the exact form this must take. It suggests that existing service agreements can be amended to include the necessary instructions for data processing, rather than creating separate contracts. This approach is more efficient and practical, especially for situations involving multiple processors or sub-processors. The example given shows how a clause can be added to a service agreement to cover GDPR requirements, including instructions for data processing and authorization for sub-processors.

The Supreme Court in Miranda didn't just decide that people had to be told their rights, for all rights in all contexts. Miranda applies just to 5th and 6th Amendment rights, in case a person is being held coercively. If you are free to go, you need not be apprised of your rights: so, if the police are just asking questions when you are not being held, they are not required to give a rights warning. Likewise, they are allowed to request permission to conduct a search. It is true than many people do not understand that a request is distinct from an order. A useful phrase to remember is \"Am I free to go?\". If the answer is no, you are busted and they can search you.

Notably, many US citizens live their entire lives without having a passport.\n\nA fairly brief search didn't turn up an explicit statement from an official government source that passport revocation does not affect US citizenship, but that is quite clearly the case if one reads between the lines of the fairly sizeable statutory and regulatory provisions governing both. Nationality law is codified at [8 USC 1401 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III), with the sections governing loss of nationality beginning at [8 USC 1481](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III/part-III). The regulations concerning nationality generally are found at [8 CFR 301 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/chapter-I/subchapter-C), but there are not many regulations concerning loss of nationality.\n\nPassport law is found in an entirely different title of the US Code, and titles are the highest level of division in the code. It is in [22 USC 411 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-4). There are provisions that restrict eligibility for a passport scattered around in there without any section applying specifically to passport revocation. That is found in the related regulations.\n\nPassport regulations are codified at [22 CFR Part 51](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/part-51), with revocation being the subject of [Subpart E, which is 51\\.60 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/part-51/subpart-E).\n\nThere may be an explicit statement in the regulations that passport revocation does not affect citizenship. I did not look very thoroughly. But a bit of logical reasoning shows why it must be so:\n\n1. The conditions for loss of US nationality are very well defined. They are also fairly tightly circumscribed by several decisions of the US supreme court in the decades following the second world war.\n2. The conditions for revocation of a passport are much less strict; as an example, a passport may be revoked under 22 CFR 51\\.62 and 51\\.60 if the bearer \"is the subject of an outstanding Federal warrant of arrest for a felony, including a warrant issued under the Federal Fugitive Felon Act (18 U.S.C. 1073\\).\"\n3. US nationality is required to hold a US passport, but US nationals do not need to have a US passport.\n4. Therefore, a US passport may be revoked for a reason that cannot lead to loss of US nationality, and, when that happens, US nationality is retained.\n5. The condition mentioned in point 2 is clearly insufficient for depriving someone of US nationality, not least because the subject of an arrest warrant is only suspected of having committed a crime. Depriving a suspect of their liberty is acceptable to the extent necessary to bring that person to trial, but further deprivations beyond that end would violate the constitution's guarantee of due process.\n\n---\n\nA word on \"nationality\" and \"citizenship\" in US law is in order, lest the use of the two terms seem inconsistent or arbitrary. US nationality is broader than US citizenship. All US citizens are US nationals, so loss of US nationality implies loss of US citizenship. However, there are some people who are US nationals without being US citizens, so it is more precise to speak of \"loss of nationality\" than \"loss of citizenship,\" and indeed that is the term used in US nationality law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between U.S. passport revocation and U.S. citizenship?\n\nA) Revocation of a U.S. passport automatically results in the loss of U.S. citizenship.\n\nB) U.S. passport revocation and loss of citizenship are governed by the same legal provisions in the U.S. Code.\n\nC) A U.S. passport can be revoked for reasons that do not meet the criteria for loss of U.S. nationality.\n\nD) All U.S. nationals must maintain a valid passport to retain their citizenship status.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because U.S. passport revocation and loss of citizenship are governed by separate legal provisions, and the conditions for passport revocation are less strict than those for loss of nationality.

The Deputy Director earning $95,000 does not meet any of the three criteria for mandatory listing. They are not an officer, director, or trustee; their salary is below both the $150,000 threshold for key employees and the $100,000 threshold for highest compensated employees.\n\nB) Incorrect. While the Director of Business Communications earns over $100,000, they would only need to be listed if they were among the five highest compensated employees. Without more information about other salaries in the organization, we can't assume they meet this criterion.\n\nC) Correct. The Executive Director must be listed for two reasons. First, they likely qualify as an officer of the organization, which requires listing regardless of compensation. Second, with a salary of $180,000, they exceed both the $150,000 threshold for key employees and the $100,000 threshold for highest compensated employees.\n\nD) Incorrect. Although the Program Manager earns over $100,000, like the Director of Business Communications, we don't have enough information to determine if they are among the five highest compensated employees.

If the homicide is \"culpable\", it is an offense (crime). In the described scenario, it might be culpable homicide if the death was due to \"criminal negligence\". That would be the case if in doing a thing, the person \"shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons\".\n\nWe've now reached the end of what statutory law has to say about the question. Court cases take us [a bit further in understanding criminal negligence](http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CriminalNegligence.aspx). The wisdom of the courts is distilled to ts essence in jury instructions, which say\n\n> The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's\n>  conduct showed a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonable\n>  person in the circumstances; and that a reasonable person in the same\n>  circumstances would have foreseen that this conduct posed a risk of\n>  bodily harm.\n\n[R. v.

It requires some degree of awareness or advertence to the\n>  threat to the lives or safety of others or alternatively a wilful\n>  blindness to that threat which is culpable in light of the gravity of\n>  the risk assumed.\n\nUltimately, though, the fact\\-finder must evaluate the behavior against a highly subjective standard as to \"what a reasonable man would do\". I cannot imagine a scenario where shoving a person realistically could lead to them falling into traffic and getting killed but there the shoving was ordinary horseplay. Pushing a person in the direction of oncoming traffic is abnormal behavior that shows shocking disregard for the probable harm caused to another.

I reported this unauthorized access to the bank's manager directly, who said that he would put an alert on my account to make sure that it does not happen again and that he would get back to me after an internal investigation was carried out. However, he never got back to me and never returned any of my calls again. A few months later, I opened a new bank account at another bank and transferred most of my funds to it. My mother then asked me shortly thereafter why I withdrew most of my money from my original bank account. Hence, the problem was not solved \\-\\- my bank account information is still being accessed without my permission and my privacy is being violated. Since I already reported this info to the bank's manager, I do not know what else to do to pursue any legal action towards the rogue employee who has been accessing (and releasing information) about my bank account to my mother. I want to know if I can pursue any legal options against the bank, my mother, or both. I do not want to close my original bank account because this would constitute a major inconvenience (since my wife, kids, and I bank there).

See for example [ch. 35 of Title 12](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/chapter-35). The bank cannot claim \"It's not our fault, an employee did it\" (the Latin for this is \"[respondeat superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respondeat_superior)\", whereby a part is also responsible for the acts of their agents). As far as I know, there is no law against asking for information that can't be given. This does assume, however, that your mother does not have a legal right to the information (which could arise from some form of co\\-signing). Also, would assume that they have a normal privacy policy, and not one where they say \"We will tell your mother if she asks\" (they would have [informed you of that](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/6801), so read the privacy policy).

According to the principle of respondeat superior, the bank is legally responsible for the actions of its employees in the course of their employment. The bank has a legal obligation to maintain customer confidentiality, and if an employee breaches this, the customer's recourse is to sue the bank for damages, not the individual employee. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the customer's legal action should be directed at the bank, not the individual employee.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, as stated in the information, there is generally no law against asking for information that can't be given.

One might have the opinion that judicial review is just the unelected branch of government overriding decisions of the executive (or their officials). If so, that's rather undemocratic. If you believe that judges are merely applying their preconceived opinions in coming to a ruling, then there is no point studying it in detail (hence lazy).\n\nFalsifiability is a useful property in a theory. If I believe that there is no point studying the rulings because judges are just pulling answers out of the air, then there isn't any evidence you can provide to convince me otherwise. I might be correct in my belief but it isn't one based on evidence.\n\nWhat the author is arguing is that, if you're a student of the law, you need to study rulings in detail and look at the statutes, authorities and precedents quoted.

Therefore, both wills are executed as if the spouse predeceased them. The church receives $10,000 from John's will and another $10,000 from Jane's will, totaling $20,000.

Courts don't often look kindly on actions whose sole purpose is enabling someone else to do something that is prohibited. If you're making a script that helps people do something they're allowed to do, in a way that's better for at least somebody and makes nobody worse off, that's often a different story.\n\nMajor websites will generally indicate whether or not you're allowed to do this. \n\nSome sites are fairly strict about prohibiting scraping (e.g. Craigslist, which [at one point shut down Padmapper](http://blog.padmapper.com/2012/06/22/bye-bye-craigslist/)'s alternative more\\-useful presentation of their content). \n\nOthers, like Wikipedia, much more actively encourage reusing content from their sites as long as you meet [certain conditions such as a link back to the original source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates a script that scrapes content from various news websites and reformats it for easier reading on tablets.

For a federal case, that prosecutor would be a [United States Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney) or [Assistant United States Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_United_States_Attorney) (AUSA). For a state case, they'd be a [District Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney), Deputy District Attorney, or Assistant District Attorney.\n\n### In civil cases\n\nGenerally, the Federal government would be represented in civil cases by lawyers with no special title. In many cases, these would be lawyers working for the [Civil Division of the Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/civil/about), but other agencies also have lawyers to represent them in more specialized litigation\u2014for example, the [IRS Chief Counsel's Office](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/chief-counsel).\n\nA state government would be represented in civil cases by lawyers from the [state Attorney General](https://www.usa.gov/state-attorney-general)'s office ([here](https://oag.ca.gov/office) is California's, for instance).\n\n### Before the Supreme Court\n\nWhen the Federal government is before the Supreme Court, they are represented by lawyers from the [Office of the Solicitor General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States). That could be the Solicitor General themself, a Deputy Solicitor General, or an Assistant to the Solicitor General. In cases where the government is *not* a party, the office may be asked for its input on a case by the Supreme Court via a [Call for the Views of the Solicitor General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States#Call_for_the_Views_of_the_Solicitor_General).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is INCORRECT regarding government legal representation in the United States?\n\nA) In federal criminal cases, the government is represented by United States Attorneys or Assistant United States Attorneys.\n\nB) The Office of the Solicitor General represents the federal government before the Supreme Court in all cases, regardless of whether the government is a party to the case.\n\nC) State governments are typically represented in civil cases by lawyers from the state Attorney General's office.\n\nD) The Civil Division of the Department of Justice often represents the federal government in civil cases, but other agencies may have their own specialized lawyers for certain litigation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is incorrect.

(b) is guilty of a Class H felony if the person under 18 years of age under par. (b) discharges the firearm and the discharge causes death to himself, herself or another.  \n> \n> (d) A person under 17 years of age who has violated this subsection is subject to the provisions of ch. 938 unless jurisdiction is waived under s. 938\\.18 or the person is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of criminal jurisdiction under s. 938\\.183\\.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) \u2002  \n> \n> (a) This section does not apply to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a dangerous weapon when the dangerous weapon is being used in target practice under the supervision of an adult or in a course of instruction in the traditional and proper use of the dangerous weapon under the supervision of an adult. This section does not apply to an adult who transfers a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age for use only in target practice under the adult's supervision or in a course of instruction in the traditional and proper use of the dangerous weapon under the adult's supervision.  \n> \n> (b) This section does not apply to a person under 18 years of age who is a member of the armed forces or national guard and who possesses or is armed with a dangerous weapon in the line of duty. This section does not apply to an adult who is a member of the armed forces or national guard and who transfers a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age in the line of duty.  \n> \n> (c) This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941\\.28 or is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304 and 29\\.593\\. This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304 and 29\\.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941\\.28\\.\n\n2 things to note:\n\n* (1\\) takes care to include, in the list of dangerous weapons: nunchaku, shuriken and manrikigusari. While the first 2 are more or less familiar to everyone knows anything about Japanese martial arts, the last one had to be looked up by everyone following the case to discover that it's the \"secret weapon of the Ninja\"(even more than the shuriken).\n* (3\\.c) says that the whole of this entire section applies\\[adding the brackets to make following the formal logic easier] **only** if (the person under 18 is in violation of 941\\.28\\[barrel length under 16 inches]) **or** (is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304\\[Restrictions on hunting and use of firearms by persons under 16 years of age] **and** 29\\.593\\[Requirement for certificate of accomplishment to obtain hunting approval]).\n\nIn programming terms(for those so inclined), 3\\.C could be written as:\n\n```\nIF ((barrelLengthInches < 16) OR (huntingUnder16Applies AND huntingCertificateApplies))\nTHEN statute948.60Applies\nELSE statute948.60DoesNotApply\n\n```\n\nSince the barrel length is over 16'' and Rittenhouse is over 16 and no hunting permit was required for his activities, the whole section of the law did not apply. Assistant District Attorney James Kraus [argued](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/explainer-judge-drop-rittenhouse-gun-charge-81285031) that the exception renders the state\u2019s prohibition on minors possessing dangerous weapons meaningless. In essence, that the legislators drafting that law spent too much time watching cheesy early 90's action movies and thinking of how to save Wisconsinites from the Ninja threat, to draft the law properly, so it should be read according to its intent from the title of the section.\n\nHowever, there is a binding Common Law precedent, dating back from the 16th century called the \"Rule of Lenity\", also called \"Strict Constructionism\" in the US, whereby if the legislature screws up, it's the legislature's problem. In the original case, the law in England forbade \"felonious stealing of **Horses**, Geldings or Mares\". A thief was caught, but argued that since he only stole **one** horse and the law specified horses, the law didn't apply to him. He was let off and the law hastily rectified. Pre\\-revolutionary Common Law precedent is binding in the US and it was re\\-affirmed multiple times, e.g. United States v. Wiltberger, where a US sailor got off with killing another US sailor in a Chinese estuary, because the law only applied on the \"high seas\". So, the charge was tossed and the defense didn't press the issue further.\n\n**However**, the really interesting bit is that even though it didn't get to be argued since Rittenhouse was 17, the way the law is actually written, this section **only** applies if (huntingUnder16Applies **AND** huntingCertificateApplies). That means that there is literally **nothing** in Wisconsin barring a **12** year old(under 12 is separately forbidden in the 29\\.304/huntingUnder16Applies section) from possessing and using an AR\\-15(or AK\\-47\\), as long as the barrel is \\>16'' and a hunting license isn't required for the activity.\n\nI think that the legislature will amend the law with haste, before it can be tested on 12 year olds.\n\nP.S. the other guy who gave him the gun will get off with this precedent too, since the statute for his charge is:\n\n> This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304 and 29\\.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941\\.28\\.\n\ni.e. the same 3 sub\\-sections as for Rittenhouse.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Wisconsin, under what circumstances would statute 948.60 (Possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18) NOT apply to a 15-year-old possessing a rifle?\n\nA) If the rifle has a barrel length of 18 inches and the teenager is not hunting\nB) If the rifle has a barrel length of 14 inches and the teenager has a hunting certificate\nC) If the rifle has a barrel length of 16 inches and the teenager is hunting without a certificate\nD) If the rifle has a barrel length of 15 inches and the teenager is hunting with a certificate\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: According to the statute, section 948.60 applies only if the person under 18 is in violation of s. 941.28 (barrel length under 16 inches) OR is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 (restrictions on hunting and use of firearms by persons under 16 years of age) AND 29.593 (requirement for certificate of accomplishment to obtain hunting approval).\n\nIn option A, the barrel length is over 16 inches (so not in violation of s. 941.28), and since the teenager is not hunting, compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593 is not relevant. Therefore, the statute would not apply in this case.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the barrel length is under 16 inches, which would trigger the application of the statute.\n\nOption C is incorrect because for a 15-year-old, both hunting restrictions (29.304) and certificate requirements (29.593) would apply, and non-compliance with both would trigger the statute.\n\nOption D is incorrect for the same reason as B - the barrel length is under 16 inches, which would make the statute applicable regardless of hunting status or certification."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80414/is-the-scarborough-fair-melody-really-in-the-public-domain", "docs_id": 80414, "title": "Is the Scarborough Fair Melody Really in the Public Domain?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to Wikimedia Commons:\n\n[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scarborough\\-Fair\\-Melody.png](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scarborough-Fair-Melody.png)\n\nthe melody to the tune Scarborough Fair (which had been popularized in the 1960s by Simon and Garfunkel) is in the public domain.\n\nIs this claim correct; and if so, can someone today write a new set of lyrics to accompany the basis of the said melody, and publish it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Yes**\n\nBoth melody and lyrics source back to the middle ages, as for instance described [here](https://www.liveabout.com/scarborough-fair-traditional-simon-and-garfunkel-1322515).

If the copyright holder stops offering the work under BSD terms, that does not lessen the fact that you *already did* receive the work under BSD terms. The copyright holder may choose to stop distributing new copies to other people under the old license, but the old license grant offered to you in the past will persist, unless either\n\n1. the license expires, or\n2. the licencor explicitly revokes your license grant.\n\nThe BSD license (and any OSI\\-approved license) does not have an expiration date, so we do not need to worry about the first possibility.\n\nA license can be revoked only if either\n\n1. the terms of the license explicitly allow the licencor to do so, or\n2. the license was granted in such a way that the licencor received no economic consideration for the license grant.\n\nThe BSD license is silent on revocability, so we must see whether there is economic consideration involved. According to [*Jacobsen v. Katzer*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17776182574171214893), a public open\\-source license grant may have economic consideration, even absent any exchange of money:\n\n> Traditionally, copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money. The lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration, however. There are substantial benefits, including economic benefits, to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties. For example, program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge. Similarly, a programmer or company may increase its national or international reputation by incubating open source projects. Improvement to a product can come rapidly and free of charge from an expert not even known to the copyright holder.\n\n(See also [Are licenses irrevocable by default?](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/q/4012/50) on OpenSource.SE.)\n\nThus, there is a strong possibility that there is consideration involved in your case, and the licencor may not be able to revoke the license already granted to you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company releases an open-source product under the BSD license.

Once a user receives software under the BSD license, that license grant persists even if the company later changes its licensing model. The BSD license does not have an expiration date and does not explicitly allow for revocation. Additionally, according to legal precedent (Jacobsen v.

Therefore, existing users can continue to use, modify, and distribute the software under the original BSD terms, regardless of the company's new licensing model for future releases.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the company cannot retroactively revoke the license for existing users.

Could Stripe successfully sue the new company for using such a slogan?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A slogan such as \"The Stripe of Bitcoin\" might well be taken to indicate that the seller of a product or service is trading on the good reputation associates with the mark \"stripe\".

One can, for example market a soft drink with the tag \"*The cola that's better than Coke*\" without permission from Coca\\-cola (which i doubt anyone would ever get). This is because when a marketer says \"X is better than Y\" no one reasonably thinks X is sponsored or approved by Y, nor will anyone be lead by this tag into thinking that X and Y are the same.\n\nOther forms of ***nominative use*** are also allowed without permission from the trademark holder.

Instead, it seems to position the new company as a crypto equivalent of Stripe, which could be seen as unfairly benefiting from Stripe's established brand reputation. The proximity of the industries involved (fintech and crypto) increases the likelihood of customer confusion, making this use potentially infringing."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82131/will-twitters-lawsuit-against-elon-musk-allow-him-to-force-disclosure-of-the-bo", "docs_id": 82131, "title": "Will Twitter&#39;s lawsuit against Elon Musk allow him to force disclosure of the bot data he was seeking from Twitter?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Elon Musk made an offer to Twitter to buy the company.

In a legal dispute like this, the court is likely to focus on the terms of the original purchase agreement and what data Twitter was obligated to disclose under those terms. The discovery phase will probably be limited to information relevant to determining whether Twitter complied with its contractual obligations.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the court is unlikely to compel disclosure of data beyond what was required in the original agreement, as that would not be directly relevant to the case.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while Twitter may attempt to protect some information as proprietary, they cannot easily avoid disclosing data that is material to the case and was part of the original agreement.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because Musk will not have unrestricted access to Twitter's data. The discovery process is controlled by the court and limited to relevant information."}}
