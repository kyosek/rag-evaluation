Another familiar example where this is seen is on [checks](https://www.huntington.com/Personal/checking/checks/how-to-write-a-check).\n\nIt serves as a sort of \"redundancy check\", to help catch errors where either the words or the numerals could have been incorrectly transcribed. Of course, one could ask why similar redundancy isn't used to avoid errors in other contexts; there doesn't seem to be a good answer for this besides \"tradition\".\n\nSome people feel the practice is obsolete and should be abandoned, e.g. [https://www.butlersnow.com/2020/04/five\\-5\\-reasons\\-to\\-stop\\-writing\\-numbers\\-like\\-this/](https://www.butlersnow.com/2020/04/five-5-reasons-to-stop-writing-numbers-like-this/).",

The primary purpose of writing numbers in both digits and words in legal documents is to serve as a redundancy check and help catch transcription errors. This practice provides a way to verify the accuracy of the number by comparing the digit and word forms, reducing the likelihood of mistakes in important numerical information.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because, while the practice may contribute to a formal appearance, this is not its primary purpose.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because accommodating different reader preferences is not the main reason for this practice. The redundancy is meant for error-checking rather than reader convenience.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because, while this practice is common, it is not a mandatory legal requirement for all official documents. Some argue that it is becoming obsolete and should be abandoned in certain contexts.\n\nThe practice originated as a safeguard against errors in important legal and financial documents, but its necessity in modern times is debated, with some professionals advocating for its discontinuation in favor of more streamlined writing."

The use may not clearly fall under fair use, as it's for a promotional video rather than educational or critical purposes. There's a risk that Disney, the owner of the \"Big Hero 6\" franchise, could view this as an unauthorized use of their intellectual property. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the legal situation. Option B is too extreme, as it's not necessarily a clear-cut trademark violation.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the 1987 movie, *The Untouchables*, there is a courtroom scene in which Al Capone's lawyer spontaneously announces that his client wants to change his plea to guilty and Capone displays his displeasure with that by attempting to attack his attorney. The change of plea is apparently accepted by the court.\n\nIs this just a movie fiction or did this happen in reality? Can an attorney change his client's plea without the client's consent?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Legally and ethically (in the United States), an attorney is required to have the consent of his client to change a plea. If that happened in open court, the plea would not have been accepted.\n\nThe pertinent part of Rule of Professional Conduct 1\\.2(a) which is essentially identical in ever U.S. state, states:\n\n\"A lawyer shall abide by a client's decision whether to settle a matter. In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client's decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.\"\n\nThere is also constitutional criminal procedure case law to that effect, although as a lawyer who practices exclusively in civil matters, it doesn't come as quickly to mind.\n\nNow, [Al Capone's plea bargain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capone#Imprisonment) took place on June 16, 1931\\. The pertinent ethical rules and constitutional criminal procedure cases may not have been in place at that time, and I certainly don't know the state of the law back then well enough to opine confidently upon it. Wikipedia recounts what happened (numerous citations omitted):\n\n> The IRS special investigation unit chose Frank J. Wilson to\n>  investigate Capone, with the focus on his spending. The key to\n>  Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the\n>  most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay\n>  tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was tried for\n>  tax evasion in 1930\\. Ralph spent the next three years in prison after\n>  being convicted in a two\\-week trial over which Wilkerson presided.\n>  Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. Crucially,\n>  during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer\n>  stated the income that Capone was willing to pay tax on for various\n>  years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance.\n>  Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a\n>  letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable\n>  income for certain years. On March 13, 1931, Capone was charged with\n>  income tax evasion for 1924, in a secret grand jury. On June 5, 1931,\n>  Capone was indicted by a federal grand jury on 22 counts of income tax\n>  evasion from 1925 through 1929; he was released on $50,000 bail. A\n>  week later, Eliot Ness and his team of Untouchables inflicted major\n>  financial damage on Capone's operations and led to his indictment on\n>  5,000 violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition laws).\n> \n> \n> On June 16, 1931, at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of\n>  Judge James Herbert Wilkerson, Capone plead guilty to income tax\n>  evasion and the 5,000 Volstead Act violations as part of a \u200b2 1\u20442\\-year\n>  prison sentence plea bargain. However, on July 30, 1931, Judge\n>  Wilkerson refused to honor the plea bargain, and Capone's counsel\n>  rescinded the guilty pleas. On the second day of the trial, Judge\n>  Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his\n>  client, saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so\n>  at his own risk. Wilkerson deemed that the 1930 letter to federal\n>  authorities could be admitted into evidence from a lawyer acting for\n>  Capone. Wilkerson later tried Capone only on the income tax evasion\n>  charges as he determined they took precedence over the Volstead Act\n>  charges.\n> \n> \n> Much was later made of other evidence, such as witnesses and ledgers,\n>  but these strongly implied Capone's control rather than stating it.\n>  Capone's lawyers, who had relied on the plea bargain Judge Wilkerson\n>  refused to honor and therefore had mere hours to prepare for the\n>  trial, ran a weak defense focused on claiming that essentially all his\n>  income was lost to gambling. This would have been irrelevant\n>  regardless, since gambling losses can only be subtracted from gambling\n>  winnings, but it was further undercut by Capone's expenses, which were\n>  well beyond what his claimed income could support; Judge Wilkerson\n>  allowed Capone's spending to be presented at very great length. The\n>  government charged Capone with evasion of $215,000 in taxes on a total\n>  income of $1,038,654, during the five\\-year period. Capone was\n>  convicted on three counts of income tax evasion on October 17, 1931,\n>  and was sentenced a week later to 11 years in federal prison, fined\n>  $50,000 plus $7,692 for court costs, and was held liable for $215,000\n>  plus interest due on his back taxes.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \"Fairness\" isn't mentioned in the constitution but due process is and I would think typically applies to a defendant \\- someone who has been accused of a crime.\n\nBut is there a concept where the prosecution can say the process wasn't fair to them??\n\nCase in point \\- the impeachment of Trump by the House of Reps. Pelosi is saying she won't send articles of impeachment to the Senate until she can be convinced that there will be a fair trial. \n\nBUT \\- in the trial, she and company will be prosecutors. The defendant will be Trump. Is it Trump's constitutional right to demand fairness or the right of those who want to prosecute him?\n\nIn short, you should be awarded fairness when you are defending yourself or when you are prosecuting someone?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Due Process is for defendants:** \n\nThe \"fairness\" provisions in Amendments 4\\-8 do not \"typically\" apply to defendants. They *explicitly* apply *only* to defendants. For instance, the 5th Amendment says: \n\n> No person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...\n\nThe basic idea is that the public is best served by having a fair, impartial trials under law. As Paul Johnson notes in his excellent comment, the general presumption is that the state has much more power than defendants, and hence is more likely to pervert justice for its benefit. The \"fairness\" provisions aim to reduce the power imbalance by requiring the state to follow certain procedures, such as getting warrants, and so on. \n\n**Fairness and prosecutors**\n\nIt is bad when either side perverts justice. That is why even prosecutors have some ability to challenge trial procedures that seem biased in favor of defendants. Thus, prosecutors cannot generally ask for a change of venue, but they can object to particular jurors. The idea, again, is that given its resources, allowing the state to move a trial would hurt defendants. \n\nAs Paul Johnson notes, the analogy of impeachment to regular trials breaks down at this point. The Constitution imposes only a few bare\\-bones requirements on the impeachment process. This lack of structure, when combined with the Constitutional provision that each House can make its own rules, [makes it easier](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46730/in-the-trump-impeachment-process-what-is-the-legal-status-of-notes/46731#46731) for House and Senate to do things that would not be allowed in regular trials, such as delay bringing charges (which would violate the \"[speedy trial](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment)\" clause), or seat admittedly \"[not\\-fair](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lindsey-graham-not-trying-to-pretend-to-be-a-fair-juror-here/2019/12/14/dcaad02c-1ea8-11ea-b4c1-fd0d91b60d9e_story.html)\" jurors. \n\n**What is fair?**\n\nThe obvious response to charges that the process is \"unfair,\" is to ask, \"Unfair by what standard?\" After, all the rules of impeachment are what they are. It is hard to see how using these rules to one's advantage is unfair. \n\nIt is important to remember, that as in regular trials, both sides are busy trying to put their spin on what is going on. If either side believes they will get more support by talking about \"basic fairness,\" that is how they will talk. But this spin should not hide the reality that the impeachment rules are what they are. As with any rules, whether some tricky manuever within the rules is fair depends on whose ox is being gored. After all, most Republicans were thrilled when Mitch McConnell invoked the Constitution to justify delaying a vote on Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court. Democrats were not. Now when delay does not serve Republicans, they are much less impressed with the Constitutional arguments.",

And what about that it no longer gives the user the option to interpret the steps differently, for creative or legal reasons?\n\nWhat if the program requires a very specific byte\\-for\\-byte copy from a legal source, like \"all files in the VIDEO\\_TS folder of the Director's Cut DVD, PAL edition, batch \\#6588\"? You could argue that indicates I have likely performed said steps myself and produced a derivative work, even if I haven't distributed said work.\n\nWhat if the required file is from an illegally distributed torrent release?\n\nThis is getting technical, but what if I just XOR my edited version with some other large file, say an Ubuntu ISO, and publish the resulting key? Another person could XOR that key with the Ubuntu ISO (which they can download freely) to get *Toy Story: Buzzkill*.\n\nOn the one hand, the key could be described as a long list of instructions to turn one thing into another, no different from the initial concept.\nBut on the other hand, it could be viewed as just a very weird form of encryption, and should be no more legal than just publishing my movie as a password\\-protected (thus encrypted) ZIP file.\n\nWhere do you think the line is drawn?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A description of how to do something is itself an independent creative work, and is protected by copyright. E.g. if you write a program that controls a milling machine, that program is protected no matter what the input object is.\n\nIf you use a device, of any sort, to change a copyright\\-protected object in any manner, you have created a \"derivative work\", therefore subject to the various exceptions to copyright protection, you need permission to create that work. If you buy a physical photograph, the artwork is protected, but because you own the actual copy of the photograph, you can grind it up or otherwise deface it.\n\nIf you scan and OCR a physical book, and then convert it into online html text after running it through Google Translate to get a Finnish version of the text, you are creating a derivative work: you have to have permission. If doesn't matter if you think up this way of creating a work, or if you follow someone else's instructions.\n\nSuppose you roll the bits of the file 2 left: then a casual observer would probably think \"Binary garbage, what's the point of that?\". You might evade detection, but it is still the illegal creation of a derivative work. There is only technically a difference between infringing on copyright, and infringing on copyright without getting caught.",

According to the information provided, a description of how to do something (in this case, the editing instructions) is itself an independent creative work and is protected by its own copyright. This is true regardless of what the instructions are about or what they instruct someone to do. The instructions do not directly incorporate copyrighted material from \"Toy Story,\" so they are not a derivative work of the movie. However, following these instructions to actually create the edited version would result in an unauthorized derivative work. The legality of the instructions themselves is separate from the legality of the actions they describe."

The licensing environment is very different for the big company than it is for little tiny you. Many large companies are subject to audits by software vendors (i.e. Adobe, Oracle, etc.) in which they have to show licenses purchased for each active seat. There's a whole new INDUSTRY around maintaining license compliance. An employee bringing in their own software and installing it on a company computer complicates this vastly.\n\nThat is the environment that the question should be considered within. The large company makes the decision somewhere along the way that your individual efficiency in performing your individual tasks is less important than maintaining auditable software licensing compliance. Since they own the computer/laptop/server, it's their decision.\n\nMany times it seems that corporate policies as they apply to the individual worker are obstructive and limiting, but there's a bigger picture to the situation.",

Large organizations face complex challenges in maintaining software licensing compliance, often subject to audits by vendors. Allowing employees to use personal licenses on company computers complicates this process significantly. While it may seem restrictive to individual employees, the company's decision prioritizes maintaining clear and auditable software licensing over individual task efficiency. This policy helps the company manage its overall licensing responsibilities and reduce risks associated with software audits.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company is not violating the vendor's rights by restricting use; they are exercising control over their own equipment. Option C, while it may seem true from the employee's perspective, is an oversimplification and not the primary reason for the policy. Option D is incorrect as the company does not have a monopoly on the licenses; they are simply managing their own licensing environment."

That's not allowed in Germany. Further, a clause that gives custody to the father by default is **also** Sittenwidrig in Germany, and thus void under [\u00a7138 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__138.html). So would be a clause that gives it to the mother by default by the way.\n\nIn a case of controversy, only a court order can assign guardianship. And only the court can take guardianship away. When the kid is born its guardianship gets assigned to the parents as guardians by [\u00a71626 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626.html). While it is possible to give your partner guardianship if you're not married under [1626a BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626a.html) it is **explicitly** impossible to assign guardianship for **any** compensation to either party (e.g. the mother or the new guardian may not receive anything other than the guardianship in the specific paper) under [1626b BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626b.html). Thus a contract that does anything else in addition to guardianship, like a prenup, voids at least the guardianship clauses. And you have to tell the court about that assignment of guardianship under ([$1626d BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626d.html)). Now comes the kicker: [\u00a71628 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1628.html) forces the parents to apply to the court to solve any problems of huge impact, such as guardianship: So technically, mediation results are fully non\\-binding and you can not mandate it.\n\nAlso, since all marriages are through the state, it needs a formal instrument of the state to be dissolved. The only three ways that the state ever allowed this to be done after WW2 were a) annulment through a court, which only was possible till 1998, or b) divorce through a court, c) death of one of the marriage partners. Yes, it takes a judge to divorce a marriage under [$1313 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1313.html) or one of the two married to die.\n\nBecause you can't divorce without a filing in court, a clause that demands to divorce in some way that is *not* including \u00a71313 BGB, that clause would be void. It *might* be legal to have a clause that demands to try to solve issues in arbitration before filing for divorce or sorting the belongings in such a way, but it can't supplant the court requirement.",

It violates public policy and attempts to modify legal requirements in a way that offers less than the law demands as a minimum.\n2. Clauses that assign custody by default to either parent are considered \"Sittenwidrig\" (contrary to public policy) and void under \u00a7138 BGB.\n3.

So unless you are dominate the toilet paper market in all of the county or hundreds of miles, you can almost demand whatever you want.\n\nUS\n==\n\nProfiteering can be one of two things in legal circles of the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\"):\n\n* [Price Gauging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_gouging)\n* War Profiteering\n\nWar Profiteering\n----------------\n\nWar Profiteering was part of the title of [HR\\-400 War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007](https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/400), defining the act as:\n\n> Whoever, in any matter involving a contract with, or the provision of goods or services to, the United States or a provisional authority, in connection with a mission of the United States Government overseas, knowingly\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) (A) executes or attempts to execute a **scheme or artifice to defraud the United States** or that authority; or\n> \n> \n> (B) **materially overvalues any good or service** with the **intent to defraud the United States** or that authority;\n\nExamples from history would be deliberately creating sub\\-par products that break as soon as they hit combat. In any way, it is just against the US as the state, not any person.\n\n[Price Gouging](https://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/price-gouging-state-statutes.aspx)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn many state laws, Price Gouging is fixed in some way or another. Price Gouging is the term of art used for the act to \"take advantage of spikes in demand by charging exorbitant prices for necessities\". The term does not apply to normal increases of prices due to shifting economies or dissimilar prices for products. Commonly, many are also restricted to emergency situations such as natural disasters, war, or even [covid\\-19](/questions/tagged/covid-19 \"show questions tagged 'covid-19'\").\n\nGenerally, these laws punish people who increase prices in an unreasonable manner but they also don't prescribe what reasonable is.\n\nAn example of Price Gouging is the salesman, who knowing a hurricane will hit Florida, buys up all generators in Detroit that cost below 2000 USD and gets a truck there to sell them the moment it has passed. Now he sells each generator for 20000 USD, while the normal market price outside of the hit area is just a 10th of that. In addition, have him sell 5\\-gallon cans of fuel for 500 USD. Both items \\- equipment to make electricity to fix the homes and fuel \\- are under [Fla. Stat. \u00a7501\\.160](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0500-0599/0501/Sections/0501.160.html) 1(a) and the prices are clearly matching 1(b). So our Detroid salesman in Florida is violating the law on Price Gouging.\n\n### Non\\-emergency laws?\n\nOnly very few laws are not concerned with an emergency situation and thus more broad and general. The most likely broadest of them is [Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7445\\.903](https://law.justia.com/codes/michigan/2006/mcl-chap445/mcl-445-903.html) (z). It reads:\n\n> Charging the consumer a price that is grossly in excess of the price at which similar property or services are sold.\n\nHere, grossly in excess is the requirement, but also the similarity of the products. So, it does not take dissimilar products into account, especially not if the two items cost you very dissimilar to acquire them.\n\nTo take a less emergency example, let's say we have a shop. We sell two types of toilet paper: one is 1\\-ply and costs 10 cents a roll. The other is imported german, extra soft 4\\-ply with Aloe\\-Vera and vanilla smell and we demand 5 USD per roll. The price difference is harsh (50 times!) but the two products are not similar, and we can prove that the import paper did cost us something like 4 USD to get to our shop in the first place. Now, one day we just put the 5 USD label from our import paper onto the cheap one for whatever reason. Only now we grossly overprice our cheap toilet paper and violate that provision: we charge 50 times what the item's fair price is.\n\n#### [When goods don't *appear* dissimilar but are](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84656/alices-restaurant-profiteering-from-those-with-allergies)\n\nA baker might make a pie for 50 USD in basic fixed costs (tools, wages, electricity) to run the shop, and 25 cents per pie in ingredients if he bakes 100 of them. That's 75 USD for 100 pies in costs, or 75 cents a pie. He wants to sell them at 1 USD a piece, that's a 1/3rd markup and a somewhat normal price.\n\nThe same baker can also bake gluten\\-free pies. The ingredients cost him 50 cents a pie and the same basic fixed costs to make a batch. But he also has to clean the shop top to bottom for 3 hours before to get any gluten flour out of it, costing him another 100 USD in wages. He also only has a demand for 10 pies, so those pies cost him 160 USD per batch or 16 USD per pie. To make a profit, he sells them at 21,33 USD, which is again a 1/3rd markup. At first glance, a gluten\\-free pie might appear a *very* similar product, but it isn't even similar under the Michigan law, because manufacturing costs are disproportional higher for the market. Even *if* he could sell 100 pies and then made a 100 pie batch, he'd still pay 200 USD for 100 pies, and the *fair price* for a single pie from a 100\\-item batch would be 2,66 USD. But from the 10\\-item batch, it's 21,33 USD.\n\nBecause the two pies are so dissimilar in manufacturing prices, they can not be used as \"similar\" under Michigan law. You'd need to compare the price of another gluten\\-free pie that is baked in similarly small batches in a bakeshop that makes both normal and gluten\\-free products in the same workshop.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A small bakery in Michigan sells two types of apple pies: regular and gluten-free. The regular pies cost $1 each to make and are sold for $3. The gluten-free pies cost $15 each to make due to special ingredients and extra cleaning procedures, and are sold for $25. A customer with celiac disease complains that the bakery is engaged in price gouging for the gluten-free pies. Under Michigan law, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The bakery is guilty of price gouging because the gluten-free pie is priced more than 8 times higher than the regular pie.\n\nB) The bakery is not guilty of price gouging because the price difference is justified by the higher production costs of the gluten-free pie.\n\nC) The bakery is guilty of price gouging because any price difference over 100% is considered \"grossly in excess\" under Michigan law.\n\nD) The bakery is not guilty of price gouging, but only because food items are exempt from Michigan's price gouging laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7445.903(z), price gouging occurs when charging a price \"grossly in excess of the price at which similar property or services are sold.\" However, the key here is that the gluten-free pies are not considered \"similar\" to the regular pies due to their significantly different production costs. The price difference is justified by the higher costs associated with ingredients, cleaning procedures, and smaller batch sizes for gluten-free pies. Therefore, the bakery is not engaged in price gouging under Michigan law. Options A and C are incorrect because they don't consider the difference in production costs. Option D is incorrect because while food items aren't specifically exempt, the law applies based on similarity and price justification, not product category."

They obtain birth certificate and passport for the child and go back to India with the child. Then all of a sudden, birth certificate requirement changes like [April 2011 rule](https://www.tripsavvy.com/birth-certificate-requirements-for-passport-applications-2972802) or in worst case like this [Puerto Rico Birth Ceritificate Invalidation](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/puerto-rican-birth-certificates-invalid-after-july-1/2117961/).\n\nBirth certificate is needed to obtain minors passport.

Right now, the situation in Washington state is described [here](https://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/VitalRecords/OrderCertificates): the bar is quite low and you can do it online. The law changes on Jan. 1, to [this](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.58A&full=true), which involves more restrictions on who can apply. Even under the new law, you do not have to be present in the US in order to supply the relevant documents, but the future rules are not yet set in stone. A birth certificate might include confidential information (described [here](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=246-491-029)), but that information is not (apparently) required by the Dept. of State for issuing a passport. Under the new requirements, you will need to provide more information: as they say,\n\n> Identity and proof of relationship documentation will be required.\n> Exact documentation is still to be determined\n\nThe new rules will not be more onerous than [the old rules for confidential information](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=246-491-039), which includes a current government ID\nwith the child's name, DOB, photograph, signature, and physical description, documentation of any name changes, and a notarized signature of the requestor along with proof of identity.\n\nThere are 49 other states, plus places which are not states, so it depends on the laws of the birth jurisdiction.",

According to the information provided, Washington state is changing its rules for obtaining birth certificates. While currently the process can be done online with minimal requirements, the new rules coming into effect will require additional documentation to prove identity and relationship. However, the parents do not necessarily need to be present in the US to supply this information. They can apply remotely, but will likely need to provide more extensive documentation than before. Options A and D are incorrect because physical presence in the US or hiring an attorney is not strictly necessary.

Discuss using the examples above?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ticker symbols are too short to be protected by copyright (and the copyright would in any case belong to the exchange and not the company, since the exchange creates them). It is also not functional, so it could not have a utility patent, and is not secret, so it could not be a trade secret.\n\nSo far as I know, none of the ticket symbols are registered as trademarks under the Lanham Act (the federal trademark law in the United State). But, a company could argue that it acquired a common law trademark in its ticker symbol if it used the ticker symbol in association with the sale of goods or services.\n\nEven if it was a trademark, however, this would not prevent it from being used in the usual way that ticker symbols are used, as a nominative use identifying a company with an abbreviation of its legal name or of a trade name, rather than in a manner that conveys the impression that one is authorized to sell goods and services under the name of the company.\n\nIn the example posed, I don't think that you could determine whether there was an infringement of common law trademark rights in a vacuum.\n\nFirst, it would be necessary to determine if a particular ticker symbol had acquired a secondary meaning (i.e. an association with the company) in the relevant part of the general public. For example, \"A\" without some context identifying it as the ticker symbol for Agilent Technology, would obviously not be entitled to common law trademark protection.\n\nSecond, it would be necessary to examine the manner in which the ticker symbol was used.\n\nThe gravamen and gist of trademark infringement is that one misleads someone to think that you have an affiliation with a company in connection with a use of that trademark in commerce. If one is doing that, I could see a common law trademark infringement case prevailing.\n\nFor example, if one had an email that said \"I.Love.ABC@xyz.com\" and was selling goods competing with those produced by \"Americansource Bergen Corp\" to people who would otherwise have brought Americansource Bergen Corp's goods, I could easily see a common law trademark infringement action prevailing with the domain name suggesting that you were a licensed affiliate of Americansource Bergen Corp who was marketing its goods, rather than the company itself.\n\nOn the other hand, if one had an email that said \"I.Love.ABC@xyz.com\" and you were a neighbor or former employee of Americansource Bergen Corp or a family member of an employee or a customer, then there would be no basis for a common law trademark infringement action.\n\nAnd, there are some cases, such as the \"whathappened.EFX@xyz.com\" email for Equifax which on its face could almost never be construed as an attempt to mislead someone into thinking that you were authorized to sell goods or serves of Equifax.\n\nGenerally speaking, there is no such thing as a \"facial\" trademark infringement except perhaps when a trademark is placed directly on a good not manufactured or licensed by the trademark owner. So, there is no blanket answer to your question.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tech enthusiast creates a personal email address \"AAPL.fanboy@xyz.com\" to discuss Apple products on online forums. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of using this email address?\n\nA) This is a clear violation of trademark law and the user can be sued by Apple.\nB) The use of \"AAPL\" in the email address is completely legal as stock tickers cannot be trademarked.\nC) The legality depends on how the email address is used and whether it could mislead others about the user's affiliation with Apple.\nD) Only Apple has the right to use \"AAPL\" in any context, including personal email addresses.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the legality of using a stock ticker in a personal email address depends on the context and potential for confusion. While stock tickers themselves are not typically trademarked, companies may have common law trademark rights if the ticker has acquired a secondary meaning associated with the company. The key factor is whether the use of the ticker in the email address could mislead others into believing the user has an official affiliation with the company. In this case, \"AAPL.fanboy@xyz.com\" doesn't immediately suggest an official connection to Apple, but the legality would ultimately depend on how the email address is used in practice and whether it could cause confusion about the user's relationship with Apple."

There is no legal or even practical reason not to (at least) anonymize the data in question. No payments or contracts are involved.\n\nUntil today I have written about 7 mails to 4 different receivers including but not limited to the address listed in the above privacy statement, starting from August 2019\\.

In Hamburg, the appropriate form is [here](https://datenschutz-hamburg.de/beschwerde/). However, they are not required to investigate your complaint.\n\nIndependently from a complaint, you could consider suing Wordpress for compliance \u2013 Automattic has a subsidiary in Ireland so this might actually be feasible. I'm not quite sure though that Automattic is indeed the data controller for wordpress*.org*, as opposed to the .com domain \u2013 the privacy policy isn't quite GDPR compliant.\n\nWhile your GDPR Art 17 Right to Erasure might not apply in this case, there's a definite GDPR violation because the data controller failed to respond to your request within a month as per Art 12(4\\). That your posts on the bugtracker were deleted doesn't look like an issue in this context, what does matter is that they didn't respond to emails to the addresses mentioned in their privacy policy.\n\nWhether you have a right to erasure depends on the legal basis for storing your data. In general, you have a right to erasure if:\n\n* the data is no longer necessary;\n* processing is based on consent (because you can always withdraw consent); or\n* processing is based on a legitimate interest *and* they have no overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing despite your objection (Art 21\\).\n\nThe data is still necessary to identify you for your actions on the bugtracker, but depending on your particular situation you may be able to object successfully and force them to anonymize your posts.",

I wonder whether the fact that the booster shot is not authorized by the CDC has any legal ramifications in the US.\n\nIs it legal to get a 3rd booster shot unauthorized by the CDC in the US?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The CDC does not authorize shots or vaccine distribution. The FDA authorizes vaccine distribution, or distribution of medicines in general. A medicine is authorized for use in a certain way, which is an \"instruction\" directed at the medical professional. So\\-called \"off\\-label\" use is discussed by the FDA [here](https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-expanded-access-and-other-treatment-options/understanding-unapproved-use-approved-drugs-label). Such use if legal, it simply stretches the limits of what the FDA was allowed to approve (e.g. was found to be safe and effective for X, was not similarly tested for Y). Patients are free to take whatever medicines they want if they can find them, and if they are not on the Controlled Substances list. Hence it's legal to take DMSO, but it's not legal to peddle it as a cancer cure.\n\nThe prescription regime for covid vaccinations seems to be somewhat relaxed, in that it is likely that many people get a vaccine without a (meaningful) doctor's exam, instead, you show up and get the shot. This is normal with flu shots. The upcoming 3rd shot approval is addressed to doctors, so they can then recommend third shots.",

The FDA, not the CDC, authorizes vaccine distribution and use. Their authorization is primarily directed at healthcare providers and manufacturers. Patients are generally free to take medicines they can obtain, as long as they are not controlled substances. The \"off-label\" use of approved drugs is legal, even if not explicitly authorized for that specific use.

When an associate claims to have exhaustively researched the law and concluded that their client is right, opposing counsel is unlikely to give this statement any credence. This is because:\n\n1. It's expected that each side will claim the law supports their position.\n2. Opposing counsel will have their own interpretation of the law.\n3. Such statements can be seen as posturing rather than a genuine basis for negotiation.\n\nIn contrast, emphasizing personal connections (like the client's friendship with the managing partner) and the client's resolve not to settle can be more effective. This approach:\n\n1. Introduces a factor that opposing counsel can't easily dispute or counter.\n2. Suggests that the case might not be resolved purely on legal merits.\n3. Implies that prolonging the case could be costly and unproductive for the opposing side.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because intimidation is not the goal, and discussing the case isn't unethical in this context.

I say this because your incredulity does not seem to extend to the notion that appellate courts can bind lower courts.\n\nYou ask:\n\n> why are prior judges\u2019 powers of interpretations automatically seen to be more capable and robust than, so as to bind and prevail over, subsequent judges\u2019 interpretative abilities?\n\nThis is not the rationale for horizontal *stare decisis*. The doctrine is not at all based on the premise that the first court or judge to answer got it correct. Justification was given in a concurring opinion in *R. v. Kirkpatrick*, [2022 SCC 33](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2022/2022scc33/2022scc33.html):\n\n> Stare decisis promotes: (1\\) legal certainty and stability, allowing people to plan and manage their affairs; (2\\) the rule of law, such that people are subject to similar rules; and (3\\) the legitimate and efficient exercise of judicial authority (citations omitted).\n\nAnd horizontal *stare decisis* is not absolute. Common\\-law jurisdictions have developed limited avenues for departure. For example, in Canada, a lower court can depart from previous decisions of courts of coordinate jurisdiction when (*R. v. Sullivan*, [2022 SCC 19](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/19390/index.do)):\n\n> 1. The rationale of an earlier decision has been undermined by subsequent appellate decisions;\n> 2. The earlier decision was reached per incuriam (\u201cthrough carelessness\u201d or \u201cby inadvertence\u201d); or\n> 3. The earlier decision was not fully considered, e.g. taken in exigent circumstances.\n\nEven apex courts have developed a sense of internal obligation to follow their own precedents. But departure from previous decisions may be justified where (see the *Kirkpatrick* concurrence [at para. 202](https://canlii.ca/t/jr3vx#par202)):\n\n> 1. The Court rendering the decision failed to have regard to a binding authority or relevant statute (\u201c*per incuriam*\u201d);\n> 2. The decision has proven unworkable (\u201cunworkability\u201d); or\n> 3. The decision\u2019s rationale has been eroded by significant societal or legal change (\u201cfoundational erosion\u201d).\n\nThis has been viewed to \"strike the appropriate balance between the competing demands of certainty, correctness and the even\\-handed development of the law\" (*R. v. Sullivan*, [2022 SCC 19](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/19390/index.do)). \"Adherence to precedent furthers basic rule of law values such as consistency, certainty, fairness, predictability, and sound judicial administration.\"",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My Colleague is currently in debate with someone they previously worked with last year in collaboration, under who owns the rights to the items in the following scenario. \n\n**The scenario is:**\nA group of four people, created a hair/fashion show \\- organising and planning all aspects, inclusive of hair/clothes/music/inspiration. Meaning the entire collection, was of their own idea, and creation.\n\nOutfits were purchased by these four people, and needed some modification, (modifications being some illustrations applied). so under recommendation from a friend an individual (The Designer), offered this service without any discussion or need for payment.\n\nThe Designer was provided with all materials needed to do this, as to not incur any cost to themselves, also given a brief and reference images to use to ensure the end result was as excepted and fitted with the overall collection.\n\nThese outfits (and now modifications), became part of the final 'collection', which is owned by that of the 4 who orchestrated it.\n\n**My question is:**\n\nWhere the work is of the designers hand, but was only created by them after being provided all materials, and a brief with reference images, not of their own ideas. Do they own any rights/copyright to the clothing items?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright\n---------\n\nCopyright subsists in original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, sound recordings, films or broadcasts, and the typographical arrangement of published editions \\[*Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988*, [s1]](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/1). Specifically, fashion is a \"work of artistic craftsmanship\" \\[[s4](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/4)].\n\nThe author (\"the person who creates \\[the work]\" \\[[s9](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/9)]) is the first owner of the copyright \\[[s11](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/11)] unless it is made by an employee in the course of their employment which is not the case here.\n\nThe 'designer' is *definitely* an author although it is arguable that the work is actually one of joint authorship [s10](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/10) between the 'designer' and the 'four people'. An alternative is that the 'four people' hold copyright in the \"reference images\" and that the 'designer' holds copyright in the fashion items; I think this is more likely.\n\nHowever, if the information provided to the 'designer' amounted to a design such that the fashion items are merely a 3D realisation of the design with no creative input by the designer then the fashion items are a copy of the design with no independent copyright. From the description, this seems unlikely \\- a design would require a fully detailed pattern such that multiple craftspeople using it would produce essentially the same output.\n\nAs there has been no transfer of copyright, whoever had it originally still has it \\- probably the designer.\n\nThe physical items\n------------------\n\nThese belong to whoever owned them originally \\- a mechanic does not take ownership of your car if they work on it so similarly a dressmaker doesn't take ownership of your clothes.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: In the case of the fashion show collaboration, where a designer modified outfits based on instructions from a group of four organizers, who likely holds the copyright for the modified clothing items?\n\nA) The four organizers exclusively, as they provided all materials and instructions\nB) The designer exclusively, as they performed the actual modifications\nC) Both the designer and the four organizers jointly\nD) No one holds copyright, as the modifications were minor\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) is incorrect because providing materials and instructions does not automatically grant copyright. The actual creative work is what determines copyright ownership.\n\nB) is correct because the designer, as the person who actually created the modifications, is considered the \"author\" under copyright law. Unless there was an agreement transferring rights or the designer was an employee, they would retain copyright of their creative work.\n\nC) is possible but less likely. Joint authorship would require that both parties contributed significant creative input to the final product. From the description, it seems the designer had considerable creative freedom in executing the modifications.\n\nD) is incorrect because copyright exists in original artistic works, which includes fashion items. The modifications, being illustrations applied to the outfits, likely qualify as original artistic contributions.\n\nIt's important to note that while the designer likely holds copyright to the modifications, the four organizers would still own the physical items themselves. Copyright relates to the intellectual property, not the physical objects."

The idea is that if an individual bought something\n>  from you recently, gave you their details, and did not opt out of\n>  marketing messages, they are probably happy to receive marketing from\n>  you about similar products or services even if they haven\u2019t\n>  specifically consented. However, you must have given them a clear\n>  chance to opt out \u2013 both when you first collected their details, and\n>  in every message you send.\n\nFor 'hard opt\\-in' GPDR specifies strict requirements for opt\\-in, e.g. no pre\\-ticked checkboxes.\n\nFor soft opt\\-in on the other hand, the requirements seem looser and I cannot find any exact specification for what is needed. \"Did not opt out\" (and indeed the very concept of soft opt\\-in) implies that an explicit opt\\-in was not needed. In the case of my own customers each email sent contains an unsubscribe link, and while the original signup did not contain an opt out it clearly stated that opting out was possible by clicking unsubscribe on any email sent.\n\nRather than sending an email at the present time (pre GDPR start date) that requires explicit opt\\-in, is it acceptable instead to send an email reiterating that opt\\-out is possible at this stage?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It appears you are indeed just over the edge. The troublesome bit is \"you must have given them a clear chance to opt out ... when you first collected their details\" versus \"the original signup did not contain an opt out \". If you correctly describe that first collection of their details, you failed to include an opt\\-out in just that one message, and it's technically therefore invalid.\n\nAnd you're similarly just over the edge with the idea of that new email; since you are formally lacking consent you should now obtain opt\\-in consent. Offering a chance to opt out is insufficient.",

The US sees no value in spending government money to detain someone who is ready to leave of their own accord.\n\nI'm not sure why such a person should have \"no valid documentation\". Maybe you're confused by the common term \"undocumented\" for people without legal immigration status, but it usually doesn't literally mean they have no documentation at all. Most such people would still have their passport and other identification from their home country, and the passport is enough to board a flight back home.\n\nYou say your hypothetical Israeli overstayer had a visa; so they must have had an Israeli passport when they entered the US. Under normal circumstances, they've still got it. If it expired, they could have renewed it at [an Israeli consulate within the US](https://embassies.gov.il/washington/AboutTheEmbassy/Pages/US-Missions.aspx); the consulate will issue passports to all Israeli citizens without regard to their immigration status in the US. Even if somehow they lost their Israeli passport and all other identity documents, the consulate would have the ability to verify their identity from Israeli government records (e.g. the photo and biometrics from their previous passport, which would still be in the Israeli government's database), and process their application for a replacement passport.",

The documentation states that the US does not conduct exit immigration checks, so an overstayer can generally leave without detention if they can board a flight. Even with an expired visa, the individual would likely still have their Israeli passport or could obtain a new one from an Israeli consulate in the US, regardless of their immigration status. This would allow them to board a flight back to Israel.

The explanation states that police have the responsibility to enforce the law, but they also have discretion in how and when they do so. They can consider factors such as justice, achievability, and worthwhileness when deciding how to respond to lawbreaking. In this case, the police likely determined that enforcing social distancing laws in the given circumstances would be arbitrary and not worthwhile. This shows that while they have the authority to enforce such laws, they can use their judgment to decide the most appropriate course of action.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because police do have the authority to enforce social distancing laws, even if they choose not to in certain situations. Answer B is too extreme, as it doesn't account for police discretion. Answer D is too limited, as police discretion applies to various situations, not just declared emergencies."

In some jurisdictions and in federal court, it arises as a matter of common law case precedents. In other jurisdictions, it is a statutorily created right. But all of them would agree that it includes all confidential communications in the course of the professional relationship. Most of the variation pertains to the extent of the crime\\-fraud exception (not applicable here).\n\nAttorneys are expressly authorized by the rules of professional conduct to offer advice to their clients in the course of their professional relationship with a client that extends beyond advice that is strictly legal. [Rule of Professional Conduct 2\\.1](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_2_1_advisor/) (which has been adopted verbatim in almost every U.S. state) says:\n\n> In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent\n> professional judgment and render candid advice. In rendering advice, a\n> lawyer may refer not only to law but to other considerations such as\n> moral, economic, social and political factors, that may be relevant to\n> the client's situation.\n\nThen there is a very complicated part of this issue:\n\n> such that the lawyer had inadvertently waived privilege?\n\nGenerally, a lawyer's unilateral inadvertent action does not waive the privilege. The typical fact pattern is inadvertent inclusion of an opposing party in a \"reply all\" email meant to be only a \"reply\" to or \"forward\" to a client, or inadvertent inclusion of privileged material in a discovery response (e.g. due to failing to wipe metadata).\n\nWhen another lawyer receives inadvertently disclosed privilege material there is a protocol to be followed.\n\nThe consequences in this case are less clear. The tweet probably wouldn't be admissible as evidence in court, unless the client ratified the disclosure. But once it is out there it isn't illegal for the inadvertent recipient, if the recipient is a non\\-lawyer, to share it further as was done in this case. This could even lead to a malpractice case against the errantly tweeting lawyer.",

The attorney-client privilege applies to all confidential communications between an attorney and client in the course of their professional relationship, including advice on public relations strategies. The accidental disclosure by the attorney alone typically does not waive the privilege, as waiver generally requires client consent or ratification.\n\nOption A is incorrect because attorney-client privilege extends beyond strictly legal advice to include other relevant considerations an attorney may discuss with a client.\n\nOption B is incorrect because inadvertent disclosure by an attorney alone does not automatically waive privilege. The client's rights are generally protected even if the attorney makes a mistake.\n\nOption D is incorrect because explicit instructions for confidentiality are not required for attorney-client privilege to apply.

Benson**, 920 F.2d 1173, 1176 (4th Cir. 1990\\) *(\"We will not accept on appeal theories that were not raised in the district court except under unusual circumstances.\")*.\n\nOf course it justifies why the rule is applied for this case, but what is the original reason this rule was applied?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is largely congruent with\\* the doctrine of [*laches*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laches_%28equity%29). The basic idea, under common law, is that you can lose rights by failing to assert them. This is generally important for many reasons, but specifically in the case of appeals:\n\n* The argument should have been brought before the trial court. Justice is not a game, but it's important to recognize that the party trying to raise the argument had an opportunity to do so already. They have given up their right to raise this argument, and extending them the *privilege* of doing so is (for the following reasons) not good for the system.\n* Courts of appeals are typically not well\\-equipped to evaluate factual evidence. It is not their area of expertise. Witnesses or evidence may be less available. It's just not practical to try to adjudicate factual issues on appeal, most of the time.\n* If anyone could get an appeal by bringing new factual arguments, then *everyone* would do that. You'd bring your strongest argument before the district court, and then if that fails, bring the second strongest before the circuit court. That way, you get an extra trial. This is inefficient.\n* Allowing factual arguments on appeal would encourage attorneys and their clients to strategically bring different facts before different courts. This kind of forum\\-shopping is harmful because it has little to do with who has the stronger overall case, and more to do with who has the better lawyer.\n\n\\* \"Congruent with\" is not the same as \"an instance of\"; this rule is *not* formally an application of *laches*. It just happens to share the same justification.",

The information provided emphasizes that allowing new arguments on appeal would encourage attorneys to strategically bring different facts before different courts, which is harmful to the justice system. This practice is referred to as \"forum-shopping\" and is discouraged because it prioritizes legal strategy over the strength of the overall case.\n\nB) While this is a consequence of the rule, it's not the primary reason. The main concern is preventing strategic withholding of arguments, not ensuring all evidence is presented at trial.\n\nC) While there is a distinction between trial and appellate courts mentioned in the text, particularly regarding their ability to evaluate factual evidence, this is not cited as the primary reason for the rule.\n\nD) Although the rule is described as \"congruent with\" the doctrine of laches, the text explicitly states that it is not formally an application of laches.

How common is it for parties in criminal trials to give notices like that and point judges to reliable sources of the facts referred to in the notices?\n\nIntuitively I would expect that *expert witnesses* are required to testify about \"facts capable of accurate and ready determination\"\n\u2014 so that they could be cross\\-examined. If notices like provided for in the cited law above are indeed allowed in criminal trial that may seem to be sort of circumvention to avoid cross\\-examination. Is it not?\n\nFor example, there is a case involving a Labrador retriever attacking domestic ducks. It is a well\\-known fact (at least among owners of this particular dog breed) that chasing and catching ducks is in their blood/nature: they normally will do it as soon as they *see* ducks \u2014 as opposed to having to be encouraged/commanded. Assuming a reliable published source of this fact exists, can it be given in notice pursuant to the cited section? Or can this knowledge only be put before the court by way of expert witness e.g. a Labrador retriever breeder?\n\n(Any common law jurisdiction)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is known as [Judicial notice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_notice) and is used in many jurisdictions. It is normally supposed to be used only for facts about which there could be no possible controversy. The Wikipedia article linked above mentions such examples as \"which day of the week corresponded to a particular calendar date or the approximate time at sunset.\" It can also be used to include the text of a law from another jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to the *Free Legal Encyclopedia* (FLE) [article](https://law.jrank.org/pages/7886/Judicial-Notice.html):\n\n> When a court takes judicial notice of a certain fact, it obviates the need for parties to prove the fact in court. Ordinarily, facts that relate to a case must be presented to the judge or jury through testimony or tangible evidence. However, if each fact in a case had to be proved through such presentation, the simplest case would take weeks to complete. To avoid burdening the judicial system, all legislatures have approved court rules that allow a court to recognize facts that constitute common knowledge without requiring proof from the parties.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The most common judicially noticed facts include the location of streets, buildings, and geographic areas; periods of time; business customs; historical events; and federal, state, and INTERNATIONAL LAW. Legislatures also maintain statutes that give courts the power to recognize certain facts in specific situations. For example, in Idaho any document affixed with the official seal of the state PUBLIC UTILITIES commission must be judicially noticed by all courts (Idaho Code \u00a7 61\\-209 \\[1996]). In Hawaii, when a commercial vehicle is cited for violating vehicle equipment regulations, a trial court must take judicial notice of the driver's subordinate position if the driver works for a company that owns the vehicle (Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 291\\-37 \\[1995]).\n\nIn the United States, [Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE)](https://www.rulesofevidence.org/article-ii/rule-201/) covers this. It reads:\n\n> (a) Scope. This rule governs judicial notice of an adjudicative fact only, not a legislative fact.\n> \n> \n> (b) Kinds of Facts That May Be Judicially Noticed. The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it:\n> \n> \n> (b) (1\\) is generally known within the trial court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction; or\n> \n> \n> (b) (2\\) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\n> \n> \n> (c) Taking Notice. The court:\n> \n> \n> (c) (1\\) may take judicial notice on its own; or\n> \n> \n> (c) (2\\) must take judicial notice if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the necessary information.\n> \n> \n> (d) Timing. The court may take judicial notice at any stage of the proceeding.\n> \n> \n> (e) Opportunity to Be Heard. On timely request, a party is entitled to be heard on the propriety of taking judicial notice and the nature of the fact to be noticed. If the court takes judicial notice before notifying a party, the party, on request, is still entitled to be heard.\n> \n> \n> (f) Instructing the Jury. In a civil case, the court must instruct the jury to accept the noticed fact as conclusive. In a criminal case, the court must instruct the jury that it may or may not accept the noticed fact as conclusive.\n\nNote that subsection (e) preserves the rights of parties to be heard on whether taking notice is proper in a given case. None also that subsection (f) makes it clear that this procedure may be used in both civil and criminal cases.\n\nThe Wikipedia article (linked above) says that most US states closely follow FRE 201 in their rules of evidence. (So does the FLE article.) Note also that the NZ law quoted in the question is very similar even in wording to FRE 201\\. The article mentions similar practices in Canada and Australia.\n\nThe Wikipedia article also says:\n\n> Legal disputes about foreign affairs are generally settled by judicial notice by obtaining the information directly from the office of the Secretary of State (in the United States). For example, if a litigant in an extradition hearing attempted to argue that Israel was not a sovereign state, a statement from the Secretary of State that the U.S. recognized Israel as a sovereign state would settle the issue and no evidence could be led to the contrary. (In the United Kingdom, similar result could be had to information from the Foreign Secretary.)\n\nNote that under US FRE 201 no fact that enters the case under judicial notice is binding on a jury in a criminal case, and a defendant (or the defendant's lawyer) may be heard to offer contrary evidence. Thus the practice does not offer a way to evade cross\\-examination of a proper expert wittiness if used properly. Similar rules probably exist in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe FLE article linked above goes on to state:\n\n> The danger of judicial notice is that, if abused, it can deprive the fact finder of the opportunity to decide a contestable fact in a case. In *Walker v. Halliburton Services*, 654 So. 2d 365 (La. App. 1995\\), Johnny Walker fell from a tank truck approximately ten feet to a concrete floor. Walker sought WORKERS' COMPENSATION benefits for his injuries, and his claim was denied by the Office of Workers' Compensation.\n> \n> \n> At the application hearing, the hearing officer stated that it was her experience that a soft\\-tissue injury heals in six weeks. She then took judicial notice of the fact that a soft\\-tissue injury heals in six weeks\u2014preventing Walker from contesting that proposition\u2014and disallowed Walker's claim. On appeal the Louisiana Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, reversed the decision and ordered the payment of workers' compensation benefits. According to the court, it was a clear error of law for the hearing officer to take judicial notice of such intricate medical knowledge.\n\nConsidering the example in the question of a Labrador retriever attacking domestic ducks. I would think this would not be a proper subject for judicial notice, because it would be \"subject to reasonable dispute\". An expert might testify that this happens in many but not all dogs of the breed, or under certain conditions but not others. So it might be comparable to the soft tissue injury case where notice was improper. However, if all parties agreed that such notice might be taken, then perhaps there would be no issue, as no party had been deprived of a right to contest the alleged fact. In such a case this might be considered a *stipulation* rather than an example of judicial notice.",

How should the judge proceed?\n\nA) The judge should take judicial notice of the fact, as it comes from a reliable source and is common knowledge among dog owners.\n\nB) The judge should refuse to take judicial notice, as this kind of specific breed behavior is not an appropriate subject for judicial notice in a criminal trial.\n\nC) The judge should take judicial notice of the fact, but instruct the jury that they may or may not accept it as conclusive.\n\nD) The judge should only take judicial notice if both the prosecution and defense agree to it, effectively making it a stipulation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of judicial notice in criminal trials. Option A is incorrect because while the fact comes from a seemingly reliable source, it's not the type of indisputable fact typically subject to judicial notice. Option B, while cautious, is overly restrictive; judges can take judicial notice in criminal trials. Option D suggests treating it as a stipulation, which is different from judicial notice. \n\nThe correct answer is C. In a criminal trial, a judge can take judicial notice of facts from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. However, to protect the rights of the defendant, the jury must be instructed that they may or may not accept the noticed fact as conclusive. This balances the efficiency of judicial notice with the defendant's right to have all facts proven beyond a reasonable doubt."

He wants to transfer this debt to his friend Sarah, who has agreed to take on the responsibility. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's ability to transfer his debt?\n\nA) John can directly transfer his debt to Sarah without involving Bank A, as he is the debtor and has the right to reassign his debt.\n\nB) John cannot transfer his debt to Sarah under any circumstances, as debt transfers are only allowed between financial institutions.\n\nC) John can transfer his debt to Sarah if he gets written permission from Bank A, as the bank holds the right to approve any changes to the debt agreement.\n\nD) John cannot directly transfer his debt to Sarah, but Sarah could potentially take out a new loan to pay off John's debt, effectively becoming the new debtor to a different lender.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. As a debtor, John does not have the right to unilaterally transfer or sell his debt to another individual. The debt holder (Bank A in this case) owns the debt as an asset and has the right to sell or transfer it, but the debtor does not have this ability. However, Sarah could potentially take out a new loan to pay off John's existing debt, effectively becoming a new debtor to a different lender. This process is known as refinancing. Options A and C are incorrect because debtors cannot transfer debts directly or with mere permission from the bank. Option B is too absolute, as there are ways to effectively transfer debt responsibility through refinancing."

This tenancy agreement is due for renewal in 4 months from now.\n\nOne of the current tenants is to leave and be replaced by a person of our choosing. The landlord has requested that the new tenant pay a slightly increased level of rent and thus has proposed that the figure on the current tenancy agreement be amended to reflect this. He then intends to increase the rent further in 4 months when the tenancy agreement is renewed.\n\nI expressed my reservations about this and indicated that either a new tenancy agreement should be issued to replace the current one \\- subject to our agreement (which would mean the tenancy agreement renewal period would reset?) or postpone all rent rises until the contract is renewed in 4 months.\n\nWhat can we do in this situation? Is the landlord simply allowed to to modify the contract for an incoming tenant?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is the landlord simply allowed to to modify the contract for an incoming tenant?\n\nNo. When you have a joint tenancy, an end of tenancy comes in effect for all tenants. It's a single tenancy, so it can't just end for one person and leave the rest unaffected. \n\nThe end of tenancy procedure takes a slightly different route:\nFor a fixed term tenancy ALL tenants and the landlord need to agree, if anyone wishes to move out, or if the landlord wants to change some of the terms of the agreement. \nFor a periodic tenancy either tenant can serve a months notice and end the tenancy. \n\nThe landlord is then free to draft a new, modified tenancy agreement with the rest of you and the new tenant that comes in. The landlord is free to introduce changes to the new tenancy agreement, like increased rent, and you have two options \\- sign it or move out.\n\nSigning a new tenancy means the review period will reset, however, the landlord can simply introduce an intermediary rent increase now, and then add the rest of the planned amount after 6 or 12 months, when the tenancy review date is.\n\nAnother option for all of you is to negotiate for the landlord to draft individual tenancy agreements for each of you (having their own room, I assume), which will make it unnecessary to re\\-draft the tenancy agreement each time a tenant wishes to move out. It's more hassle for them, but better for you individually. This will also make you not liable to pay for damages that other tenants have caused. \n\nHere is more information on [tenancy agreements](http://www.thetenantsvoice.co.uk/advice_from_us/tenancy-agreements-assured-shorthold-tenancy-ast/).",

Which of the following statements is correct regarding this situation?\n\nA) The landlord can modify the existing contract to increase rent for just the new tenant without the other tenants' consent.\n\nB) The landlord must wait until the contract renewal in 4 months to make any changes to the rent or agreement terms.\n\nC) A completely new tenancy agreement must be drafted and signed by all remaining tenants, the new tenant, and the landlord if any changes are to be made before the renewal date.\n\nD) The landlord can unilaterally end the tenancy for the leaving tenant while keeping the agreement intact for the remaining tenants.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In a joint tenancy, the agreement applies to all tenants collectively. Any changes, including a tenant leaving or joining, or modifications to terms like rent, require a new agreement to be drafted and signed by all parties involved - the landlord, remaining tenants, and new tenant. The landlord cannot modify the existing contract for just one tenant (A), nor must they wait until renewal to make changes if all parties agree to a new contract now (B). The landlord also cannot unilaterally end the tenancy for just one tenant in a joint agreement (D). Therefore, the correct approach is to create a new tenancy agreement that all parties must agree to and sign (C)."

This approach allows for compliance with data protection laws while still maintaining some control over cryptographic technologies. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Wassenaar Arrangement does not completely ban cryptography; it aims to control its spread.\n\nAnswer B is overstated.

For the house, which is solely in John's name, it would be considered a separately held asset and would pass to his children through intestate succession. The joint bank account would be split, with Jane keeping her half and the children inheriting John's half. For the life insurance policy with no named beneficiary, it would typically pass to John's next of kin, which in this case would be his children. The probate court would need to confirm the children's relationship to John before they could inherit.

Maybe. Under *Playboy* they can definitely use the words, but using the logo may be pushing it.

The concept of nominative fair use, as established in cases like Playboy v Welles, allows for limited use of trademarks under certain conditions. \n\nUsing the names of media outlets where the company was featured would likely be considered fair use, as it falls under the first and third conditions of the nominative fair use test: it's necessary for identification and doesn't suggest sponsorship or endorsement.\n\nHowever, using logos may be problematic due to the second condition of the test, which states that only as much of the mark as is reasonably necessary for identification should be used. Logos go beyond mere words and might be seen as using more of the trademark than necessary.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fair use is not absolute and requires consideration of specific factors. \n\nOption B is too restrictive, as using names could likely be justified under fair use.\n\nOption D is overly permissive, as the use of logos, even if the company was genuinely featured, may still pose legal risks.\n\nThis question tests understanding of trademark law, fair use doctrine, and the nuances of using third-party branding in marketing materials."

I've talked with this friend of mine for a while yet she is unwilling to overthink her decision.\n\nThe company at hand sells food supplements, and offers you the possibility of \"gaining money\" by \"working\" as a salesperson for them. The food supplements are low\\-quality and **extremely overpriced** (*\\~200$ for a package*). You can easily buy a similar package for 1/10th of the price.\n\nNow, \"working\" as a salesperson isn't really working for them, as you aren't employed. You have to buy the packages (for the **FULL** price), and then sell them online, refunds impossible (you lose the possibility of \"working\" for them).\n\nOnce you've sold \\~25 packages within a month, you get 10% off of your next package (*wow, amazing*). And this keeps on going, you're getting a few very small \"benefits\" the higher you get, at some point even money. The company has \\~2\\-3 \"selfmade\" persons earning allegedly a few thousands per month just by selling those supplements online.\n\n---\n\nMy questions now are:\n\n1. Am I right to believe that this is indeed a pyramid scheme?\n2. How can I do something against this company?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It seems that your friend is taking part in a multi\\-level marketing scheme. However, this does not necessarily exclude a pyramid or snow ball scheme.\n\nBoth can be illegal in Germany and Switzerland under the respective unfair business practices codes, because the systems do not rely on the sales of goods and services, but on the continuous recruitment of further sales persons. \n\nTo clarify whether your friend's system is illegal, you could report the scheme to the competent watchdogs. In Germany the \"Zentrale zur Bek\u00e4mpfung unlauteren Wettbewerbs\" in Bad Homburg is recommendable. As the company is operating from Switzerland, German law not be applicable without more. Therefore also contacting the Swiss authorities may be advisable. This seems to be the \"Staatssekretariat f\u00fcr Wirtschaft SECO\" in Bern.",

The question mentions that the company operates from Switzerland, but German law could potentially apply as well. Specifically, the answer suggests contacting the \"Zentrale zur Bek\u00e4mpfung unlauteren Wettbewerbs\" in Germany and the \"Staatssekretariat f\u00fcr Wirtschaft SECO\" in Switzerland.

When the patient received an EOB from the insurance $1600\\.00 had been charged to the insurance for the same crown. When questioning the amount, the office manager stated that he can charge any amount he wants to the insurance company. The doctor stated that the billing is out of her hands. The insurance company states that the patient should not have gone out of network and it is out of their hands. IS THIS LEGAL? OR THIS INSURANCE FRAUD?\nNot only was the bill to insurance excessive but it also used up $700\\.00 more of the patients yearly maximum than originally quoted which means she will not be able to complete other dental treatment needed. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Dental \"quotes\" are typically estimates of a patient's financial responsibility, given the insurance information provided by the patient. If you patronize an in\\-network practicioner, it is fairly easy for them to be pretty accurate in that estimate, but there can be some small errors when it turns out the insurance company thinks one thing and the doctor thinks something else (the doctor generally loses). This is because an in\\-network provider has a contract with the insurance company that says what they can charge and what they will receive. They could charge the patient more than the maximum allowed by the insurance company, but that would be a violation of their contract with the insurance company. It is very common that a doctor bills for a large sum, accepts much less than that and passes on a specific amount to the patient as their responsibility.\n\nAn out\\-of\\-network provider doesn't have those limits on what they can charge, also they may be less accurate in estimating patient responsibility. Indeed, an out\\-of\\-network provider could simply hand the patient a bill and a receipt, leaving it to the patient to get reimbursed, especially if the insurance company is a known pain in the neck. Insurance companies encourage you to patronize in\\-network by (1\\) limiting what the doctor can charge, (2\\) paying a greater portion of the bill, (3\\) having separate in\\-network vs. out\\-of\\-network yearly maxima plus often higher out\\-of\\-network maxima.\n\nThe doctor can *charge* any amount he wants to the insurance company, in any event \u2013 the insurance company is responsible for deciding what they will pay (a doctor can symbolically overcharge and accept lower levels of payment, if he wants to). So, yes, this is all legal. It's all part of general contract law, regarding the three contratual relations you\\+insurance, you\\+doctor and doctor\\+insurance.",

I've never seen a contract with both in twenty years as a lawyer, but all sorts of weird stuff gets written into contracts especially by amateurs. A term like this is often important because it can often be unclear which state's law applies to a contract otherwise.\n\nNot infrequently, there would be both a \"Choice of Law\" paragraph stating which law applies to the contract in which circumstances, and a separate \"Choice of Forum\" provision (somethings given a different title such as \"Dispute Resolution\" or \"Forum\" or \"Venue\") which states which court the contract can be enforced in, since a forum court can often apply the law of another state as to some issues in a case. \n\nFor example, usually, consumer contracts can only be enforced in a court for a jurisdiction in which the defendant consumer resides, even though the contract might provide that the governing law is the law of the place where the company suing the consumer is based.\n\nI often write (business to business) contracts that provide that Colorado law shall apply and that any suit to enforce the contract shall be brought in the state courts of the state of Colorado in the county where the business writing the court is located and that the parties waive any right to a trial by jury.",

The first clause is a Choice of Law provision, specifying that New York law should be used to interpret the contract. The second clause is a Choice of Forum provision, indicating where disputes should be resolved (California courts in this case). \n\nThese clauses can coexist in a contract and serve different purposes. As the documentation states, \"a forum court can often apply the law of another state as to some issues in a case.\" Therefore, it's entirely possible and not uncommon for a court in one jurisdiction (California in this case) to apply the laws of another jurisdiction (New York) when resolving a dispute.\n\nOption A is incorrect because both clauses are valid and serve different purposes.

There already is some legal relationship between the end users and the company.\n\nYour question seems to boil down to: can the company create a legal relationship between the provider and the end users?\n\n* The company cannot enter any agreements on behalf of the end users, unless the end users have provided the necessary rights.\n* It may be possible for the company to transfer its end user relationship to the provider, with the new provider remaining bound by existing agreements.\n* The company may be able to unilaterally change its terms of service offered to the end users, but not all such changes are valid.\n\nBut in practice, nothing like this will be happening: there won't be any legal relationship between the end users and the provider, only between the company and the provider. The company might then appear as a reseller. The company can only engage that provider if their agreement with the end user allows this.\n\nA practical example: The company provides an email service. It wants to stop self\\-hosting the email and outsource the service to some provider.\n\n* Scenario A: The current terms of service state that the emails will be stored on servers in Switzerland, but the new provider would be in Australia. Engaging the provider would violate the terms of service in the current form, but the ToS can likely be changed with some advance notice that allows users to delete their account if they don't agree with the changes.\n* Scenario B: The company's current agreement with end users makes certain privacy guarantees. The company ensures that these guarantees hold even when outsourcing to that provider. For example, they might have a contract with the provider that controls how the provider can process the end user data.\n\nBy the way, that scenario B would be a GDPR\\-compliant approach: the company acts as a data controller, and can take on data processors if they sign a data processing agreement that binds the processor to only use that end user data as explicitly instructed by the controller. That way, any use of the data remains under the authority of the controller. Things only get problematic when the provider wants to use the data for their own purposes.",

It addresses several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. It respects the existing legal relationship between TechCorp and its users by updating its own terms of service rather than trying to create a new relationship between users and CloudMail.\n\n2. It provides users with advance notice of the changes, allowing them to opt-out if they disagree with the new terms.\n\n3. It maintains TechCorp as the data controller, with CloudMail acting as a data processor. This aligns with GDPR requirements, where the original company (TechCorp) remains responsible for user data and can engage processors (CloudMail) under a data processing agreement.\n\n4. It doesn't bypass user agreements or create accounts without consent, unlike options A and C.\n\n5.

Which of the following statements best describes the correct legal approach in this situation?\n\nA) The court has no authority to order the disclosure of an SSN under any circumstances, as it is protected private information.\n\nB) The court can freely order the disclosure of an SSN without any consideration of privacy concerns or relevance to the case.\n\nC) The court may order the disclosure of an SSN, but the party should file a motion to have the records sealed to protect privacy.\n\nD) The court must always make SSNs part of the public record in order to ensure transparency in legal proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While a court can order the disclosure of an SSN if it's relevant to the case, it's important to balance this with privacy concerns. The party whose SSN is being requested should file a motion to have the records sealed. This approach recognizes the court's authority to request the information when necessary, while also acknowledging the need to protect sensitive personal information from unnecessary public disclosure. Options A and D are incorrect because they represent extreme positions that don't align with actual legal practice. Option B is incorrect because it ignores the privacy implications of disclosing an SSN."

It consists of about 30 fern\\-like shapes on a white background. I am making a logo for a non\\-commercial academic website and it was suggested to me to use one of those shapes, albeit recoloured to match the website's theme. (There are intellectual reasons, and a kind of mathematical and visual pun why this particular image was suggested...)\n\nI am aware that the EU copyright in this work expires in about five years, as Matisse died in 1954, and US copyright would extend five years beyond that.\n\nI'm hesitant because while some fair use principles seem to apply (no effect on the Matisse estate's earning power; only \\~3% of the artwork, and not representative of the whole; non\\-profit usage in an academic setting; original is a painting but new work is a logo for a wiki website), I don't quite feel 100% comfortable. On GraphicDesign.SE, where I first asked this, one user commented this was a clear case where it would be a copyright violation.\n\nAny advice or resources that would help make a more solid case either way? (I respect the above\\-mentioned GD.SE user's experience and advice, but it is the say\\-so of one person on the internet) I've had a quick look around, but I cannot find any discussion about similar situations.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem is that decisions on what constitute fair use are highly fact\\-driven judgement calls. Such decisions cannot be automated, at least not in the present state of AI, nor can a checklist approach give a reliable answer. It is hard to see how any \"resource\" could be helpful, beyond a list of example cases to compare the facts of a new case against.\n\nFrom the description, there is a plausible case for fair use under US law, but the only way to be sure would be a court decision, sure to be a lot of trouble at best.\n\nOf course, one could always ask the estate for permission. Given the factors cited it might be granted.\n\nBy the way, in the US, the painting will be in copyright for 95 years after publication, so at least until 2047\\. the life\\+70 term does not apply to works created before 1977\\.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright implications of this use?\n\nA) This would be a clear case of copyright violation, as stated by a user on GraphicDesign.SE.\n\nB) This use would definitely fall under fair use because it's for a non-commercial, academic purpose.\n\nC) The artwork will be in the public domain in the EU in about five years, so it's safe to use now.\n\nD) While there are some factors that could support a fair use claim, the only way to be certain would be through a court decision or by obtaining permission from the Matisse estate.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because the situation presents a complex copyright scenario. While there are factors that could potentially support a fair use claim (such as non-commercial use, academic context, and using only a small portion of the work), fair use decisions are highly fact-specific and can't be determined definitively without a court ruling. The safest approach would be to seek permission from the Matisse estate. Options A and B present overly simplistic views of a nuanced situation. Option C is incorrect because the work will still be under copyright in the US until at least 2047, and current copyright status must be respected even if it will change in the near future."

An example is [8 USC 1182(f)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182), which says\n\n> Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any\n>  class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the\n>  interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such\n>  period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or\n>  any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the\n>  entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\n\nExplicit constitutional powers are not numerous, but include commanding the armed forces and overseeing execution of national law by appointing and removing executive officers. POTUS is constitutionally the federal official responsible for relations with foreign nations, so he can make treaties (subject to Senate approval) and [executive agreements](https://fam.state.gov/fam/11fam/11fam0720.html) (not subject to approval), can appoint US ambassadors and can receive foreign ambassadors. Executive agreements have the greatest potential for being an avenue for POTUS to act contrary to Congress, but they are limited to agreements pursuant to legislation, treaty and constitutional authority (and, as agreements, are not unilateral). \n\nCongress was able to somewhat limit presidential military authority by statutes such as the [War Powers Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-33), and in the policy statement at [50 USC 1541](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1541), Congress declares\n\n> The constitutional powers of the President as Commander\\-in\\-Chief to\n>  introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into\n>  situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly\n>  indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1\\) a\n>  declaration of war, (2\\) specific statutory authorization, or (3\\) *a\n>  national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its\n>  territories or possessions, or its armed forces*\n\nThe law limits the length of engagement of the military, without Congressional approval, but there is no toothful restriction on deploying the military for up to 60 days.\n\n[50 USC Ch. 34](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-34) more generally addressed \"national emergencies\", and started by declaring an end to all existing declared emergencies. Other sections of the law require Congress to be notified and emergencies to be published in the Federal Register. An emergency can be terminated by POTUS or by act of Congress, and after 6 months (and every 6 months thereafter), Congress shall meet to discuss the emergency. POTUS must also annually re\\-declare the emergency to keep it in force.\n\nThese are procedural requirements, not content requirements. In general, you wold have to go through Title 50 to check for particular powers granted by Congress\n\nThe [International Emergency Economic Powers Act](http://International%20Emergency%20Economic%20Powers%20Act) grants powers to POTUS, with the following limit:\n\n> (a) Any authority granted to the President by section 1702 of this\n>  title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary\n>  threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the\n>  United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of\n>  the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with\n>  respect to such threat.\n> \n> \n> (b) The authorities granted to the President by section 1702 of this\n>  title may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary\n>  threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared\n>  for purposes of this chapter and may not be exercised for any other\n>  purpose. Any exercise of such authorities to deal with any new threat\n>  shall be based on a new declaration of national emergency which must\n>  be with respect to such threat.\n\nwhich appears more limiting than the War Powers Act. There is an extensive list of powers granted under [50 USC 1702](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1702), which in that domain could be called \"bright\" lines. Generally, the lines are only as bright as Congress has painted them.",

The President's power to declare national emergencies is indeed subject to procedural requirements, such as notifying Congress and publishing the declaration in the Federal Register. The emergency must also be renewed annually and is subject to congressional review every six months. However, there are few content-based restrictions on what constitutes a national emergency, giving the President significant latitude in this area.\n\nOption A is incorrect because presidential power is not unlimited and is subject to various checks and balances, including congressional oversight.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the War Powers Act actually limits the deployment of armed forces without congressional approval to 60 days, not 90 days.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the International Emergency Economic Powers Act specifically states that the threat must be unusual and extraordinary, with its source substantially outside the United States, and must be related to national security, foreign policy, or the economy. It does not grant broad powers for any threat."

What are the best resorts for these types of information?\n\nI'm thinking of looking into getting a whole official copy of the HMLR dataset and then running some algorithmic analysis to cross index it.\n\nBut I'm hoping there is anything more direct? Is this information intended to be accessible or inaccessible or neither per se?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a live political issue. Currently, the various datasets are incomplete and have known accuracy issues. Considering a particular parcel of land:\n\n* It might not be in the Land Registry at all. About 85% of land in England and Wales is registered, and less in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n* Scottish registered land might only appear on the paper \"Register of Sasines\", as opposed to the more recent electronic database, or potentially in even older county\\-specific sasine registers.\n* The owner might be a company, partnership, trust, etc., rather than a natural person.\n* The ownership and control of that company (etc.) can be hard to trace. Companies House data is not verified; companies can be incorporated overseas; the trusts register is not publicly searchable; things can be muddled. Raw data might not show that a dozen properties, each owned by a single company that owns nothing else, are in fact ultimately controlled by a particular person of interest.\n* Different people may own the freehold, or a leasehold, or have various other forms of ownership or control. Even a long\\-term tenancy may be of interest for database purposes.\n\nBecause of continuing interest in anti\\-money laundering, tax evasion, and general accumulation of wealth, there have been plans to have a new \"register of beneficial ownership\". Such a register would record, for each plot of land, the name of the human beings who actually own and control it in the end. In the anticipated structure, each of those people would have an identifying number, and so we would get your proposed reverse index where you could look up a person and see what they owned.\n\nThe register introduced by the [Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/10/contents) is the \"[Register of Overseas Entities](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-an-overseas-entity)\" (ROE). However, as the name suggests, it only covers companies/partnerships/etc. from outside the UK. It's operated by Companies House. Overseas entities who have dealt in UK land since 1999/2014/2022 (depending on which part of the UK the land was in) have to list their beneficial owners. Because this is new, it is also not very complete yet: it only went live on 1 August 2022 and no penalties apply until the deadline of 31 January 2023\\.\n\nIn Scotland, the \"[Register of Persons Holding a Controlled Interest in Land](https://rci.ros.gov.uk/)\" (RCI) is meant to do the same but not just for overseas entities. It is live since 1 April 2022 and the initial registration period ends on 1 April 2023, so again it may not be very complete just yet.\n\nThere will likely be more political tussle over potential creation of a more extensive UK\\-wide register. Until that exists, this is a known problem with the extent of current data. You can get a partial view but even that will be frustrating when it comes to the most interesting chunks of property.",

Property ownership information in the UK is indeed fragmented across different registries, with varying levels of completeness and accessibility. The Land Registry doesn't cover all properties, and there are known accuracy issues. The Register of Overseas Entities (ROE) and the Scottish Register of Persons Holding a Controlled Interest in Land (RCI) are recent initiatives, but they are not yet complete and only cover specific types of ownership.

It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV.''\n\nHowever, in the 120\\+ years which followed Holmes' speech, it has been observed (see, for example, [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the\\-supreme\\-court\\-is\\-allergic\\-to\\-math/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-is-allergic-to-math/)) that the Supreme Court has not been very receptive to statistical/quantitative evidence.\n\nI would like to know of any counterexamples to that observation.\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is far from obvious what would qualify as a \u201cSupreme Court cases decided based on statistical evidence\u201d, actually, it is far from obvious what constitutes \u201cstatistical evidence\u201d. At the minimum, I expect that it is evidence which at least counts numbers of examples of something, and uses that number to reach a legal conclusion. For example \u201cOf the two candidates, Smith received 10,000 votes and Jones received 10,001 votes. The wording of the statute declares to be the winner that candidate who receives \u2018more than any other candidate\u2019, therefore we hold that Jones won\u201d. People often supplement raw counts with some measure of \u2018significance\u2019, which can be a significant (sorry about that) factor in discrimination cases, based on disparate impact theories; and also in evaluating forensic evidence (thus DNA evidence was poorly treated until the lawyers figured how to sell it).\n\nAny appeal to statistical hypothesis testing is highly unlikely to ever arise at the level of SCOTUS. That is because (generally\\-speaking, perhaps there are obscure uses baked into law) the law and the legislature do not mandate particular alphas for acceptance of a statistical hypothesis. Instead, admissibility of testimony is (federally, and for half of the states) determined by the [Daubert standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard), encoded as [FRE 702](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702) which requires that \u201cthe testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case\u201d, implicitly subsuming some domain\\-specific standards of hypothesis testing.\n\nTo the extent that DNA evidence is admissible in court and the expert can make a compelling, unrebutted argument for identity (\u201c1 chance in 70 billion\u201d as opposed to \u201c49 chances in 100\\), statistical evidence is routinely accepted (or excluded as inconclusive). SCOTUS does not commonly have [original jurisdiction](https://www.oyez.org/issues/392) so it is very unlikely that they would have ever been presented with trial\\-court level disputes involving words like \u201cBonferroni\u201d or \u201cPearson's chi\\-squared test\u201d.\n\n[This article](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/disparate-statistics) looks at the role of statistics in disparate impact cases in the US. The ruling in [Griggs v. Duke Power](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/401/424/)\ndoes not directly appeal to any statistical reasoning, it indicates simply that an pair of intelligence tests were used as a substitute for a requirement of a high school education, but the tests were not intended \u201cto measure the ability to learn to perform a particular job or category of jobs\u201d. A claim rejected by the lower court was that \u201cthese two requirements operated to render ineligible a **markedly disproportionate number** of Negroes, they were unlawful under Title VII unless shown to be job\\-related\u201d.\nThe dicta of Griggs provides numerous numeric statements such as\n\u201cwhile 34% of white males had completed high school, only 12% of Negro males had done so\u201d, \u201cuse of a battery of tests\u2026 resulted in 58% of whites passing the tests, as compared with only 6% of the blacks\u201d, \u201cthe percentage of white employees who were promoted but who were not high school graduates was nearly identical to the percentage of nongraduates in the entire white workforce\u201d.\n\nA striking mention of statistical concepts cited in Griggs is found in CFR \u00a7 1607, 35 Fed.Reg. 12333 (Aug. 1, 1970\\) which is a requirement that employers using tests have available \u201cdata demonstrating that the test is **predictive of or significantly correlated with** important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated\u201d. SCOTUS is absolutely silent on the question of actual numbers in this case, that is taken to be a matter of fact determined by the lower court, and SCOTUS\u2019s only job is to decide if employers can be required to show that a particular test is job\\-related. There is no discussion of what level of asymmetry in numbers is proof of discrimination.\n\nAnother relevant SCOTUS case is [Wards Cove Packing v. Antonio](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/490/642)\nwhich might be seen as a case of SCOTUS being \u201cunfriendly\u201d to statistics, but the ruling simply holds that proving statistical significant between variables is insufficient. In fact in the holding SCOTUS identifies the Court of Appeals error as being\n\n> a comparison of the percentage of cannery workers who are nonwhite and\n> the percentage of noncannery workers who are nonwhite makes out a\n> prima facie disparate\\-impact case. Rather, the proper comparison is\n> generally between the racial composition of the at\\-issue jobs and the\n> racial composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor\n> market\n\nIn the above statistical article, other cases are cited where the courts engaged in magnitude inquiries of practical significance. [29 CFR 1607\\.4](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1607.4) states a \u201crule\u201d known as the \u2018four\\-fifths\u201d rule that\n\n> A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than\n> four\\-fifths (4/5\\) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group with\n> the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement\n> agencies as evidence of adverse impact, while a greater than\n> four\\-fifths rate will generally not be regarded by Federal enforcement\n> agencies as evidence of adverse impact\n\nhowever the Supreme Court in [Watson v. Fort Worth Bank \\& Tr.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/487/977/), 487 U.S. 977 finds that this is no more that \u201ca rule of thumb\u201d. [Ricci v. Destefano](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/557/557/) finds that \u201c\\[A] prima facie case of disparate\\-impact liability \\[is] essentially, a threshold showing of a significant statistical disparity . . . and nothing more . . . .\u201d, and a prima facie demonstration does not require a disparity of any particular magnitude.\n\nIn short, SCOTUS cases frequently have a \u201cstatistical\u201d underpinning, any time a scientific question arises. By the nature of expert testimony and the Daubert standard, the court does not rule on what constitutes a technically\\-correct statistical test, that is a matter for the trier of fact to decide. Disparate impact cases provide the best opportunity for higher courts to be confronted with statistical arguments. If some law were passed that specifically requires a particular p\\-value on some body of numbers and demographics, the court would have to discern the legislative intent of such a law, and not the majority opinion of some body of scientists as to what is \u201cstatistically correct\u201d.",

        "answer": "Here is a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best reflects the Supreme Court's approach to statistical evidence in discrimination cases?\n\nA) The Supreme Court has established a strict statistical threshold (p-value) that must be met to prove discrimination.\n\nB) The Supreme Court relies primarily on the \"four-fifths rule\" as definitive proof of adverse impact in all cases.\n\nC) The Supreme Court considers statistical disparities as one factor, but does not require a specific magnitude of disparity to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\n\nD) The Supreme Court rejects all forms of statistical evidence in discrimination cases, relying solely on direct evidence of intent to discriminate.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Supreme Court's approach to statistical evidence in discrimination cases is nuanced. While statistical disparities are considered relevant, the Court has not established strict thresholds or relied solely on any single statistical rule. In cases like Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, the Court described the \"four-fifths rule\" as a \"rule of thumb\" rather than a definitive standard. In Ricci v. Destefano, the Court indicated that a prima facie case of disparate impact requires \"a threshold showing of a significant statistical disparity... and nothing more,\" without specifying a particular magnitude. The Court considers statistical evidence as one factor among others, recognizing its relevance while also emphasizing the need to consider the specific context and other relevant factors in each case. This approach aligns most closely with option C, which reflects the Court's balanced consideration of statistical evidence without mandating specific thresholds or rejecting such evidence entirely."

For example, suppose XYZ Entertainment Inc. publishes a movie, then ABC Studios LLC uses part of it in their own movie in a way that is possibly fair use. XYZ then sues ABC. If ABC won, however, the precedent would do them more harm than good long\\-term; they don't want other companies to be able to copy their work in that way, and they are willing to pay damages to XYZ to avoid that. In the scenario described in my question, ABC would try to lose the lawsuit, because the damages they will pay by losing are less than the long\\-term loss they would suffer due to the precedent set by them winning. Has something like this ever happened?

Seeking a settlement before trial is a common and ethical practice.
