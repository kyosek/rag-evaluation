The basic idea is that on an issue of public concern, an honest opinion isn't defamatory unless it makes a reasonable listener think the speaker knows something that is in fact not true (the classic example is \"In my opinion, Jones is a liar:\" here the speaker implies he knows that Jones lied, which is a statement of fact that can be true or false).\n\nIn your example, there are questions that have to be reached before fair comment even enters into it. First off, in US law *any* defamation claim has to be for a statement that a reasonable person would interpret as being a statement of fact or (if it's an opinion) implying a statement of fact (like \"I think Jones is a liar\"). This is context\\-dependent. \"I wouldn't let my child be alone with someone like *famous convicted pedophile 1*, *famous convicted pedophile 2*, or *politician*\" is more likely to be read as \"*politician* is a pedophile.\" A marked work of fiction is unlikely to be read as a statement of fact. If the statement is read as a simple opinion, or as pure fiction, there's no defamation under US law.\n\nOnce we've established that an express or implied statement of fact is at issue, fair comment asks whether the fact is true or false and whether it's an issue of public concern. But in the US, with a politician, you'd never go for the fair comment defense, because you have a much stronger defense \\-\\- a politician can only win the suit if they show that not only is the statement false, but the speaker actually knew or strongly suspected that it was false. It's not enough that a reasonable person would suspect it's false; it has to reach the level of recklessness, which is *extremely* hard to show (public figures in the US do not often win defamation suits). This is strictly easier than for fair comment.\n\nIf the politician wasn't a politician, and was actually a private figure, then fair comment could enter into it. In that case, the question is whether the statement is a reasonable opinion drawn from the (true) facts that lots of people didn't want their daughters alone with the person. While it's context\\-dependent, that could very well be fair comment.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A famous politician, John Doe, has been the subject of widespread rumors that some supporters fear leaving their college-aged daughters alone with him. An author writes a fictional novel using John Doe's real name, where a character expresses fear of leaving his 18-year-old daughter alone with the politician. If John Doe sues for defamation, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the author's potential defense?\n\nA) The author can claim fair comment as a defense, which would be sufficient to dismiss the case.\n\nB) The author has no viable defense since using a real person's name in fiction automatically constitutes defamation.\n\nC) The author's strongest defense is that John Doe, as a public figure, must prove actual malice to win a defamation case.\n\nD) The author can successfully argue that the work is pure fiction and therefore cannot be considered defamatory under any circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In the United States, when a public figure such as a politician sues for defamation, they must prove \"actual malice\" - that the defendant knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth. This is a much higher standard than for private individuals and is extremely difficult to prove. This would be the author's strongest defense.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while fair comment could be a potential defense, it's not the strongest one available in this case, given that John Doe is a public figure.\n\nOption B is incorrect because using a real person's name in fiction does not automatically constitute defamation, especially if it's clearly presented as fiction.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the fictional nature of the work is relevant, it's not an absolute defense.

In those comments I claimed that the estate of a deceased person is not a legal entity and that it is the personal representatives (executors if testate, administrators if intestate) who hold legal title to the assets of the estate and can sue and be sued in relation to those assets. That assertion was challenged by several people, which leads me to wonder if this is something which varies by jurisdiction.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, I'm taking \"legal entity\" to mean an entity which can hold legal title to an asset and be named as a party to a lawsuit in relation to that asset. There was some talk in the discussion about entities being *represented* in court by a natural person, but I do not consider that the same as being the person named as the party. So e.g. an assertion that \"*to sue for the assets in an estate, you sue the executor*\" would suggest that an estate is *not* a legal entity, while \"*to sue for the assets in an estate, you sue the estate itself which is then represented in court by the executor*\" would suggest that it *is* a legal entity.\n\n**Is the estate of a deceased person a legal entity?**\n\nGiven the level of disagreement, I'd prefer if possible to see jurisdiction tags and citations of which at least one is an authoritative legal source (ideally primary sources such as legislation or precedents, but secondary sources such as legal textbooks, journal articles, or practice notes aimed at practitioners would suffice).\n\nIt was pointed out that the IRS refers to an estate as a legal entity but my research indicates that carries a different meaning to the legal one and is relevant only in the context of federal tax filings. If intending to cite the IRS I'd be grateful if this could be backed up with a legal source to show that their use of \"legal entity\" carries the same meaning as the one defined above.\n\nI will self\\-answer to provide some citations which I believe support my proposition.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Good news: it behaves *like* a legal entity.\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAn estate is a collection of assets and liabilities that belonged to the deceased. The collection behaves a great deal like an LLC or other legal entity, *although states don't call it that*.\n\n* The collection is isolated from anyone else's collection of assets and liabilities. For instance, it's not part of the executor's personal assets, nor liabilities. That's very important because...\n* If the collection is *sued* e.g. by a creditor, the suit can only make claims against assets in the \"collection\". That is to say, the executor's own assets are not at risk. **That's very important if you're thinking about volunteering to become an executor or manager of a trust. You can do so without fear of personal liability**. Asterisk here \\*, but don't panic, it's a harmless asterisk.\n* The collection can buy and sell goods and services (more the latter generally). A typical service purchased by an estate is storage unit rental.\n* The collection can hire, fire and generally do business. Consider an estate which owns an apartment building. Life goes on: rent must be collected, utilities paid, leaky toilets fixed, contractors and managers hired and fired. In this case, the estate is *a going\\-concern business* behaving a lot like an LLC.\n* The collection/estate could potentially do business *indefinitely*, if the will of the heirs is to continue doing so. This might happen if splitting the assets equitably amongst the heirs wasn't possible (e.g. the estate of Leonard Cohen collects a lot of royalties)... or too complex to easily back out of (say: the deceased owned 5 McDonalds franchises and had bet the farm on opening two more; backing out now would bankrupt the estate, so the estate might oddly open two McDonalds.)\n* The collection can also sue, and proceeds from the suit or settlement go into the collection. Asterisk again. \\*\n* The collection has its own Taxpayer Identification Number (aka SSN or EIN).\n* The collection files its own 1040 tax form, and may do so for years or even decades.\n\n### The point of all these practical examples is that an estate *looks, walks and quacks* like a \"legal entity\". To the point where the IRS even calls it one.\n\nAnd to a boots\\-on\\-ground executor, manager or trustee, the reality is it handles like a legal entity, and the experience you have managing legal entities will largely apply, almost in full. Almost.\n\n\\* Now, that asterisk. Due to state court rules in many states, if you attempt to sue an estate, you have to use the right name. *And that's what this question is all about.*\n\nIt's a naming convention, and that is all.\n------------------------------------------\n\nAnd courts treat it as such.\n\nTake *Roe v. Wade*. \"Roe\" is an adaption of \"Doe\" as in \"John Doe\". Wade, however, was the district attorney of Dallas County at the time of filing. Wade wasn't being sued *personally*. It's just the quirky naming convention the court uses.\n\nWhat you have identified is a similar quirk in court rules, where instead of suing\n\n* Estate of John Q. Example,\n\nthe syntactically correct thing is to sue\n\n* Jane Doe, *in the capacity of, Executor of John Q Example's estate*.\n\nAnd the italic parts are optional, because the court knows that.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nIt's not important, and that's what the Florida Court of Appeals said in [florida](/questions/tagged/florida \"show questions tagged 'florida'\") [Spradley v Spradley 213 So. 3d 1042 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2017](https://casetext.com/case/spradley-v-spradley-5). The plaintiff had made exactly the above error: suing \"the estate of\" instead of suing \"Derreck Spradley et.al. (implied: in their capacity as executor)\". The judge threw out the case, saying in essence \"You forgot to \"dot an i\". The appeals court said no, the distinction is trivial and the court should have simply let the brother \"dot their i\" and continue with an entirely valid case.\n\nIn other words, **it was a distinction without a difference**.\n\nSo if sued, the executor should not panic about being \"named personally\" in the suit \\- you're not personally liable. And it is a waste of time to pick nits over how the name of the defendant is spelled, so says the Florida court at least... and in my humble opinion that precedent would be well received in other state courts, as it avoids wasting docket time and citizen filing fees on an action that will simply be re\\-filed correctly the next day.\n\nNot a license to cheat, however.\n--------------------------------\n\nOne way an executor *can* manage to create personal liability is to abuse or mishandle the role with extreme negligence.

Two contradictions cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nWhat do you think would happen in this hypothetical?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a couple of flaws in your hypothetical. Nobody, certainly not the state, represents the birth records as inerrant or complete. Birth records frequently have to be corrected. In fact the point of many paternity suits is to correct the official birth record. Sometimes the father, or even the mother will be listed as \"unknown\" on the birth record, so the absence of a birth record naming a person as a father is not dispositive. No government official would ever issue a legal document declaring that the man is not any child's legal father because the records don't establish that. At best they could issue a document stating that the man was not the father of record for any child in the state.\n\nAnyway, the exercise would be pointless. The only birth record the court would be interested in would be that for the child before them. None of the other birth records would be relevant to the case at hand.\n\nThe court in a paternity case would ask for evidence, such as birth certificates, or statements acknowledging paternity. If the two parties continued to dispute paternity, the court would order a paternity test.

Option B is wrong as government officials cannot issue such definitive statements based solely on birth records. Option C is inaccurate because courts consider various forms of evidence in paternity cases, not just birth records.

Is this the case in the whole of Canada?\n\nSubject to an exception for holographic wills (in all but one Canadian province) and choice of law issues, yes.\n\n**Ordinary Written Wills And Witnessing Irregularities In Them**\n\nA will does not need to be notarized to be valid, although the notarization makes the admission of the will to probate (i.e. the court process of determining that a will is legally valid) easier.\n\nA will with one witness that is notarized by a separate person still meets this requirement, however.\n\nSome people are not eligible to witness a will. So, if a will is signed by the testator and two witnesses, but one of the witnesses is ineligible to serve as a witness (e.g. because the witness is 7 years old, or has certain prohibited conflicts of interest), there is a problem.\n\nBut, I don't know what remedy would be applied in each province. Some jurisdictions allow a witness who was ineligible at the time and is not ineligible to be a witness at the time of death to testify and cure the defect. Some jurisdictions invalidate the will. Some jurisdictions, for example, in a case where someone not allowed to be a witness due to a conflict of interest witnessed the will, validate the will but void the rights of the ineligible witness under the will.\n\n**Other Irregularities In Written Wills**\n\nSome U.S. jurisdictions (including Colorado) and some jurisdictions in Australia, recognize the validity of the will that have immaterially defective formalities that were signed with an intent to be a will and have two witnesses.\n\nFor example, these jurisdictions might validate wills when the wife accidentally signed the husband's will and the husband accidentally signed the wife's will, both intending to sign their own will, or where \"magic words\" are missing from the execution clause or notarization, or where the testator's name is spelled inconsistently or incorrectly.\n\nOntario is a strict compliance jurisdiction. Any inconsistency with the formal requirements, as set out in the *Succession Law Reform Act*, renders a will invalid.\n\nI do not know if any other Canadian provinces have a legal authorization to remedy or reform such an inadvertent error in the formal execution of a will. I suspect that some do, either by statute or case law, but don't know and don't have a good source for finding out.\n\n**Holographic Wills**\n\nA will written substantially in the handwriting of the testator (i.e. of the person making their will) and signed by the testator, also known as a holographic will, is valid in most, but not all, Canadian provinces. Some jurisdictions honor oral wills in the hand writing of the testator, even without a signature, if the text makes clear that the testator is making a will for himself or herself.\n\nThe provinces that consider handwritten wills legal are Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Saskatchewan.\n\nHolographic wills are not recognized in the province of British Columbia. But if the will was written outside British Columbia and the concerned property is within BC, then the will can be upheld by the court.\n\n**Will Contracts**\n\nEven if a document is not itself a holographic will because it lacks language clearly intending to make it one itself and instead merely promises to make a will with certain provisions, a typed writing signed by someone who late dies can sometimes be interpreted as a valid contract to make a will that is enforceable in that fashion, even thought it is not itself enforceable as a valid will.\n\n**Oral Wills**\n\nNo Canadian provinces recognize the validity of oral wills (also known as nuncupative wills), that are recognized as valid under some circumstances in other common law jurisdictions.\n\nAny will not printed out in writing is an oral will, even if it is in a typewritten record in electronic form, and even if it has an electronic signature.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nA typewritten will merely signed by the testator, and not witnesses by two witnesses (perhaps with just one witness or no witnesses), or not printed out at all, would generally be invalid.\n\n**Choice of Law Exceptions**\n\nThere is also a choice of law issue. Usually a will which is valid where entered into is valid elsewhere even if it does not meet the formal requirements of the place where it is admitted to probate at the time it is admitted to probate. This is why a holographic will executed outside of BC is valid in BC (even as to BC property) even though BC does not recognize holographic wills.\n\nMost jurisdictions with common law legal systems also require that a will be in a writing signed by the testator and witnesses by two witnesses, so usually, it doesn't matter where the will was signed.\n\nBut, for example, Colorado has recently adopted a law authorizing certain will to be valid without being printed out, but to the best of my knowledge, no Canadian province has adopted legislation to this effect.\n\nSo, if you executed an electronic will in Colorado under circumstances where it would be valid in Colorado, a Canadian court might recognize it even though it doesn't meet the standards for a valid will executed in Canada.\n\nSimilarly, if an oral will was valid where it was made, but invalid in Canada, a Canadian court might still honor it.\n\n**Exceptions For Will Substitutes**\n\nAlso note that while a will must always be in writing in Canada, there are circumstances when a trust may be established orally and without witnesses other than the person entrusted with assets.\n\nAlso, some beneficiary designations on bank accounts and insurance policies and retirement policies and transfer on death deeds, for example, that function as *will substitutes*, are not held to the formal requirements of a will, even though they dispose of property upon death just as a will does. These are usually valid if signed by the person making the designation and delivered to a third\\-party associates with the asset (or noted in real property records in the case of real property) prior to the death of the person making them.\n\n**Lost Wills**\n\nUnlike most legal documents, generally, a will is like a $20 bill, a photocopy or scanned copy is not as good as the real thing. Sometimes documents like this are called \"real documents\" or \"real instruments.\" (Original promissory notes have the same character because they can be transferred to a new owner by endorsement of the original physical promissory note.)\n\nThis rule exists because, at common law and under the law still in force today in Canada and most common law jurisdictions, a will can be revoked by physically destroying or defacing the original with an intent to revoke it.\n\nBut, in the event that an original will is destroyed by fire or other disaster or malfeasance of a third party under circumstances that indicate that there was no intent to revoke it by the testator, the will can be admitted to probate based upon a paper or electronic copy of the original with adequate testimony regarding the unavailability of the original will.\n\n**Grounds For Contesting Facially Valid Wills and Will Substitutes**\n\nA will or will substitute that meets the formal requirements for a will or will substitute may still be invalidated, in whole or in part.\n\nThe most common grounds for doing so are:\n\n* undue influence on the testator by a beneficiary of the instrument,\n* lack of testamentary capacity which invalidates the instrument,\n* inauthentic signatures that invalidate a will (i.e. a forged instrument),\n* fraud in the inducement of the instrument,\n* a benefit conveyed by the instrument to someone who subsequently slays the decedent which is rendered void by operation of law,\n* a gift in favor of someone who subsequently divorced the decedent which is rendered void by operation of law,\n* unintentionally failing to provide for a child living at the time of death which results in an implied in law gift to that child,\n* partial invalidity for failing to make adequate provision for a surviving spouse, or\n* full or partial invalidity for failing to honor a valid contract or court order to make a will with specific provisions.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Canada, which of the following scenarios would most likely result in a valid will?\n\nA) A typed will signed by the testator and one witness, notarized by a separate person\nB) A handwritten will by the testator, signed but without witnesses, in British Columbia\nC) An electronic will created and signed digitally by the testator, with two digital signatures from witnesses\nD) A typed will signed by the testator and two witnesses, where one witness is the testator's 17-year-old child\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nA) This is correct.

(in an parallel: does using \"you're a wizard, Harry!\" to teach English pronunciation infringe H.P. copyright?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Applicability of trademark laws\n-------------------------------\n\nTrademark laws apply when you intend to use a word as the name of a brand, make, model, or otherwise the identifier of what you intend to sell. In addition, trademarks are registered within a bound domain and do not impact anything outside it. For example:\n\n* There are two Apple trademarks: One for Apple Inc., the notorious American company that sells iPhone and Mac. The other is a record label.\n* The Metro Inc. from Canada and the Metro AG from Germany cannot sue Microsoft for trademarking the word \"Metro\" for its API.\n\nApplicability of copyright laws\n-------------------------------\n\nCopyright, however, does not apply to individual names. Once a work as a whole is protected by copyright laws, no part of it may be reproduced in any way without the explicit permission of the copyright holder. But then, copyright laws of different countries are subject to such exceptions as:\n\n* Threshold of originality (whether something as a whole has enough authorship to be protected by copyright, whose purpose is to foster the growth of original art and culture); this does not apply to you.\n* The *de minimis* principle (applies when the violation of the law, including copyright, is so insignificant that the only disruption in the whole system of the governing country is the lawsuit itself)\n* The *fair use* principle (an exemption that applies to works that definitely infringe upon the core statements of copyright laws but they don't impact the author of original work significantly and actually foster the growth of art and culture). See the following:\n\n[Would it be legal to copy a small passage from a book to a website for language teaching purposes?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29148/would-it-be-legal-to-copy-a-small-passage-from-a-book-to-a-website-for-language)\n\nThe sum of all fears! (Pun intended)\n------------------------------------\n\nSo, for the usage that you mentioned, neither the trademark laws nor copyright laws hinder you.\n\nBut err on the side of caution: I've been told that while the spirit of the laws don't hinder what you explained, there were cases in U.S. in which some trademark holder attacked a party that used its mark, claiming that the latter intended to falsify association. Believe me, you don't want this to happen, i.e. you don't want to go to the court even though you win. (Not unless you have ample money, time and nerves, and are willing to waste them.)\n\nSo, publishers (well... at least, American and Canadian publishers) usually add a fineprint like this to their works:\n\n> * \"Windows\" is a trademark of \"Microsoft Corporation\". Unless stated otherwise, our use of this trademark does not imply any form of association to, or endorsement by, Microsoft Corporation.\n> * \"Harry Potter\" is an imprint of \"Scholastic Corporation\". Unless stated otherwise, our mention of the aforementioned does not imply \\[...]\n\nYour disclaimer, however, should probably be in Brazilian Portuguese, in which I am not fluent. So, you might want to use the appropriate literature. The purpose of this disclaimer is to defuse the potential lawsuit before it goes to the court. First, it reassures the trademark holder that you don't seek to abuse his/her mark. Second, if he/she is not convinced, there will be the burden of proving that your disclaimer was a lie. Going to the court isn't cheap and the burden of proof makes it more expensive.

Copyright laws generally don't prevent use of short quotes or titles under principles like de minimis or fair use, especially for educational purposes.\n3.

[Missouri Statutes \u00a7577\\.029](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=577.029) says\n\n> A licensed physician, registered nurse, phlebotomist, or trained\n> medical technician, acting at the request and direction of the law\n> enforcement officer under section 577\\.020, shall, with the consent of\n> the patient or a warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction,\n> withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol content of\n> the blood, unless such medical personnel, in his or her good faith\n> medical judgment, believes such procedure would endanger the life or\n> health of the person in custody. Blood may be withdrawn only by such\n> medical personnel, but such restriction shall not apply to the taking\n> of a breath test, a saliva specimen, or a urine specimen. In\n> withdrawing blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol content\n> thereof, only a previously unused and sterile needle and sterile\n> vessel shall be utilized and the withdrawal shall otherwise be in\n> strict accord with accepted medical practices. Upon the request of\n> the person who is tested, full information concerning the test taken\n> at the direction of the law enforcement officer shall be made\n> available to him or her.\n\n\"Shall\" means \"must\" \u2013 if there is a warrant (we assume there is no consent). Then the question is, what happens if the phlebotomist (etc) refuses? First, [\u00a7577\\.031](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=577.031&bid=29960) immunizes the medical\\-person from legal liability when they act in compliance with a request from a LEO (a simple request, not necessarily accompanied by a warrant). [\u00a7577\\.033](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=577.033&bid=29962) says that being dead, unconscious or otherwise incapable of refusing does not constitute withdrawal of consent (which is implied, by law). No specific penalty is prescribed for refusal to administer a court\\-ordered blood draw. There is no penalty for complying, there is no prescribed criminal penalty for refusing to comply with a court order (there is the possibility of a finding of contempt of court).\n\nNot every state is Missouri: I understand that Utah is different.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to Missouri law, which of the following statements is true regarding blood draws for DUI investigations?\n\nA) Medical professionals are never required to draw blood for police investigations without patient consent.\n\nB) A warrant is always required for a blood draw, even if the suspect consents.\n\nC) Medical professionals must comply with a blood draw request if there's either patient consent or a valid warrant, unless they believe it would endanger the patient's health.\n\nD) Medical professionals face criminal penalties if they refuse to perform a court-ordered blood draw.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to Missouri Statute \u00a7577.029, licensed medical professionals \"shall, with the consent of the patient or a warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, withdraw blood\" for determining alcohol content. However, they may refuse if they believe in good faith that the procedure would endanger the life or health of the person in custody.\n\nOption A is incorrect because medical professionals are required to draw blood with either consent or a warrant, not never.\n\nOption B is false because the law specifically states that either consent OR a warrant is sufficient.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while refusing a court order could potentially result in contempt of court, there are no specific criminal penalties outlined in the provided statutes for refusing to perform a court-ordered blood draw."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61413/what-is-the-emancipation-process", "docs_id": 61413, "title": "What is the emancipation process?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am looking into emancipation and was wondering what the process looks like.

There is no statute regarding emancipation, which means that the courts deal with the issue on an ad hoc basis. The process is basically that you file a petition with the Court of Common Pleas, there will be a hearing, and the judge will issue a ruling. There is no specific form, instead you would need to hire an attorney to file a petition etc. The process focuses on the specific reason for emancipation, for example \"for medical consent\", or to get around the fact that you have to go to the school in the district where your parents live. Bear in mind that what emancipation means is \"being treated as an adult\", where no court order will give you the right to purchase alcohol under\\-age. No emancipation hearing is required to receive public assistance.

The employer is not likely to be a \"covered entity\", so these permissions are irrelevant. Furthermore, included in this section is a provision where disclosure is allowed in the case of\n\n> (v) An employer, about an individual who is a member of the workforce\n> of the employer\n\nwith various conditions following such as\n\n> (A) The covered entity is a covered health care provider who provides\n> health care to the individual at the request of the employer:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) To conduct an evaluation relating to medical surveillance of the\n> workplace; or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) To evaluate whether the individual has a work\\-related illness or\n> injury\n\nHowever, these permissions apply to covered entities, not employers.

Is that true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, One Can\n------------\n\nIn the United States, one may assert the Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify or otherwise give information that might tend to implicate the speaker in a crime. This is true in any court proceeding, civil or criminal, whether the person asserting the privilege is an accused, a witness, or a party to a civil case. It may be asserted in a Grand Jury or trial proceeding. One may also assert the privilege under police interrogation, or in an administrative proceeding. One may also assert it when testifying before Congress, a state legislature, or any local legislative body. One may also assert it when testifying before a government agency, such as the Interstate Commerce Commission. Asserting the privilege is often informally called \"pleading the Fifth\", although strictly speaking \"pleading\" is something that only an accused does (as in \"I plead not guilty\"). The availability of the privilege in civil cases has been true at least since the *Saline Bank* case of 1828 (see below).\n\nThe privilege is not available when no criminal prosecution is legally possible, such as when the statute of limitations has expired, or when the law invoked has been held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, and no other valid law applies. Thus, if an authorized government official (usually a prosecutor) offers a grant of immunity, the privilege is no longer available on matters covered by the grant, and the person asserting it must then testify on such matters.\n\nThe privilege may be asserted when the person doing so is actually guilty, or when the person is not guilty, but has a reasonable belief that the statements asked for might be used against the speaker in some current or future criminal proceeding. A person who has been tried for a crime nut had the case end in a mistrial, or a dismissal without prejudice, could still be re\\-tried for that accusation, and so may assert the privilege.\n\nAny assertion must be clear, but need not use a specific form of worfs. The standard form advised by many lawyers is\n\n> I decline to answer on the grounds that the answer might tend to incriminate me.\n\nbut less formal wording such as 'I take the Fifth\" will also serve to assert the privilege.\n\nWhen the privilege is asserted in a court case, the Judge may question the person asserting it in private, off the record, to determine whether the fear of incrimination is reasonable.\n\nCase Law\n--------\n\n### *Saline Bank* (1828\\)\n\nIn the case of [*United States v. Saline Bank of Virginia*, 26 U.S. 100 (1828\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/26/100/) Chief Justice Marshall wrote:\n\n> It is apparent that, in every step of the suit, the facts required to be discovered in support of this suit would expose the parties to danger. The rule clearly is that **a party is not bound to make any discovery which would expose him to penalties**, and this case falls within it. \\[This case was cited in *Murphy*, below]\n\n*Saline Bank* was a civil suit by the US treasury in Federal curt against an apparently unincorporated bank, but a Virginia state law of the time made it a crime to operate or participate in a bank without a proper charter. Thus the Marshall Court held that a witness in a civil suit could assert the privilege against the future possibility of a state criminal proceeding.\n\n### *Kastigar* (1972\\)\n\nIn [*Kastigar v.

This Court has been zealous to safeguard the values that underlie the privilege \\[Citing the *Miranda* case in a footnote].\n\n(*Kastigar* was a case in which people subpoenaed before a Grand Jury asserted the privilege, were granted immunity, and still refused to testify, alleging that the grant of immunity was not enough to revoke the privialge.

The contrary must be accepted as settled. **The privilege is not ordinarily dependent upon the nature of the proceeding** in which the testimony is sought or is to be used. **It applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it.** The privilege protects a mere witness as fully as it does one who is also a party defendant.

In this scenario, both X (plaintiff) and Z (defendant) reside in the same state when the lawsuit is filed. The fact that Y originally signed the contract or lives in a different state is irrelevant because Y is not a party to the current lawsuit.

You would have to rebuild the code from scratch. There is a significant chance that the code would be \"substantially similar\" to the code that you were hired to build, also that if anybody else were to write a bubble sort or 24\\-to\\-am/pm conversion routine, it would look the same, where even variable names (which should describe function) are the same or very similar. In case of an infringement lawsuit, you would have to defend yourself by showing that there are only a few ways to code a given function.\n\nCopyright protects only the \"expression\", not the abstract idea. A linked list is an idea, which can't be protected by copyright; same with recursion, pointers, stacks, object\\-oriented programming... Anything that involves copy and paste is infringement. If you re\\-read the copyrighted code and then try to reconstruct it, you probably crossed the infringement line. If you remember the problems and solutions and accidentally write somewhat similar code, that is probably on the safe side.\n\nFrom the perspective of the programmer not wanting to always reinvent the wheel, it would be most useful to make a distinction in the contract between \"the essentials of the customer's program\" versus \"incidental utility work\". The difficulty will arise in saying specifically what is essential vs. incidental. For instance, I know that if I were to hire you to develop a speech\\-recognition system, low\\-level audio\\-acquisition and encoding would not be essential to my purpose, whereas DSP parsing routines would be the center of my interest.

You want to set up a business that essentially combines three different concepts: \n\n* Network streaming from your PC to a different screen across the network using remote screen software; e.g. [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/features/), or a Chromecast, e.g. playing a PC\\-only game on your iPad, which I've done.\n* Basically [AWS](https://lg.io/2015/07/05/revised-and-much-faster-run-your-own-highend-cloud-gaming-service-on-ec2.html): Renting a dedicated server, racked in a server room far, far away, and remote\\-screening off that server. AND, time\\-sharing the dedicated server; i.e. the server is dedicated to you *while you are using it*, and an hour later your environment may be boxed, and the actual iron allocated to someone else.\n\nSo in principle, you'd have an array of racks and racks of dedicated PCs, all headless or blades. They'd all be preloaded with a standard image, with a virgin (un\\-customered) Steam, GoG, Battle.net etc. etc. Customer would \n\n1. Lease a dedicated PC from you, and you'd grab one out of the pool of available PCs.\n2. Remotely controlling it (a\\-la Parsec): Launch Steam etc., log into *their* account.\n3. Install a game on it.\n4. Play the game as long as they liked.\n5. Quit playing and log out.\n6. You'd wipe the PC's disk and return it to the pool.\n\nI'm with you so far.

I am seeking, after years of struggle,medication and therapy, a diagnosis.\n\nLast week, I booked a consultation for the next available slot at an aesthetic clinic to enquire about dermal fillers. At the appointment the following day, the clinic director told me she instead recommended something called a thread lift, a much more extreme and invasive non\\-surgical face lift procedure. I am a 33 year old female, and even though she had my date of birth right in front of her on the consultation form, she kept telling me my genetics were against me as I had serious collagen loss at age 36\\.

I am also shocked that the clinic did no screening for mental health flags and also that they offered me the procedure in such a short timeframe after my initial consultation (1\\.5 hours later), without giving me time to go away, reflect on the information they'd provided, to research and make an informed decision. If I had done that, I'm certain I wouldn't have gone ahead with it and willingly given away such a substantial sum of money.\n\nI'm unsure if there is anything I can do here, as I obviously willingly signed the forms and agreed to it all on the day. The forms also included sentences around 'i understand I can withdraw at any time/I'm not being pressured into going ahead,' which I ultimately signed.\n\nAre there any UK laws specifically around consumers making poor decisions during a mental health crisis, and/or medical service providers not screening for such concerns, and/or not giving patient sufficient time to independently make a considered decision?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You went to this clinic voluntarily out of your own free will; things would be different if they had contacted you first.

Did they in any way force you to sign up and pay, for example walk with you to a cash machine? That might make a difference.\n\nIn the forms it said \"I understand that I can withdraw at any time\". That's what you should have done. \"I'm not being pressured into going ahead\" on the other hand would likely be worthless, since if you were pressured, you would have signed this anyway. But that doesn't mean you were pressured, you'd have to give evidence for this.\n\nUnless you can show that your mental problems are so bad that you will make decisions against your will, this looks difficult. And if you have those mental problems, that might mean that someone else would have to make those decisions.\n\nI would suggest consulting a lawyer and ask for their opinion.

If there is no clear, **unconditional** acceptance then there is no contract at that time; this applies even if you have paid for the goods.\n\nIf this is the case (and I strongly suspect that it would be for most online stores), then their acceptance of your offer and the formation of the contract probably does not come into effect until they \"give objective manifestation of an intent to form the contract\" by shipping the goods.

It turns out that this terminology is very old. [Wikipedia notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement#.22Piracy.22) that this sense of the word piracy is attested as far back as 1603 CE and was used as part of the language of a copyright treaty as early as 1886 CE. \n\nIn particular, people who use or distribute unauthorized copies of movies, television shows, videos of live concerts, and music are also frequently said to be engaged in pirating of the material.\n\nThe term is used in this context in [testimony before Congress](https://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat052505.html) by the chief U.S. Copyright official in 2005\\.\n\n[Critics of the term](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2011/12/15/piracy_is_a_form_of_theft_and_copyright_infringement_is_neither.html) argue that \"piracy,\" which originally meant armed robbery of tangible property on the high seas (a form of theft), is an inapt way to describe copyright infringement which is really different in kind than theft because copyright infringement does not deprive anyone of use of the materials, it merely impairs the legally granted monopoly of someone regarding how it shall be used. As Matthew Yglesias [explains at Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2011/12/15/piracy_is_a_form_of_theft_and_copyright_infringement_is_neither.html):\n\n> If I steal your car then you don't have a car anymore, whereas if I\n>  duplicate a digital media file we both end up with it.

An expression like \"in the course of employment with the company\" is vague and could refer to \"during that time period\" or to \"as a result of\". If the intent is \"during that time period\", then you should say it that way, and perhaps the candidate will decide to not take the position. Since the company gets to write the contract, the courts will interpret ambiguous language against the interest of the contract's author.\n\nIf the contract is written differently for copyright versus patents, then patents could be handled differently.

However, these do not contain adequate treatments of legal content acquisition. \n\nProviding that an individual:\n\n1. Seeks to use copyrighted content that is not available from publicly\\-licensed sources (e.g. MovieClips.com, public domain)\n2. Uses content in an objectively \"fair\\-use\" manner\n3. Takes illegal measures to acquire content (e.g. [ripping DVDs](http://lifehacker.com/5978326/is-it-legal-to-rip-a-dvd-that-i-own), torrent, breach of contract)\n\n\t* Will fair\\-use and source legality be determined separately in a court of law?\n\t* Further, will a judicial determination that the content source (or method of acquisition) was illegal necessarily determine that usage was \"unfair\"?\n\t* Conversely, does fair\\-use ever justify the method of sourcing content (especially dvd\\-ripping)? This has been implied in responses elsewhere on stackexchange.\n\nContext: United States\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two senses in which \"content\" acquisition could be legal / illegal. One regards the act of copying from a source, and the other regards the legality of accessing that source. Copyright law does not distinguish between making an unauthorized copy from a DVD that you own, as opposed to one that you stole.\n\nThere is a practical difference between stealing a DVD and copying it, or hacking into a computer and stealing material, in that these acts involve a crime plus an actionable civil tort (copyright infringement): they involve \"illegal acquisition\" in the second sense, but not necessarily the first. Conversely, acquisition of a borrowed or owned DVD is not illegal, but acquiring material (copying) from the source may be illegal.\n\nCopyright law does not distinguish whether your access was legal or illegal. If you steal a DVD and copy an amount that is consistent with fair use, you may be prosecuted for theft, but that would not create liability for copyright infringement that would not exist if access to the material were lawful. \"Ripping\" and \"torrent\" are just popular ways of data acquisition typically associated with infringement. Copying from a DVD is not illegal, and streaming, no matter how fast, is not illegal. Copying without permission or in excess of fair use is what is illegal.\n\nHowever, outside the bounds of the law, the rights holder might find it okay if you make a copy if you own the DVD (the main record industry special interest organization at some point said \"we don't mind\", but that doesn't change the law). \n\nThe Creative Commons copyright\\-renunciation license CC\\-0, and expired\\-copyright works (so\\-called \"public domain\") are effectively immune to the limitations of fair use, in the former case because permission has been unconditionally granted, and in the latter case because the law no longer protects the work (copyright is not perpetual). Most publicly\\-licensed material is conditionally licensed, and thus it is possible to infringe copyright of publicly\\-licensed material (by not satisfying the license conditions). Even so, *all* licensed (and non\\-licensed) works are subject to a fair use analysis. Whether or not you break into a computer or have permission to access the computer, and in either event if you copy material subject to the Creative Commons Non\\-Commercial license NC, your liability for copyright infringement is strictly a function of whether you have complied with the license terms, or else your use is \"fair use\".\n\nIf a person puts an illegal copy of a book \"out there\" and protects it with a password that only he knows, the courts are likely to treat such an offense more generously, as compared to a person who wholesale steals hundreds of books and makes them flagrantly available to one and all.

The CC BY\\-SA agreement contains two clauses relevant to the form of attribution.\n\nOne, as the question points out, is paragraph 4(c), which states that \"credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner.\" This language is much less restrictive than the StackExchange blog post.\n\nThe other relevant clause is the last clause of the agreement, paragraph 8(e), which is a standard integration clause:\n\n> This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\nIn other words, any changes to the license, which would include any additional restrictions on the nature of the attribution that may be given (besides the \"reasonable manner\" specified in the license) are effective only if both parties agree to do so in writing.\n\nThe specific law applied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction is going to vary, but in general, in the United States, when you have a fully integrated agreement such as this license, a court will not look at anything outside the four corners of the agreement to determine the parties' rights and duties.\n\nIf a court finds this to be a fully integrated agreement, and refuses to consider \"parol evidence,\" meaning statements outside of the contract, then StackExchange can post a page asking people to attribute content in a particular way, but no, they cannot require it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the discussion on LawStackExchange, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Stack Exchange's attribution requirements for user contributions licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0?\n\nA) Stack Exchange's blog post specifying additional attribution requirements is legally binding and must be followed by all users of the content.\n\nB) The CC BY-SA 3.0 license allows primary distributors like Stack Exchange to add any restrictions they want to the attribution requirements.\n\nC) Users can ignore Stack Exchange's specific attribution requirements as long as they provide attribution in any reasonable manner as per the CC BY-SA 3.0 license.\n\nD) The CC BY-SA 3.0 license requires users to follow Stack Exchange's specific attribution requirements, including direct hyperlinks to author profiles and non-use of URL shorteners.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the CC BY-SA 3.0 license states that \"credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner.\" Additionally, the license contains an integration clause (paragraph 8(e)) which specifies that the license constitutes the entire agreement between parties, and additional provisions appearing in any communication are not binding. Stack Exchange's blog post with specific attribution requirements is likely not enforceable as it goes beyond the terms of the actual license agreement.

I bet you didn't do anything like that, because that's fairly obscure banking stuff they don't teach in school anymore.\n\nBut yes, taking money out of an account not yours, without permission and without replacing that money, will put you in legal jeopardy **because you did not promptly replace the money** /cover it / make it good. The substance of the crime is in not replacing the money promptly.\n\nI mean it's technically a crime if you do replace the money, but there is no *mens rea* or \"guilty mind\", which is an essential element of a crime. For instance, I one pumped gas and drove off. I got a phone call from a police detective, and I immediately high\\-tailed it back to the gas station and paid my bill with a hearty apology. *Nothing more was made of it*.\n\nSince your boyfriend now seems to be hostile, I would advise re\\-paying your boyfriend using a payment method which is tracked and leaves a paper trail \\- like a cashier's check from a bank where you have a relationship. If you pay the boyfriend cash, nothing proves you paid it!\n\nYou might even consider opening your own account at the bank involved in this crisis. Then you can say \"look, that wasn't a fraudulent check at all, I just used bad judgment sharing an ATM, and I'd like to deposit that check into my own account here\".

In this scenario, Alice has several less extreme options, such as contacting law enforcement, securing her vehicle, or setting up surveillance.

The attorney's behavior exists in a gray area of professional ethics. While attorneys have a duty of diligence to their clients (ABA Model Rule 1.3) and should make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation (Rule 3.2), short-term delays for practical reasons (like managing workload or staffing changes) are not necessarily unethical. However, if the delay becomes excessively long or is clearly intended to harm the opposing party, it could violate Rule 4.4, which prohibits using means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person. The key is the reasonableness and length of the delay. Option A is too strong, as the behavior isn't clearly unethical for short-term delays.

Being ignorant of the copyright status is not a defense to infringement, although if they were \"not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright\", statutory damages [may be reduced](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504).\n\nIt's possible that the publisher has a clause in the publishing contract saying the author must pay if the publisher gets sued. However, this won't prevent the lawsuit from naming the publisher; it just means the publisher can later seek money from the author.\n\nDetermination of [fair use](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107) is a multi\\-factor test. I can't say for sure whether the use of the image would or would not fall under fair use, especially without reading the book (context is important), although at a glance it seems unlikely that this would be fair use. The nature of the use seems to be cover art for a book (probably against fair use), the nature of the copyrighted work is a creative image (against fair use), and it looks like the entire image is used (against fair use.)

Both the author and the publisher can be sued for copyright infringement, regardless of their awareness of the infringement. Copyright law protects various rights, including the right to reproduce, distribute, and create derivative works. In publishing an infringing book, both parties are likely engaging in one or more of these protected activities.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it falsely limits liability to the author alone. The publisher is also involved in the reproduction and distribution of copyrighted material.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because ignorance of copyright status is not a defense against infringement.

What are examples of employer breaching employee contract?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The most simple way how an employer can violate a work contract is usually not mentioned specifically, but heavily implied: **Non\\-payment of wages.**\n\nIf the employer does not pay by the due date, he is in breach of the contract, as he had agreed to pay. But what happens then is dependant on the country you are in and the governing laws.\n\n### Example: [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\")\n\nThe laws for the protection of the employees are strong in Germany. In the case of nonpayment by due date, the employer automatically is in violation of law and doesn't even need to be notified extra, the moment he doesn't pay he is liable for interest. He's *also* liable for *extra* expenses that the employee accrues because the payment is late. If the non\\-payment continues, the employee may reduce or stop working, depending on the amount of wages outstanding, until the outstanding wages are paid (partially). Neither of these results from the laws are ever referenced in work contracts, but their presence in the law is implied. It also leads to the wording in work contracts such as these:\n\n> \u00a71 \\[What is the employment contract for]\n> \n> \n> \u00a72 \\[Start and end of the employment]\n> \n> \n> \u00a73 *Compensation*\n> \n> \n> 1. Employer will pay employee X as wage per month \\[sometimes also phrased in an hourly rate].\n> 2. Payment is due till the last day of a calendar month by money transfer to a bank of employee's choice.\n> \n> \n> \u00a74 *weekly worktime* \\- The regular work time per week is Y hours.\n\nThe wording makes it rather clear, that non\\-payment of the compensation (wage) is a breech of the contract, having the aforementioned effects that are written out in the laws: \u00a7 286 Abs.2 Nr.1 BGB \\& \u00a7 614 BGB dictate the interest after the payment date and when that is. \u00a7 273 Abs.1 BGB allows the employee that is not paid on time to reduce the work done until the missing payment is done, and it is generally assumed that two full missing monthly wages allow to fully stop working till the missing amount is lower than this. \u00a7 626 Abs.1 BGB states, that the employee can, without notice period, dissolve the work contract if 2 monthly wages are not paid, as long as he notified the employer of not having paid on time in the proper way (\"Abmahnung\" \\~ Writeup).\n\nAnd atop that, as [gnasher](https://law.stackexchange.com/users/525/gnasher729) notes, not paying the employee still forces the employer to pay the income tax on the amount that is owed to the employee, and the tax has even to be paid before the employee is.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In German employment law, what is the correct sequence of events and legal provisions that apply when an employer fails to pay wages on time?\n\nA) The employer is immediately liable for interest, the employee can reduce work hours, and after two missed payments, the employee can terminate the contract without notice.\n\nB) The employee must first provide a written warning, then can reduce work hours after one missed payment, and can terminate the contract after three missed payments.\n\nC) The employer has a grace period of 30 days, after which the employee can stop working entirely until all back wages are paid.\n\nD) The employee must continue working at full capacity while pursuing legal action, and can only terminate the contract after a court ruling.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: According to German law, when an employer fails to pay wages on time:\n1. The employer is automatically in violation and liable for interest (\u00a7 286 Abs.2 Nr.1 BGB & \u00a7 614 BGB).\n2. The employee may reduce work done until the missing payment is made (\u00a7 273 Abs.1 BGB).\n3.

Apparently, regulations that might have banned palm kernel oil were repealed, but they would not have banned palm fruit oil.

This practice likely has historical and quasi-legal roots, aiming to inform consumers that these are oils extracted from the fruit part of the plant, not from seeds or kernels.\n\nFor olive oil, this distinction is less crucial as olive oil is typically derived from the fruit. However, for palm oil, it's more significant. \"Palm (fruit) oil\" specifically refers to oil from the fruit of the palm, distinguishing it from palm kernel oil, which comes from the seed.\n\nThis labeling practice helps consumers understand the exact source of the oil and may relate to historical regulations or differences in how various oil types are regulated or perceived. It's not about organic certification (A), international trade compliance (C), or a special infusion process (D), but rather about clearly specifying the part of the plant from which the oil is derived."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9354/can-i-use-the-word-saga-in-a-video-game-name", "docs_id": 9354, "title": "Can I use the word &quot;Saga&quot; in a video game name?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From what I understand King owns the word \"saga\" as it pertains to video games from this article \\- [http://www.polygon.com/2014/4/17/5624980/king\\-settles\\-trademark\\-disputes\\-with\\-the\\-banner\\-saga\\-developer](http://www.polygon.com/2014/4/17/5624980/king-settles-trademark-disputes-with-the-banner-saga-developer)\n\nBut I can't tell from the article or from copyright record searches whether this is actually true, and since the developers of \"The Banner Saga\" settled out of court with King it doesn't help to explain either. \n\nWould it be against copyright law to use the word saga in a name of a video game?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, it's got nothing to do with copyright law. You can't copyright a word, or even a short phrase, whether or not it's a title. This is a matter of trademark law.\n\nSecond, it would probably not be a violation of trademark law, assuming the title is relevant to the work and you aren't trying to mislead people into thinking it's a King game.

Grimaldi](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/524053/ginger-rogers-v-alberto-grimaldi-mgmua-entertainment-co-and-pea/) (2d Cir. 1989\\), in which Ginger Rogers and the estate of Fred Estare sued over a movie which was titled \"Ginger and Fred\". Under the Rogers test, the title of an expressive work does not violate trademark law \"unless the title has no artistic relevance to the underlying work whatsoever, or, if it has some artistic relevance, unless the title explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the work.\"\n\nHowever, it is very possible that you'd be sued by King, and it's even possible you'd lose.

Note that if a person is unable to perform the essential duties of a job, even with a reasonable accommodation, an employer is free not to hire such a person.

Not all cases of obesity are considered disabilities, but severe cases that substantially limit major life activities or are regarded as such by the employer could be protected. The policy may be discriminatory if it screens out individuals whose obesity qualifies as a disability under these acts. Answers A and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the legal situation and ignore the potential for obesity to be considered a disability in some cases.

The crutch of the debate was whether Federal employees or military could use a prostitute if they went to Las Vegas.\n\nProstitution is legal in certain parts of LV. However, the debate was whether there was a Federal law that would prohibit travelling to another state for the express purpose of using a prostitute. At least one person suggested it was illegal due to human trafficking's laws, though I'm not convinced that is accurate.\n\nSo, could a Federal employee legally travel to LV with the intent of using a prostitute there? As a related question is it possible that it's legal, i.e. I won't end up in jail, but would be grounds for termination from Federal employment; though I realize the latter question may be more policy than a legal question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Short Answer\n\nIt is not illegal for a federal employee or anyone else, who is not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to travel to Nevada for the purposes of engaging the services of a prostitute in the counties of Nevada (Clark County where Las Vegas, Nevada is located is not one such county) where it is legal.\n\nBut, this is an offense under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice applicable primarily to U.S. military personnel while serving in that capacity, even in cases where prostitution is legal under local law and the service member is not married.\n\n### Long Answer\n\n**Legal Prostitution In Nevada, In General**\n\nAs another answer correctly notes that in Nevada:\n\n> Clark County, the county in which Las Vegas is located, has made\n> prostitution illegal. . . . You also can't do it in Reno (it's illegal\n> in Washoe County) and the nearby independent city of Carson City\n> (Nevada State Capital).\n> \n> \n> In fact, the law only permits counties with a population of 70,000 or\n> less to do it per county law.

Even then, only\n> 8 counties have at least one active brothel in operation.\n\n**Civilian Legal Considerations In The U.S. Not Involving International Travel**\n\nIt seems as if the concern of the original post might be with the Mann Act.\n\n> [The Mann Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann_Act) (also known as the White\\-Slave Traffic Act of 1910\\) is a\n> federal law that criminalizes the transportation of \u201cany woman or girl\n> for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other\n> immoral purpose.\u201d\n\n([Source](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mann_act))\n\nThis has been revised in a manner that, among other things, is now gender\\-neutral and limiting it to circumstances in which the act for which the prostitute is transported is illegal. It was the first federal human trafficking law in the U.S.\n\nThis act applies to transporting the prostitute across state lines, not the prostitute's customer.\n\nCloser to the mark is the [Travel Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_Act):\n\n> The Travel Act or International Travel Act of 1961, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952,\n> is a Federal criminal statute which forbids the use of the U.S. mail,\n> or interstate or foreign travel, for the purpose of engaging in\n> certain specified criminal acts.\n\nBut, since the travel would be for the purpose of an act that is legal at its destination, it wouldn't apply.\n\nInternational treaties on sex tourism are inapplicable to domestic travel, and I don't try to analyze their applicability here.\n\nNone of these relevant laws treat military personnel or federal employees differently.\n\n**Prosecutions Under The Uniform Code of Military Justice**\n\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice provides an internal means of prosecuting military service members who are currently serving and a small number of other persons, via courts\\-martial, which are quasi\\-criminal proceedings with quasi\\-criminal punishments.\n\nArticle 134 of the UCMJ is its general provision which is a catch\\-all article barring anything \"of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces\", and also certain unenumerated offenses which are illegal under local law where the offense is committed, or under federal law. Article 134 encompasses many sub\\-offenses which are enumerated in the Manual For Courts\\-Martial but not in the statutory language of the UCMJ itself.\n\nOne of the offenses which the Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in the United States prohibits is adultery (which only a handful of U.S. states do and Nevada does not), so this would be an activity, if carried out, that would be subject to court\\-martial for a married member of the military who is currently serving in the military and thus subject to court\\-martial jurisdiction. Adultery prosecutions under the UCMJ are reasonably common even now.\n\n(A lesser included offense of adultery under the UCMJ is \"wrongful cohabitation\" which is akin to adultery and bigamy but does not require a showing a sexual intercourse.)\n\nAlso, as noted in the comments to the question, while patronizing a prostitute is not a specific offense in the UCMJ in the statute itself, it is another offense that can also be prosecuted under Article 134\\. It has been DOD policy [since at least 2006](https://www.stripes.com/news/patronizing-a-prostitute-is-now-a-specific-crime-for-servicemembers-1.43314) to prosecute service members under Article 134 for engaging in prostitution, whether or not the service member is married, and whether or not prostitution is legal under local law. (Prostitution is not illegal under federal law other than the UCMJ.)\n\nThis is not obvious from the language of Article 134 of the UCMJ (which is codified at 10 U.S. Code \u00a7 934\\), itself, which states:\n\n> Though not specifically mentioned in this chapter, all disorders and\n> neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed\n> forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed\n> forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject\n> to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a\n> general, special, or summary court\\-martial, according to the nature\n> and degree of the offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of\n> that court. As used in the preceding sentence, the term \u201ccrimes and\n> offenses not capital\u201d includes any conduct engaged in outside the\n> United States, as defined in section 5 of title 18, that would\n> constitute a crime or offense not capital if the conduct had been\n> engaged in within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of\n> the United States, as defined in section 7 of title 18\\.\n\nBut, the primary and authoritative interpretive authority for Article 134 of the UCMJ is the [Manual for Courts\\-Martial](https://www.sapr.mil/public/docs/ucmj/UCMJ_Article134_General_Article.pdf), with the force of a law or validly adopted regulation. This indicates that prosecutions for pandering a prostitute under Article 134 does not require a showing that it is illegal to do so under local law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. military service member travels to a county in Nevada where prostitution is legal and engages the services of a prostitute. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal consequences for this service member?\n\nA) The service member has not violated any laws or regulations, as prostitution is legal in that county.\n\nB) The service member can be prosecuted under federal law for traveling across state lines to engage in prostitution.\n\nC) The service member can be court-martialed under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, regardless of the legality of prostitution in that county.\n\nD) The service member can only face consequences if they are married, as adultery is prohibited under the UCMJ.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, even though prostitution may be legal in certain counties in Nevada, military service members can still be prosecuted under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for engaging in prostitution. This is true regardless of the local laws or the marital status of the service member. The Department of Defense has had a policy since at least 2006 to prosecute service members under Article 134 for engaging in prostitution, even when it's legal under local law. Options A and D are incorrect because they don't account for this policy. Option B is incorrect because while there are federal laws like the Mann Act and the Travel Act, they don't apply to individuals traveling for the purpose of engaging in prostitution where it's legal."}}
