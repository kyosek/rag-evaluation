[https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR\\-2012\\-title8\\-vol1/pdf/CFR\\-2012\\-title8\\-vol1\\-sec316\\-5\\.pdf](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2012-title8-vol1/pdf/CFR-2012-title8-vol1-sec316-5.pdf):\n\n> Absences from the United States for\n> continuous periods of between **six (6\\)**\n> months and **one (1\\)** year during the periods for which continuous residence is\n> required under \u00a7316\\.2 (a)(3\\) and (a)(6\\)\n> shall disrupt the continuity of such\n> residence for purposes of this part unless the applicant can establish otherwise to the satisfaction of the Service.\n\nTypically people don't write the same info twice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is very common in all sorts of legal documents, not just the United States Code. Another familiar example where this is seen is on [checks](https://www.huntington.com/Personal/checking/checks/how-to-write-a-check).\n\nIt serves as a sort of \"redundancy check\", to help catch errors where either the words or the numerals could have been incorrectly transcribed. Of course, one could ask why similar redundancy isn't used to avoid errors in other contexts; there doesn't seem to be a good answer for this besides \"tradition\".\n\nSome people feel the practice is obsolete and should be abandoned, e.g. [https://www.butlersnow.com/2020/04/five\\-5\\-reasons\\-to\\-stop\\-writing\\-numbers\\-like\\-this/](https://www.butlersnow.com/2020/04/five-5-reasons-to-stop-writing-numbers-like-this/).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains the primary purpose of writing numbers in both digits and words in legal documents, such as U.S. laws and checks?\n\nA) To emphasize the importance of specific numerical values in legal contexts\nB) To serve as a redundancy check and help catch transcription errors\nC) To accommodate readers who prefer either numerical or written representations\nD) To adhere to an international standard for legal document formatting\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The primary purpose of writing numbers in both digits and words in legal documents is to serve as a redundancy check and help catch transcription errors. This practice provides a way to verify the accuracy of the number by comparing its representation in both forms. If there's a discrepancy between the digit and word forms, it becomes easier to identify and correct potential errors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the practice may draw attention to numbers, emphasizing importance is not its main purpose. Option C is incorrect as the practice is not primarily about reader preference, but error prevention. Option D is incorrect because this is not an international standard, but rather a tradition mostly seen in certain types of legal and financial documents.\n\nIt's worth noting that some legal professionals consider this practice outdated and unnecessary in modern times, but it persists largely due to tradition and its perceived benefit in error prevention."

One researcher is nicknamed \"Baymax\" after a character from the film \"Big Hero Six\". The designer wants to include this nickname on a title card in the video. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of using this nickname?\n\nA) Using the nickname \"Baymax\" is definitely fair use and poses no legal risk.\nB) The use of \"Baymax\" is likely copyright infringement and should be avoided entirely.\nC) Using \"Baymax\" as an internal nickname is fine, but displaying it in a promotional video may raise copyright concerns.\nD) As long as the video is only used internally, there are no legal issues with using the \"Baymax\" nickname.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While using \"Baymax\" as an internal nickname within the team is generally fine, displaying it in a promotional video that may be seen by the public could potentially raise copyright concerns. The use might not fall under fair use, as it's for promotional purposes and could be seen as capitalizing on the popularity of the \"Big Hero Six\" character. While it's not definitively illegal, it's a grey area that could pose some risk. Option C best captures this nuanced situation, acknowledging that internal use is likely fine but public display in promotional material may be problematic. Options A and D are too permissive, while B is overly cautious. The safest approach would be to seek legal advice or permission from the copyright holders before using the nickname in public-facing materials."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the 1987 movie, *The Untouchables*, there is a courtroom scene in which Al Capone's lawyer spontaneously announces that his client wants to change his plea to guilty and Capone displays his displeasure with that by attempting to attack his attorney. The change of plea is apparently accepted by the court.\n\nIs this just a movie fiction or did this happen in reality? Can an attorney change his client's plea without the client's consent?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Legally and ethically (in the United States), an attorney is required to have the consent of his client to change a plea. If that happened in open court, the plea would not have been accepted.\n\nThe pertinent part of Rule of Professional Conduct 1\\.2(a) which is essentially identical in ever U.S. state, states:\n\n\"A lawyer shall abide by a client's decision whether to settle a matter. In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client's decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.\"\n\nThere is also constitutional criminal procedure case law to that effect, although as a lawyer who practices exclusively in civil matters, it doesn't come as quickly to mind.\n\nNow, [Al Capone's plea bargain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capone#Imprisonment) took place on June 16, 1931\\. The pertinent ethical rules and constitutional criminal procedure cases may not have been in place at that time, and I certainly don't know the state of the law back then well enough to opine confidently upon it. Wikipedia recounts what happened (numerous citations omitted):\n\n> The IRS special investigation unit chose Frank J. Wilson to\n>  investigate Capone, with the focus on his spending. The key to\n>  Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the\n>  most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay\n>  tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was tried for\n>  tax evasion in 1930\\. Ralph spent the next three years in prison after\n>  being convicted in a two\\-week trial over which Wilkerson presided.\n>  Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. Crucially,\n>  during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer\n>  stated the income that Capone was willing to pay tax on for various\n>  years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance.\n>  Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a\n>  letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable\n>  income for certain years. On March 13, 1931, Capone was charged with\n>  income tax evasion for 1924, in a secret grand jury. On June 5, 1931,\n>  Capone was indicted by a federal grand jury on 22 counts of income tax\n>  evasion from 1925 through 1929; he was released on $50,000 bail. A\n>  week later, Eliot Ness and his team of Untouchables inflicted major\n>  financial damage on Capone's operations and led to his indictment on\n>  5,000 violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition laws).\n> \n> \n> On June 16, 1931, at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of\n>  Judge James Herbert Wilkerson, Capone plead guilty to income tax\n>  evasion and the 5,000 Volstead Act violations as part of a \u200b2 1\u20442\\-year\n>  prison sentence plea bargain. However, on July 30, 1931, Judge\n>  Wilkerson refused to honor the plea bargain, and Capone's counsel\n>  rescinded the guilty pleas. On the second day of the trial, Judge\n>  Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his\n>  client, saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so\n>  at his own risk. Wilkerson deemed that the 1930 letter to federal\n>  authorities could be admitted into evidence from a lawyer acting for\n>  Capone. Wilkerson later tried Capone only on the income tax evasion\n>  charges as he determined they took precedence over the Volstead Act\n>  charges.\n> \n> \n> Much was later made of other evidence, such as witnesses and ledgers,\n>  but these strongly implied Capone's control rather than stating it.\n>  Capone's lawyers, who had relied on the plea bargain Judge Wilkerson\n>  refused to honor and therefore had mere hours to prepare for the\n>  trial, ran a weak defense focused on claiming that essentially all his\n>  income was lost to gambling. This would have been irrelevant\n>  regardless, since gambling losses can only be subtracted from gambling\n>  winnings, but it was further undercut by Capone's expenses, which were\n>  well beyond what his claimed income could support; Judge Wilkerson\n>  allowed Capone's spending to be presented at very great length. The\n>  government charged Capone with evasion of $215,000 in taxes on a total\n>  income of $1,038,654, during the five\\-year period. Capone was\n>  convicted on three counts of income tax evasion on October 17, 1931,\n>  and was sentenced a week later to 11 years in federal prison, fined\n>  $50,000 plus $7,692 for court costs, and was held liable for $215,000\n>  plus interest due on his back taxes.

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the 1931 tax evasion trial of Al Capone, which of the following legal events occurred that would be considered highly unusual or potentially unethical by modern standards?\n\nA) The judge refused to honor a plea bargain agreement after Capone had already entered a guilty plea.\nB) Capone's lawyers were given only hours to prepare for the trial after the plea bargain was rejected.\nC) The judge allowed Capone's own lawyer's statement about his income to be admitted as evidence against him.\nD) All of the above.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of legal procedures and ethics in the context of a historical case. Option A is correct because Judge Wilkerson's refusal to honor the plea bargain after Capone had already pleaded guilty would be highly unusual today. Option B is also correct, as it highlights a severe disadvantage to the defense that would likely be grounds for appeal in modern courts. Option C is correct because allowing an attorney's statement about their client's income as evidence against the client would violate attorney-client privilege by today's standards. \n\nThe correct answer is D because all of these events occurred during Capone's trial and would be considered problematic by modern legal and ethical standards. This question requires the examinee to recognize multiple irregularities in the historical trial process and understand how they differ from current legal practices."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \"Fairness\" isn't mentioned in the constitution but due process is and I would think typically applies to a defendant \\- someone who has been accused of a crime.\n\nBut is there a concept where the prosecution can say the process wasn't fair to them??\n\nCase in point \\- the impeachment of Trump by the House of Reps. Pelosi is saying she won't send articles of impeachment to the Senate until she can be convinced that there will be a fair trial. \n\nBUT \\- in the trial, she and company will be prosecutors. The defendant will be Trump. Is it Trump's constitutional right to demand fairness or the right of those who want to prosecute him?\n\nIn short, you should be awarded fairness when you are defending yourself or when you are prosecuting someone?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Due Process is for defendants:** \n\nThe \"fairness\" provisions in Amendments 4\\-8 do not \"typically\" apply to defendants. They *explicitly* apply *only* to defendants. For instance, the 5th Amendment says: \n\n> No person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...\n\nThe basic idea is that the public is best served by having a fair, impartial trials under law. As Paul Johnson notes in his excellent comment, the general presumption is that the state has much more power than defendants, and hence is more likely to pervert justice for its benefit. The \"fairness\" provisions aim to reduce the power imbalance by requiring the state to follow certain procedures, such as getting warrants, and so on. \n\n**Fairness and prosecutors**\n\nIt is bad when either side perverts justice. That is why even prosecutors have some ability to challenge trial procedures that seem biased in favor of defendants. Thus, prosecutors cannot generally ask for a change of venue, but they can object to particular jurors. The idea, again, is that given its resources, allowing the state to move a trial would hurt defendants. \n\nAs Paul Johnson notes, the analogy of impeachment to regular trials breaks down at this point. The Constitution imposes only a few bare\\-bones requirements on the impeachment process. This lack of structure, when combined with the Constitutional provision that each House can make its own rules, [makes it easier](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46730/in-the-trump-impeachment-process-what-is-the-legal-status-of-notes/46731#46731) for House and Senate to do things that would not be allowed in regular trials, such as delay bringing charges (which would violate the \"[speedy trial](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment)\" clause), or seat admittedly \"[not\\-fair](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lindsey-graham-not-trying-to-pretend-to-be-a-fair-juror-here/2019/12/14/dcaad02c-1ea8-11ea-b4c1-fd0d91b60d9e_story.html)\" jurors. \n\n**What is fair?**\n\nThe obvious response to charges that the process is \"unfair,\" is to ask, \"Unfair by what standard?\" After, all the rules of impeachment are what they are. It is hard to see how using these rules to one's advantage is unfair. \n\nIt is important to remember, that as in regular trials, both sides are busy trying to put their spin on what is going on. If either side believes they will get more support by talking about \"basic fairness,\" that is how they will talk. But this spin should not hide the reality that the impeachment rules are what they are. As with any rules, whether some tricky manuever within the rules is fair depends on whose ox is being gored. After all, most Republicans were thrilled when Mitch McConnell invoked the Constitution to justify delaying a vote on Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court. Democrats were not. Now when delay does not serve Republicans, they are much less impressed with the Constitutional arguments.",

You could argue that indicates I have likely performed said steps myself and produced a derivative work, even if I haven't distributed said work.\n\nWhat if the required file is from an illegally distributed torrent release?\n\nThis is getting technical, but what if I just XOR my edited version with some other large file, say an Ubuntu ISO, and publish the resulting key? Another person could XOR that key with the Ubuntu ISO (which they can download freely) to get *Toy Story: Buzzkill*.\n\nOn the one hand, the key could be described as a long list of instructions to turn one thing into another, no different from the initial concept.\nBut on the other hand, it could be viewed as just a very weird form of encryption, and should be no more legal than just publishing my movie as a password\\-protected (thus encrypted) ZIP file.\n\nWhere do you think the line is drawn?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A description of how to do something is itself an independent creative work, and is protected by copyright. E.g. if you write a program that controls a milling machine, that program is protected no matter what the input object is.\n\nIf you use a device, of any sort, to change a copyright\\-protected object in any manner, you have created a \"derivative work\", therefore subject to the various exceptions to copyright protection, you need permission to create that work. If you buy a physical photograph, the artwork is protected, but because you own the actual copy of the photograph, you can grind it up or otherwise deface it.\n\nIf you scan and OCR a physical book, and then convert it into online html text after running it through Google Translate to get a Finnish version of the text, you are creating a derivative work: you have to have permission. If doesn't matter if you think up this way of creating a work, or if you follow someone else's instructions.\n\nSuppose you roll the bits of the file 2 left: then a casual observer would probably think \"Binary garbage, what's the point of that?\". You might evade detection, but it is still the illegal creation of a derivative work. There is only technically a difference between infringing on copyright, and infringing on copyright without getting caught.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of publishing these instructions?\n\nA) Publishing the instructions is legal because they are an independent creative work.\nB) The instructions themselves are a derivative work and cannot be legally published without permission.\nC) Publishing the instructions is legal as long as they don't include any copyrighted material from the original movie.\nD) The instructions are legal to publish, but following them to create the altered version would be copyright infringement.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The instructions themselves are likely considered an independent creative work and protected by their own copyright. Publishing them would generally be legal, as they don't directly contain copyrighted material from the original movie. However, following these instructions to actually create the altered version of \"Toy Story\" would result in an unauthorized derivative work, which would be copyright infringement. This situation is similar to how a recipe or tutorial can be legally published, even if it describes how to modify a copyrighted work, but actually carrying out those modifications without permission would infringe on the original copyright."

According to the information provided, for a work to be eligible for copyright protection, it must be \"original\" and exhibit a \"modicum of creativity\" (US standard) or be \"the product of an author's exercise of skill and judgment\" (Canadian standard).

The licensing environment is very different for the big company than it is for little tiny you. Many large companies are subject to audits by software vendors (i.e. Adobe, Oracle, etc.) in which they have to show licenses purchased for each active seat. There's a whole new INDUSTRY around maintaining license compliance. An employee bringing in their own software and installing it on a company computer complicates this vastly.\n\nThat is the environment that the question should be considered within. The large company makes the decision somewhere along the way that your individual efficiency in performing your individual tasks is less important than maintaining auditable software licensing compliance. Since they own the computer/laptop/server, it's their decision.\n\nMany times it seems that corporate policies as they apply to the individual worker are obstructive and limiting, but there's a bigger picture to the situation.",

Large organizations face complex software licensing compliance issues, often subject to audits by vendors. Allowing employees to use personal licenses on company computers complicates this process significantly. The company's decision prioritizes maintaining clear and auditable software licensing compliance over individual employee efficiency. This approach helps the company manage its overall licensing responsibilities and avoid potential compliance issues during audits. While it may seem restrictive to the individual employee, it's part of a broader strategy to manage software licensing at an organizational level."

That's not allowed in Germany. Further, a clause that gives custody to the father by default is **also** Sittenwidrig in Germany, and thus void under [\u00a7138 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__138.html). So would be a clause that gives it to the mother by default by the way.\n\nIn a case of controversy, only a court order can assign guardianship. And only the court can take guardianship away. When the kid is born its guardianship gets assigned to the parents as guardians by [\u00a71626 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626.html). While it is possible to give your partner guardianship if you're not married under [1626a BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626a.html) it is **explicitly** impossible to assign guardianship for **any** compensation to either party (e.g. the mother or the new guardian may not receive anything other than the guardianship in the specific paper) under [1626b BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626b.html). Thus a contract that does anything else in addition to guardianship, like a prenup, voids at least the guardianship clauses. And you have to tell the court about that assignment of guardianship under ([$1626d BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626d.html)). Now comes the kicker: [\u00a71628 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1628.html) forces the parents to apply to the court to solve any problems of huge impact, such as guardianship: So technically, mediation results are fully non\\-binding and you can not mandate it.\n\nAlso, since all marriages are through the state, it needs a formal instrument of the state to be dissolved. The only three ways that the state ever allowed this to be done after WW2 were a) annulment through a court, which only was possible till 1998, or b) divorce through a court, c) death of one of the marriage partners. Yes, it takes a judge to divorce a marriage under [$1313 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1313.html) or one of the two married to die.\n\nBecause you can't divorce without a filing in court, a clause that demands to divorce in some way that is *not* including \u00a71313 BGB, that clause would be void. It *might* be legal to have a clause that demands to try to solve issues in arbitration before filing for divorce or sorting the belongings in such a way, but it can't supplant the court requirement.",

Commonly, many are also restricted to emergency situations such as natural disasters, war, or even [covid\\-19](/questions/tagged/covid-19 \"show questions tagged 'covid-19'\").\n\nGenerally, these laws punish people who increase prices in an unreasonable manner but they also don't prescribe what reasonable is.\n\nAn example of Price Gouging is the salesman, who knowing a hurricane will hit Florida, buys up all generators in Detroit that cost below 2000 USD and gets a truck there to sell them the moment it has passed. Now he sells each generator for 20000 USD, while the normal market price outside of the hit area is just a 10th of that. In addition, have him sell 5\\-gallon cans of fuel for 500 USD. Both items \\- equipment to make electricity to fix the homes and fuel \\- are under [Fla. Stat. \u00a7501\\.160](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0500-0599/0501/Sections/0501.160.html) 1(a) and the prices are clearly matching 1(b). So our Detroid salesman in Florida is violating the law on Price Gouging.\n\n### Non\\-emergency laws?\n\nOnly very few laws are not concerned with an emergency situation and thus more broad and general. The most likely broadest of them is [Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7445\\.903](https://law.justia.com/codes/michigan/2006/mcl-chap445/mcl-445-903.html) (z). It reads:\n\n> Charging the consumer a price that is grossly in excess of the price at which similar property or services are sold.\n\nHere, grossly in excess is the requirement, but also the similarity of the products. So, it does not take dissimilar products into account, especially not if the two items cost you very dissimilar to acquire them.\n\nTo take a less emergency example, let's say we have a shop. We sell two types of toilet paper: one is 1\\-ply and costs 10 cents a roll. The other is imported german, extra soft 4\\-ply with Aloe\\-Vera and vanilla smell and we demand 5 USD per roll. The price difference is harsh (50 times!) but the two products are not similar, and we can prove that the import paper did cost us something like 4 USD to get to our shop in the first place. Now, one day we just put the 5 USD label from our import paper onto the cheap one for whatever reason. Only now we grossly overprice our cheap toilet paper and violate that provision: we charge 50 times what the item's fair price is.\n\n#### [When goods don't *appear* dissimilar but are](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84656/alices-restaurant-profiteering-from-those-with-allergies)\n\nA baker might make a pie for 50 USD in basic fixed costs (tools, wages, electricity) to run the shop, and 25 cents per pie in ingredients if he bakes 100 of them. That's 75 USD for 100 pies in costs, or 75 cents a pie. He wants to sell them at 1 USD a piece, that's a 1/3rd markup and a somewhat normal price.\n\nThe same baker can also bake gluten\\-free pies. The ingredients cost him 50 cents a pie and the same basic fixed costs to make a batch. But he also has to clean the shop top to bottom for 3 hours before to get any gluten flour out of it, costing him another 100 USD in wages. He also only has a demand for 10 pies, so those pies cost him 160 USD per batch or 16 USD per pie. To make a profit, he sells them at 21,33 USD, which is again a 1/3rd markup. At first glance, a gluten\\-free pie might appear a *very* similar product, but it isn't even similar under the Michigan law, because manufacturing costs are disproportional higher for the market. Even *if* he could sell 100 pies and then made a 100 pie batch, he'd still pay 200 USD for 100 pies, and the *fair price* for a single pie from a 100\\-item batch would be 2,66 USD. But from the 10\\-item batch, it's 21,33 USD.\n\nBecause the two pies are so dissimilar in manufacturing prices, they can not be used as \"similar\" under Michigan law. You'd need to compare the price of another gluten\\-free pie that is baked in similarly small batches in a bakeshop that makes both normal and gluten\\-free products in the same workshop.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A local bakery produces two types of pies: regular and gluten-free. The regular pies cost $0.75 to make and are sold for $1.00 each. The gluten-free pies cost $16.00 to make due to special ingredients and cleaning procedures, and are sold for $21.33 each. A customer files a complaint alleging price gouging on the gluten-free pies. Under Michigan's consumer protection law (Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7445.903), which of the following is the most accurate assessment of the situation?\n\nA) The bakery is guilty of price gouging because the gluten-free pies are priced more than 20 times higher than the regular pies.\n\nB) The bakery is not guilty of price gouging because the law only applies to emergency situations like natural disasters.\n\nC) The bakery is guilty of price gouging because they are charging a price that is grossly in excess of the price of similar property.\n\nD) The bakery is not guilty of price gouging because the two types of pies are not considered \"similar property\" due to their significantly different production costs.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Michigan's consumer protection law prohibits \"charging the consumer a price that is grossly in excess of the price at which similar property or services are sold.\" However, in this case, the regular and gluten-free pies are not considered \"similar property\" under the law due to their vastly different production costs. The gluten-free pies require special ingredients and extensive cleaning procedures, resulting in a much higher production cost. The markup percentage for both types of pies is the same (approximately 33%), indicating that the price difference is due to actual cost differences rather than price gouging. Therefore, the bakery is not guilty of price gouging under this law."

Under the new requirements, you will need to provide more information: as they say,\n\n> Identity and proof of relationship documentation will be required.\n> Exact documentation is still to be determined\n\nThe new rules will not be more onerous than [the old rules for confidential information](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=246-491-039), which includes a current government ID\nwith the child's name, DOB, photograph, signature, and physical description, documentation of any name changes, and a notarized signature of the requestor along with proof of identity.\n\nThere are 49 other states, plus places which are not states, so it depends on the laws of the birth jurisdiction.",

Discuss using the examples above?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ticker symbols are too short to be protected by copyright (and the copyright would in any case belong to the exchange and not the company, since the exchange creates them). It is also not functional, so it could not have a utility patent, and is not secret, so it could not be a trade secret.\n\nSo far as I know, none of the ticket symbols are registered as trademarks under the Lanham Act (the federal trademark law in the United State). But, a company could argue that it acquired a common law trademark in its ticker symbol if it used the ticker symbol in association with the sale of goods or services.\n\nEven if it was a trademark, however, this would not prevent it from being used in the usual way that ticker symbols are used, as a nominative use identifying a company with an abbreviation of its legal name or of a trade name, rather than in a manner that conveys the impression that one is authorized to sell goods and services under the name of the company.\n\nIn the example posed, I don't think that you could determine whether there was an infringement of common law trademark rights in a vacuum.\n\nFirst, it would be necessary to determine if a particular ticker symbol had acquired a secondary meaning (i.e. an association with the company) in the relevant part of the general public. For example, \"A\" without some context identifying it as the ticker symbol for Agilent Technology, would obviously not be entitled to common law trademark protection.\n\nSecond, it would be necessary to examine the manner in which the ticker symbol was used.\n\nThe gravamen and gist of trademark infringement is that one misleads someone to think that you have an affiliation with a company in connection with a use of that trademark in commerce. If one is doing that, I could see a common law trademark infringement case prevailing.\n\nFor example, if one had an email that said \"I.Love.ABC@xyz.com\" and was selling goods competing with those produced by \"Americansource Bergen Corp\" to people who would otherwise have brought Americansource Bergen Corp's goods, I could easily see a common law trademark infringement action prevailing with the domain name suggesting that you were a licensed affiliate of Americansource Bergen Corp who was marketing its goods, rather than the company itself.\n\nOn the other hand, if one had an email that said \"I.Love.ABC@xyz.com\" and you were a neighbor or former employee of Americansource Bergen Corp or a family member of an employee or a customer, then there would be no basis for a common law trademark infringement action.\n\nAnd, there are some cases, such as the \"whathappened.EFX@xyz.com\" email for Equifax which on its face could almost never be construed as an attempt to mislead someone into thinking that you were authorized to sell goods or serves of Equifax.\n\nGenerally speaking, there is no such thing as a \"facial\" trademark infringement except perhaps when a trademark is placed directly on a good not manufactured or licensed by the trademark owner. So, there is no blanket answer to your question.",

There is no legal or even practical reason not to (at least) anonymize the data in question. No payments or contracts are involved.\n\nUntil today I have written about 7 mails to 4 different receivers including but not limited to the address listed in the above privacy statement, starting from August 2019\\. Without any reply at all.\n\nI tried opening tasks in their bugtracker and request information about the legal holder of the domain or a contact who may be able to fulfill my request. All my requests have been blocked and deleted immediately \\- even one of my domains has been blocked completely.\n\nWordpress is putting preasure on avoiding me as hard as possible even tho I have written most polite messages and acknowledging integrity of their systems.\n\nWhat could I possibly do now to get my data erased or anonymized?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If a data controller fails to fulfil your data subject rights, lodge a complaint with your data protection authority. In Hamburg, the appropriate form is [here](https://datenschutz-hamburg.de/beschwerde/). However, they are not required to investigate your complaint.\n\nIndependently from a complaint, you could consider suing Wordpress for compliance \u2013 Automattic has a subsidiary in Ireland so this might actually be feasible. I'm not quite sure though that Automattic is indeed the data controller for wordpress*.org*, as opposed to the .com domain \u2013 the privacy policy isn't quite GDPR compliant.\n\nWhile your GDPR Art 17 Right to Erasure might not apply in this case, there's a definite GDPR violation because the data controller failed to respond to your request within a month as per Art 12(4\\). That your posts on the bugtracker were deleted doesn't look like an issue in this context, what does matter is that they didn't respond to emails to the addresses mentioned in their privacy policy.\n\nWhether you have a right to erasure depends on the legal basis for storing your data. In general, you have a right to erasure if:\n\n* the data is no longer necessary;\n* processing is based on consent (because you can always withdraw consent); or\n* processing is based on a legitimate interest *and* they have no overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing despite your objection (Art 21\\).\n\nThe data is still necessary to identify you for your actions on the bugtracker, but depending on your particular situation you may be able to object successfully and force them to anonymize your posts.",

The website claims GDPR compliance, but has not responded to multiple requests. What is the most appropriate next step for the user to take according to the information provided?\n\nA) File a lawsuit against Automattic in Ireland\nB) Continue sending emails to different WordPress contacts\nC) Lodge a complaint with their local data protection authority\nD) Create new posts on the WordPress bugtracker\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C - lodge a complaint with their local data protection authority. The information provided states that if a data controller fails to fulfill data subject rights, the next step is to file a complaint with the relevant data protection authority. For example, in Hamburg, there is a specific form for this purpose.\n\nOption A is not the most appropriate next step, as legal action should typically be a last resort after other avenues have been exhausted. \n\nOption B is not advisable, as the user has already sent multiple emails without response, indicating this method is ineffective.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the information states that the user's posts on the bugtracker were being deleted, so this approach is unlikely to succeed.\n\nWhile filing a complaint doesn't guarantee an investigation, it is the most appropriate next step in escalating the issue through official channels before considering legal action."

I wonder whether the fact that the booster shot is not authorized by the CDC has any legal ramifications in the US.\n\nIs it legal to get a 3rd booster shot unauthorized by the CDC in the US?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The CDC does not authorize shots or vaccine distribution. The FDA authorizes vaccine distribution, or distribution of medicines in general. A medicine is authorized for use in a certain way, which is an \"instruction\" directed at the medical professional. So\\-called \"off\\-label\" use is discussed by the FDA [here](https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-expanded-access-and-other-treatment-options/understanding-unapproved-use-approved-drugs-label). Such use if legal, it simply stretches the limits of what the FDA was allowed to approve (e.g. was found to be safe and effective for X, was not similarly tested for Y). Patients are free to take whatever medicines they want if they can find them, and if they are not on the Controlled Substances list. Hence it's legal to take DMSO, but it's not legal to peddle it as a cancer cure.\n\nThe prescription regime for covid vaccinations seems to be somewhat relaxed, in that it is likely that many people get a vaccine without a (meaningful) doctor's exam, instead, you show up and get the shot. This is normal with flu shots. The upcoming 3rd shot approval is addressed to doctors, so they can then recommend third shots.",

The FDA, not the CDC, is responsible for authorizing vaccine distribution. Off-label use of approved drugs is legal and discussed by the FDA. Patients are free to take medicines they can obtain if they are not on the Controlled Substances list. Medical professionals can legally administer off-label treatments, and individuals can legally receive them. While the CDC may not recommend unauthorized boosters, this does not make them illegal. The relaxed prescription regime for COVID-19 vaccinations allows for easier access, similar to flu shots."

This approach is often more effective in negotiations than claiming to have thoroughly researched the law, as opposing counsel is likely to be skeptical of such claims. The personal connection implies a commitment to the case that goes beyond legal arguments and may encourage the other party to settle more quickly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the managing partner's advice doesn't focus on demonstrating research capabilities.

I say this because your incredulity does not seem to extend to the notion that appellate courts can bind lower courts.\n\nYou ask:\n\n> why are prior judges\u2019 powers of interpretations automatically seen to be more capable and robust than, so as to bind and prevail over, subsequent judges\u2019 interpretative abilities?\n\nThis is not the rationale for horizontal *stare decisis*. The doctrine is not at all based on the premise that the first court or judge to answer got it correct. Justification was given in a concurring opinion in *R. v. Kirkpatrick*, [2022 SCC 33](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2022/2022scc33/2022scc33.html):\n\n> Stare decisis promotes: (1\\) legal certainty and stability, allowing people to plan and manage their affairs; (2\\) the rule of law, such that people are subject to similar rules; and (3\\) the legitimate and efficient exercise of judicial authority (citations omitted).\n\nAnd horizontal *stare decisis* is not absolute. Common\\-law jurisdictions have developed limited avenues for departure. For example, in Canada, a lower court can depart from previous decisions of courts of coordinate jurisdiction when (*R. v. Sullivan*, [2022 SCC 19](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/19390/index.do)):\n\n> 1. The rationale of an earlier decision has been undermined by subsequent appellate decisions;\n> 2. The earlier decision was reached per incuriam (\u201cthrough carelessness\u201d or \u201cby inadvertence\u201d); or\n> 3. The earlier decision was not fully considered, e.g. taken in exigent circumstances.\n\nEven apex courts have developed a sense of internal obligation to follow their own precedents. But departure from previous decisions may be justified where (see the *Kirkpatrick* concurrence [at para. 202](https://canlii.ca/t/jr3vx#par202)):\n\n> 1. The Court rendering the decision failed to have regard to a binding authority or relevant statute (\u201c*per incuriam*\u201d);\n> 2. The decision has proven unworkable (\u201cunworkability\u201d); or\n> 3. The decision\u2019s rationale has been eroded by significant societal or legal change (\u201cfoundational erosion\u201d).\n\nThis has been viewed to \"strike the appropriate balance between the competing demands of certainty, correctness and the even\\-handed development of the law\" (*R. v. Sullivan*, [2022 SCC 19](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/19390/index.do)). \"Adherence to precedent furthers basic rule of law values such as consistency, certainty, fairness, predictability, and sound judicial administration.\"",

Meaning the entire collection, was of their own idea, and creation.\n\nOutfits were purchased by these four people, and needed some modification, (modifications being some illustrations applied). so under recommendation from a friend an individual (The Designer), offered this service without any discussion or need for payment.\n\nThe Designer was provided with all materials needed to do this, as to not incur any cost to themselves, also given a brief and reference images to use to ensure the end result was as excepted and fitted with the overall collection.\n\nThese outfits (and now modifications), became part of the final 'collection', which is owned by that of the 4 who orchestrated it.\n\n**My question is:**\n\nWhere the work is of the designers hand, but was only created by them after being provided all materials, and a brief with reference images, not of their own ideas. Do they own any rights/copyright to the clothing items?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright\n---------\n\nCopyright subsists in original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, sound recordings, films or broadcasts, and the typographical arrangement of published editions \\[*Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988*, [s1]](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/1). Specifically, fashion is a \"work of artistic craftsmanship\" \\[[s4](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/4)].\n\nThe author (\"the person who creates \\[the work]\" \\[[s9](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/9)]) is the first owner of the copyright \\[[s11](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/11)] unless it is made by an employee in the course of their employment which is not the case here.\n\nThe 'designer' is *definitely* an author although it is arguable that the work is actually one of joint authorship [s10](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/10) between the 'designer' and the 'four people'. An alternative is that the 'four people' hold copyright in the \"reference images\" and that the 'designer' holds copyright in the fashion items; I think this is more likely.\n\nHowever, if the information provided to the 'designer' amounted to a design such that the fashion items are merely a 3D realisation of the design with no creative input by the designer then the fashion items are a copy of the design with no independent copyright. From the description, this seems unlikely \\- a design would require a fully detailed pattern such that multiple craftspeople using it would produce essentially the same output.\n\nAs there has been no transfer of copyright, whoever had it originally still has it \\- probably the designer.\n\nThe physical items\n------------------\n\nThese belong to whoever owned them originally \\- a mechanic does not take ownership of your car if they work on it so similarly a dressmaker doesn't take ownership of your clothes.",

This is because:\n\n1. Copyright subsists in original artistic works, which includes fashion as a \"work of artistic craftsmanship.\"\n2. The author (creator) of a work is typically the first owner of the copyright, unless it's made by an employee in the course of employment (which isn't the case here).\n3. While the organizers provided materials and a brief, the actual creative work of modifying the clothing was done by the designer.\n4. The designer's work appears to involve creative input beyond merely realizing a fully detailed design, which would give them copyright over their modifications.\n5. There's no mention of any transfer of copyright, so the designer would retain it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because providing materials and ideas doesn't automatically grant copyright. Option C could be considered if it was truly a joint work, but the scenario suggests the designer did the modifications independently. Option D is incorrect because original artistic modifications are generally copyrightable.\n\nIt's important to note that while the designer likely holds copyright to the modifications, the physical items themselves would still belong to the organizers who purchased them."

The idea is that if an individual bought something\n>  from you recently, gave you their details, and did not opt out of\n>  marketing messages, they are probably happy to receive marketing from\n>  you about similar products or services even if they haven\u2019t\n>  specifically consented. However, you must have given them a clear\n>  chance to opt out \u2013 both when you first collected their details, and\n>  in every message you send.\n\nFor 'hard opt\\-in' GPDR specifies strict requirements for opt\\-in, e.g. no pre\\-ticked checkboxes.\n\nFor soft opt\\-in on the other hand, the requirements seem looser and I cannot find any exact specification for what is needed. \"Did not opt out\" (and indeed the very concept of soft opt\\-in) implies that an explicit opt\\-in was not needed. In the case of my own customers each email sent contains an unsubscribe link, and while the original signup did not contain an opt out it clearly stated that opting out was possible by clicking unsubscribe on any email sent.\n\nRather than sending an email at the present time (pre GDPR start date) that requires explicit opt\\-in, is it acceptable instead to send an email reiterating that opt\\-out is possible at this stage?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It appears you are indeed just over the edge. The troublesome bit is \"you must have given them a clear chance to opt out ... when you first collected their details\" versus \"the original signup did not contain an opt out \". If you correctly describe that first collection of their details, you failed to include an opt\\-out in just that one message, and it's technically therefore invalid.\n\nAnd you're similarly just over the edge with the idea of that new email; since you are formally lacking consent you should now obtain opt\\-in consent. Offering a chance to opt out is insufficient.",

The US sees no value in spending government money to detain someone who is ready to leave of their own accord.\n\nI'm not sure why such a person should have \"no valid documentation\". Maybe you're confused by the common term \"undocumented\" for people without legal immigration status, but it usually doesn't literally mean they have no documentation at all. Most such people would still have their passport and other identification from their home country, and the passport is enough to board a flight back home.\n\nYou say your hypothetical Israeli overstayer had a visa; so they must have had an Israeli passport when they entered the US. Under normal circumstances, they've still got it. If it expired, they could have renewed it at [an Israeli consulate within the US](https://embassies.gov.il/washington/AboutTheEmbassy/Pages/US-Missions.aspx); the consulate will issue passports to all Israeli citizens without regard to their immigration status in the US. Even if somehow they lost their Israeli passport and all other identity documents, the consulate would have the ability to verify their identity from Israeli government records (e.g. the photo and biometrics from their previous passport, which would still be in the Israeli government's database), and process their application for a replacement passport.",

According to the information provided, the US does not conduct exit immigration checks, so an overstayer with a valid passport can typically board a flight and leave the country without being detained or punished. Even if their original passport expired, they could obtain a new one from an Israeli consulate in the US, regardless of their immigration status. The term \"undocumented\" doesn't usually mean they have no documentation at all, and most people in this situation would still possess their home country's passport or other identification. Options A and D are incorrect as the US generally allows overstayers to leave voluntarily without detention or special exit visas. Option B is also incorrect, as a valid US visa is not required for departure, only a valid passport from their home country."

[Rule of Professional Conduct 2\\.1](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_2_1_advisor/) (which has been adopted verbatim in almost every U.S. state) says:\n\n> In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent\n> professional judgment and render candid advice. In rendering advice, a\n> lawyer may refer not only to law but to other considerations such as\n> moral, economic, social and political factors, that may be relevant to\n> the client's situation.\n\nThen there is a very complicated part of this issue:\n\n> such that the lawyer had inadvertently waived privilege?\n\nGenerally, a lawyer's unilateral inadvertent action does not waive the privilege. The typical fact pattern is inadvertent inclusion of an opposing party in a \"reply all\" email meant to be only a \"reply\" to or \"forward\" to a client, or inadvertent inclusion of privileged material in a discovery response (e.g. due to failing to wipe metadata).\n\nWhen another lawyer receives inadvertently disclosed privilege material there is a protocol to be followed.\n\nThe consequences in this case are less clear. The tweet probably wouldn't be admissible as evidence in court, unless the client ratified the disclosure. But once it is out there it isn't illegal for the inadvertent recipient, if the recipient is a non\\-lawyer, to share it further as was done in this case. This could even lead to a malpractice case against the errantly tweeting lawyer.",

The advice includes suggestions on how to characterize the article if asked to comment. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the attorney-client privilege in this situation?\n\nA) The attorney-client privilege does not apply because the advice was about public relations, not legal matters.\n\nB) The attorney-client privilege applies, but it was automatically waived when the attorney accidentally sent the text to the journalist.\n\nC) The attorney-client privilege applies to this communication, and the accidental disclosure by the attorney alone does not necessarily waive the privilege.\n\nD) The attorney-client privilege only applies if the client explicitly requested PR advice from the attorney.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nC is correct because attorney-client privilege covers all confidential communications between an attorney and client in the course of their professional relationship, including advice on non-legal matters such as public relations. The accidental disclosure by the attorney alone typically does not waive the privilege, as waiver generally requires client consent or ratification.\n\nA is incorrect because attorney-client privilege is not limited to strictly legal advice. Attorneys are permitted to offer advice on various factors relevant to the client's situation, including PR strategies.\n\nB is incorrect because inadvertent disclosure by an attorney does not automatically waive privilege. There are protocols for handling such situations, and courts generally do not consider it a waiver unless the client ratifies the disclosure.\n\nD is incorrect because the privilege applies to the attorney's advice within the professional relationship, regardless of whether the client explicitly requested that specific type of advice."

Benson**, 920 F.2d 1173, 1176 (4th Cir. 1990\\) *(\"We will not accept on appeal theories that were not raised in the district court except under unusual circumstances.\")*.\n\nOf course it justifies why the rule is applied for this case, but what is the original reason this rule was applied?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is largely congruent with\\* the doctrine of [*laches*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laches_%28equity%29). The basic idea, under common law, is that you can lose rights by failing to assert them. This is generally important for many reasons, but specifically in the case of appeals:\n\n* The argument should have been brought before the trial court. Justice is not a game, but it's important to recognize that the party trying to raise the argument had an opportunity to do so already. They have given up their right to raise this argument, and extending them the *privilege* of doing so is (for the following reasons) not good for the system.\n* Courts of appeals are typically not well\\-equipped to evaluate factual evidence. It is not their area of expertise. Witnesses or evidence may be less available. It's just not practical to try to adjudicate factual issues on appeal, most of the time.\n* If anyone could get an appeal by bringing new factual arguments, then *everyone* would do that. You'd bring your strongest argument before the district court, and then if that fails, bring the second strongest before the circuit court. That way, you get an extra trial. This is inefficient.\n* Allowing factual arguments on appeal would encourage attorneys and their clients to strategically bring different facts before different courts. This kind of forum\\-shopping is harmful because it has little to do with who has the stronger overall case, and more to do with who has the better lawyer.\n\n\\* \"Congruent with\" is not the same as \"an instance of\"; this rule is *not* formally an application of *laches*. It just happens to share the same justification.",

Encouraging comprehensive initial hearings is a beneficial side effect, but not the main purpose of the rule.\n\nB) This touches on one aspect (appellate courts not being well-equipped to evaluate new factual evidence), but it's overly narrow and doesn't capture the broader rationale behind the rule.\n\nC) This is the correct answer. The rule helps maintain the distinct roles of trial and appellate courts. Trial courts are designed to hear evidence and determine facts, while appellate courts are meant to review legal issues and the application of law to established facts. Allowing new factual arguments on appeal would blur this distinction and disrupt the efficient functioning of the judicial system.\n\nD) While res judicata is an important legal principle, it typically applies to preventing the same case from being litigated again in a different court. The rule against new arguments on appeal is more about procedural efficiency and maintaining the proper roles of different court levels within the same case.\n\nThe correct answer encompasses multiple aspects discussed in the original text, including the inefficiency of raising new arguments on appeal, the appellate courts' lack of expertise in evaluating factual evidence, and the prevention of strategic forum-shopping by attorneys."

How common is it for parties in criminal trials to give notices like that and point judges to reliable sources of the facts referred to in the notices?\n\nIntuitively I would expect that *expert witnesses* are required to testify about \"facts capable of accurate and ready determination\"\n\u2014 so that they could be cross\\-examined. If notices like provided for in the cited law above are indeed allowed in criminal trial that may seem to be sort of circumvention to avoid cross\\-examination. Is it not?\n\nFor example, there is a case involving a Labrador retriever attacking domestic ducks. It is a well\\-known fact (at least among owners of this particular dog breed) that chasing and catching ducks is in their blood/nature: they normally will do it as soon as they *see* ducks \u2014 as opposed to having to be encouraged/commanded. Assuming a reliable published source of this fact exists, can it be given in notice pursuant to the cited section? Or can this knowledge only be put before the court by way of expert witness e.g. a Labrador retriever breeder?\n\n(Any common law jurisdiction)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is known as [Judicial notice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_notice) and is used in many jurisdictions. It is normally supposed to be used only for facts about which there could be no possible controversy. The Wikipedia article linked above mentions such examples as \"which day of the week corresponded to a particular calendar date or the approximate time at sunset.\" It can also be used to include the text of a law from another jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to the *Free Legal Encyclopedia* (FLE) [article](https://law.jrank.org/pages/7886/Judicial-Notice.html):\n\n> When a court takes judicial notice of a certain fact, it obviates the need for parties to prove the fact in court. Ordinarily, facts that relate to a case must be presented to the judge or jury through testimony or tangible evidence. However, if each fact in a case had to be proved through such presentation, the simplest case would take weeks to complete. To avoid burdening the judicial system, all legislatures have approved court rules that allow a court to recognize facts that constitute common knowledge without requiring proof from the parties.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The most common judicially noticed facts include the location of streets, buildings, and geographic areas; periods of time; business customs; historical events; and federal, state, and INTERNATIONAL LAW. Legislatures also maintain statutes that give courts the power to recognize certain facts in specific situations. For example, in Idaho any document affixed with the official seal of the state PUBLIC UTILITIES commission must be judicially noticed by all courts (Idaho Code \u00a7 61\\-209 \\[1996]). In Hawaii, when a commercial vehicle is cited for violating vehicle equipment regulations, a trial court must take judicial notice of the driver's subordinate position if the driver works for a company that owns the vehicle (Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 291\\-37 \\[1995]).\n\nIn the United States, [Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE)](https://www.rulesofevidence.org/article-ii/rule-201/) covers this. It reads:\n\n> (a) Scope. This rule governs judicial notice of an adjudicative fact only, not a legislative fact.\n> \n> \n> (b) Kinds of Facts That May Be Judicially Noticed. The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it:\n> \n> \n> (b) (1\\) is generally known within the trial court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction; or\n> \n> \n> (b) (2\\) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\n> \n> \n> (c) Taking Notice. The court:\n> \n> \n> (c) (1\\) may take judicial notice on its own; or\n> \n> \n> (c) (2\\) must take judicial notice if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the necessary information.\n> \n> \n> (d) Timing. The court may take judicial notice at any stage of the proceeding.\n> \n> \n> (e) Opportunity to Be Heard. On timely request, a party is entitled to be heard on the propriety of taking judicial notice and the nature of the fact to be noticed. If the court takes judicial notice before notifying a party, the party, on request, is still entitled to be heard.\n> \n> \n> (f) Instructing the Jury. In a civil case, the court must instruct the jury to accept the noticed fact as conclusive. In a criminal case, the court must instruct the jury that it may or may not accept the noticed fact as conclusive.\n\nNote that subsection (e) preserves the rights of parties to be heard on whether taking notice is proper in a given case. None also that subsection (f) makes it clear that this procedure may be used in both civil and criminal cases.\n\nThe Wikipedia article (linked above) says that most US states closely follow FRE 201 in their rules of evidence. (So does the FLE article.) Note also that the NZ law quoted in the question is very similar even in wording to FRE 201\\. The article mentions similar practices in Canada and Australia.\n\nThe Wikipedia article also says:\n\n> Legal disputes about foreign affairs are generally settled by judicial notice by obtaining the information directly from the office of the Secretary of State (in the United States). For example, if a litigant in an extradition hearing attempted to argue that Israel was not a sovereign state, a statement from the Secretary of State that the U.S. recognized Israel as a sovereign state would settle the issue and no evidence could be led to the contrary. (In the United Kingdom, similar result could be had to information from the Foreign Secretary.)\n\nNote that under US FRE 201 no fact that enters the case under judicial notice is binding on a jury in a criminal case, and a defendant (or the defendant's lawyer) may be heard to offer contrary evidence. Thus the practice does not offer a way to evade cross\\-examination of a proper expert wittiness if used properly. Similar rules probably exist in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe FLE article linked above goes on to state:\n\n> The danger of judicial notice is that, if abused, it can deprive the fact finder of the opportunity to decide a contestable fact in a case. In *Walker v. Halliburton Services*, 654 So. 2d 365 (La. App. 1995\\), Johnny Walker fell from a tank truck approximately ten feet to a concrete floor. Walker sought WORKERS' COMPENSATION benefits for his injuries, and his claim was denied by the Office of Workers' Compensation.\n> \n> \n> At the application hearing, the hearing officer stated that it was her experience that a soft\\-tissue injury heals in six weeks. She then took judicial notice of the fact that a soft\\-tissue injury heals in six weeks\u2014preventing Walker from contesting that proposition\u2014and disallowed Walker's claim. On appeal the Louisiana Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, reversed the decision and ordered the payment of workers' compensation benefits. According to the court, it was a clear error of law for the hearing officer to take judicial notice of such intricate medical knowledge.\n\nConsidering the example in the question of a Labrador retriever attacking domestic ducks. I would think this would not be a proper subject for judicial notice, because it would be \"subject to reasonable dispute\". An expert might testify that this happens in many but not all dogs of the breed, or under certain conditions but not others. So it might be comparable to the soft tissue injury case where notice was improper. However, if all parties agreed that such notice might be taken, then perhaps there would be no issue, as no party had been deprived of a right to contest the alleged fact. In such a case this might be considered a *stipulation* rather than an example of judicial notice.",

While the average lifespan of a domesticated cat might seem like a fact that could be judicially noticed, it's important to follow proper procedures. The prosecution should request judicial notice and provide a reliable source. However, as per the rules (such as FRE 201(e)), the defense should have an opportunity to be heard on the propriety of taking judicial notice. This preserves the rights of all parties and allows for potential dispute if necessary. Additionally, in a criminal case, even if judicial notice is taken, the jury would typically be instructed that they may or may not accept the noticed fact as conclusive, unlike in civil cases where it would be treated as conclusive.\n\nOption A is incorrect because judicial notice shouldn't be taken automatically without input from the parties. Option B is unnecessarily complex for a widely known fact, though it could be appropriate if the fact were more specialized or controversial. Option D is incorrect because in criminal cases, juries are typically instructed that they may or may not accept judicially noticed facts as conclusive, and the defense should have an opportunity to object."

He then intends to increase the rent further in 4 months when the tenancy agreement is renewed.\n\nI expressed my reservations about this and indicated that either a new tenancy agreement should be issued to replace the current one \\- subject to our agreement (which would mean the tenancy agreement renewal period would reset?) or postpone all rent rises until the contract is renewed in 4 months.\n\nWhat can we do in this situation? Is the landlord simply allowed to to modify the contract for an incoming tenant?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is the landlord simply allowed to to modify the contract for an incoming tenant?\n\nNo. When you have a joint tenancy, an end of tenancy comes in effect for all tenants. It's a single tenancy, so it can't just end for one person and leave the rest unaffected. \n\nThe end of tenancy procedure takes a slightly different route:\nFor a fixed term tenancy ALL tenants and the landlord need to agree, if anyone wishes to move out, or if the landlord wants to change some of the terms of the agreement. \nFor a periodic tenancy either tenant can serve a months notice and end the tenancy. \n\nThe landlord is then free to draft a new, modified tenancy agreement with the rest of you and the new tenant that comes in. The landlord is free to introduce changes to the new tenancy agreement, like increased rent, and you have two options \\- sign it or move out.\n\nSigning a new tenancy means the review period will reset, however, the landlord can simply introduce an intermediary rent increase now, and then add the rest of the planned amount after 6 or 12 months, when the tenancy review date is.\n\nAnother option for all of you is to negotiate for the landlord to draft individual tenancy agreements for each of you (having their own room, I assume), which will make it unnecessary to re\\-draft the tenancy agreement each time a tenant wishes to move out. It's more hassle for them, but better for you individually. This will also make you not liable to pay for damages that other tenants have caused. \n\nHere is more information on [tenancy agreements](http://www.thetenantsvoice.co.uk/advice_from_us/tenancy-agreements-assured-shorthold-tenancy-ast/).",

Which of the following statements is correct regarding this situation?\n\nA) The landlord can unilaterally modify the contract for the incoming tenant without the consent of other tenants.\n\nB) The landlord must wait until the renewal date to make any changes to the rent or terms of the agreement.\n\nC) A new tenancy agreement must be drafted and agreed upon by all remaining tenants, the new tenant, and the landlord.\n\nD) The landlord can modify the agreement for the new tenant as long as the majority of existing tenants agree.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In a joint tenancy agreement, any changes to the contract, including the addition or removal of a tenant or modifications to rent, require the consent of all parties involved. The correct procedure is to end the current tenancy for all tenants and create a new agreement that includes the desired changes. This new agreement must be agreed upon by all remaining tenants, the new tenant, and the landlord. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest the landlord can make changes without full consensus. Option B is incorrect because while waiting for renewal is one possible approach, it's not the only legal way to make changes to the agreement."

Your children would inherit any separately held assets that don't have a beneficiary associated with them.\n\nYou should make sure your spouse (or kids) are the beneficiaries on any retirement accounts, bank accounts, life insurance, etc. Those won't go into probate and will be inherited directly. If your minor children are the beneficiaries, then the court will have to appoint someone to manage the money for them. That will likely be their mother/other parent, but the court would have to appoint that person.\n\nFor jointly held assets, that don't have a beneficiary, your common law spouse would inherit half the asset, your children would inherit the other half. \n\nProperty depends on the deed whether it's held as joint tenants or tenants in common.",

Therefore, Mary would not be considered John's legal spouse for inheritance purposes. The children, once confirmed by the probate court to be John's, would inherit his separately held assets that don't have a designated beneficiary, such as the house and car. The retirement account typically has a designated beneficiary and would pass directly to that person outside of probate. If John had named Mary or the children as beneficiaries of the retirement account, they would receive it directly. This scenario highlights the importance of having a will and properly designating beneficiaries, especially in situations where couples are not legally married but have children together."

This situation potentially falls under nominative fair use, but there are important considerations. The Playboy v. Welles case established a three-part test for nominative fair use:\n\n1. The trademark is necessary to identify the product or service.\n2. Only as much of the mark is used as is reasonably necessary for identification.\n3.

In Germany the \"Zentrale zur Bek\u00e4mpfung unlauteren Wettbewerbs\" in Bad Homburg is recommendable. As the company is operating from Switzerland, German law not be applicable without more. Therefore also contacting the Swiss authorities may be advisable. This seems to be the \"Staatssekretariat f\u00fcr Wirtschaft SECO\" in Bern.",

The company appears to be operating a multi-level marketing scheme that may be illegal under both German and Swiss law. Since the company operates from Switzerland but may have effects in Germany, reporting to authorities in both countries is advisable. The German \"Zentrale zur Bek\u00e4mpfung unlauteren Wettbewerbs\" and the Swiss \"Staatssekretariat f\u00fcr Wirtschaft SECO\" are specifically mentioned as competent watchdogs for such issues.\n\nOption A is not advisable as a private individual lacks the authority to demand a company cease operations. Option C is premature without an official investigation and may not be successful in a German court for a Swiss-based company. Option D is inappropriate as local police may not have jurisdiction over complex international business practices, and arrest is not warranted without a formal investigation and charges."

When the patient received an EOB from the insurance $1600\\.00 had been charged to the insurance for the same crown. When questioning the amount, the office manager stated that he can charge any amount he wants to the insurance company. The doctor stated that the billing is out of her hands. The insurance company states that the patient should not have gone out of network and it is out of their hands. IS THIS LEGAL? OR THIS INSURANCE FRAUD?\nNot only was the bill to insurance excessive but it also used up $700\\.00 more of the patients yearly maximum than originally quoted which means she will not be able to complete other dental treatment needed. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Dental \"quotes\" are typically estimates of a patient's financial responsibility, given the insurance information provided by the patient. If you patronize an in\\-network practicioner, it is fairly easy for them to be pretty accurate in that estimate, but there can be some small errors when it turns out the insurance company thinks one thing and the doctor thinks something else (the doctor generally loses). This is because an in\\-network provider has a contract with the insurance company that says what they can charge and what they will receive. They could charge the patient more than the maximum allowed by the insurance company, but that would be a violation of their contract with the insurance company. It is very common that a doctor bills for a large sum, accepts much less than that and passes on a specific amount to the patient as their responsibility.\n\nAn out\\-of\\-network provider doesn't have those limits on what they can charge, also they may be less accurate in estimating patient responsibility. Indeed, an out\\-of\\-network provider could simply hand the patient a bill and a receipt, leaving it to the patient to get reimbursed, especially if the insurance company is a known pain in the neck. Insurance companies encourage you to patronize in\\-network by (1\\) limiting what the doctor can charge, (2\\) paying a greater portion of the bill, (3\\) having separate in\\-network vs. out\\-of\\-network yearly maxima plus often higher out\\-of\\-network maxima.\n\nThe doctor can *charge* any amount he wants to the insurance company, in any event \u2013 the insurance company is responsible for deciding what they will pay (a doctor can symbolically overcharge and accept lower levels of payment, if he wants to). So, yes, this is all legal. It's all part of general contract law, regarding the three contratual relations you\\+insurance, you\\+doctor and doctor\\+insurance.",

According to the information provided, an out-of-network provider is not bound by the same contractual limitations as in-network providers. They can legally charge different amounts to the insurance company than what was quoted to the patient. While this practice may seem unfair, it is not illegal. The dentist can bill any amount to the insurance company, and it's up to the insurance company to decide what they will pay. This situation highlights the potential risks and complexities of using out-of-network providers.

I've never seen a contract with both in twenty years as a lawyer, but all sorts of weird stuff gets written into contracts especially by amateurs. A term like this is often important because it can often be unclear which state's law applies to a contract otherwise.\n\nNot infrequently, there would be both a \"Choice of Law\" paragraph stating which law applies to the contract in which circumstances, and a separate \"Choice of Forum\" provision (somethings given a different title such as \"Dispute Resolution\" or \"Forum\" or \"Venue\") which states which court the contract can be enforced in, since a forum court can often apply the law of another state as to some issues in a case. \n\nFor example, usually, consumer contracts can only be enforced in a court for a jurisdiction in which the defendant consumer resides, even though the contract might provide that the governing law is the law of the place where the company suing the consumer is based.\n\nI often write (business to business) contracts that provide that Colorado law shall apply and that any suit to enforce the contract shall be brought in the state courts of the state of Colorado in the county where the business writing the court is located and that the parties waive any right to a trial by jury.",

The first clause is a Governing Law clause specifying New York law. The second is a Choice of Forum clause specifying California courts. These are not conflicting, as courts in one jurisdiction can apply the laws of another. Option A is incorrect because these clauses can coexist. Option B is wrong because the forum clause specifies California courts. Option D is incorrect because it reverses the application of law and forum.

There already is some legal relationship between the end users and the company.\n\nYour question seems to boil down to: can the company create a legal relationship between the provider and the end users?\n\n* The company cannot enter any agreements on behalf of the end users, unless the end users have provided the necessary rights.\n* It may be possible for the company to transfer its end user relationship to the provider, with the new provider remaining bound by existing agreements.\n* The company may be able to unilaterally change its terms of service offered to the end users, but not all such changes are valid.\n\nBut in practice, nothing like this will be happening: there won't be any legal relationship between the end users and the provider, only between the company and the provider. The company might then appear as a reseller. The company can only engage that provider if their agreement with the end user allows this.\n\nA practical example: The company provides an email service. It wants to stop self\\-hosting the email and outsource the service to some provider.\n\n* Scenario A: The current terms of service state that the emails will be stored on servers in Switzerland, but the new provider would be in Australia. Engaging the provider would violate the terms of service in the current form, but the ToS can likely be changed with some advance notice that allows users to delete their account if they don't agree with the changes.\n* Scenario B: The company's current agreement with end users makes certain privacy guarantees. The company ensures that these guarantees hold even when outsourcing to that provider. For example, they might have a contract with the provider that controls how the provider can process the end user data.\n\nBy the way, that scenario B would be a GDPR\\-compliant approach: the company acts as a data controller, and can take on data processors if they sign a data processing agreement that binds the processor to only use that end user data as explicitly instructed by the controller. That way, any use of the data remains under the authority of the controller. Things only get problematic when the provider wants to use the data for their own purposes.",

In this case, the company acts as a data controller and engages the new provider as a data processor. By ensuring that the provider only uses user data as explicitly instructed and maintaining existing privacy guarantees, the company remains in compliance with its agreements with users and data protection regulations like GDPR.\n\nOption A violates user privacy by allowing the provider to use data for its own purposes.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright implications of this use?\n\nA) This use would definitely be considered fair use because it's for a non-commercial, academic purpose.\n\nB) The artwork will enter the public domain in the EU in about five years, so the website can freely use it then.\n\nC) Seeking permission from Matisse's estate is the most reliable way to ensure legal use of the artwork.\n\nD) The artwork will be in the public domain in the US by 2023, 70 years after Matisse's death in 1954.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While there are some factors that might support a fair use claim (non-commercial use, small portion used, academic context), fair use determinations are complex and fact-specific. The safest approach is to seek permission from the copyright holder. Option A is incorrect because fair use is not guaranteed even for academic purposes. Option B is misleading because EU public domain status doesn't affect US copyright. Option D is incorrect because for works created before 1977, US copyright lasts 95 years from publication, not 70 years after the artist's death, meaning \"La Gerbe\" will be protected until at least 2047 in the US."

An example is [8 USC 1182(f)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182), which says\n\n> Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any\n>  class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the\n>  interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such\n>  period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or\n>  any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the\n>  entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\n\nExplicit constitutional powers are not numerous, but include commanding the armed forces and overseeing execution of national law by appointing and removing executive officers. POTUS is constitutionally the federal official responsible for relations with foreign nations, so he can make treaties (subject to Senate approval) and [executive agreements](https://fam.state.gov/fam/11fam/11fam0720.html) (not subject to approval), can appoint US ambassadors and can receive foreign ambassadors. Executive agreements have the greatest potential for being an avenue for POTUS to act contrary to Congress, but they are limited to agreements pursuant to legislation, treaty and constitutional authority (and, as agreements, are not unilateral). \n\nCongress was able to somewhat limit presidential military authority by statutes such as the [War Powers Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-33), and in the policy statement at [50 USC 1541](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1541), Congress declares\n\n> The constitutional powers of the President as Commander\\-in\\-Chief to\n>  introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into\n>  situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly\n>  indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1\\) a\n>  declaration of war, (2\\) specific statutory authorization, or (3\\) *a\n>  national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its\n>  territories or possessions, or its armed forces*\n\nThe law limits the length of engagement of the military, without Congressional approval, but there is no toothful restriction on deploying the military for up to 60 days.\n\n[50 USC Ch. 34](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-34) more generally addressed \"national emergencies\", and started by declaring an end to all existing declared emergencies. Other sections of the law require Congress to be notified and emergencies to be published in the Federal Register. An emergency can be terminated by POTUS or by act of Congress, and after 6 months (and every 6 months thereafter), Congress shall meet to discuss the emergency. POTUS must also annually re\\-declare the emergency to keep it in force.\n\nThese are procedural requirements, not content requirements. In general, you wold have to go through Title 50 to check for particular powers granted by Congress\n\nThe [International Emergency Economic Powers Act](http://International%20Emergency%20Economic%20Powers%20Act) grants powers to POTUS, with the following limit:\n\n> (a) Any authority granted to the President by section 1702 of this\n>  title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary\n>  threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the\n>  United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of\n>  the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with\n>  respect to such threat.\n> \n> \n> (b) The authorities granted to the President by section 1702 of this\n>  title may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary\n>  threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared\n>  for purposes of this chapter and may not be exercised for any other\n>  purpose. Any exercise of such authorities to deal with any new threat\n>  shall be based on a new declaration of national emergency which must\n>  be with respect to such threat.\n\nwhich appears more limiting than the War Powers Act. There is an extensive list of powers granted under [50 USC 1702](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1702), which in that domain could be called \"bright\" lines. Generally, the lines are only as bright as Congress has painted them.",

What are the best resorts for these types of information?\n\nI'm thinking of looking into getting a whole official copy of the HMLR dataset and then running some algorithmic analysis to cross index it.\n\nBut I'm hoping there is anything more direct? Is this information intended to be accessible or inaccessible or neither per se?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a live political issue. Currently, the various datasets are incomplete and have known accuracy issues. Considering a particular parcel of land:\n\n* It might not be in the Land Registry at all. About 85% of land in England and Wales is registered, and less in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n* Scottish registered land might only appear on the paper \"Register of Sasines\", as opposed to the more recent electronic database, or potentially in even older county\\-specific sasine registers.\n* The owner might be a company, partnership, trust, etc., rather than a natural person.\n* The ownership and control of that company (etc.) can be hard to trace. Companies House data is not verified; companies can be incorporated overseas; the trusts register is not publicly searchable; things can be muddled. Raw data might not show that a dozen properties, each owned by a single company that owns nothing else, are in fact ultimately controlled by a particular person of interest.\n* Different people may own the freehold, or a leasehold, or have various other forms of ownership or control. Even a long\\-term tenancy may be of interest for database purposes.\n\nBecause of continuing interest in anti\\-money laundering, tax evasion, and general accumulation of wealth, there have been plans to have a new \"register of beneficial ownership\". Such a register would record, for each plot of land, the name of the human beings who actually own and control it in the end. In the anticipated structure, each of those people would have an identifying number, and so we would get your proposed reverse index where you could look up a person and see what they owned.\n\nThe register introduced by the [Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/10/contents) is the \"[Register of Overseas Entities](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-an-overseas-entity)\" (ROE). However, as the name suggests, it only covers companies/partnerships/etc. from outside the UK. It's operated by Companies House. Overseas entities who have dealt in UK land since 1999/2014/2022 (depending on which part of the UK the land was in) have to list their beneficial owners. Because this is new, it is also not very complete yet: it only went live on 1 August 2022 and no penalties apply until the deadline of 31 January 2023\\.\n\nIn Scotland, the \"[Register of Persons Holding a Controlled Interest in Land](https://rci.ros.gov.uk/)\" (RCI) is meant to do the same but not just for overseas entities. It is live since 1 April 2022 and the initial registration period ends on 1 April 2023, so again it may not be very complete just yet.\n\nThere will likely be more political tussle over potential creation of a more extensive UK\\-wide register. Until that exists, this is a known problem with the extent of current data. You can get a partial view but even that will be frustrating when it comes to the most interesting chunks of property.",

With euthanasia, once the act is completed, the person is deceased and cannot regret or reverse their decision. However, in the case of voluntary slavery, the person remains alive and may wish to change their mind, but would no longer have the legal freedom to do so. This violates the principle in free societies that individuals should maintain the ability to make decisions about their own freedom. Option B correctly captures this crucial difference, explaining why voluntary slavery is generally not legally permissible, while voluntary euthanasia may be in some jurisdictions."

It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV.''\n\nHowever, in the 120\\+ years which followed Holmes' speech, it has been observed (see, for example, [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the\\-supreme\\-court\\-is\\-allergic\\-to\\-math/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-is-allergic-to-math/)) that the Supreme Court has not been very receptive to statistical/quantitative evidence.\n\nI would like to know of any counterexamples to that observation.\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is far from obvious what would qualify as a \u201cSupreme Court cases decided based on statistical evidence\u201d, actually, it is far from obvious what constitutes \u201cstatistical evidence\u201d. At the minimum, I expect that it is evidence which at least counts numbers of examples of something, and uses that number to reach a legal conclusion. For example \u201cOf the two candidates, Smith received 10,000 votes and Jones received 10,001 votes. The wording of the statute declares to be the winner that candidate who receives \u2018more than any other candidate\u2019, therefore we hold that Jones won\u201d. People often supplement raw counts with some measure of \u2018significance\u2019, which can be a significant (sorry about that) factor in discrimination cases, based on disparate impact theories; and also in evaluating forensic evidence (thus DNA evidence was poorly treated until the lawyers figured how to sell it).\n\nAny appeal to statistical hypothesis testing is highly unlikely to ever arise at the level of SCOTUS. That is because (generally\\-speaking, perhaps there are obscure uses baked into law) the law and the legislature do not mandate particular alphas for acceptance of a statistical hypothesis. Instead, admissibility of testimony is (federally, and for half of the states) determined by the [Daubert standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard), encoded as [FRE 702](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702) which requires that \u201cthe testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case\u201d, implicitly subsuming some domain\\-specific standards of hypothesis testing.\n\nTo the extent that DNA evidence is admissible in court and the expert can make a compelling, unrebutted argument for identity (\u201c1 chance in 70 billion\u201d as opposed to \u201c49 chances in 100\\), statistical evidence is routinely accepted (or excluded as inconclusive). SCOTUS does not commonly have [original jurisdiction](https://www.oyez.org/issues/392) so it is very unlikely that they would have ever been presented with trial\\-court level disputes involving words like \u201cBonferroni\u201d or \u201cPearson's chi\\-squared test\u201d.\n\n[This article](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/disparate-statistics) looks at the role of statistics in disparate impact cases in the US. The ruling in [Griggs v. Duke Power](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/401/424/)\ndoes not directly appeal to any statistical reasoning, it indicates simply that an pair of intelligence tests were used as a substitute for a requirement of a high school education, but the tests were not intended \u201cto measure the ability to learn to perform a particular job or category of jobs\u201d. A claim rejected by the lower court was that \u201cthese two requirements operated to render ineligible a **markedly disproportionate number** of Negroes, they were unlawful under Title VII unless shown to be job\\-related\u201d.\nThe dicta of Griggs provides numerous numeric statements such as\n\u201cwhile 34% of white males had completed high school, only 12% of Negro males had done so\u201d, \u201cuse of a battery of tests\u2026 resulted in 58% of whites passing the tests, as compared with only 6% of the blacks\u201d, \u201cthe percentage of white employees who were promoted but who were not high school graduates was nearly identical to the percentage of nongraduates in the entire white workforce\u201d.\n\nA striking mention of statistical concepts cited in Griggs is found in CFR \u00a7 1607, 35 Fed.Reg. 12333 (Aug. 1, 1970\\) which is a requirement that employers using tests have available \u201cdata demonstrating that the test is **predictive of or significantly correlated with** important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated\u201d. SCOTUS is absolutely silent on the question of actual numbers in this case, that is taken to be a matter of fact determined by the lower court, and SCOTUS\u2019s only job is to decide if employers can be required to show that a particular test is job\\-related. There is no discussion of what level of asymmetry in numbers is proof of discrimination.\n\nAnother relevant SCOTUS case is [Wards Cove Packing v. Antonio](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/490/642)\nwhich might be seen as a case of SCOTUS being \u201cunfriendly\u201d to statistics, but the ruling simply holds that proving statistical significant between variables is insufficient. In fact in the holding SCOTUS identifies the Court of Appeals error as being\n\n> a comparison of the percentage of cannery workers who are nonwhite and\n> the percentage of noncannery workers who are nonwhite makes out a\n> prima facie disparate\\-impact case. Rather, the proper comparison is\n> generally between the racial composition of the at\\-issue jobs and the\n> racial composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor\n> market\n\nIn the above statistical article, other cases are cited where the courts engaged in magnitude inquiries of practical significance. [29 CFR 1607\\.4](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1607.4) states a \u201crule\u201d known as the \u2018four\\-fifths\u201d rule that\n\n> A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than\n> four\\-fifths (4/5\\) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group with\n> the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement\n> agencies as evidence of adverse impact, while a greater than\n> four\\-fifths rate will generally not be regarded by Federal enforcement\n> agencies as evidence of adverse impact\n\nhowever the Supreme Court in [Watson v. Fort Worth Bank \\& Tr.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/487/977/), 487 U.S. 977 finds that this is no more that \u201ca rule of thumb\u201d. [Ricci v. Destefano](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/557/557/) finds that \u201c\\[A] prima facie case of disparate\\-impact liability \\[is] essentially, a threshold showing of a significant statistical disparity . . . and nothing more . . . .\u201d, and a prima facie demonstration does not require a disparity of any particular magnitude.\n\nIn short, SCOTUS cases frequently have a \u201cstatistical\u201d underpinning, any time a scientific question arises. By the nature of expert testimony and the Daubert standard, the court does not rule on what constitutes a technically\\-correct statistical test, that is a matter for the trier of fact to decide. Disparate impact cases provide the best opportunity for higher courts to be confronted with statistical arguments. If some law were passed that specifically requires a particular p\\-value on some body of numbers and demographics, the court would have to discern the legislative intent of such a law, and not the majority opinion of some body of scientists as to what is \u201cstatistically correct\u201d.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information provided about Supreme Court cases and statistical evidence, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The Supreme Court frequently rules on the technical correctness of statistical tests in cases involving scientific questions.\n\nB) The \"four-fifths rule\" is a strict standard always applied by the Supreme Court in disparate impact cases.\n\nC) The Supreme Court has consistently rejected any use of statistical evidence in its rulings since Oliver Wendell Holmes' 1897 speech.\n\nD) While the Supreme Court has addressed cases with statistical underpinnings, it generally defers to lower courts on the specifics of statistical analysis and focuses on broader legal principles.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. The passage indicates that while Supreme Court cases often have statistical underpinnings, especially in cases involving scientific questions or disparate impact, the Court does not typically rule on the technical correctness of statistical tests. Instead, it focuses on broader legal principles and leaves the evaluation of specific statistical evidence to lower courts and expert testimony.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage states that the Supreme Court does not rule on what constitutes a technically-correct statistical test, as that is a matter for the trier of fact to decide.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage mentions that the Supreme Court in Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Tr. found the \"four-fifths rule\" to be merely a \"rule of thumb\" rather than a strict standard.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the passage notes that the Supreme Court has not been very receptive to statistical/quantitative evidence, it does not suggest a complete rejection of such evidence. In fact, the passage provides examples of cases where statistical concepts were considered, albeit not always decisively."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My brother was involved in a car accident while being a registered driver on my insurance policy. The car in the wreck was in my name. The other driver involved in the accident filed a lawsuit against my brother for medical expenses. My brother died recently to something unrelated. As my insurance policy is not going to cover all of the medical expenses the other driver is after will I be the one responsible to cover the remaining balance?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Possibly\n--------\n\nMy condolences on your loss.\n\nIn a motor vehicle accident:\n\n* the at\\-fault driver is responsible for the damage caused,\n* the owner may also be responsible in certain circumstances; for example, if the driver is an agent of the owner.\n\nIn the circumstances, the aggrieved person has sued the driver. The death of the defendant in a civil trial does not end the suit \\- it will continue against the estate of the deceased.\n\nIf the defendant has insurance, then that has nothing to do with the plaintiff. An insurer indemnified the insured \\- that is, up to the limit of the policy, they will mount a defence and pay out any successful claims against the insured. If the limit of the insurance is greater than the loss, great \\- the insured pays the excess and the insurer pays the claim. If the claim is greater than the cover, the insured pays the excess, the insurer pays up to the limit and the insured pays whatever is leftover. In this case, it means the estate of your brother is liable and cannot be distributed to the beneficiaries until this is resolved.\n\nThe plaintiff can, if they think they can win, sue the owner arguing that they are also liable. This may be something they will now consider.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a car accident scenario where the driver was using a car registered to someone else and died after being sued but before the case was resolved, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding liability?\n\nA) The lawsuit automatically terminates upon the death of the defendant driver.\nB) The car owner becomes solely responsible for covering any damages beyond the insurance limit.\nC) The estate of the deceased driver remains liable for damages exceeding insurance coverage.\nD) The insurance company is obligated to cover all damages regardless of policy limits.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because the death of a defendant in a civil trial does not end the lawsuit. The case continues against the estate of the deceased.\n\nB is not necessarily true. While the car owner may potentially be held liable in certain circumstances, the primary responsibility still lies with the at-fault driver (or their estate).\n\nC is correct. As stated in the documentation, if the claim exceeds the insurance coverage, the estate of the deceased driver would be responsible for paying the remainder. The estate cannot be distributed to beneficiaries until this liability is resolved.\n\nD is incorrect. Insurance companies are only obligated to pay up to the policy limits. Any amount beyond that is not their responsibility."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: (sorry about the camelCaseTitle, I ran out of characters)\n\nHave there been any lawsuits where the losing party is known to have intentionally lost, because they wanted the opposite precedent of what would benefit them in that particular case? For example, suppose XYZ Entertainment Inc. publishes a movie, then ABC Studios LLC uses part of it in their own movie in a way that is possibly fair use. XYZ then sues ABC. If ABC won, however, the precedent would do them more harm than good long\\-term; they don't want other companies to be able to copy their work in that way, and they are willing to pay damages to XYZ to avoid that. In the scenario described in my question, ABC would try to lose the lawsuit, because the damages they will pay by losing are less than the long\\-term loss they would suffer due to the precedent set by them winning. Has something like this ever happened? (This isn't limited to copyright; that was just an example.)\n\nWould it be ethical for a lawyer to \"represent\" ABC and try to lose the lawsuit for them if they specifically wanted this?\n\nI'm interested in answers for any jurisdiction, but especially the US.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are some cases in which it is ethical to lose a suit on purpose, called [Friendly Suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_suit). They're not real controversies, as both parties already agree on the outcome desired, but judicial recognition of that outcome is still desired. Your example doesn't sound like that to me. It seems like it would be easier for ABC to just settle with XYZ before it made it to trial and risked setting precedent.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of legal proceedings, what is the most appropriate course of action for a company (ABC Studios LLC) that wants to avoid setting an unfavorable precedent in a copyright infringement case, even if it means losing the current lawsuit?\n\nA) Intentionally present a weak defense in court to ensure a loss\nB) Hire an incompetent lawyer to mishandle the case\nC) Seek a settlement with the opposing party before the case goes to trial\nD) Pursue a \"friendly suit\" with the opposing party\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) Intentionally presenting a weak defense is unethical and could be considered a form of fraud on the court. It goes against the principles of justice and the lawyer's professional obligations.\n\nB) Hiring an incompetent lawyer deliberately is also unethical and could lead to malpractice issues. It undermines the integrity of the legal system.\n\nC) This is the correct answer. Seeking a settlement before the case goes to trial is a legitimate and common practice. It allows both parties to resolve the dispute without setting a legal precedent, which is ABC's main concern in this scenario.\n\nD) A \"friendly suit\" is not applicable in this situation. Friendly suits are used when both parties agree on the desired outcome and want judicial recognition. In this case, there is a real controversy between the parties.\n\nThe most ethical and practical solution for ABC Studios LLC is to negotiate a settlement with XYZ Entertainment Inc. This approach avoids the risk of setting an unfavorable precedent while resolving the immediate dispute."
