        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A settlement agreement was reached between a shopper and a grocery store regarding food poisoning. The agreement stipulated that within one week: (1) the store would pay $100, (2) provide a free steak, (3) the shopper would remove a negative Yelp review, and (4) both parties would release each other from further legal action. After one week, the store hasn't paid the $100. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the shopper's options?\n\nA) The shopper can immediately sue for the original $300 claimed before the settlement, as the agreement is now void.\n\nB) The shopper must still remove the Yelp review before taking any action against the store.\n\nC) The shopper can seek enforcement of the settlement agreement through the court, but is limited to the terms agreed upon in the settlement.\n\nD) The shopper is no longer bound by the agreement and can pursue any legal action, including claims beyond the original dispute.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When a settlement agreement is breached, the aggrieved party (in this case, the shopper) can seek enforcement of the agreement through the court. However, they are limited to the terms agreed upon in the settlement. The shopper cannot revert to the original claim of $300 or pursue additional claims, as the settlement agreement included a mutual release clause (term 4). The shopper is still bound by the terms of the agreement, including removing the Yelp review, even if the store hasn't fulfilled its obligations. The breach by one party doesn't automatically void the entire agreement or release the other party from their obligations. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to seek enforcement of the settlement terms through the court."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding trademark filings and the information they typically contain?\n\nA) Trademark filings always include precise measurements and angles for visual elements of the trademark.\n\nB) The USPTO's TSDR database contains trademark registration documents, but these are unlikely to specify exact angles between visual elements.\n\nC) Google Patents is the best resource for finding detailed information about trademarked characters like Mickey Mouse.\n\nD) The angle between Mickey Mouse's ears is a key legal criterion used by courts to determine trademark infringement.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The USPTO's Trademark Status and Document Retrieval (TSDR) database does contain trademark registration documents, which can be searched using registration numbers. However, these documents typically do not include precise measurements or angles for visual elements of trademarks. Instead, they usually provide example drawings and general descriptions. The exact angle between Mickey Mouse's ears is not likely to be specified in these documents.\n\nOption A is incorrect because trademark filings do not always include precise measurements and angles. They are more likely to contain visual representations and broader descriptions.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Google Patents is primarily for patent searches, not trademarks. It's not the appropriate resource for finding trademark information.\n\nOption D is incorrect because courts do not typically use specific measurements like the angle between Mickey Mouse's ears as a key criterion for determining trademark infringement. Instead, they consider whether a particular usage is likely to cause confusion among consumers."

Processing such data is *forbidden*, unless an exception applies. Per Art 9(2\\)(h) such processing is allowed when it is\n\n> \\[\u2026] necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to contract with a health professional and subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 3\n\nParagraph 3 requires that processing under 9(2\\)(h) only occurs under the responsibility of someone who is subject to an obligation of secrecy per Union or member state law, e.g. a doctor. Paragraph 4 allows individual member states to add further conditions, including limitations, to such processing.\n\nAssuming that electronic storage or processing of health data is in fact necessary, the GDPR does not make a strong distinction between in\\-house processing, and processing via Data Processors. Of course, the usual conditions for using data processors and performing international transfers apply.\n\nHowever, a data controller processing medical data will almost certainly have to first perform an Art 35 Data Protection Impact Assessment. This DPIA must consider various risks. Transferring data into third countries is risky. Using data processors is risky. But processing data in\\-house can also be risky, so using an external service could improve things. There is a lot to be balanced here. Where the planned processing has high risks, the responsible supervisory authority has to be consulted first (Art 36\\).

According to the GDPR, health data is considered a special category of data under Article 9, and its processing is generally forbidden unless specific exceptions apply. While storing medical data in cloud services can be legal, it requires careful consideration and compliance with GDPR requirements.\n\nThe hospital must conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) as per Article 35, which is almost certainly required for processing medical data. This DPIA must consider various risks, including those associated with using data processors and performing international transfers. If the planned processing presents high risks, the hospital must consult with the supervisory authority first, as stated in Article 36.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the requirements and ignores the need for a DPIA and risk assessment.\n\nAnswer B is too restrictive. While health data is a special category, the GDPR does allow for its processing under certain conditions, including for healthcare purposes as per Article 9(2)(h).\n\nAnswer D is partially correct in considering patient consent, but it's not the only or primary requirement. Moreover, the GDPR doesn't strictly require data to be stored within the EU, though data transfers outside the EU do require additional safeguards."

We're interested in adding a second bathroom to ours \u2014 by converting an existing small room rather than building or taking common area. Even though we're not changing the footprint, this is an improvement which affects the common areas (because of the plumbing) and therefore needs trustee approval. We have that, with a 2\\-1 vote. But, the people voting no are saying that since there is a page in the condo docs which describes the number of rooms and notes on a chart \"1B\", where B is bathroom, that the project requires an amendment to this part of the Master Deed to change this and cannot go forward without.\n\nIs this true? Is this chart a *prescription*, or is it intended to describe the condo at formation and should be changed to follow reality but does not block it? Or, something else?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So, likely descriptive but may be either depending on how the deed is drafted, and depending on whether it's in an exhibit that is incorporated by reference into the deed or not. However, what likely governs is not the description/prescription in any event; it is whether your deed allows for an easement and the board has approved it. \n\nMost master deeds for condominiums have what is called an \"Easement of Encroachment\" in the body of deed (usually shortly after the name, description of land, description of building, description of unit(s)), so that each unit has the benefit of an easement of encroachment in the event that said unit (meaning *any* unit) encroaches upon any portion of the common elements of the structure or another unit (encroachment on another unit is only for things like building settling that causes the building lines to move or change slightly \u2013 you can't bump out your closet a foot into your neighbor's room). This easement goes both ways, or vice versa, such that common elements may encroach upon the unit for a variety of different reasons like building maintenance and building settling; i.e., the whole has the same rights.\n\nThe part that is really relevant in your case, however, and is very typical language, is the part that typically states something like: *each unit has and is subject to an easement for the benefit of any other unit, to use and access such elements to encompass wires, ducts, pipes, conduits, cables or any other common elements located in, on, or within the right of any unit such that if improvements to a unit that are within your right under the restrictive covenants (the vote would decide that in your case) then those common elements may be changed to the extent that they do not materially and adversely affect another unit*. This does not mean that another unit does not like it. It means that it would materially change their unit in some way, like the shape of it, the water available to them, etc. You should check the master deed for this. Otherwise, the covenants control and you still should have the right to do this. You may potentially just need to amend the description of your unit. Even if an amendment needs to get filed with the registry of deeds, that is not a big deal. I hope this helps.",

According to the information provided, alphabetical order is considered a \"fact\" rather than an \"expression,\" and facts are not subject to copyright protection. This applies to both standard Latin alphabet order and the order of special characters in the Turkish alphabet. The order of words in a dictionary based on the alphabet is not a creative expression but a standardized system, and thus cannot be copyrighted. Additionally, even if the Turkish government established the order for special characters, government decisions of this nature are typically exempt from copyright under Turkish law."

Their inclusion, separate from the mention of the States, seems to imply some distinction, but its nature is unclear. Has there ever been any legal investigation of this?

Heller](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/opinion.html), 554 U.S. 570\\. In Heller, the meaning of \"Right of the People\" is relevant, and the court finds that in three instances in The Constitution,\n\n> these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not\n>  'collective' rights, or rights that may be exercised only through\n>  participation in some corporate body\"\n\nHowever, Art. 1 Sec 2 of The Constitution says that \"the people\" will select members of The House, and then there is the 10th: Heller says that \n\n> Those provisions arguably refer to 'the people' acting\n>  collectively\u2014but they deal with the exercise or reservation of powers,\n>  not rights\n\nIn other words, \"the people\" can act collectively, but \"the people\" have individual rights. In the remaining cases of \"the people\", the expression \"unambiguously refers to all members of the political community, not an unspecified subset\".\n\nWe are then directed to [US v. Verdugo\\-Urquidez](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/494/259/case.html) 494 U.S. 259, which is a warrantless search case involving a Mexican citizen and a search in Mexico, and the part that Heller finds relevant is that\n\n> \u2018\\[T]he people\u2019 seems to have been a term of art employed in select\n>  parts of the Constitution\u2026 . \\[Its uses] sugges\\[t] that \u2018the people\u2019\n>  protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the First and Second\n>  Amendments, and to whom rights and powers are reserved in the Ninth\n>  and Tenth Amendments, refers to a class of persons who are part of a\n>  national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient\n>  connection with this country to be considered part of that community.\"\n\nIn other case law, [Underwager v.

Heller and US v. Verdugo-Urquidez, has distinguished between uses of \"the people\" in the Constitution. When referring to rights (as in the First, Second, and Fourth Amendments), \"the people\" indicates individual rights. However, in the context of powers, as in the Tenth Amendment, \"the people\" refers to collective action. The Court specifically noted that in the Tenth Amendment, the phrase deals with \"the exercise or reservation of powers, not rights.\" Furthermore, \"the people\" is defined as those who are part of the national community or have sufficient connection to it. Therefore, in the Tenth Amendment, \"the people\" refers to the collective exercise of powers by this national community, distinct from both individual rights and state powers."

What have they done in the last nine\\-days which suddenly justifies personal sanctions against them? As far as I know most of them don't hold any current positions of power/authority in Russia (not officially anyhow).\n\nWhilst I broadly accept the consensus that they're Putin's cronies who owe much of their current success to their past associations with him, and whilst I'd personally be delighted to see their money go to support Ukrainian refugees I can't actually see a good legal argument for sanctions other than 'guilt by association' \\- which probably wouldn't stand up in court.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the [united\\-kingdom](/questions/tagged/united-kingdom \"show questions tagged 'united-kingdom'\"), the legal basis flows from the [Sanctions and Anti\\-Money Laundering Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/contents). This allows regulations to be made for particular sanctions regimes, in this case [The Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/contents) and its several amendments, including three revisions this year. Under those regulations, the Secretary of State may designate individuals who are then subject to particular sanctions. A consolidated [list](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list) is available for all individuals and organizations who have been named under any of the regulations, not just the Russia one.\n\nWorking backwards from the list, we see such names as Vladimir Putin, who has an asset freeze on the grounds that \\-\n\n> Vladimir Vladimirovich PUTIN is the President of the Russian Federation, carrying ultimate authority for the policy of the Russian government and Russian armed forces. In February 2022, PUTIN ordered Russian military forces to launch an invasion of Ukraine, undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.\n\nThus, he has been named for the purposes of [regulation 11](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/11), and the statement of reasons (required by [regulation 8](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/8)) refers to the specific grounds in [regulation 6](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/6) by which a person can be added to the list. In this case, those grounds are 6(2\\)(a)(i) as interpreted by 6(3\\)(a),\n\n> (2\\) In this regulation, an \"involved person\" means a person who \u2014\n>   \n> (a) is or has been involved in\u2014\n>   \n>  (i) destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine\n>   \n> ...\n>   \n> (3\\) For the purposes of this regulation, a person is \u201cinvolved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine\u201d if\u2014\n>   \n> (a) the person is responsible for, engages in, provides support for, or promotes any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine\n\nFor \"oligarchs\" who are on the list, the Foreign Secretary has specifically drawn attention to Gennady Timchenko, described as Russia's sixth\\-richest oligarch. The statement of reasons says:\n\n> Gennadiy Timchenko, hereafter TIMCHENKO is a major shareholder in Bank \"Rossiya\". Bank \"Rossiya\" is a key stakeholder in the National Media Group which supports Russian policy which is destabilising Ukraine. Following the annexation of Crimea, Bank \"Rossiya\" has expanded its bank branches and provision of insurance and investment throughout Crimea and Sevastopol; and offers support to military activities and the formation of major transport links and cards that allow the public to travel easily around the peninsula. Therefore, Bank \"Rossiya\" has supported the consolidation of Crimea into the Russian Federation by integrating the financial system following the annexation of Crimea. TIMCHENKO therefore is or has been involved in engaging in, providing support for, or promoting any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. Additionally, TIMCHENKO is associated with a person involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.\n\nThese are the same regulation 6 grounds as for Putin, but with additional reasoning to draw the connection (also, a citation under 6(2\\)(d) for \"associated with\"). One reason for this text being required is to undercut any suggestion that the listing is because of \"guilt by association\". In judicial review, for which continue reading below, this kind of statement and the process that gave rise to it is powerful evidence against a suggestion that the Secretary of State was acting other than rationally.\n\nWe can now look back to the 2018 Act, which authorizes the 2019 Regulations and provides rules about how the Secretary of State can designate people. Detailed provisions in the Regulations trace back to rules in the Act about the shape of a sanctions regime; for example, the \"asset freeze\" of regulation 11 is within [section 3](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/section/3) of the Act on \"Financial sanctions\". There are also procedural safeguards around the making of regulations, mainly relating to Parliamentary approval, and around the designation of individuals. For example, a designated person can ask the Secretary of State to be removed from the list, and under [section 22(3\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/section/22) she must do so if the person doesn't fit the criteria by which they were originally included. That would include if they are no longer an \"involved person\", or if their designation were no longer deemed appropriate based on the purpose of the sanctions regulations.\n\nAs with other executive actions, judicial review is available (under Chapter 4 of the Act), which could bring in considerations of whether the Secretary of State acted within her powers, did so \"reasonably\", etc. Human rights grounds are also possible, in relation to procedural fairness (Article 6\\) or the right to enjoy property (ECHR Protocol 1, Article 1\\). Against those stand arguments on the public interest, UK compliance with international obligations, national security, the general integrity of the sanctions system, and so forth. It is plausible that if a claim reached this point, the Secretary of State would be able to show that the designation \\- as described in the statement of reasons above \\- was on sound policy grounds, was taken after a sober review of the evidence, and was proportionate in the circumstances.\n\nThere is not much case law on the 2018 Act, given its recency. One example is *R (Youssef) v Secretary of State* \\[2021] EWHC 3188 (Admin) in which an Article 6 claim failed. That was in relation to UN sanctions against Al\\-Qaida, which is a different position from the one here, but it has some force for understanding the current UK system. The present Act was created partially in response to the judgement in *HM Treasury v Ahmed* \\[2010] UKSC 2 against a previous version of the sanctions laws, and the 2021 case found that the new version was acceptable. The judicial review avenue and the requirement to give reasons are directly aimed at complying with Article 6\\. While a court could always potentially find another problem, the current Act and the Regulations are as watertight as the drafters can make them in the light of existing precedent.",

According to the information provided, the legal basis for sanctions flows from the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 and the subsequent Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Regulation 6 specifically outlines the grounds for designating an \"involved person,\" which includes those who are or have been involved in \"destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because while many sanctioned individuals are wealthy Russians, there is no specific wealth threshold in the legislation. \n\nOption B is incorrect because a conviction for money laundering is not a prerequisite for sanctions under this specific regulation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while some sanctioned individuals do hold government positions (like Vladimir Putin), this is not a requirement for all designated persons. Many sanctioned oligarchs, for example, do not hold official positions but are targeted for their support of destabilizing actions.\n\nThe correct option (C) directly reflects the language used in the regulations and provides the broadest basis for designating individuals involved in the conflict, whether through direct action, financial support, or other means."

Which of the following statements best describes why this approach would not be legally permissible?\n\nA) The company would be violating antitrust laws by monopolizing legal services.\nB) Only state bar associations are allowed to regulate the provision of legal services.\nC) The ethical rules governing lawyers apply regardless of the business structure employing them.\nD) Non-lawyers are prohibited from hiring lawyers to provide services to third parties.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The ethical rules and restrictions on advertising and soliciting clients, as outlined in the ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct, apply to lawyers regardless of the type of organization employing them. These rules bind the individual lawyers, not just traditional law firms. Therefore, even if a company is structured as a non-law firm business, the lawyers working for it would still be subject to the same ethical constraints and unable to engage in unrestricted advertising or solicitation of clients.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because this scenario doesn't involve antitrust issues. Answer B is incorrect because while bar associations play a role in regulating legal practice, they are not the only entities involved in legal regulation. Answer D is too broad and incorrect; non-lawyers can hire lawyers (e.g., in-house counsel), but they cannot circumvent the ethical rules governing the practice of law."

However, they didn't pay me for 3 months, so the system expired.\n\nIs an undisclosed expiration feature like that considered sabotage?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you're attacking the problem from the wrong angle.\n\nThe software is written in PHP? Did you really sabotaged it in such a way as to explicitly require your own intervention? E.g., did it automatically delete the source code that you own, but preserved all the stuff that they own? If it's just a few \"eggs\" here and there, then they can simply hire someone else to remove those eggs, and be done with it.\n\nIf you instead sabotaged their data, or encrypted it in some way, or stored it offsite, then, yes, you're in trouble. Likewise, if they're directly losing lots of money due to your software being suddenly unavailable, which you did on purpose and in bad faith (e.g., without ever informing them of any such condition), then they could likely sue you for damages.\n\nA better approach in the situation would be the legal\\-offensive side. If they're using your software, without paying you the monthly fee that they've agreed to pay (and for which you have proof of many repeated prior payments, separate from your main employment with them), you should be the one to send them invoices and a cease\\-and\\-desist letter, and then if no compliance is reached, sue them, asking the court for a judgement in your favour for the monies owned, and for an injunctive court order for them to stop using your software without providing a payment in return.",

The answer suggests that if the company experiences significant financial losses due to the sudden unavailability of the software, which was intentionally caused by the developer without prior disclosure, they could potentially sue for damages. This aligns with the documentation's statement that if the company is \"directly losing lots of money due to your software being suddenly unavailable, which you did on purpose and in bad faith (e.g., without ever informing them of any such condition), then they could likely sue you for damages.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation does not support the idea that the developer's actions are completely legal and justified. Option C, while a better approach suggested in the documentation, is not the best description of the legal implications of the current situation.

In the future it is possible that it will be in the US's interest to reverse their decision due to the sudden shift in market pressure. That said Bayer is a German company so I wanted to know if the US Supreme Court or any other court could hit Bayer with antitrust regulations. If not is there anyway the US can regulate Bayer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Starting at the top, a company can be restructured (\"broken up\") under anti\\-trust laws (classical examples: Standard Oil, ATT), however restructuring is not common. Approval of a merger does not immunize a company against future anti\\-trust action \u2013 the company has to continuously obey the law.\n\nForeign companies are not free of the threat of anti\\-trust actions, indeed the \"exception\" where anti\\-competitive behavior is allowed is when it only hurts foreign markets. See [In Re Capacitors Antitrust Litigation](https://secureservercdn.net/45.40.155.193/f51.56e.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/InreCapacitorsFTAIA.pdf):\n\n> Congress\u2019s goal was to assure American companies that they would not\n> be liable under the Sherman Act for conduct that typically would be\n> considered anticompetitive so long as that conduct adversely affected\n> foreign markets only\n\nThis is implemented in [15 USC 6a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/6a) which says that\n\n> Sections 1 to 7 of this title shall not apply to conduct involving\n> trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with\n> foreign nations unless...\n\nand sections 1\\-7 are the general prohibitions against anti\\-competitive behavior [15 USC 8](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/8) specifically addresses illegal import trade:\n\n> Every combination, conspiracy, trust, agreement, or contract is\n> declared to be contrary to public policy, illegal, and void when the\n> same is made by or between two or more persons or corporations, either\n> of whom, as agent or principal, is engaged in importing any article\n> from any foreign country into the United States, and when such\n> combination, conspiracy, trust, agreement, or contract is intended to\n> operate in restraint of lawful trade, or free competition in lawful\n> trade or commerce, or to increase the market price in any part of the\n> United States of any article or articles imported or intended to be\n> imported into the United States, or of any manufacture into which such\n> imported article enters or is intended to enter.\n\nSo given that Bayer does business with the US, it is subject to US antitrust law. It can be found to be in violation, and can be punished accordingly.\n\nThe Dept. of Justice has [this long analysis](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/926481/download) of the law of anti\\-trust actions against foreign companies. But unquestionable and as upheld in a number of cases against foreign businesses e.g. [F. Hoffman\\-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S. A.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/542/155/#tab-opinion-1961676), 542 U.S. 155 commercial activities abroad are subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act if\n\n> those activities adversely affect domestic commerce, imports to the\n> United States, or exporting activities of one engaged in such\n> activities within the United States\n\nIt is hard to know whether the court would order Bayer to be broken up, since involuntary restructuring is an uncommon outcome.",

Option B is incorrect as modifying existing licenses is neither legal (in most cases) nor encouraged in the open-source community. Option D, while touching on potential consequences, is incorrect in stating that modifying the GPL is legal.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity of established open-source licenses and the legal protections in place to prevent unauthorized modifications."

We've planned to make a public free WiFi and make a phishing website to phish login credential. We've use Facebook as our first stage of research in which we delete the login form, replace the login button with JavaScript which will redirect user to a notification page which tells them this is a phishing site and also telling them how to prevent this vulnerability.\n\nIf we **don't collect** users' login info, and we also redirect them to a page which notify and tell them how to prevent phishing, is it still illegal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is / will be no \"educational exception\". It is not clear whether it is possible to do anything in that direction, without violating a particular state's anti\\-phishing law (around half the states have them). Let me first posit a hypothetical means of doing this: put up a fake Facebook login page with boxes for name and password, where users type that data in. The data remains on the users browser and is not posted back to the phisher. In Washington, [RCW 19\\.190\\.080](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.190.080) says\n\n> It is a violation of this chapter to solicit, request, or take any\n>  action to induce a person to provide personally identifying\n>  information by means of a web page, electronic mail message, or\n>  otherwise using the internet by representing oneself, either directly\n>  or by implication, to be another person, without the authority or\n>  approval of such other person.\n\nThe law is broader than a prohibition against storing or receiving (and forgetting) PII, it includes asking. When a person types their PII into the boxes, they will have provide that information. They don't even have to type the information in, because setting up the web page constitutes inducing to provide that information. So don't do it in Washington, or Oregon (ORS \u00a7 646\\.A.808\\), or [California](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&division=8.&title=&part=&chapter=33.&article=).\n\nThe applicable Virginia law [\u00a718\\.2\\-152\\.5:1(A)](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter5/section18.2-152.5:1/) is more general, not tailored to phishing. It says\n\n> It is unlawful for any person...to use a computer to obtain, access,\n>  or record, through the use of material artifice, trickery or\n>  deception, any identifying information, as defined in clauses (iii)\n>  through (xiii) of subsection C of \u00a7 18\\.2\\-186\\.3\\.\n\nUnder the hypothetical scenario, you will not have recorded, and probably will not have obtained or accessed. Their law does not define \"access\" or \"obtain\". If prosecuted in Virginia, you may be able to defend yourself based on a interpretation of those terms, but that is a risk, and you should absolutely hire a cyberlaw attorney knowledgeable about Virginia.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A cybersecurity student plans to create a public free WiFi hotspot with a fake Facebook login page for educational purposes. The page won't collect user data, but will redirect users to a notification about phishing risks. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this project?\n\nA) This project is legal in all US states as long as no user data is collected.\nB) The project is legal if conducted only for educational purposes and with university approval.\nC) The project could be illegal in some states, even if no data is collected or stored.\nD) The project is legal as long as users are informed it's a simulation after attempting to log in.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The project could be illegal in some states, even if no data is collected or stored. Many state laws, such as those in Washington, Oregon, and California, prohibit not just the collection of personal information through phishing, but also the act of soliciting or inducing people to provide such information. For example, Washington's law (RCW 19.190.080) makes it illegal to take any action to induce a person to provide personally identifying information by impersonating another entity online, regardless of whether that information is actually collected or stored. Similarly, Virginia's law (\u00a718.2-152.5:1(A)) prohibits using trickery or deception to obtain identifying information via computer, which could potentially apply to this scenario. Therefore, even with educational intent and no data collection, the project could still violate anti-phishing laws in several states."

Will he be able to return to his native country in the future under statute barred or statute of limitations rules? He would have been jailed for five years if he wasn't a Diplomat.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several options that the Home country has. \n\n1. It can choose to waive diplomatic immunity and allow the Host nation (Saudi Arabia in this case) to pursue legal charges in their own system.\n2. The Home nation can choose to pursue charges as though the crime were committed on national soil. Typically once charges are brought the statute of limitations is suspended but this may vary by nation.\n3. The Home nation can choose not to pursue charges. In this case once the statute of limitations expires then the former diplomat would be free at home. And would enjoy the immunity from prosecution for the incident in the Host country as well.\n\nHowever since the diplomat appears to have fled before charges could be brought, if Saudi Arabia were to gain possession of the former diplomat it could pursue legal action against the diplomat as an international fugitive. The former diplomat could attempt to invoke diplomatic immunity and it would be up to the Home country to either back their former diplomat, or they could choose to deny the claim since the former diplomat fled and they could interpret that as surrendering his diplomatic post and in effect renouncing his diplomatic status.",

Country Y wants to prosecute the ambassador. Which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding the potential outcomes of this situation?\n\nA) The ambassador is permanently protected by diplomatic immunity and can never be prosecuted for the crime in any country.\n\nB) Country X must waive the ambassador's diplomatic immunity for any legal action to be taken against them.\n\nC) If Country X refuses to waive immunity, Country Y has no further recourse to pursue justice.\n\nD) Country Y could potentially prosecute the ambassador if they gain custody, depending on Country X's actions and interpretations of diplomatic status.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement. While diplomatic immunity typically protects ambassadors from prosecution in host countries, there are several factors that could allow for prosecution in this case:\n\n1. Country X (the home country) could waive diplomatic immunity, allowing Country Y to pursue charges.\n2. Country X could choose to prosecute the ambassador themselves.\n3. If the ambassador fled before charges were brought, they might be considered an international fugitive.\n4. Country X could interpret the ambassador's flight as a renunciation of their diplomatic status, potentially allowing Country Y to prosecute if they gain custody.\n\nOption A is incorrect because diplomatic immunity is not absolute or permanent. Option B is incorrect because Country X has other options besides waiving immunity, such as prosecuting the ambassador themselves. Option C is incorrect because Country Y may have other avenues to pursue justice, especially if they gain custody of the former ambassador and if Country X does not support their claim to continued diplomatic immunity."

In civil cases, such as copyright infringement, damages can indeed be awarded based on current legal interpretations, even if the action occurred before those interpretations were firmly established.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal process and requirements in this situation?\n\nA) The court will automatically assume the debt is legitimate and rule in favor of the collecting company without requiring evidence.\n\nB) Capital One is legally required to verify the legitimacy of the debt collection agency before the case can proceed.\n\nC) The burden of proof lies with the defendant (alleged debtor) to prove they do not owe the debt.\n\nD) The plaintiff (debt collector) must provide sufficient evidence to prove the existence and ownership of the debt in court.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because courts do not automatically assume debts are legitimate. They require evidence.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while financial institutions may have internal compliance procedures, there's no legal requirement for Capital One to verify the legitimacy of a debt collector before a case proceeds.\n\nOption C is incorrect because in legal proceedings, the burden of proof typically lies with the plaintiff (the party making the claim), not the defendant.\n\nOption D is correct. As stated in the documentation, the creditor (in this case, the debt collection company) must prove the debt with evidence. They need to provide sufficient documentation to support their claim of debt ownership and the debt's existence. This aligns with the principle that the plaintiff must prove their case on the balance of probabilities in court."

Note that this is before any judicial scrutiny occurs: I.e., not only are you (supposedly) presumed innocent, but you have not even been indicted and the prosecutor has not even decided whether to seek an indictment. So the standards for detention are extremely low.\n\nFurthermore, [there appears to be no consistent right to communicate with anyone during detention](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2274/you-have-the-right-to-one-phone-call-when-arrested-a-hollywood-myth). You can demand a lawyer if you are interrogated, but the police could instead choose to simply detain you without questioning.\n\nIt seems that the consequences of this to the detainee could be disastrous: Imagine you're a single working mother snatched by the police during your lunch break. Your employer and/or clients don't hear from you for 3 days. Your babysitter can't reach you when you fail to return home at the usual hour. You may miss deadlines for financial matters that could incur enormous direct costs.\n\nDo all of these costs have to be born by the innocent individual?\n\nDoes the state have any obligation to care for your dependents while you are detained?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, there is no recourse. An yes, the potential \"costs\", both personal, financial, social, can be high and are not compensable under an investigatory hold scenario; however, it doesn't usually happen like that. There is no investigatory hold that long without arrest. If the police want to talk to you but don't have enough to arrest you, you can leave any time. If you call your lawyer, he/she will come to the police station and tell the cops to release or arrest you.\n\nIf the police really want you to stay, likely there is probable cause and they can keep you anyway. The police can arrest you and keep you, without a warrant so long as there is \"probable cause\" to believe that a crime has been committed (by you). Once arrested without a warrant, this is what is usually referred to as an investigatory hold, where the law says you must be arraigned within 72 hours (some states it must be 48 hours, 1 day less than supreme court says is reasonable). During this time they can investigate their case against you and decide what, if any, charges they will bring.\n\nThere is no recourse for this, (in the event they bring no charges) unless you can establish that you were held for no reason (including not being falsely identified) and that it was only to intentionally deprive you of your right to liberty. This is nearly impossible to prove, unless you really did nothing and the cop was just messing with you (for instance in a personal vendetta) and you can show that.",

According to the information provided, there is generally no recourse for individuals detained under an investigatory hold, even if no charges are ultimately filed. The detainee would only have a case if they could prove that the detention was entirely baseless and intended solely to deprive them of liberty, which is extremely difficult to establish. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the state has no obligation to compensate for lost wages or provide care for dependents during detention. \n\nOption B is incorrect because simply not filing charges after an investigatory hold does not constitute unlawful detention if there was probable cause at the time of arrest. \n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no consistent right to a phone call during detention, contrary to popular belief.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the legal rights (or lack thereof) of individuals during police detention and the potential personal consequences of such detention, even for innocent parties."

But the hypothetical law as written makes theft something that someone can be *guilty* of, that is, theft is an offence and illegal. The exact consequences depend on other provisions and the legal system itself.\n\nIf a common law jurisdiction abandons common law offences in favour of a criminal code and such code does not contain \"any person who commits theft is guilty of theft\", then theft would be legal (or at least not criminalized by such code).\n\nTheft has to have an operable definition for the law to be effective, but the definition does not have to be explicit in the statutes when there are other sources of laws. The courts are meant to interpret the words in law reasonably, relying on ordinary definitions of expressions, the discernible intention of the legislature, history and social development.\n\nThere can be unconstitutionally (or otherwise unacceptably) vague laws, but in common law jurisdictions, at least the usual crimes like theft and murder have been interpreted by the courts over hundreds of years with a rich body of case law and legal literature. Crimes like piracy benefit from a multitude of internationals conventions and case laws in many jurisdictions, for example, the Canadian definition of [piracy](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/FullText.html) is almost a tautology:\n\n> 74 (1\\) Every one commits piracy who does any act that, by the law of nations, is piracy.\n\nOf course, the operative provision is exactly the one with the words \"is guilty of\"\n\n> (2\\) Every one who commits piracy while in or out of Canada is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.",

After the termination date, any domains which are not transferred will resolve to an error page until the domain expiry date, and any data associated with your account will be deleted.  \n> \n> If you believe your website provides information services that are critical to the defense of Ukraine or which assist in ensuring the safety and well\\-being of the Ukrainian people, please reach out to us directly and an IONOS representative will review your site as a possible exception to the company's general policy on terminations.

For purposes of the Agreement, \"force majeure\" shall mean circumstances or occurrences beyond IONOS\u2019s reasonable control, whether or not foreseeable at the time of entering into the Agreement, in consequence of which IONOS cannot reasonably be required to perform its obligations hereunder or otherwise perform its obligations under the Agreement.\n\nIONOS is an internet service, which to my knowledge is rendered outside of Russian soil. Therefore I don't see a way to declare that IONOS is \"cannot reasonably be required to perform its obligations\" in such situation.

A problem is that the TOS refers to a \"country subject to U.S. Treasury Department embargo restrictions\", which is not legally defined. [Here](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/where-is-ofacs-country-list-what-countries-do-i-need-to-worry-about-in-terms-of-us-sanctions) is the Treasury Department's explanation of that point (which is that there are very many types of restrictions: there is no legal category of \"embargo restrictions\"). One could then argue, in one's breach of contract arbitration hearing, that the clause cannot reasonably be interpreted the way the company (possibly) intends it to be.\n\nThe force majeure clause does not seem relevant unless they see some way in which the invasion of Ukraine makes it impossible for the company to fulfill the contract with Russians.",

In Germany, copyright (or more precisely, *Author's Right*) can only be held by a *natural person*, which is a legal term of art that essentially means \"human being\". There are two groups of natural persons involved here: the programmers and the creators of the works which are part of the training set. However, I can't see how either group could have a reasonable claim of copyright.\n\nNote: there have been similar discussions about GitHub Copilot, an AI that writes code for you. It is my understanding that the process used by GitHub Copilot is roughly comparable to the process used here. With GitHub Copilot, there have been instances where significant snippets which are part of the training set have appeared in the output with only minor alterations. In this case, it is likely that the original author will have copyright over that portion of the output.\n\nHowever, *IFF* a human being were actually involved in *selecting* specific works, then there is probably a copyright based on the creative decision of selecting *this particular* work and rejecting all the others. This is similar to the classic textbook example of a driftwood sculpture: the creative process here is not creating the sculpture but choosing to pick up *this particular* piece of driftwood instead of the hundreds of others on the beach.\n\nSo, if you simply generate these works and publish *all of them*, there is no copyright. If you generate a large batch and then *select* a certain number, then the person who made the selection might hold a copyright.",

The GAN-generated artwork itself would likely be considered public domain, as neither the programmers nor the creators of the training set works have a reasonable claim to copyright on the output. However, if a human is involved in selecting specific works from a larger batch of GAN-generated images, they may be able to claim copyright based on their creative decision in choosing particular outputs.

You can offer the employer to compensate them for the extra work and cost associated with cutting and handling a physical check\n3. You could offer to indemnify your employer against clerical mistakes, lost checks, delayed payments, etc.\n4. You can try to set up an escrow account that is handled by an \"acceptable\" and neutral 3rd party. This party can receive the money and move it per your instructions, so you don't have to handle it yourself\n\nMany employers will be willing to flex a little, if it's not too much work \\& effort for them and if you can articulate your need in a way that makes sense to them.",

This doesn't make the Act itself applicable (option B is incorrect), but it does create contractual obligations that mirror the Act's provisions (making D correct).\n\nOption A is incorrect because parties cannot contract into the application of the Act where it's explicitly excluded. Option C is incorrect because the Act either applies in full or not at all; parties can't selectively apply only parts of it.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the Act's scope, the concept of contractual terms vs. statutory obligations, and the limits of contracting around legislation."

This agent appears to be from a property services company that specialises in tenancy evictions and getting unpaid rent for the landlord \\- this was probably because we were withholding rent payments due to the landlord not adhering to section 48 (giving us a UK address to which we can send correspondence) and he wouldn't accept that he was breaking the contract at the time but has since realised this and all has been resolved, so this agent's service is no longer required.\n\nBut what's to stop him from going back on his word at the last moment (after we've signed a new contract) and pretend he didn't send it \\- because I can't really prove that he sent the email right? Unless the agency he CCed will be willing to act on my behalf too? Will they be legally required to?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the landlord has sent the notice by e\\-mail, and both you and the letting agent have received it, then that ought to be sufficient proof.\n\nIf you want to leave, and you are leaving when the fixed term ends, you can just leave without giving notice whatever the landlord does, though it's generally appreciated if you let the landlord know in advance anyway.\n\nIf you want to leave and you're on a rolling tenancy, then you can give a month's notice, and again it doesn't matter what the landlord does.\n\nIncidentally, the landlord doesn't need to lie about sending a section 21 notice, because if he changes his mind, he can rescind it (or equivalently, choose not to proceed with legal action before it expires).\n\n> we'll be able to sue him after we've left due to him not protecting our deposit in time\n\nThis introduces a twist. There are [a number of requirements](http://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/security_of_tenure/notices/notices_assured_shorthold_tenancies/restrictions_on_use_of_section_21) that the landlord must meet before he can issue a section 21 notice. In this case, if the landlord has not correctly protected the deposit and sent you the prescribed information within the required time period, **then any section 21 notice is not valid**.\n\nIn which case: if you want to leave, give notice (if required) as described above, and then leave.",

According to the documentation, there are several requirements that a landlord must meet before issuing a valid Section 21 notice. One of these requirements is the proper protection of the tenant's deposit within the specified timeframe. If the landlord has failed to correctly protect the deposit and provide the prescribed information to the tenant within the required period, any Section 21 notice issued is not valid, regardless of how it was delivered or whether the tenant acknowledged receipt. This highlights the importance of landlords fulfilling their legal obligations regarding deposit protection before attempting to end a tenancy through a Section 21 notice."

The legal counsel said he does not give consent or permission to be recorded and that slides cannot be copied. I'm not sure if it was for a legal reason or administrative one but meeting minutes were not recorded (some people were very upset by this).\n\nMy questions are\n\n1. Is it illegal to take notes of what a lawyer (or anyone else) is saying if they say that you can't? I think there might have been some confusion, just because no one was taking official minutes doesn't mean that people can't write their own notes.\n2. Is it illegal to record a meeting without consent or knowledge of the people involved? The lawyer said it's his firms policy and that the information could be detrimental to the union if it got into the wrong hands.\n3. Is it illegal to screen shot or photograph a slide from a presentation if the presenter said you can't?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Canadian Criminal Code \u00a7 181 ff](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-25.html#docCont) makes it illegal to \"intercept\" a private communication:\n\n> 184 (1\\) Every person who, by means of any electro\\-magnetic, acoustic,\n> mechanical or other device, knowingly intercepts a private\n> communication is guilty of (a) an indictable offence and liable to\n> imprisonment for a term of not more than five years; or (b) an offence\n> punishable on summary conviction.\n\nHowever,\n\n> 183\\.1 Where a private communication is originated by more than one person or is intended by the originator thereof to be received by more\n> than one person, a consent to the interception thereof by any one of\n> those persons is sufficient consent for the purposes of any provision\n> of this Part\n\nMoreover, \"intercept\"\n\n> includes listen to, record or acquire a communication or acquire the\n> substance, meaning or purport thereof;\n\nSo it's not even legal for you or anyone else to listen to this call without consent. Obviously to have consent to listen to the communication. As a party to the communication, you can give consent to yourself to record the communication. So it's not based on the law about secret recordings.\n\nThis does not preclude the possibility that there is a contractual basis for the lawyer's assertion, for example the firm's contract with the union might stipulate that you cannot record any communication with a member. There is no basis for the lawyer taking legal action against you, but he could take action against the union, or the union could take action against you (especially because of his action against the union). In that case, the question of whether it is \"legal\" depends on what you mean by \"is it legal\". It could be in violation of the terms of the contract, which is a standard sense in which an act is \"not legal\".",

However, there's an important exception: when a private communication involves multiple people, consent from any one of those individuals is sufficient for the purposes of the law. This means that if you are a participant in the call, you can give consent to yourself to record it, even if other participants object. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the exception allowing single-party consent. \nOption C is incorrect because while organizational policies may create contractual obligations, they don't override the legal provisions in the Criminal Code. \nOption D goes beyond what the law requires, as consent from all participants is not necessary under the described legal framework.\n\nIt's important to note that while this may be legally permissible, it could still violate contractual agreements or professional ethics in certain contexts."

It is also why, for example, most wine producers make many kinds of wine at different price thresholds even though economies of scale would make it more cost effective to produce just one of each kind of wine.\n\nCertainly, there is not an obligation for the price charged to be proportional to or reflect the costs of product a good or service, although there are certainly goods or services, like all you can eat buffets, or life insurance, where both cost and willingness and ability to pay are related to age.\n\nFor example, movie theaters and restaurants frequently have discounts for kids and seniors. The example you suggest is more extreme, but conceptually, really isn't any different.\n\nOn the other hand, some kinds of merchants, like utilities, typically have their prices comprehensively regulated and so can only do this with express government approval.\n\nIn the example you suggest, you'd expect it to be an attempt to capture the greater ability and/or willingness of older people than younger people to pay.\n\nLaw is very context specific and rarely follows strict general rules, so it is hard to answer this question accurately in the abstract. Even when there are regulations of age discrimination they tend to be very specific to particular industries and circumstances.",

While it may seem unfair, businesses are often allowed to charge different prices based on age, similar to senior discounts or student rates. This practice is considered a form of price discrimination in economics, where companies attempt to maximize profits by charging different prices to different demographic groups based on their perceived willingness or ability to pay. However, the legality can depend on the specific industry and any applicable regulations. Some sectors, like utilities, may have more stringent pricing rules. Without knowing the specific industry or any applicable regulations, this pricing structure is likely legal in most cases, even if the price differences are not directly tied to cost differences in serving different age groups."

Just like the military is a public institution but they don\u2019t let you walk across their shooting ranges.\n\nTo be clear, in the absence of clear \u201cno dogs allowed\u201d signage, you were not trespassing until you were told about the policy. At that point, you were legally obliged to remove yourself (or more precisely, your dog) from the campus as soon as possible. When you refused to do so, you became a trespasser.\n\nIt\u2019s trivially easy to find out who you are. One photograph, one [reverse image search](https://www.reverseimagesearch.com) they\u2019ll know everything about you right down to your shoe size. Even if you don\u2019t use social media, I\u2019m sure some of your family and friends do.\n\nIn most US states, trespass is a misdemeanour and also in most states members of the public can arrest someone who is committing a misdemeanour in their presence. They can use reasonable force to do so and can hold the arrestee until they can transfer them to the custody of a law enforcement officer. Admittedly, this seems unlikely but it is possible.\n\nIf you have caused damage, you can be sued. It seems that your discussion with the college staff was somewhat protected so the loss of productivity of those staff members is a loss that the college suffered and that they could sue you for. Again, not likely but possible.\n\nAlternatively, they could just report you to the police who may or may not bring charges.\n\nNote: this assumes the dog is a pet. If it\u2019s a disability assistance animal, it can\u2019t be excluded.\n\nSee:\n\n* [Are sidewalks on a university public or private property?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/9183)\n* [Can a local government charge a fee to enter a public downtown area during an event?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/48231)\n* [Trespassing or Public Property?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/5684)\n* [Is a mall considered a \"public place\" for copyright purposes?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/58557)",

Which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The student is correct; public institutions cannot restrict access or enforce policies on their property.\n\nB) The student is trespassing only if there are clearly visible \"No Dogs Allowed\" signs posted on campus.\n\nC) The student becomes a trespasser once informed of the policy and refuses to leave with their dog.\n\nD) The college has no recourse as they cannot identify the student or detain them until police arrive.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the community college is a public institution, it has the right to set and enforce policies on its property. The student was not initially trespassing due to the lack of posted signs. However, once informed of the policy prohibiting pets and asked to leave, the student's refusal to comply constitutes trespassing. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because public institutions can indeed restrict access and enforce policies on their property, similar to how military bases (also public institutions) can restrict access.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while visible signs would make the policy clearer, verbal notification of the policy is sufficient to establish trespassing if the person then refuses to comply.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the college does have recourse. They could potentially identify the student through various means (e.g., photographs and reverse image searches), and in many states, citizens can perform arrests for misdemeanors like trespassing. Additionally, the college could report the incident to the police or potentially pursue civil action for any damages or lost productivity."

Apparently, a law exists where a population of greater than 10,000 is required for competition to exist unless the city allows it. This potentially generates a need to keep a city from growing so it doesn't see competition in the money making municipal.\n\nThese cities usually boast a large mobile home population. I've heard a rumor that mobile home residents don't count in the city's population count for the census. Is that true? I can't find any documentation to support that.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Census Clause (Art. 1 Section 2\\) requires \"counting the whole number of persons in each State\", so they don't count houses, they count people. There is a perennial question about their methods of counting: they use a variety of methods. Ever since there has been a census, the law has them counting people in their usual residence, and the Census Bureau has a [page on residence criteria](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about/residence-rule.html). There are problems pertaining counting people without a fixed address, and this may be addressed by using [social\\-science technology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218229/#_ddd00159_) (i.e. estimating the number of homeless people based on interviews and visits to locations where the homeless might be). People living in mobile homes communities would be counted as much as anyone else is counted (they have a mailing address).\n\nThe [municipal liquor license law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/340A.601) allows a municipality a population of not more than 10,000 to have a municipal liquor store. That same law says \"A city which has established a municipal liquor store may continue to operate it notwithstanding a subsequent change in population\", and \"A city which established a liquor store prior to July 1, 1967, may continue to own and operate it\".

The statute came into existence in [1985](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/laws/1985/0/305/) (or earlier). The population might have been lower when the store was first opened, though it might be that the [population was 10,949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bemidji,_Minnesota#2010_census) in the relevant year. The law does not state what basis is to be used for this population qualification; it might be a [US Census estimate](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html).\n\nWhatever is going on, it is unlikely that this relates to mobile homes.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Minnesota, which of the following statements is true regarding municipal liquor stores and population counting?\n\nA) Cities with a population over 10,000 are required to have competing liquor stores and cannot operate a municipal liquor store.\n\nB) Mobile home residents are not counted in a city's population for the purpose of determining eligibility for a municipal liquor store.\n\nC) A city that established a municipal liquor store when its population was under 10,000 can continue to operate it even if the population subsequently exceeds 10,000.\n\nD) The U.S. Census counts houses rather than people when determining a city's population for liquor license regulations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct based on the information provided. The Minnesota statute states, \"A city which has established a municipal liquor store may continue to operate it notwithstanding a subsequent change in population.\" This means that even if a city's population grows beyond 10,000, it can still operate its municipal liquor store if it was established when the population was under 10,000.\n\nOption A is incorrect because cities over 10,000 are not required to have competing stores; they are simply allowed to have them.\n\nOption B is false. The Census counts all residents, including those in mobile homes. There's no evidence supporting the exclusion of mobile home residents from population counts.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The Census Clause requires counting the whole number of persons, not houses. The Census Bureau counts people at their usual residence, regardless of the type of housing."

If the part is not covered by a patent, are they in the clear? Or could some other type of IP right apply to, say, a bolt hole pattern?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright and trademark are limited by the [functionality doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionality_doctrine) which is the legal principle that denies trademark and copyright the ability to restrict the reproduction of purely functional features.\n\n17 U.S.C. \u00a7101 defines the notion of a \"useful article\":\n\n> A \"useful article\" is an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.\n\n17 U.S.C \u00a7103(b) limits the applicability of copyright on useful articles:\n\n> This title does not afford, to the owner of copyright in a work that portrays a useful article as such, any greater or lesser rights with respect to the making, distribution, or display of the useful article so portrayed than those afforded to such works under the law...\n\nIn other words, you cannot stop someone from making and distributing a useful article merely because you have previously expressed the useful article in a copyrighted work.\n\nFor trademark, the most significant court case is [*TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrafFix_Devices,_Inc._v._Marketing_Displays,_Inc.), which held that trademark cannot restrict distribution of functional components. The plaintiff in that case claimed that their product's spring mechanism was legally protected as a visually distinctive part of their product's trade dress, but the Supreme Court held that the spring mechanism was ineligible for trademark protection insofar as it was a functional component of the product.",

They claim this pattern is part of their brand identity and want to prevent other manufacturers from using it. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding AutoInnovate's ability to protect this bolt hole pattern?\n\nA) AutoInnovate can copyright the bolt hole pattern to prevent others from using it, as it's an original design created by their engineers.\n\nB) AutoInnovate can trademark the bolt hole pattern as part of their trade dress, effectively preventing competitors from using a similar pattern.\n\nC) AutoInnovate cannot protect the bolt hole pattern through copyright or trademark due to the functionality doctrine, but they may be able to patent it if it meets patentability criteria.\n\nD) AutoInnovate can protect the bolt hole pattern indefinitely through a combination of copyright and trademark laws, as it's a unique identifier of their brand.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The functionality doctrine limits the application of copyright and trademark protection to purely functional features. The bolt hole pattern, being a functional component of the engine, falls under this doctrine. Copyright protection is not applicable as per 17 U.S.C. \u00a7101 and \u00a7103(b), which exclude \"useful articles\" with intrinsic utilitarian functions from copyright protection. Trademark protection is also not applicable, as established in the TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc. case, which held that functional components cannot be protected by trademark. However, if the bolt hole pattern is novel, non-obvious, and useful, AutoInnovate may be able to seek patent protection, which is the appropriate form of intellectual property protection for functional innovations. Therefore, option C is the most accurate statement regarding AutoInnovate's ability to protect their bolt hole pattern."

Who\n> does this apply to? Or is this just some guideline or established\n> advice to avoid problems (which ones)?\n\n**Legal Ethics Considerations**\n\nThere are circumstances when commenting publicly on litigation violates the ethical rules for lawyers related to trial publicity *See* Rule of Professional Conduct 3\\.6 (the numbering system for professional conduct rules for lawyers is uniform nationally in the U.S. although the substance of the rules can differ in detail from state to state \\- [Colorado's rule](https://www.cobar.org/For-Members/Opinions-Rules-Statutes/Rules-of-Professional-Conduct/Rule-36-Trial-Publicity) is fairly typical). Mostly this rule calls for avoiding statements that could prejudice a jury unless the other side has already done so and those statements need to be rebutted. This rule states (in its Colorado version):\n\n> (a) A lawyer who is participating or has participated in the\n> investigation or litigation of a matter shall not make an\n> extrajudicial statement that the lawyer knows or reasonably should\n> know will be disseminated by means of public communication and will\n> have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an\n> adjudicative proceeding in the matter.\n> \n> \n> (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and Rule 3\\.8(f), a lawyer may state:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) the claim, offense or defense involved and, except when prohibited\n> by law, the identity of the persons involved;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) information contained in a public record;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) that an investigation of a matter is in progress;\n> \n> \n> (4\\) the scheduling or result of any step in litigation;\n> \n> \n> (5\\) a request for assistance in obtaining evidence and information\n> necessary thereto;\n> \n> \n> (6\\) a warning of danger concerning the behavior of a person involved,\n> when there is reason to believe that there exists the likelihood of\n> substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest; and\n> \n> \n> (7\\) in a criminal case, in addition to subparagraphs (1\\) through (6\\):\n> (i) the identity, residence, occupation and family status of the\n> accused; (ii) if the accused has not been apprehended, information\n> necessary to aid in apprehension of that person;(iii) the fact, time\n> and place of arrest; and (iv) the identity of investigating and\n> arresting officers or agencies and the length of the investigation.\n> \n> \n> (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and Rule 3\\.8(f), a lawyer may make a\n> statement that a reasonable lawyer would believe is required to\n> protect a client from the substantial undue prejudicial effect of\n> recent publicity not initiated by the lawyer or the lawyer's client. A\n> statement made pursuant to this paragraph shall be limited to such\n> information as is necessary to mitigate the recent adverse publicity.\n> \n> \n> (d) No lawyer associated in a firm or government agency with a lawyer\n> subject to paragraph (a) shall make a statement prohibited by\n> paragraph (a).\n\nStatements such as \"We believe we acted correctly, but this will be decided in court\" are allowed and are not terribly uncommon. But, making a comment about something that can be easily inferred from the publicly available documents filed in court provides little or no positive advantage for a litigant.\n\nAlso, one doesn't have to say much to create at least a colorable Rule of Professional Conduct 3\\.6 issue that a mediator can raise in settlement talks, or that a judge can be forced to analyze. Even if the claim of unethical trial publicity ultimately doesn't hold water, it still muddies the waters and distracts lawyers and litigants from dealing with the substance of the dispute.\n\n**The Risk That A Statement Will Be Used Against You**\n\nUsually, the main concern is similar to the concern about talking to police: Anything you say can and will be used against you at trial.\n\nFor example, this week former President Trump's [public statement about his knowledge of classified documents](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/31/politics/trump-tape-classified-document-iran-milley/index.html), which are the subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation of him, seriously harmed his position legally. (His statement was made quite a while ago in a semi\\-private forum, but at a time when the possibility of a criminal investigation still should have been on his radar screen.)\n\nIn the civil rape\\-defamation case against him (as noted, for example, in [this Law.SE answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/92362/9517)), Trump's decision to continue to speak publicly about matters that were the subject of active litigation against him in an earlier case resulted in an extended statute of limitations and an opportunity to refile the case without having to worry about Presidential immunity from liability for statements he made while in office.\n\nIt isn't just former President Trump that does things like this, but his conduct provides good textbook examples of what lawyers worry about when their clients talk about cases that are being litigated.\n\nSocial media statements about pending cases by litigants [routinely provide powerful evidence against them](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewarnold/2018/12/30/heres-how-social-media-can-be-used-against-you-in-court/?sh=38a9dd946344) in trials.\n\nSome clients (particularly politicians and many senior executives of big and medium sized businesses, but also more ordinary people with big egos) are \"forces of nature\" who can't resist running their mouths, usually to their detriment, when given the least leave to do so. It is easier to teach them to say \"no comment\" across the board about pending litigation, than to transmit the depth of understanding necessary to comment without saying something potentially harmful. Lawyers spend many hours and sometimes days preparing their clients for depositions for a reason.\n\n**Avoiding Annoyance To Opposing Counsel, Parties, And Judges**\n\nMaking a comment about pending litigation has the potential to aggravate opposing counsel and can emotionally influence non\\-lawyer opposing parties with whom a negotiated settlement will be reached 90%\\+ of the time (only about 1\\-2% of civil cases go to trial, but some are resolved by default judgments or on motion practice as opposed to by settlement).\n\nIt can also irritate a judge who frequently prefers to be out of the public spotlight when necessary, even when the statements made aren't prohibited, and judges in the U.S. have lots of discretionary authority.",

Which, at first glance, feels like a good argument; if you can demonstrate that a given algorithm, under a variety of different conditions over a period of months, has fewer accidents than a normal human then it makes sense to use that algorithm instead.\n\nHowever, the thing that gets completely glossed\\-over in that argument is the fact that there is a single point of failure in that entire system: effectively, all the cars are using the same driver. So, if the software is fine for a few months, everything's fine, but if the image recognition software performs very, very poorly on an overcast day and one day it's overcast, or if a software update is pushed out which contains a regression, suddenly millions of people all die in one day.\n\nIn other words, an AV won't necessarily improve statistics; it will simply change their distribution, because there's effectively one driver for all those cars. So, when that one driver has an off day, all the passengers have an off day.\n\nThis is effectively the same model the pharmaceutical industry has been dealing with for its entire history, and as a result some pretty solid testing guidelines exist to minimize risk; first the new drug / algorithm is tested for a while with a small group of volunteers in a double\\-blind fashion (such that everyone is told they're getting the new thing, when half of the group are not), then larger and larger groups are tested under more varied conditions to see whether uncommon but serious flaws emerge, and to determine whether the placebo is actually more helpful / less dangerous than the new treatment.\n\nIs there similar legislation in place to regulate these AVs' navigational software?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The federal guidelines (from NHTSA) are [here](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/AV%20policy%20guidance%20PDF.pdf): these are not currently hard regulations (but they aren't just talking points). Manufacturers must certify that their product complies with safety standards, which is true of brakes as well as self\\-driving systems. Federal vehicle safety regulations are generally framed in terms of a functional requirement, like \"doesn't, by design, crash\".\n\nThey list (p. 28\\) a set of specific things that an HAV should be able to do, such as \"merge onto the freeway\", \"deal with a roundabout\", taken from California, with a suggestion that this is a minimum set, to be expanded. The HAV guidelines indicate that the future regulations will have a very finely tuned set of designations ranging from zero to full vehicle intervention in the driving process, and requirements for recording and reporting all sorts of events of concern. The latter is important in establishing that some system (for whatever reason) is in fact unsafe. Regulation starts by articulating a desired end and a means of determining whether desires have been met, and later when there turns out to be a really big problem, Congress may decide to limit what manufacturers can do, e.g. they could pass a law forbidding the use of Windows ME as the OS underlying an HAV, which would authorize a specific regulation from NHTSA.",

According to the information provided, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has issued federal guidelines for autonomous vehicles. These guidelines are not currently hard regulations, but they do provide a framework for manufacturers to follow. Manufacturers must certify that their products comply with safety standards, including those related to self-driving systems.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while there are guidelines, they are not strict, legally binding regulations comparable to pharmaceutical trials. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because there are indeed guidelines in place, and manufacturers are not free to develop and deploy their technology without any oversight.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while states may have their own regulations, there is federal involvement through the NHTSA guidelines, and the federal government plays a role in setting safety standards for vehicles.\n\nThe guidelines include specific capabilities that AVs should have, requirements for recording and reporting events of concern, and a system for classifying levels of vehicle automation. This approach allows for flexibility as the technology develops while still providing a framework for safety and accountability."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From everything I've seen online, it seems not, but I've heard a few credible individuals claim that they are allowed to do that. I think there must be some kernel of truth in it, or I wouldn't have heard multiple credible people say that.\n\nIf it's never legally permitted for a landlord to do this in the UK, was it ever? When did it stop being the case? If it is allowed, what circumstances is it allowed under?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ultimately *yes*, this can and does happen, but there are a few steps necessary before the bailiffs come to your door.\n\nIn times gone by, the common law recognized a right to \"distrain for rent\", meaning that a landlord could come round to the tenant and seize some property as security (up to the value of the rent owed). If the rent is not then paid within a certain time, the goods could be sold. Various additional provisions of law covered the circumstances around forcing entry, breaking open locked cupboards, and searching *off* the premises for goods which the tenant had concealed. There were also special\\-case rules about what could be seized, such as a statute of the seventeenth century saying (among other things) that landlords could not harvest growing crops, but could take already\\-cut sheaves.\n\nSubsequent reforms for the protection of tenants have made it so that landlords cannot do this at their whim. They first have to go to the County Court for a judgement that there is an unpaid debt. (In fact, this and subsequent steps can happen with any debt.) On that basis, they can apply for a \"warrant of control\", under which an \"enforcement officer\", commonly called a bailiff, will take charge of collecting the money owed. There are quite a few steps and rules here, but the basic position is the same in terms of being able to take your stuff. And it is not the landlord walking around making those decisions, but a court\\-appointed officer.\n\nThe previous common\\-law \"distress\" process is now totally abolished, for most tenants by the Housing Act 1988, and for everybody in 2014, because of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 section 71, which simply states\n\n> The common law right to distrain for arrears of rent is abolished.\n\nCommercial property has its own legal regime since that Act, but previously functioned in the same way.\n\nSo landlords can no longer seize your property on their own, but they can go through a few hoops and ask a court to do it. They also do not get to keep the specific property, but just get the money. As mentioned above, this is the general avenue for what happens when a court orders you to pay money, and you don't do it. The High Court has its own enforcement officers who are able to deal with larger amounts of money, as well as enforcing evictions.\n\nIn Scotland, the same basic pattern applies but different words are used, and some of the detailed rules are different. \"Attachment\" is when a sheriff officer (\\= a bailiff) comes round to value your possessions and auction them off if you don't pay. There is also \"arrestment\" which is taking money out of your bank account.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK, which of the following statements accurately describes the current legal situation regarding a landlord's ability to seize a tenant's property for unpaid rent?\n\nA) Landlords can directly seize tenant property at their discretion, as per the common law right to \"distrain for rent\"\nB) Landlords cannot seize tenant property under any circumstances\nC) Landlords can seize tenant property, but only after obtaining a court judgment and warrant of control, which is then executed by an enforcement officer\nD) Landlords can seize tenant property without a court order, but only if the lease agreement explicitly allows it\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The common law right to \"distrain for rent\" has been abolished in the UK. Currently, landlords cannot directly seize a tenant's property for unpaid rent. However, they can pursue legal action through the court system. If they obtain a court judgment confirming the unpaid debt, they can then apply for a warrant of control. This warrant allows an enforcement officer (bailiff) to seize and potentially sell the tenant's property to recover the debt. This process involves several legal steps and is carried out by court-appointed officers, not the landlord themselves. Options A and D are incorrect because landlords no longer have the right to directly seize property. Option B is too absolute, as seizure can occur through the legal process described."

In the regulations the mere appearance of conflict of interest is ground for recusal (\"the employee should not participate in the matter\"), but allows an \"agency designee\" to waive this.\n\nMy impression is that 2635\\.502 doesn't apply to a US vice\\-president because he is not an employee but an officer whereas 18 USC \u00a7 209 clearly applies to both officers and employees (both categories are mentioned in the latter, only employees in the former). As for why there would be such a discrepancy, i.e. a lower conflict\\-of\\-interest standard for the officers, there's parallel with the recusal of supreme justices, [who aren't](https://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3585&context=hastings_law_journal) held to the higher recusal standard of [28 USC 455](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/455) presumably because the supreme justices are aren't as easily replaceable \\[on a case] as lower\\-level federal judges.\n\nIs this reasoning correct, basically, i.e. does 5 CFR \u00a72635\\.502 not apply to a US vice\\-president?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [5 CFR 2635\\.102](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=fa7cc6c3ebd20830fd4ab50971ae85bc&mc=true&n=pt5.3.2635&r=PART&ty=HTML#se5.3.2635_1102) provides definitions for 5 CFR Part 2635 (which contains 5 CFR 2635\\.502\\). \n\n> (h) Employee means any officer or employee of an agency, including a\n>  special Government employee. It includes officers but not enlisted\n>  members of the uniformed services. It includes employees of a State or\n>  local government or other organization who are serving on detail to an\n>  agency, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3371, et seq. **For purposes other than\n>  subparts B and C of this part, it does not include the President or\n>  Vice President**. Status as an employee is unaffected by pay or leave\n>  status or, in the case of a special Government employee, by the fact\n>  that the individual does not perform official duties on a given day.\n\nSubparts B \\& C pertain to gifts and range from \n\u00a72635\\.201\\-304, whereas the section you are asking about is in Subpart E. So \u00a72635\\.502 expressly does not apply to the VP.\n\nThe \"why\" part is more challenging. The statutory authority invoked for these regulations is [5 USC 7301](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7301), [7351](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7351), [7353](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7353), [5 USC App](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5a/compiledact-95-521), acts passed by Congress. The rule\\-making rationale is in \n[57 FR 35042](https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Federal%20Register%20Issuances/50D0CABACE039FB885257E96006A91FE/$FILE/eee0a4898a5345a7b972ae4e7bd559e611.pdf?open), which does not overtly invoke any specific statutory authority for this specific item. In contrast, Subpart B is the implementation of \n5 USC \u00a77353, which governs gifts to federal employees, and (d)(2\\) of that section says\n\n> the term \"officer or employee\" means an individual holding an\n>  appointive or elective position in the executive, legislative, or\n>  judicial branch of Government, other than a Member of Congress.\n\nIn other words, the mixed definition of \"employee\" (the VP is an employee only for subparts B, C) under the regulations is because Congress passed some laws that included the VP, but did not pass a law that required non\\-appearance of conflict. Such a regulation would be within the authority given the president in 5 USC 7301, which simply says that \"The President may prescribe regulations for the conduct of employees in the executive branch\". Since there is no Congressional authority to subject the VP to 5 CFR 2635\\.502, it is written to exclude that person (also the president).",

Dec. 20, 2021\\)) or certain provisions of the [Fair Credit Reporting Act](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act) applies, sometimes but not always, with a statutory remedy as a substitute for common law liability).\n\nDefeating a defamation lawsuit isn't always what it's cracked up to be for a defendant. For example, the Better Business Bureau recently prevailed in defamation lawsuit only after seven years of litigation (an outcome that suggests that a case that can survive an early dismissal may have significant settlement value). *A Better Way Wholesale Autos, Inc. v. Better Business Bureau of Connecticut*, 2021 WL 5112673 (Conn. Superior Ct.

Miami Bus. L. Rev. 434 (2019\\).\n\nOne has to show particularized injury from a violation to state a claim, however, including claims under the statutory remedy that purports to give standing to anyone whose information is inaccurate. *See [Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/13-1339dif_3m92.pdf)* (U.S. 2016\\) and *[TransUnion, LLC v.

The *TransUnion* case essentially added a constitutional standing component to the publication and damages elements that would apply in a defamation action in the context of a statutory claim under the Fair Credit Reporting Act that doesn't expressly require either of these elements.\n\nMany of the legal issues, however, are [unsettled questions of first impression](https://www.futureoftech.org/big-data/5-privacy-security-liability/).\n\n[european\\-union](/questions/tagged/european-union \"show questions tagged 'european-union'\")\n\nA survey of the issues in an E.U. context can be found at Thomas Hoeren, \"Big data and the legal framework for data quality\" International 25(1\\) Journal of Law and Information Technology 26\\-37 (January 8, 2017\\).

Which is hard living 10000km away!\n\nIs the physical court apearance a must, could it be virtual/teleconf?\n\nThanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Realistically, if your lawsuit is with the person who has been acting as your agent in the United States, small claims court is probably not the right way to go.\n\nIf you are owed less than $10,000 (possibly including attorney fees), you probably need to hire a lawyer to pursue your case in the non\\-Small Claims Magistrate Division of the District Court. Lawyers are allowed in this forum, unlike the Small Claims division which is oriented towards *pro se* parties (i.e. people without lawyers). Small claims can consider only claims up to $4,000 against defendants in the county where the lawsuit is brought, and attorneys are now allowed in small claims court. ([Source](https://isc.idaho.gov/overview.pdf))\n\nEven if you can be in the Small Claims division of Magistrate's Court, the enforcement of a judgment if you win requires technical court documents which are essentially the same as those for collecting a judgment from any other court.\n\nEven when Zoom participation is allowed in a court, usually the main trial can't be conducted entirely remotely so someone needs to be in the courtroom representing you for the trial. (The only U.S. state where there is an actual right to participate in a civil court trial remotely is Alaska.)\n\nA lawyer will also often be more effective at negotiating a settlement, with or without a mediator, which would avoid the need for a trial at all, and mediations these days since COVID are routinely conducted remotely. Mediation is often required before a case goes to trial.\n\nIf you are owed more than $10,000, you probably need to hire a lawyer to pursue your case in District Court (outside the Magistrate's Division). ([Source](https://isc.idaho.gov/overview.pdf))\n\nIt is also possible in District Court (not the Magistrate's division) in some cases to resolve the case in \"motion practice\" based upon submitted papers, rather than in a hearing. This is not really a possibility in the Small Claims Court or the Magistrate's Division.\n\nAlso, to be perfectly honest, the kind of case you describe is probably beyond the capacity of even a college educated person without legal training to do right and not screw up.\n\nHandling issues like service of process, the rules of evidence, and the collection of a judgment are all highly technical matters, and there may be legal claims related to possible misappropriation of funds that you might not know how to raise. Depending upon the language of your contract, the other side may even be able to demand a jury trial which is far beyond the capacity of an unrepresented person to manage, even if they are only doing it to force you to hire a lawyer. It could also be necessary to use the \"discovery\" process or subpoenas to obtain records needed to prove the case.\n\nFor what it is worth, Idaho lawyers are less expensive than lawyers in much of the U.S., and Idaho is not known for having overcrowded courts the greatly delayed schedules, however.",

The documentation suggests that for amounts less than $10,000, hiring a lawyer to pursue the case in the non-Small Claims Magistrate Division of the District Court is likely the best option. This is because:\n\n1. Small claims court has a limit of $4,000 and doesn't allow attorneys, which may be disadvantageous for a complex case involving an international property owner.\n2. The Magistrate Division allows claims up to $10,000 and permits lawyers, which is beneficial for handling technical aspects of the case.\n3. Remote participation is not guaranteed, and even when allowed, it's usually not for the entire trial.\n4. A lawyer can better handle issues like service of process, rules of evidence, and potential settlement negotiations.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect as they misrepresent the small claims limits, the ease of self-representation, and the ability to participate remotely in Idaho courts for this type of case."

I am an immediate relative to a U.S. Citizen.\n\nI will graduate soon in about 3 months and my question is if I don't get a job after graduation and I don't have my I\\-130 approved by then, do I need to leave the country?\n\nIn general what will be the situation for me after graduation? Do I have to remain on F\\-1 visa somehow (or get a job) as long as I am waiting for approval of I\\-130 or I\\-485?\n\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I will address 3 issues: 1\\) whether going out of status will affect your pending I\\-485 application, 2\\) whether you accrue unlawful presence if you go out of status while I\\-485 is pending, and 3\\) whether you are deportable if you go out of status while I\\-485 is pending.\n\nIn most categories, in order to be eligible for Adjustment of Status (I\\-485\\), you need to be in status at the time of filing I\\-485 (see [USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 7, Part B, Chapter 3](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-3)), and have never been out of status in the past (see [USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 7, Part B, Chapter 4](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-4)). Even for those restrictions, however, going out of status after the I\\-485 is filed will not by itself affect the I\\-485\\. See [USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 7, Part B, Chapter 4, section G](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-4#S-G):\n\n> For purposes of the bars to adjustment, a nonimmigrant only needs to\n> maintain his or her nonimmigrant status until the time he or she\n> properly files an adjustment application with USCIS so long as the\n> nonimmigrant does not engage in any unauthorized employment after\n> filing the adjustment application.\n\nYou may have noticed if you went to the above pages, that those bars to adjustment do not apply to \"immediate relatives\". You are in the Immediate Relative category (spouse, parent, or unmarried under\\-21 child of US citizen), and you thus don't even need to be in status at the time of filing I\\-485\\. In other words, you could have stopped going to school years ago, and still be eligible to file I\\-130 and I\\-485 now. This is summarized in [USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 7, Part B, Chapter 8, section B](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-8#S-B):\n\n> Certain adjustment bars do not apply to an immediate relative,\n> including the spouse or child (unmarried and under 21 years old) of a\n> U.S. citizen, and the parent of a U.S. citizen older than 21\\.\n> \n> \n> An adjustment applicant applying as an immediate relative may be\n> eligible to adjust status even if:\n> \n> \n> * The applicant is now employed or has ever been employed in the United States without authorization;\n> * The applicant is not in lawful immigration status on the date he or she files the adjustment application;\n> * The applicant has ever failed to continuously maintain a lawful status since entry into the United States;\n> * The applicant was last admitted to Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) as a visitor under the Guam or CNMI\n> Visa Waiver Program and is not a Canadian citizen;\n> * The applicant was last admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor without a visa under the Visa Waiver Program; or\n> * The applicant has ever violated the terms of his or her nonimmigrant status.\n\nYou do not accrue \"unlawful presence\" while your Adjustment of Status (I\\-485\\) application is pending. So even if your I\\-485 is denied or abandoned, you would not have accrued \"unlawful presence\" for the purposes of determining whether you trigger a 3/10\\-year ban if you leave the US. (Although in your case it doesn't make a difference anyway, since F1 students are admitted with \"D/S\" on their I\\-94s, so do not automatically start accruing unlawful presence absent an application denial or immigration court decision.) See USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual chapter 40\\.9\\.2(b)(3\\)(A) (on page 85 of [this PDF](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/policy-manual-afm/afm40-external.pdf)):\n\n> (3\\) Aliens Present in Unlawful Status Who Do not Accrue Unlawful\n> Presence by Virtue of USCIS Policy for Purposes of Sections\n> 212(a)(9\\)(B) and (C)(i)(I) of the Act\n> \n> \n> (A) Aliens with Properly Filed Pending Applications for Adjustment of\n> Status or Registry ( Sections 209 , 245 , and 245(i) of the Act,\n> sections 202 of P ublic Law 99\\-603 (Cuban\\-Haitian Adjustment), section\n> 202(b) of NACARA, section 902 of HRIFA, and aliens with properly\n> filed, pending Registry applications under section 249 of the Act)\n> Accrual of unlawful presence stops on the date the application is\n> properly filed pursuant to 8 CFR 103 and the regulatory filing\n> requirements governing the particular type of benefit sought.

The accrual of unlawful presence is\n> tolled until the application is denied.\n\nAs for whether you are deportable, it is generally said that people are not deportable just for being out of status while they have a pending Adjustment of Status application. However, I can't find this written anywhere in any statute or official rule, manual, or webpage. I believe it is a de facto policy that is followed in practice, but ICE always theoretically has the power to initiate deportation proceedings against you. However, Adjustment of Status is a defense in removal proceedings. So, in the highly unlikely case that you are put into removal proceedings, you can simply file a new Adjustment of Status application with the immigration judge, or continue your previously\\-filed\\-with\\-USCIS Adjustment of Status application with the immigration judge. The immigration judge has the power to adjudicate and, if warranted, approve your Adjustment of Status and close the removal proceedings. Alternately, the immigration judge can close the removal proceedings to let you file Adjustment of Status with USCIS again.",

As an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen with a pending I-485 (Adjustment of Status) application, the student can remain in the U.S. even if they go out of F-1 status after graduation. The documentation states that for immediate relatives, being out of status does not affect I-485 eligibility. Additionally, the student does not accrue unlawful presence while the I-485 is pending, and they are generally not considered deportable during this time. Options A and D are incorrect because the student is not required to leave the country or maintain F-1 status through OPT. Option B is incorrect because unlawful presence is not accrued while the I-485 is pending."

Olech* 528 U.S. 562 (2000\\) (The Equal Protection Clause gives rise to a cause of action on behalf of a \"class of one\" when the plaintiff does not allege membership in a class or group, but alleges that they have been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for such treatment.)\n\nThe typical \"group of one\" equal protection clause case involves a local government enforcing a zombie law against someone that a local official has a grudge against for some unrelated reason like the regulatory target's son being unfaithful to the local regulator's daughter.",

Regulatory agencies have no legally enforceable duty to enforce laws equally against all potential violators. To prove selective prosecution, PharmaCorp would need to show it was singled out based on impermissible considerations like race or religion, which is a very high bar to meet.

The man promptly lodges an application for an emergency injunction against the local/state animal control services, seeking to prohibit the confiscation and destruction of his dogs.\n\nPrior to this application being heard by a judge, an animal control officer arrives at the property and is then shot dead. During the ensuing police standoff, the man declares that he was acting in self defence, that he will peacefully surrender if the emergency injunction he applied for is approved and a copy of the approval is delivered to him by his lawyer, and that he is willing to die fighting to protect his dogs. In the interests of preventing unnecessary bloodshed, the judge approves the injunction, and the man does surrender peacefully.\n\nAt the resulting trial, he advances the following arguments:\n\n1. Any intruder on his property has unknown intentions, and must be assumed to be there to murder him and his family. If he had been present, the initial intruder would have been shot dead by the man, and it would have been self\\-defense. As such, the intruder being killed by his dogs was self\\-defense \\- the dogs were simply the weapon he used to defend the lives of his family, no different than an autonomous killer drone.\n2. The dogs should not be destroyed because they were acting in accordance with their training to defend the property from intruders, and once you cross the property line, you have forfeited your right to continue living \\- and they pose no additional danger to the community beyond that he himself does.\n3. The animal control officer was there to kill his dogs. His dogs were members of his family, and he was acting in self\\-defense to protect the lives of his family.\n4. Even if that argument doesn't fly, he was still acting to defend his property (his dogs), so it was still self\\-defense.\n5. Once the threat to the lives of members of his family (and/or property) was averted, he peacefully surrendered.\n\nWhat would likely result at trial? Would he be able to successfully argue self\\-defense? Would he be able to save the life of his dogs?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. That is not a valid assumption. Many states have laws that let you presume someone is a threat to your life if they *forcibly* enter your *house*. Simple trespass on your land does not let you reasonably presume someone is a murderer. An autonomous killer drone is not a comparison you want to make: those may be illegal entirely, and are likely to seriously hurt any claim of justifiable force.\n2. \u201cYou forfeit your right to live when you set foot on my property\u201d is not justifiable. If the dogs are trained to be a hazard to the community, that\u2019s an argument *in favor* of having them confiscated and destroyed.\n3. Dogs are not people. Under normal circumstances, they cannot be protected under self\\-defense or the defense of others. Those doctrines only apply when a *person* is in danger.\n4. Deadly force is sometimes allowed to protect property, but this tends to be strictly limited. To start with, you can only ever use force to prevent *illegal* damage to property. If your concern is \u201cthis animal control officer will destroy my dogs within the scope of their duty,\u201d that\u2019s not protecting against an illegal use of force. Deadly force in defense of property is also normally limited to particular crimes that are inherently dangerous, like arson, robbery, or burglary. Even in Texas, simple theft only justifies deadly force during the nighttime. Deadly force is also not justifiable if there were reasonable other options. Shooting an animal control officer is unlikely to be the only way to temporarily stop them from destroying a dog.\n5. Threatening violence in order to influence a judge\u2019s decision is *terrorism*. This hypothetical man is a terrorist. He may well find himself on death row for murder, but he\u2019s also going to face separate charges for terrorism.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a condominium complex in California, resident Alice plants a lemon tree in the common courtyard with the approval of the HOA. Resident Bob picks lemons from the tree without asking. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal ownership and rights to the fruit?\n\nA) Bob has the right to pick the lemons as they are in a common area, making them equally accessible to all residents.\n\nB) Alice owns the lemons exclusively because she planted and maintains the tree, regardless of its location.\n\nC) The HOA owns the lemons and has the sole right to determine their distribution among residents.\n\nD) The lemons legally belong to all property owners in the complex collectively, and individual picking without consensus may not be permitted.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. In California, fruit from a tree planted in a common area of a condominium complex would legally belong to all property owners collectively. This is because the common areas are owned jointly by all unit owners as tenants-in-common. \n\nOption A is incorrect because although the tree is in a common area, this doesn't automatically grant individual picking rights to residents. \n\nOption B is wrong because planting and maintaining the tree doesn't override the collective ownership of the common area and its fruits. \n\nOption C is partially correct in that the HOA might have the authority to manage common areas, but it doesn't exclusively own the fruits - the owners do collectively. \n\nOption D correctly reflects that the fruits are collectively owned, and therefore, individual picking without agreed-upon rules or consensus could be problematic. This answer best captures the complexity of shared ownership in common areas of residential complexes."

As I understand it, first Amendment protects unpopular speech, but is confined and not unlimited. The classic example is that one can not yell \"fire\" in a crowded movie theatre and incite a panicked exodus.\n\nI imagine free speech as a box: if the speech is within the box the content is protected by the first amendment. Using the box analogy, Why is the Gillars radio broadcast not protected under the first amendment? How exactly did the Gillars broadcast \"cross the line\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It might be more helpful to reverse the analogy.\n\nUnprotected speech is a box, and everything that doesn't fit inside the box is free speech.\n\nThe box is small and strangely shaped, and therefore, very few things will fit inside. The government has spent centuries trying to cram things into it, so we have a pretty good idea of what fits and what doesn't:\n\n> Content\\-based restrictions on speech have been permitted, as a general matter, only when confined to the few historic and traditional categories of expression long familiar to the bar. Among these categories are:\n> \n> \n> * advocacy intended, and likely, to incite imminent lawless action, see [*Brandenburg v. Ohio*, 395 U.S. 444 (1969\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/395/444);\n> * obscenity, see, e.g., [*Miller v. California*, 413 U.S. 15 (1973\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/413/15);\n> * defamation, see, e.g., [*New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*, 376 U.S. 254 (1964\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/376/254); [*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.*, 418 U.S. 323 (1974\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/323);\n> * speech integral to criminal conduct, see, e.g., [*Giboney v. Empire Storage \\& Ice Co.*, 336 U.S. 490 (1949\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/336/490);\n> * so\\-called \u201cfighting words,\u201d see [*Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire*, 315 U.S. 568 (1942\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/315/568);\n> * child pornography, see [*New York v. Ferber*, 458 U.S. 747 (1982\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/458/747);\n> * fraud, see [*Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.*, 425 U.S. 748 (1976\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/425/748);\n> * true threats, see [*Watts v. United States*, 394 U.S. 705 (1969\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/394/705); and\n> * speech presenting some grave and imminent threat the government has the power to prevent, see [*Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson*, 283 U.S. 697 (1931\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/283/697), although a restriction under the last category is most difficult to sustain, see [*New York Times Co. v. United States*, 403 U.S. 713 (1971\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/713).\n> \n> \n> These categories have a historical foundation in the Court's free speech tradition. The vast realm of free speech and thought always protected in our tradition can still thrive, and even be furthered, by adherence to those categories and rules.\n\n[*United States v. Alvarez*, 567 U.S. 709, 717\u201318 (2012\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-210).\n\nAlthough I don't know that I've ever seen the Supreme Court acknowledge it explicitly, one of the common threads you'll see in most of these categories is that First Amendment protection begins to weaken when words are spoken with some kind of ill intent and are likely to cause some kind of societal harm.\n\nSo the Gillars case falls into the \"speech integral to criminal conduct\" category. She appealed her conviction on First Amendment grounds, but the D.C. Circuit affirmed. Although the First Amendment would protect someone who hated the American government and went on the radio to denounce the American government, it does not protect those who commit the act of treason, even if speech is their weapon:\n\n> There is no question in our mind that words may be an integral part of the commission of the crime if the elements which constitute treason are present; that is, if there is adherence to and the giving of aid and comfort to the enemy by an overt act proved by two witnesses, with intention to betray, though the overt act be committed through speech. ...\n> \n> \n> While the crime is not committed by mere expressions of opinion or criticism, words spoken as part of a program of propaganda warefare, in the course of employment by the enemy in its conduct of war against the United States, to which the accused owes allegiance, may be an integral part of the crime. There is evidence in this case of a course of conduct on behalf of the enemy in the prosecution of its war against the United States. The use of speech to this end, as the evidence permitted the jury to believe, made acts of words. The First Amendment does not protect one from accountability for words as such.\n\n[*Gillars v. United States*, 182 F.2d 962, 971 (D.C. Cir. 1950\\)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=92849302602115676).\n\nThis is probably one of the least\\-developed exceptions to First Amendment protection, and therefore one of the hardest to understand. For a deep dive, I'd recommend [*Eugene Volokh*, The \"Speech Integral to Criminal Conduct\" Exception, 101 Cornell L. Rev. 981 (2016\\)](https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4699&context=clr).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes why Mildred Gillars' radio broadcasts during World War II were not protected under the First Amendment?\n\nA) Her speech was considered obscene and therefore not protected.\nB) Her broadcasts were classified as \"fighting words\" and thus exempt from First Amendment protection.\nC) Her speech was integral to the criminal conduct of treason, falling outside First Amendment protection.\nD) The First Amendment does not apply to speech made outside of the United States.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Mildred Gillars' radio broadcasts were considered an integral part of the crime of treason, which is why they were not protected under the First Amendment. The D.C. Circuit Court affirmed her conviction, stating that while mere expressions of opinion or criticism are protected, words spoken as part of propaganda warfare in service of an enemy during wartime can constitute an overt act of treason. This falls under the \"speech integral to criminal conduct\" exception to First Amendment protection.\n\nOption A is incorrect because obscenity was not the issue in Gillars' case. Option B is wrong because \"fighting words\" typically refer to face-to-face confrontations likely to provoke immediate violence, which doesn't apply to radio broadcasts. Option D is incorrect because the First Amendment can still apply to speech by U.S. citizens abroad, especially when it relates to U.S. interests."

These are an administrative subpoena, without prior approval from a judge, for meta\\-information (e.g. phone numbers dialed or email recipients addressed but not the content) of communications relevant to national security investigations. They typically contain a non\\-disclosure requirement prohibiting the recipient of the NSL from disclosing its existence or the FBI's demands. There have been challenges on First Amendment grounds to the non\\-disclosure aspect but, so far as I'm aware, they have all ultimately failed. Some of their non\\-disclosure requirements may eventually expire under other laws.\n\nIn response, so\\-called 'warrant canaries' ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary)) have been developed (and gone a bit further than [the original idea](https://web.archive.org/web/20131103121048/http:/groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/cypherpunks-lne-archive/conversations/topics/5869)) \\- these are intended to allow entities to relatively passively warn of such an order having been received if not the detail of the order. However, they can be legally risky in that they might be seen by a court as trying to circumvent the non\\-disclosure requirement and therefore breaking it.",
