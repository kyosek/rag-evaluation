For instance, Michigan [MCL 600\\.2591(3\\)(a)(i)](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(akz3lpegavk5uois3fnkkyek))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-600-2591) awards attorney fees and other costs to the prevailing party if the primary purpose in the lawsuit is \"*to harass, embarass, or injure that prevailing party*\".

Instead, Acme is trying to obtain a very different benefit: Joe's silence. As such, Joe is entitled to refuse Acme's bid for non\\-disclosure, and commence proceedings in court. If Acme removed from its settlement offer the condition of Joe's non\\-disclosure, Acme would have more merit in arguing that Joe's lawsuit was frivolous.\n\nLastly, to clarify concepts, the *veracity* of Joe's claim implies that he is not *defaming* Acme. And even if Joe's claim were knowingly false, his judicial proceedings in and of themselves cannot lead to a viable defamation lawsuit because judicial proceedings are (unfortunately) protected by *absolute privilege*."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Joe is suing Acme Corp for $1000 in damages.

The documentation states that Joe is entitled to refuse Acme's settlement offer, especially since it includes a non-disclosure agreement, which is a benefit to Acme beyond simply compensating Joe for damages.

I think that the key word that confuses me is \"void\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is more of an English language issue than a legal one. Your problem is that you are reading these conditional parts of the statement independently of the actionable parts. To your credit, though, the clause is not especially well\\-written.\n\n> Regarding the 1st highlighted part. Does it basically give the parties the \"optionality\" of later changing their minds with regard to the fairness and reasonableness of the restrictions laid out in section 13?\n\nNo. When a part or whole of a contract is found to be void, it means that the clauses in the contract have been contested in a court of law, and the court has found those clauses to be contrary to the law and that the parties will be restored as if the contract or clauses had never existed. Note that something being void is legally distinct from it being unenforceable, which means that the clauses will be considered to have existed, but that the courts will not provide a remedy for their violation. That decision will be made by the judge who oversees the proceedings, not by the parties to the contract.\n\n> Regarding the 2nd highlighted part. I simply cannot understand it. Could someone translate it in plain English, please?\n\nThe part that you emphasized needs to be read in the context of the whole second half of the clause, like this:\n\n> and **if** by deleting part of the wording or substituting a shorter period of time, different limits and/or a more restricted range of activities than those set out in this clause 13 it will not be void, **then** such restrictions will apply with such deletions or modifications as may be necessary to make them valid and effective.\n\nThe phrase beginning with \"if\" is conditional, meaning that the conditions specified, that being the existence of different restrictions which would not be void under the law, must be present in order for the second phrase, beginning with \"then\" to take effect. This second phrase would mean that the contract would then change to include restrictions that did not make the clauses void.\n\nThe clause could be written in plain English like this:\n\n> If the clauses in this contract are found to be void, and if the terms of those clauses can be changed so that they are no longer void, then they will be changed so that the clauses are no longer void.\n\nTake note that this clause would probably not be enforceable anyway, due to the fact that it would (1\\) force the courts to define the new terms and decide that they are fair, a decision which, even if you could force the court to do that (and you can't), can always be appealed to the next highest court up to the Supreme Court, potentially taking years of work and massive expense, and (2\\) you would be agreeing to a change in contract, the terms of which are completely unknowable to you, so how could you consent to them?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of a service agreement clause regarding post-termination restrictions, what is the primary purpose of including language about \"void\" clauses and potential modifications?\n\nA) To give parties the option to change their minds about the fairness of restrictions at a later date\nB) To ensure that if part of the clause is found void, the entire agreement becomes unenforceable\nC) To allow for automatic renegotiation of terms without court involvement\nD) To attempt to salvage restrictions by allowing for potential modifications if found overly broad\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The primary purpose of such language is to attempt to salvage post-termination restrictions if they are found to be overly broad or unreasonable by a court. This is known as a \"severability\" or \"blue pencil\" clause. It aims to preserve the intent of the restrictions by allowing for potential modifications (such as shortening time periods or narrowing the scope of activities) rather than having the entire set of restrictions invalidated if found to be excessive.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the clause does not allow parties to unilaterally change their minds; any determination of \"void\" clauses would be made by a court.\n\nOption B is the opposite of the clause's intent, which is to try to keep parts of the restrictions enforceable even if other parts are found void.\n\nOption C is incorrect because any modifications would typically require court involvement or agreement between the parties; the clause doesn't allow for automatic renegotiation.\n\nD is correct as it accurately describes the main purpose of including such language in the agreement."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53456/is-there-any-principle-of-contract-law-regarding-failure-to-take-a-step-towards", "docs_id": 53456, "title": "Is there any principle of contract law regarding failure to take a step towards fulfilling a contract?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For instance, an offer letter is sent to the successful bidder of a government contract, in which it is stipulated that that they desposit 50% of the premium/bid prior to XX/XX/2020\\.

This could potentially be a repudiatory breach allowing the government body to choose to end the contract if they wanted (by \"withdrawing\").

The bidder's acceptance created a binding contract, with the promise to pay serving as consideration. The failure to pay does not negate the contract's existence but likely constitutes a breach. This breach may allow the government to terminate the contract, depending on the specific terms and whether the breach is considered repudiatory. Options A and C are incorrect because acceptance and consideration were established through the bidder's communication and promise to pay, respectively. Option B is incorrect because the government's withdrawal, given the bidder's failure to pay, is more likely a response to a breach rather than a breach itself."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/898/can-you-get-a-restraining-order-without-cause", "docs_id": 898, "title": "Can you get a restraining order without cause?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Do you have to have some type of justified reason to get a restraining order?

The \"electoral voting\" law regarding voting of presidential electors is [ARS 16\\-212](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/16/00212.htm). First,\n\n> On the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, 1956, and\n> quadrennially thereafter, there shall be elected a number of\n> presidential electors equal to the number of United States senators\n> and representatives in Congress from this state.\n\nSecond,\n\n> After the secretary of state issues the statewide canvass containing\n> the results of a presidential election, the presidential electors of\n> this state shall cast their electoral college votes for the candidate\n> for president and the candidate for vice president who jointly\n> received the highest number of votes in this state as prescribed in\n> the canvass.\n\nFinally,\n\n> A presidential elector who knowingly refuses to cast that elector's\n> electoral college vote as prescribed in subsection B of this section\n> is no longer eligible to hold the office of presidential elector and\n> that office is deemed and declared vacant by operation of law. The\n> chairperson of the state committee of the political party represented\n> by that elector shall appoint a person who is otherwise qualified to\n> be a presidential elector.

Notwithstanding section [16\\-344](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/16/00344.htm) and any other statute, the\n> nomination paper and affidavit of qualification of the replacement\n> presidential elector may be completed and filed with the secretary of\n> state as soon as is practicable after the presidential elector's\n> appointment.\n\nThere is no provision for legislative \"certification\" and no authority to override the procedure set down in law.\nThe appointment statute (344\\) gives sole discretion to the state party chairmen to appoint that party's electors:\n\n> The chairman of the state committee of a political party that is\n> qualified for representation on an official party ballot at the\n> primary election and accorded a column on the general election ballot\n> shall appoint candidates for the office of presidential elector equal\n> to the number of United States senators and representatives in\n> Congress from this state and shall file for each candidate with the\n> secretary of state, not more than ten days after the primary election,\n> by 5:00 p.m. on the last day for filing:\n\nName, residence and postal address and an affadavit of residence in the state are needed. Again, there is no provision for \"certification\" by the state legislature. The certification that takes place is that the electors sign the presidential elector ballot certificate of vote, e.g. [Arizona 2016](https://www.archives.gov/files/electoral-college/2016/vote-arizona.pdf), which simply notes that the electors have been \"duly elected\". In general, Arizona law does not require \"certification\" of any election. Pennsylvania law on the election of electors ([25 PS 2878](https://govt.westlaw.com/pac/Document/NE7FF6540343011DA8A989F4EECDB8638?transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29#co_anchor_I5D4CE310796111EAB11AFBEDA38AC9EF)) similarly does not give the legislature any veto power over the electoral process. The law on the [voting of the electors](https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-25-ps-elections-electoral-districts/pa-st-sect-25-3191.html) also does not provide for any legislative intervention.\n\nThis does not mean that the legislatures cannot pass an act ceremonially \"de\\-certifying\" or invalidating the 2020 election in general, or the nominations of one or both parties. Or, they could pass an act amending the election process to require legislative certification in the case of presidential electors.

Is it a civil contract whose parties are allowed to agree (even retroactively) than an NDA is in place? Or could doing so (backdating such a document) be considered fraud, forgery, or anything illegal, or even for some reason ethically or morally wrong?\n\nIt seems to me that it might be legal (assuming that I as the employee were willing to sign it) because as an employee I'd assume that some NDA was in place even if haven't signed one (so it's as if the agreement or meeting of minds was in place even before it was documented).\n\nOn the other hand it also appears to be creating a false document, so, I don't know.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally you can back\\-date the effective date of a contract. Texas does not have any specific laws that prohibit it and in contracts law, this concept is called the \"relation back\" theory of contract effectiveness. *[See Grubb \\& Ellis Co. v. Bradley Real Est. Trust](http://www.leagle.com/decision/19901959909F2d1050_11777/GRUBB%20&%20ELLIS%20CO.%20v.%20BRADLEY%20REAL%20ESTATE%20TRUST)*, 909 F.2d 1050, 1054 (7th Cir. 1990\\) for an explanation that back dating violates no general contract law principles and is \"determined by the intent of the parties as deduced from the instrument itself.\"\n\nAside from the obvious issues where someone is back\\-dating a contract to commit some type of fraud, back\\-dating raises a whole host of unforeseen consequences with regards to a party's performance under the contract as well as the rights of third parties.\n\nThe best practice is to make it clear that the effective date and the execution date are different. This avoids confusion and ambiguity that could call the enforceability of the contract into question.\n\nSome of the issues that arise when back\\-dating a NDA are:\n\n* **Liability for disclosures** the employee made between the effective date and when the contract is executed/signed. This is particularly troublesome if the NDA provides for liquidated damages or imposes other penalties.\n* If the effective date and execution date are not clear, there **might not be a \u201cmeeting of the minds.\u201d** (The essential elements of a contract are offer, acceptance, consideration, and meeting of the minds.) This is a problem for the employer more than the employee.\n* **Liability to third parties**. Say an employer licensed some technology from a third party and everyone working on the project was required to sign NDAs. Employer could be on the hook here. Also, the employer and employee could both be in trouble if they were back\\-dating the contract to trick the third party into thinking it had been signed all along. The issue here is *fraud*.\n\nSo, the bottom\\-line is that is generally legal/enforceable, but one should have a clear explanation for the difference in the dates."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee has been working on a project for 2 years without signing an NDA.

However, it can create potential issues, particularly regarding liability for disclosures made between the backdated effective date and the actual signing date. While not inherently illegal, backdating can lead to complications such as unclear \"meeting of the minds,\" potential fraud if third parties are involved, and unforeseen consequences regarding contract performance.

If he actually believes that the car has a custom exhaust system (because he paid for one) but the shop simply took his money, and you later buy the car, then he hasn't defrauded you. A claim like \"this car will last 100,000 miles\" can be a warranty, but if the car dies after 50,000 miles, that is not fraud, because the seller doesn't know the statement is false, he was just mistaken about whether it will turn out to be true. \n\nAn express warranty as defined in the [Uniform Commercial Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-313) would subsume frauds."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A private seller tells a potential buyer that a used car has never been in an accident and has a custom performance exhaust system. The buyer purchases the car based on these statements. Later, the buyer discovers the car has frame damage from a previous accident and the exhaust system is stock. Which of the following best describes the legal situation?\n\nA) This is a breach of express warranty, and the seller is liable for repairs or replacement of the car.\n\nB) This is fraud, as the seller knowingly made false representations about the car's condition to induce the sale.\n\nC) This is neither fraud nor a breach of warranty, as private sales are not covered by such protections.\n\nD) This is a breach of implied warranty of merchantability, which applies to all car sales.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario best fits the definition of fraud. The seller made specific false statements about the car's condition (no accidents and custom exhaust) that the buyer relied on when making the purchase. If the seller knew these statements were false, it constitutes fraud, which is more serious than a breach of warranty. Fraud occurs before the contract is made and involves knowingly false representations to induce a sale. Express warranties typically come from manufacturers and have time limits, which doesn't apply here. Option C is incorrect because even private sales can involve fraud. Option D is incorrect because implied warranties generally don't apply to private sales, and this situation involves specific false statements rather than implied conditions."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35488/can-someone-legally-require-me-to-return-a-gift-they-gave-me", "docs_id": 35488, "title": "Can someone legally require me to return a gift they gave me?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So a \"friend\" in Canada sent me a tablet ( I think it was worth $400 U.S. currency) to replace the one I had that I could barely do anything on.

However, since the ToS explicitly say personal AND non\\-commercial use, I'm not 100% sure my use of a Lure Module for the purpose stated above would qualify as acceptable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is ample reason to conclude that \"non\\-commercial\" would include a church, as well as advocating a political cause or candidate. The hard part of \"personal\". In the context of (Canadian) bankruptcy law, it [can mean \"non\\-business use\"](http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/P/PersonalUse.aspx); in the context of \"[personal use property](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personaluseproperty.asp)\", it can be \"A type of property that an individual does not use for business purposes or hold as an investment. In other words, property that an individual owns for personal enjoyment\". US tax law takes \"personal purposes\" to refer to non\\-business purposes. But in the [context of copyright](http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1218&context=articles) (especially music downloading / copying), it is taken to refer to the use of or by an individual. Distributing free copies of a protected work does not get legally sanctioned due to the copying being non\\-commercial. \n\nThe alternative term \"private\" is much clearer, in identifying \"just you\", but is probably avoided in this kind of context so as to avoid the wrong inference that you can only play Pokemon in the privacy of your own home. So the slightly less clear term \"personal\" is used instead of \"private\" especially in copyright\\-related contexts. \"Personal\" and \"private\" are not exactly the same, but when it's about use, I don't see any difference, and I think there is no question that use to attract to a church or political candidate is not \"private\", it is public.\n\nSince the license does not define \"your own personal purposes\" and there is not an existing crystal\\-clear definition of \"personal purposes\", the phrase could be given its \"[ordinary (plain) meaning](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3867&context=flr)\". Of course, plain meaning has to give way to contractual intent, so we have to figure out what the parties intended. Except, you don't have a contract with Niantic, but still, plain meaning surely has some place in the law of licenses. At this point, in a lawsuit, both sides would hire an expert witness like a linguist or English teacher to make the case that a church or other non\\-commercial non\\-private use is / is not included in the meaning of \"personal purpose\". A silly argument could be made to the effect that if you personally have an interest in doing something then it is a personal purpose (if specifically commercial, it would be precluded by the term \"noncommercial\"). What makes this silly is that everybody does things for personal purposes (even acting in a way that benefits others, since you do so for the personal reason that you *should* do so), and thus \"personal\" would not mean anything. That is, \"personal purposes\" does not mean \"whatever motivation or interest you personally have\".\n\nYou can also gain a certain understanding of what \"personal purposes\" means by looking at similar licenses. In the context of academic publishing, authors are typically granted license to copy \"for personal, professional, or teaching purposes\". Professional purposes and teaching purposes are things that the person has an interest in, so by mentioning these things separately, we must conclude that \"teaching\" is not a \"personal purpose\". And so: I would conclude that a court could find that using a product to support a political campaign, philosophy, or religion, is a \"public\" purpose, not a \"personal\" purpose.\n\nAt the same time, at least as I understand it, a lure module is a thing that others besides yourself personally can see (I admit, I don't go), which implies that the purpose of the thing is not entirely private. In addition, there is a fair amount of buzz out there about how a lure could be good for business, which is (1\\) clearly in contradiction of the license terms and (2\\) clearly a golden opportunity for Niantic, perhaps in a few weeks after everybody gets hooked and then they will offer non\\-personal licenses. Their [license terms](https://www.nianticlabs.com/terms/pokemongo/en) also say that you will not \"use the Services or Content, or any portion thereof, for any commercial purpose or *for the benefit of any third party* or in a manner not permitted by these Terms\". I would say that that definitively says \"No don't do it\", and it also means that you can't be nice to a neighbor. So what they literally say and what they really intend are probably completely different things."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A church leader wants to use a Pok\u00e9mon Go Lure Module to attract people to their church.

For example, exploitive loan\\-sharking arrangements and contracts that have a criminal object should be declared void *ab initio*.

However, protection is not limited to businesses headquartered in the country of registration. Firms doing business internationally often register a trademark in multiple countries, sometimes very many countries. It is possible that \"Le Cordon Bleu\" was registered in Australia. (Indeed it turns out to be so registered, see below.)\n\nAlso, in some countries a trademark can be protected to a degree merely by use, without any registration. That is true in the US. I have not yet checked if it is true in Australia. If the plaintiff's mark was in actual use in Australia, that might be enough to get them a favorable trademark decision there. It will be Australian law that will be relevant here, not really international law.\n\nIt seems that the school \"Le Cordon Bleu\" objected to a restaurant called called \"Gordon Bleu\".

Instead, the defense lawyer persuades the police to do something based upon what a court is likely to do, or has already done, as a result of their conduct so far.\n\nAlso, of course, it isn't always possible for a lawyer to get his client out of jail. If the police do have probable cause and the offense is not one for which bail is set in advance, it is not possible for the client to be released until bail is set by a judicial officer such as a magistrate and bail (if granted at all) is posted, which may be beyond the client's means in the case of a serious offense, particularly if the client is considered by the magistrate to be a flight risk.\n\nOn TV and books, the person that the police have arrested is usually someone that the police had no probable cause to arrest but suspect of a crime anyway, and the police usually fold when called on the fact that they lack probable cause by the lawyer.

The motorist had run a motorcycle off the road, although after the motorcyclist decided kick their passenger side door. \n\nThe video was included in the article, and around half of the comments indicated that people generally felt it was justifiable self defense, while the other half agreed with the police and felt it was assault with a deadly weapon. \n\n**Would it be a good idea as a prosecutor to weigh the divided public opinion in the matter before deciding what charges to file?**\n\nMy thought is this: Even if by the letter of the law the motorist committed a crime, the prosecutor knows from the comments on the video that around half of the people who see this video will decide that the motorist was justified. That seems like an uphill battle to avoid a hung jury. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is called prosecutorial discretion and in the U.S. Legal system, the Prosecutor can choose to present any case of any crime they wish. It is not Jury Nullification, in that it doesn't overturn a law, but rather, gives the prosecutor a way to not bring certain criminal charges to court. The general guiding system is that the prosecutor believes that they cannot secure a guilty verdict with the evidence on hand (and the Prosecutor is intentially dealt the weaker hand in U.S. jurisprudence. The Prosecutor must prove that it happened in exactly the one way that makes it criminal, while the defense merely has to prove it could have happened in a way that was not criminal, but need not offer a specific explanation (there was a famous child murder case in Florida in which the defendant had made numerous contradictory statements as to the nature of her actions up untill the child's body was found at various points in the lifecycle of the case (which was in the public eye for almost four years). When it went to the jury, the conclusion was that they basically, the defense likely had a significant role to play, but the prosecution's charges could not be proven with evidence presented. Scotland actually offers a third option for this situation where the jury can find \"Not Proven\" in addition to \"Guilty\" or \"Not Guilty\" which basically means they tend to agree with the prosecutor, but that they cannot convict because the evidence doesn't fully support. Or as one Scotsman describe's the intent of not prove, it means \"You didn't do it, and you better not do it again!\".).\n\nBecause the prosecutor is a taxpayer funded office and an elected office, they are answerable to local public opinion and as such, will face scrutiny for bring a shakey case both from the people who believe the guy didn't do it, and the people who think that the prosecutor shouldn't have taken this case as they knew it was not a slam dunk and thus they were wasting taxpayer money (trials cost money) and citizens time (a jury is drawn from local election registry... so anyone who is deciding a can vote on the prosecutor's future employment).\n\nAnother reason is that once a jury is empaneled, the Prosecution doesn't get a do over. The Constitution Bans double jeopardy for criminal cases, which effectively means that if new evidence is uncovered after a not guilty verdict, then the defense got away with the crime (essentially, it means only the Defense can initiate the appeals process in a criminal case. Given that no one would do that if new incriminating evidence is found, the Prosecution can't appeal the decision.). It's not a violation to not press the charges until more incriminating evidence is found, so long as it's under the statute of limitations for the crime, so they can play the long game.\n\nIt could also be entirely politically motivated, but if it's obviously political, then the it could backfire. Take a look at the Chicago prosecutor's office and the outrage from many people of many different political thoughts when she let off Jessie Smollett for falsely reporting a crime. It's really bad for a prosecutor when you lose the support of local police, who are essentially the guys who they represent in their cases.\n\nJury Nullification is a different event and not something the prosecution can do. Jury Nullification is when the jury comes to the conclusion that the defendant did in fact commit the crime but the law that was violated should not have existed in such a way that given this specific case they found guilt. In effect, it is not guilt by reason of a law we disagree with, and thus the state shouldn't have prosecuted in this case not because he didn't do it, but because it shouldn't have been a crime if he did. It doesn't necessarily mean the law is repealed or changed, but occasionally it can (for example, a man is on trial for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family. The jury concludes that yes, he did take bread without paying for it, but that it wasn't taken for profit purposes as he had no intent to resell it and only stole that which he needed to keep himself and his dependents alive and the prosecution shouldn't have gone after this guy like it they did. There could be some case law that now theft doesn't include stealing basic necessities, or the prosector will realize the jury won't convict and let it go as pressing the matter will waste resources). In other aspects it could be that the law really was egrigious (for example, Baltimore City has a law banning ownership of parrots as pets. No one really knows why and no one gets arrested on it, but if they did, the Jury could say \"this law is stupid\" and let the guy go because a parrot ban serves no specific purpose would likely render the law effectively repealed. Ironically, many a bizarre law in Common Law Jurisdictions are created in this manner. The U.S. can create laws through legal preciseness. For example, under Flordia Law, an alligator counts as a deadly weapon for the purposes of the law... but this came about because someone through a baby alligator at someone and Assault with Deadly Weapon was charged and a judge ruled that the alligator was used as a weapon and they are deadly. It wasn't written by the state legislature because they had nothing better to do then argue about alligators counting as weapons.).\n\nThis is one of the reasons why judges will not allow either side to make any mention of Jury nullification during the case. It's also why, in the United States, cases likely to result in a capital punishment sentance can not have a jurist empaneled who is opposed to the death penalty (because sentancing only comes after guilt is found, the jury rarely has any say in the matter beyond the verdict and in the interest of justice, the court does not want a not guilty verdict or a hung trial based on someone's political position, not the merits of the case. In the case that the jury does affect the outcome, the question is only posed after they find the man guilty. It is illegal for Captial sentences to be mandatory, but it is legal if the sentence is found to be warranted based on aggravating and mitigating factors specific to the events of a specific case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A prosecutor is considering whether to file charges against a motorist who ran a motorcycle off the road after the motorcyclist kicked their car.

It may be presumed to be supporters by the Interstate commerce clause. During the 20th century and to the present this clause has been interpreted very broadly to grant regulatory authority over almost any economic activity in the US. An early and leading case on this point was [*Wickard v Filburn* 317 U.S. 111 (1942\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn). In this case regulation under the Commerce Clause of the planting and harvesting of wheat intended to be fed to livestock on the farm, and consumed by the residents thereof, but not separately marketed, was held to be proper and within the power of congress. The opinion in this case says:\n\n> (at 120\\) We believe that a review of the course of decision under the Commerce Clause will make plain, however, that questions of the power of Congress are not to be decided by reference to any formula which would give controlling force to nomenclature such as \"production\" and \"indirect\" and foreclose consideration of the actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate commerce.\n\nQuoting *Swift \\& Co. v. United States*, 196 U. S. 375, 196 U. S. 398 (at page 122\\) the opinion further said that:\n\n> \"commerce among the States is not a technical legal conception, but a practical one, drawn from the course of business.\"\n\nThe opinion went on to say that:\n\n> (at 124\\-125\\) That an activity is of local character may help in a doubtful case to determine whether Congress intended to reach it. The same consideration might help in determining whether, in the absence of Congressional action, it would be permissible for the state to exert its power on the subject matter, even though, in so doing, it to some degree affected interstate commerce. But even if appellee's activity be local, and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce, and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as \"direct\" or \"indirect.\"\n> \n> \n> (at pages 127\\-128\\) That appellee's own contribution to the demand for wheat may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from the scope of federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial.\n> \n> \n> (at pages 128\\-129\\) Congress may properly have considered that wheat consumed on the farm where grown, if wholly outside the scheme of regulation, would have a substantial effect in defeating and obstructing its purpose to stimulate trade therein at increased prices.\n\nNone of the cases under the ADA that I have found challenge the congressional power to pass the act. In [the Wikipedia article on the act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990), it is said to be largely based on the scheme of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\\.

This scenario closely parallels the principles established in Wickard v. Filburn and subsequent interpretations of the Commerce Clause. Even though Mike's Bikes primarily serves local customers, the aggregate effect of similar businesses across the country can substantially impact interstate commerce. The Supreme Court has consistently held that Congress has broad power to regulate activities that, in aggregate, affect interstate commerce, even if individual instances seem purely local. The ADA, like many federal regulations, is presumed to be based on the Commerce Clause, and courts have generally upheld its constitutionality. Mike's lawyer's argument is unlikely to succeed given this established legal framework.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Commerce Clause has been interpreted to apply even to seemingly local activities.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the ADA does address civil rights, its constitutional basis is primarily the Commerce Clause, not the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, as established in Wickard v.

(ie upon the signing or agreement of a written or verbal lease? On the first / \"move in\" day of the lease itself? Upon handing over the keys to the tenant? Etc).\n\nOf course, s21B(3\\) of HA1988 provides the restriction on usage by LL of s21(1\\) or s21(4\\) until they are no longer in breach of regulations referred to by 21B(1\\). While 21B(2\\)(b) refers vaguely and non\\-specifically to \"the time the requirement applies,\" this is again in the context of defining criteria for ascertaining what version of a document must be served and not per se in that of setting out when to serve it. And this is the closest that anywhere else in s21B comes to touching on the matter.\n\nSo, while we have a statutory provision laying out the consequence for not serving the document in a timely way (no allowance to use s21\\), we are left with no statutory source for the oft\\-repeated, yet apparently ill\\-defined idea that this booklet is to be served \"at the start of a tenancy\". What is this idea's basis or origin?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The beginning of the tenancy is defined in [section 45(2\\) of the Housing Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/45) as:\n\n> the day on which the tenancy is entered into or, if it is later, the day on which, under the terms of any lease, agreement or other document, the tenant is entitled to possession under the tenancy.\n\n(This applies to the statutory instrument because it is made under section [21B](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/21B) of the 1988 Act, and definitions carry over from primary to secondary legislation in this way.) The definition probably matches what people would expect.\n\nSection 21B, and the 2015 Regulations, just say that the landlord has to give this information to their tenant. But it follows that if the tenancy has begun, then the landlord's obligation also begins. It binds from day 1\\. Therefore, the government is justified in saying in the booklet:\n\n> The landlord, or the letting agent, should give the current version of this guide to the tenant when a new assured shorthold tenancy starts.\n\nBecause of all the other paperwork involved, it's most common for the booklet to be given as part of the bundle of documents when the tenancy agreement is signed \\- so, along with the inventory and so on. This is typically not too distant in time from when the tenant is entitled to actually move in, and landlords will often only sign on the day itself even if the tenant has completed their part of the formalities earlier.\n\nPerhaps your doubt is about whether it is \"OK\" for the landlord to provide the booklet before the actual start date of the tenancy, as opposed to waiting until the tenancy is in effect. In the same way, we could imagine a prospective tenant wanting to see the energy performance certificate well before agreeing to sign anything. Does the landlord have to give them another copy on day 1 of the tenancy, even though it's the same as the copy they already have?\n\nIn fact, there *are* specific different rules for those other items of information.\n\n* The most recent gas safety certificate must normally be given \"to any new tenant of premises ... before that tenant occupies those premises\" ([SI 1998/2451 reg.36(6\\)(b)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/2451/regulation/36/made))\n* The EPC must be given to any *prospective* tenant at the earliest opportunity, and in any event must have been given to \"the person who ultimately becomes the buyer or tenant\" ([SI 2012/3118 reg.6](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/3118/regulation/6/made), and compare the definition of \"prospective tenant\" in [regulation 3](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/3118/regulation/3/made)).\n* The EICR must similarly be given to new and prospective tenants before they occupy the premises ([SI 2022/312 reg.3(e)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/312/regulation/3/made)).\n\nSo these are meant to be given before the tenancy begins. They are part of what the prospective tenant should know before deciding whether to sign the agreement. The government's [model tenancy agreement](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1084131/Model_agreement_for_a_shorthold_assured_tenancy.pdf) has checklists for landlord and tenant in relation to these documents, plus the \"How to rent\" booklet. That is consistent with the idea that the tenant is meant to have this information on the day that the tenancy is to begin, whether that's because they're just being given it now, or because they've already seen it. Armed with all the knowledge, they can now proceed to signing the agreement.\n\nIndeed, the content of the \"How to rent\" booklet makes it less useful if it's provided after the agreement has started. A lot of the material is about searching for a property, making sure that you are prepared to sign, and avoiding bad behaviour by potential landlords. Even though it would meet the letter of the law to only get this information after signing (but still on the day), it also meets letter and spirit to get it on the day, *before* signing. Or if you had it even earlier, it would be a bold argument to say that the landlord hadn't given you the information just because they emailed it to you a week before the tenancy actually began \\- especially if you have checked the appropriate little box on the tenancy agreement to say you received it.\n\nNonetheless, because the only practical consequence for landlords is their ability to serve a s.21 notice, it's also common for them to play it safe and send another copy of the booklet before sending the notice itself. They will also often send updated copies as they arise, even though the regulation doesn't require it; some insurers ask for this just to really cement the chance of making a proper s.21 notice.\n\nI'm not aware of judicial precedent on *early* delivery of the booklet, but we can get some guidance from a recent Court of Appeal decision on s.21A, [Trecarrell House v Rouncefield \\[2020] EWCA Civ 760](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Approved-judgment-Trecarrell-House-Ltd-v-Rouncefield-18-06-2020.pdf). This case examined the nature of breaches and remedies that prevent serving an eviction notice. The conclusion was that if the tenant received a gas safety certificate \"before or with\" the s.21 notice, then the landlord has fulfilled their obligation \\- they are not irreparably in breach just becuse they did not give that information at the beginning. What matters for the Housing Act is that the tenant received it by the time that it was needed for the s.21 process. Likewise, it would seem that if the tenant had the \"How to rent\" booklet from the landlord before the beginning of their tenancy, then the landlord is not in breach \\- because the tenant has the information the whole time even though the act of giving the booklet predated the tenancy itself."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A landlord wants to ensure compliance with regulations regarding the \"How to Rent\" guide for a new Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) starting on July 1st.

The legality of seat swapping, whether for free or for money, is not explicitly addressed in federal aviation laws. It's not inherently illegal. However, the specific terms can vary based on each airline's contract of carriage. Generally, seat swapping is allowed and airlines don't typically object, but they retain the right to manage seating arrangements.

The key provision states that \"the total of the charges fixed under this subsection and estimated to be received in any year shall not exceed by an unreasonable proportion the cost to the Executive in that year of making provision for the safe keeping and redelivery of lost property.\" This means that while charges can exceed the actual costs, they must do so only by a reasonable amount, and the calculation is based on the total estimated costs and income for all lost property in a given year, not just individual items.

There are three sections in the Contract which seem like they might be relevant:\n\n> RULE 21 REFUSAL OF TRANSPORT\n\ndiscusses the reasons for which United has the right to remove a passenger from its plane. There is a list of them, but most notably, \"overbooked flight\" is *not* one of those reasons.\n\n> RULE 5 CANCELLATION OF RESERVATIONS\n> \n> \n> G. All of UA\u2019s flights are subject to overbooking which could result in UA\u2019s inability to provide previously confirmed reserved space for a given flight or for the class of service reserved. In that event, UA\u2019s obligation to the Passenger is governed by Rule 25\\.\n\nspecifies that United may overbook its flights, and as a purchaser, you're agreeing that you may not get to actually use the ticket you bought due to overbooking. However, in the event of an overbooking, it refers to:\n\n> RULE 25 DENIED BOARDING COMPENSATION\n\nwhich goes through the procedure by which United will attempt to solicit volunteers to forfeit their tickets in exchange for compensation; then, if needed, resort to selecting passengers to involuntarily forfeit their tickets, etc.\n\nHowever, point was raised that Rule 6 and Rule 25 talk about *denial of boarding* in the case of overbooking. In this specific situation, the passenger had already boarded \u2013 United had already given the passenger his \"reserved space\", and was now asking him to \"give it back\".\n\nIs there any real difference between those two events? Does the fact that the Contract of Carriage talks about \"boarding\", but not \"removal after boarding\", make any legal difference as far as United's rights in this case?\n\n---\n\nJust to clarify: I realize that overbooking itself is a legal business practice, as it's called out specifically in the Contract. But the Contact also lays out specifically what happens when overbooking occurs, and this event doesn't appear to be covered.\n\nI also recognize that United's airplane is ultimately private property and remaining in your seat after being told to leave is probably trespassing in some sense. And once security was called and the passenger disobeyed, he was clearly in the wrong. But that doesn't mean UA didn't breach their contract in having him removed in the first place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Rule 21 A: *Breach of Contract of Carriage* is one reason invoking the right to remove \\- \"Failure by Passenger to comply with the Rules of the Contract of Carriage\". 21(H): *Safety* then provides a set of rules that must be complied with:\n\n> Whenever refusal or removal of a Passenger may be necessary for the\n>  safety of such Passenger or other Passengers or members of the crew\n>  including, but not limited to:\n\nwhich includes \n\n> 2. Passengers who fail to comply with or interfere with the duties of the members of the flight crew, federal regulations, or security\n>  directives;\n\nThis does not directly authorize ejecting boarded passengers because of overbooking, but it provides a basis for concluding that there has been a breach. One can reasonably wonder whether the wording of the clause means that passengers can only be ejected for refusing to comply with an obviously safety\\-related\ninstruction. However, 21(H)(16\\) includes as a safety reason \"Passengers who have or cause a malodorous condition (other than individuals qualifying as disabled)\", and (5\\) includes being \"not properly clothed\". (4\\) also includes \"Passengers who, through and as a result of their conduct, cause a disturbance such that the captain or member of the cockpit crew must leave the cockpit in order to attend to the disturbance\", which could be applicable in a particular instance (e.g. if the flight attendant says \"please go\" and then has to call the captain to say the same).\n\nThese extensions to \"safety\" are contrary to a reasonable interpretation of \"safety\", but [14 CFR 91\\.3(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.3) states that \"The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft\". So as long as the pilot makes the determination, he has the final authority, until that regulation is changed. There is nothing in regulations about pilots that limits what the captain can do, in this respect, and there is (per case law) no provision for judicial review of pilot decisions. [Cerqueira v American Airlines](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2445069/cerqueira-v-american-airlines-inc/) indicates a possibilty for cause of action in case a decision is \"arbitrary and capricious\" (a standard originating in [Williams v. TWA](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/324732/robert-f-williams-v-trans-world-airlines/) 509 F.2d 942\\), especially in connection with anti\\-discrimination law. In the case [Lu. v.

Appx. 657 plaintiff argued that the airline's removal of her failed to meed the safety standard of the statute, and again the court affirms that there is no provision for review of pilot decisions, though review is allowed in some districts if the decision of arbitrary or capricious. Although Lu raised the \"was not inimical to safety\" argument, the court responds:\n\n> Lu did not allege any discriminatory animus for her removal from the\n>  flight. Lu only insisted that her actions were not \"inimical to\n>  safety\" and cited the \"arbitrary and capricious preferences\" of the\n>  flight attendants in an attempt to meet her burden under \u00a7 44902(b).\n>  Such conclusory statements and bare assertions that Lu's behavior was\n>  not inimical to safety\u2014despite her admitted failure to comply with\n>  safety regulations do not plausibly support a claim that her removal\n>  from the flight was arbitrary or capricious.\n\nThere is really no way to know how the courts would have ruled in the Dao case, since the relevant details of the event are not known. To test the limits of pilot removal discretion, we would need a scenario where a boarded passenger is randomly selected for removal due to overbooking, and where the passenger has done nothing that could be construed as a threat to safety (e.g. arguing with the attendant, refusing to leave), and where the pilot does not allege a safety\\-based reason for removal. Then there could be a test of whether a suit over breach of contract for removal (as opposed to denied initial boarding) for a demonstrably non\\-safety based reason would prevail."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding an airline's ability to remove a passenger who has already boarded the plane?\n\nA) An airline can only remove a passenger for reasons explicitly listed under \"Refusal of Transport\" in their Contract of Carriage.\n\nB) The pilot has absolute and unreviewable authority to remove any passenger for any reason.\n\nC) An airline can remove a passenger for safety reasons, which can be broadly interpreted, but the decision may be subject to legal review if it appears arbitrary or capricious.\n\nD) Once a passenger has boarded, they cannot be removed due to overbooking as the Contract of Carriage only addresses denied boarding in such cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Regulation 3(4\\) provides that a commerical practice is unfair if, inter alia, it is listed in Schedule 1\\.\n\nParagraph 27 of Schedule 1 contains the following item:\n\n> Requiring a consumer who wishes to claim on an insurance policy to\n> produce documents which could not reasonably be considered relevant as\n> to whether the claim was valid, or failing systematically to respond\n> to pertinent correspondence, in order to dissuade a consumer from\n> exercising his contractual rights.\n\nAs you've provided proof that you purchased the item, you can try to argue that having the serial number of the lost item can not \"reasonably be considered relevant\". Yes, the contract says that you must provide it, but consumer rights legislation overrides contractual provisions.\n\nYou may also want to consider dealing with the insurer by email/post instead of by phone, (a) to avoid continuing to waste time on hold, and (b) because if they systematically fail to respond then this may also cause them to be in breach of the above provision, (c) to acquire evidence which you can use later.\n\nEscalating\n----------\n\nIf you get no results from the insurer, make a formal complaint to them through their complaints process. Under the [FCA Handbook](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/DISP) rule DISP 1\\.3\\.1R, the insurer is required to provide a complaints procedure. Under rule DISP 1\\.6\\.2R they are required to provide a final response to a complaint within 8 weeks.\n\nIf you are not happy with the response, you can escalate the complaint to the [Financial Ombudsman Service](https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/contact-us/complain-online) which has the power to make financial awards pursuant to [section 229](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/section/229) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (\"FSMA\"). Doing so is free of charge and is therefore a good alternative to going to court. The ombudsman can also make awards that are not strictly based on law (i.e. they can go further than the courts can) because of [section 228 of FSMA](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/section/228) which provides that:\n\n> \"A complaint is to be determined by reference to what is, in the\n> opinion of the ombudsman, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances\n> of the case.\"\n\nYou must generally escalate a complaint to the Ombudsman within 6 months of receiving your final response from the insurer (rule DISP 2\\.8\\.2R)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer purchased earbuds 10 months ago and is trying to make an insurance claim for loss. The insurer is refusing the claim because the proof of purchase doesn't include the serial number, which is required according to the fine print. The retailer claims they no longer have records after 3 months. What is the most appropriate first step for the consumer to take in this situation?\n\nA) File a lawsuit against the retailer for not keeping records\nB) Make a subject access request to the retailer under UK GDPR\nC) Immediately escalate the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service\nD) Accept the insurer's decision and give up on the claim\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Making a subject access request to the retailer under UK GDPR is the most appropriate first step. This allows the consumer to formally request any personal data the retailer might still have, including the serial number, if it's linked to their identity. The retailer is obligated to respond within 30 days if they have the information. This approach is less confrontational than legal action and more likely to yield results than immediately escalating to the Ombudsman. It's also a necessary step before considering other options, as it may resolve the issue without further complications. If this fails, the consumer can then consider other options like complaining to the insurer, arguing against the relevance of the serial number requirement, or escalating to the Financial Ombudsman Service as subsequent steps."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77882/what-does-circumstantial-evidence-mean-in-criminal-procedure", "docs_id": 77882, "title": "What does &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; mean in criminal procedure?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What does the term \"circumstantial\" or \"circumstantial evidence\" mean in a legal context, particularly in regard to criminal law? How is it different from other kinds of evidence. Is it correct that circumstantial evidence is weaker or less valuable than direct evidence?\n\nPlease cite reliable sources for any answers.\n\nI am particularly interested in answers for the US (any state) but answers from other jurisdictions would also be welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Overview\n--------\n\nThe term \"circumstantial evidence\" refers to evidence that does not directly establish the elements of the crime, but that permits the finder of fact to draw inferences about what happened. It is called circumstantial because it shows the circumstances, often of the crime scene, but in any case of something in some way related to the alleged crime.\n\nFor example, a knife found in a dead body would be circumstantial evidence, as would fingerprints found on the knife.\n\nAn eye\\-witness account of the crime would be ***direct evidence***, not ***circumstantial evidence***. So would a video of the events of the crime, say from a security camera. Most physical evidence is circumstantial evidence. Much eye\\-witness is direct evidence. There is also ***opinion evidence***, also known as ***expert testimony***. In a US court at least, pretty much all evidence falls into one of these three categories.\n\nCircumstantial evidence can be misinterpreted, and it can even be faked, although that is comparatively rare. Direct evidence can include lies, misunderstandings, and particularly misperceptions.1\n\nFor example, a witness sees two people struggling, hears a shot and sees a flash, then one drops dead. This is direct evidence, not circumstantial. But does it prove murder, or even intentional killing? It need not; one person could have drawn a gun and the other struggled to seize it, and the gun fired in the struggle, killing the person who originally drew it, with no one intending that result.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose a victim reports a rape. Semen is obtained from the victim's person. The victim shows bruises and injuries characteristic of rape. DNA tests match the accused, as do fingerprints in the victim's blood at the scene of the crime. That is all circumstantial, but taken together, there seems only one reasonable interpretation.\n\nSources\n-------\n\n* The definition of [\"circumstantial evidence\"](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=191) from Law.con's legal dictionary reads:\n\n> evidence in a trial which is not directly from an eyewitness or participant and requires some reasoning to prove a fact.\n\nThe page goes on to state:\n\n> There is a public perception that such evidence is weak (\"all they have is circumstantial evidence\"), but the probable conclusion from the circumstances may be so strong that there can be little doubt as to a vital fact (\"beyond a reasonable doubt\" in a criminal case, and \"a preponderance of the evidence\" in a civil case). Particularly in criminal cases, \"eyewitness\" (\"I saw Frankie shoot Johnny\") type evidence is often lacking and may be unreliable, so circumstantial evidence becomes essential. Prior threats to the victim, fingerprints found at the scene of the crime, ownership of the murder weapon, and the accused being seen in the neighborhood, certainly point to the suspect as being the killer, but each bit of evidence is circumstantial.\n* The *Britannica* article on [\"Circumstantial Evidence\"](https://www.britannica.com/topic/circumstantial-evidence) defines the term as:\n\n> circumstantial evidence, in law, evidence not drawn from direct observation of a fact in issue.\n\nThe page goes on to state:\n\n> If a witness testifies that he saw a defendant fire a bullet into the body of a person who then died, this is direct testimony of material facts in murder, and the only question is whether the witness is telling the truth. If, however, the witness is able to testify only that he heard the shot and that he arrived on the scene seconds later to see the accused standing over the corpse with a smoking pistol in his hand, the evidence is circumstantial; the accused may have been shooting at the escaping killer or merely have been a bystander who picked up the weapon after the killer had dropped it.\n* Merriam\\-webster's [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/circumstantial%20evidence) is:\n\n> evidence that tends to prove a fact by proving other events or circumstances which afford a basis for a reasonable inference of the occurrence of the fact at issue.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n\\[1] See for example [\"Eyewitness identification: Effects of suggestion and bias in identification from photographs\"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03333151). In [\"Eyewitness Testimony](https://www.jstor.org/stable/29761486) (*Scientific American*, Dec 1974\\) Prof Robert Buckhout wrote:\n\n> Although such testimony is frequently challenged, it is still widely assumed to be more reliable than other kinds of evidence.
