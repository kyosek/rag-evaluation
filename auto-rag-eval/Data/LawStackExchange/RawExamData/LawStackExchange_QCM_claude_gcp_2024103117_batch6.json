The question is, who is responsible, the vendor or the manufacturer? Under The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the manufacturer primarily bears liability. The bad news is that the seller is not primarily responsible, unless they have \"done something\" with the product (installed it, modified it, further warrantied it), but also is \"the identity of the manufacturer is not known or if known the service of notice or process or warrant cannot be affected on the manufacturer or it the manufacturer is not subject to the law which is force in India\", i.e. the manufacturer is in another country and isn't subject to Indian law. If this is a simple redistribution contract (A provides wholesale to B, consumer buys retail from B), A bears responsibility: and therefore, you were to have applied to the manufacturer for a replacement.\n\nBut also note that [an expired warranty is not defense](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/expiry-of-warranty-no-defence-if-product-has-inherent-defect/articleshow/19359949.cms?from=mdr) to manufacturer liability, if there is an inherent manufacturing defect. The case underlying that ruling arose from a product that repeatedly failed after multiple repairs where the manufacturer played the \"expired warranty\" card after a number of repairs, but the underlying legal principle is equally applicable to the situation where a repair or replacement is not even made though applied for within the period of warranty.\n\nSo you should sue the manufacturer, unless the manufacturer is not subject to Indian law, in which case you should sue the seller. However, you should really get a lawyer who will then devise a legal strategy (probably amounting to writing a letter) outlining the legal situation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer in India purchased a defective electrical product that was under warranty. The supplier approved an exchange but couldn't procure a replacement due to the pandemic. By the time the supplier could potentially fulfill the exchange, the warranty had expired. The supplier now refuses to honor the exchange. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the customer's rights and the appropriate course of action?\n\nA) The customer has no recourse as the warranty has expired, and the supplier is within their rights to refuse the exchange.\n\nB) The customer should immediately sue the supplier, as they are primarily responsible for honoring the warranty regardless of expiration.\n\nC) The customer should pursue legal action against the manufacturer, unless the manufacturer is not subject to Indian law, in which case the seller becomes liable.\n\nD) The customer can only seek compensation if they can prove the supplier intentionally delayed the exchange to avoid honoring the warranty.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Indian consumer protection laws, the manufacturer bears primary liability for defective products. The expired warranty is not a valid defense if there is an inherent manufacturing defect. The customer should pursue legal action against the manufacturer. However, if the manufacturer is not subject to Indian law (e.g., located in another country), the seller becomes liable. This answer accurately reflects the legal framework described in the documentation, including the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and relevant case law.

This is only not the case where the contract is one for personal services (e.g. an employment contract) or where the contract explicitly proscribes or otherwise limits it.\n\nFor example, if I run a dog walking business and you contract with me to walk your dog on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for 6 months then, at any time, I can transfer my obligation to walk the dog and my right to be paid by you for doing so to anyone else. I can do this by subcontracting (in which case the rights and obligations are still mine \\- I'm just using someone else to fulfil them), or by selling individual contracts (which is how debt collection businesses operate), or by selling the entire business.\n\nIt would be completely normal that the contracts you agreed to when you opened your accounts would allow the bank to sell them.

This is based on the principle that contracts are generally transferrable unless explicitly stated otherwise or involving personal services. Bank account agreements typically include clauses allowing the bank to transfer or sell accounts. The customer's explicit consent for each transfer is not required if it's covered in the original agreement. While notification is a good practice, a 6-month advance notice is not a legal requirement. Sharing of personal information in such transfers is usually covered under the original agreement and privacy policies.

My conclusion is that for most of the web\\-sites we manage, Google's IP anonymization is *adequate* to ensure *security of processing* as required by the DPIA process. However, on some sites that are likely to visited by users interested in what the GDPR calls \"special categories of personal data\" (Article 9\\), we either do not use Google Analytics, or we add additional layers of security in case the USA Government orders Google to disregard the stipulations in the DPA and hand over the data (yes, the US Government can legally do that \\- read the fine print in the Privacy Shield accord).\n\nAs for Facebook Analytics, I think you've simply misunderstood their [policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php).\n\nNowhere in that policy document does Facebook say that they \"are not collecting Personal Identifiable Information\".\n\nAFAIK, they collect tons of it, in all sorts of obnoxious and sneaky ways.\n\nWhat they actually say about PII in the context of Analytics is this:\n\n> We do not *share* information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission.\n\nLet me remind you that one of their \"analytics partners\" was Cambridge Analytica, so if this promise not to share is true, it looks like a pretty new policy.\n\nOK, moving on to cookie compliance.\n\nTo you (the controller), both Google and Facebook are processors.\n\nGiven the history of the NSA and the methods it have used and AFAIK still use to get US\\-based companies to hand over the personal data about Europeans through orders issued by secret FISA courts, plus the fact that total nutcases currently are in charge in the USA, I am not going to rely on the privacy policy of any US\\-company for protection of personal data.\n\nSo *if* I make use of Google Analytics (and I often do, they provide a great service), I always make sure that my users opt\\-in on that (hard cookie concent), even I make use of their IP anonymization feature (YMMV).\n\nAs for Facebook, the fact that they promise *not* to share PII with third parties is irrelevant because they *collect* personal data.

And co\\-tenant A wanted to move out of the place. So A convinced B and C that if as co\\-tenants A,B, and C sign the new lease identical to the original without A's name on it (effectively \"removing\" A from the lease), A would in exchange, provide postdated checks to the landlord for the next three months of \"A's portion\" of the rent, plus the lease change agreement fee. So B and C signed the new lease without A on it.\n\nNote that here, A's agreement to pay \"A's portion\" (which technically isn't spelled out in the lease) of the rent was only communicated to B and C, and not the landlord.

Under [Ontario law](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/rso-1990-c-l15/latest/rso-1990-c-l15.html), to establish a prescriptive easement, the trespassers would have to prove to the court that they:\n\n> 1.

For example, take your previous question.

Instead, break\\-ins are (depending on the nature of the crime) prosecuted as trespassing (Hausfriedensbruch, \u00a7 123 StGB), criminal damage (Sachbesch\u00e4digung, \u00a7 303 StGB) and/or theft (Diebstahl, \u00a7 242 StGB). (Some cases may fit additonal statutory offenses, e. g. tampering with an electronic lock can be computer fraud (Computerbetrug, \u00a7 263a StGB) and hurting someone can be robbery (Raub, \u00a7 249 StGB) and/or personal injury (K\u00f6rperverletzung, \u00a7 223 StGB).)\n\nThis means: If your brother breaks the lock, then that's vandalism. If your brother walks in (without authorization), it's trespassing and if your brother steals your stuff, it's stealing.\n\nOn top of that, since your brother is living in the same household as you, breaking into your room may also be considered domestic violence. The violence protection act (Gewaltschutzgesetz) is very harsh when it comes to domestic violence: The offender can be ordered by court to hand over their home to the victim and to stay away from the home. This means that if your brother breaks into your room, your brother may be removed from the house by court order.\n\nNon\\-compliance with a court order issued under the Gewaltschutzgesetz (e. g. your brother tries to show up at your house after he was ordered to stay away), can be prosecuted under civil *and*(!) penal law.\n\nYou can read the English translation of the German penal code (STrafgesetzbuch, StGB) here (although I prefer to use German because all translations at gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de tend to be low quality): [https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/englisch\\_stgb/englisch\\_stgb.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html) \n\nAnd the Violence protection act is here (unfortunately untranslated):\n[https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/gewschg/BJNR351310001\\.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gewschg/BJNR351310001.html)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Germany, if your brother breaks into your room in your shared family home while you're away, which of the following legal actions could potentially be taken against him?\n\nA) He could only be charged with trespassing (Hausfriedensbruch)\n\nB) He could be charged with trespassing, criminal damage (Sachbesch\u00e4digung), and theft (Diebstahl), depending on his actions\n\nC) He could be immediately arrested for the specific crime of \"breaking and entering\"\n\nD) No legal action could be taken as it's a family dispute within the same household\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: In Germany, there is no specific crime of \"breaking and entering.\" Instead, such actions can be prosecuted under multiple statutes depending on the specifics of the incident.

But, British statutes did not have direct force and effect in the U.S. after independence.\n\nAs much as anything else, this simply reflect how the nature of statutes v. common law was understood in the late 18th and early 19th century. Nobody expected that British statutes would be directly applicable, so they weren't.\n\nThere may have been instances where common law rules actually had their roots in British statutes that were mostly forgotten in long layers of British common law case law, and many statutes expressly adopting British case law also expressly incorporate selected relevant British statutes of generally applicability. But, no British statutes were applicable \"automatically\" in the U.S.\n\n> For example, before Congress enacted the Naturalization Act of 1790,\n> would a person born outside the US to a US citizen father have been a\n> US citizen by dint of the US \"inheriting\" the British Nationality Act\n> 1772 mutatis mutandis?\n\nNo. Basic ways of thinking about what nationality or citizenship even was or meant would have been received, but not by receiving the British Nationality Act 1772 as U.S. law.\n\n> And before Congress enacted the Crimes Act of 1790, would an American\n> who levied war against the US, gave aid and comfort to its enemies, or\n> counterfeited US currency have been convicted and sentenced under the\n> Treason Act 1351?\n\nNot really.\n\nFrom the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776 until the adoption of the Articles of Confederation on June 11, 1777, as a practical matter, the revolutionary forced had very little actual control of the courts in an enforceable way, there was an insurgency against the British underway, and it was an ad hoc effort from day to day and month to month that was muddled through without a formal structure or guidance at a colony by colony level, or even more granularly within a colony.\n\nIn the period from June 11, 1777 until the new U.S. Constitution was implemented in 1789\\-1790, under the [Articles of Confederation](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/articles-of-confederation), the situation was fluid and irregular. State governments made most statutory and common law, adopting their colonial era colonial statutes but not necessarily British statutes that their local legislature didn't adopt. Central government laws usually acted on the states, not directly on individuals, much like treaties today. There was little or no directly applicable central government legislation.\n\nMany topics, like citizenship, were simply ignored in this era. The U.S. Constitution adopted in 1789, and the initial acts of the First Congress to implement it, were a response to the realization that after the war and its immediate aftermath had settled down, that the newly formed country needed to regularize, institutionalize, and deal with a lot of governance issues and legal questions that nobody had had the time or resources or authority to deal with while a war had been going on.\n\nFor much of this time period the Revolutionary War was in progress and it wasn't always obvious who even controlled the courts or had practice authority to enforce court judgments. The [Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War) was not concluded until 1783\\.\n\nIt was an improvisation at first, and not necessarily a uniform one, since the Articles of Confederation conceived of the U.S. as many countries in an alliance with each other rather than an actual single nation that had to address legal issues uniformly.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the federal court system under the U.S. Constitution of 1789 that remains in force, the only institution of the central government was Congress and its committees, which functioned as a legislative body, a body selecting people with executive authority, and as a court of last resort from state court judgments. Everything was carried out at the state level except for courts\\-martial.\n\nStructurally, the Articles of Confederation were a fused system, akin to the U.K. Parliament which had its highest court of appeals and its prime ministership fused with the legislative authority of parliament, layered on top of 13 separate sovereign state governments.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: During the period between the Declaration of Independence (1776) and the implementation of the U.S. Constitution (1789-1790), which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal landscape of the newly formed United States?\n\nA) British statutory law continued to apply automatically at both the federal and state levels.\n\nB) The Articles of Confederation provided a clear and uniform legal framework for all 13 states.\n\nC) Each state largely developed its own laws, with little centralized governance or uniformity across states.\n\nD) The Treason Act of 1351 was directly enforced to prosecute those who committed treason against the United States.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. During this period, the legal situation was fluid and irregular. The Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1777, conceived of the U.S. as multiple countries in an alliance rather than a single nation. Each state largely developed its own statutory and common law, often adapting their colonial-era statutes but not necessarily adopting British statutes. There was little centralized governance, and the central government under the Articles of Confederation mainly acted on states rather than individuals.\n\nOption A is incorrect because British statutory law did not automatically apply in the U.S. after independence. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the Articles of Confederation did not provide a clear and uniform legal framework; instead, it allowed for significant variation among states.\n\nOption D is incorrect because British statutes like the Treason Act of 1351 were not directly enforced in the U.S. after independence.

Words in any statute, charter or ordinance giving authority to 3 or more persons authorize a majority to act when the statute, charter or ordinance does not otherwise specify. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a vacancy on an elected or appointed body does not in itself impair the authority of the remaining members to act unless a statute, charter or ordinance expressly prohibits the body from acting during the period of any vacancy and does not in itself affect the validity of any action no matter when taken.\n2. [Shall; must; may.](http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/1/title1sec71.html) \"Shall\" and \"must\" are terms of equal weight that indicate a mandatory duty, action or requirement. \"May\" indicates authorization or permission to act. This subsection applies to laws enacted or language changed by amendment after December 1, 1989\\.\n\nThe following excerpts are but one example of a particular regulatory board (this case, professional land surveyors) that might be affected. \n\n3. Rules (Title 32, Ch. 141\\) The board may establish guidelines and rules...\n4. Duties and powers (Title 32, Ch. 141\\) The board shall administer and enforce this chapter\n5. Meetings; chair; quorum. (Title 32, Ch. 141\\) The board shall meet at least once a year to conduct its business and to elect a chair. Additional meetings must be held as necessary to conduct the business of the board and may be convened at the call of the chair or a majority of the board members. Four members of the board constitute a quorum.\n\nAnd finally, since it might be relevant, here is one general rule pertaining to all occupational boards...\n\n6. Quorum; chair (Title 10 \u00a78010\\) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a majority of the members serving on a board or commission under section 8001, subsection 38 constitutes a quorum. The board or commission shall elect its chair.\n\n---\n\nI want to know how a vacancy on this board might affect the actions the board can take. Suppose there are only 6 members appointed to the 7 member board for the course of 2 calendar years.\n\nLaw \\#1, which I cited above, almost seems to answer the question in favor of the undermanned boards. However, that law says specifically that where **authority** is given to a group, then the majority of that group is permitted to act. Law \\#1 does not say that where a **duty** is imposed upon a board, that the majority may assume that duty alone. And we see that there is definitely a distinction in law \\#2\\. Does that mean, for example, that the whole of the land surveyors board \"must\" meet at least once per year? Yes or no?\n\nIf you're thinking is that we would be lead to an absurd conclusion in thinking the whole of the land surveyor's board would be required to also (as in law \\#4\\) \"administer and enforce\" and that the \"obvious\" purpose of law \\#1 was to avoid such a burden, I think it is certainly possible that the board could develop its own bylaws to handle voting procedures during absences. If the board, on day 1, voted to empower a smaller minority to handle certain business, that would effectively be a case where the board had fulfilled its duty through delegation. No?\n\nIt is not so important to me that there **always** 100% of the time be a full board. The important thing to me is that these occupational boards are meant to be filled by a majority of professionals in the field, plus a couple of lay persons for balance. Guess which seats are empty most often? The lay persons. I understand you can't always get people to show up, but if the laws say the board is composed of lay persons too, they ought to show up at least once a year like the law says. That's my take, and I think it provides a little bit of legislative intent to back up that side of the argument.\n\nCase history on this sort of thing is scant, as far as I can see. Again, I reiterate the question...here in Maine, how do you think vacancies on a board impact board actions? And why?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Point \\#1 put simply says that when a decision or action (mandatory or otherwise) is given to 3 or more people then the decision of the majority is binding. For 1 or 2 people the decision must be unanimous.\n\nA quorum is either a) what the boards rules say (point 5\\) or b) a majority of the board (point 6\\) whichever is lesser. For the board you detail (7 members 4 for a quorum) the answer is the same either way \\- 4 members at the meetings make a valid meeting.\n\nIf there are 4 or more members on the board, the board can function providing that 4 or more members attend each meeting. \n\n> Does that mean, for example, that the whole of the land surveyors board \"must\" meet at least once per year? Yes or no?\n\nNo, there must be one meeting where a quorum is in attendance.\n\n> ... that would effectively be a case where the board had fulfilled its duty through delegation. No?\n\nYes, providing that such delegation (in the form of a sub\\-committee) was a power that the board had.\n\n> ... but if the laws say the board is composed of lay persons too, they ought to show up at least once a year like the law says.\n\nNo, it doesn't. The criteria for *appointment* to the boards may specify a given number of professionals and lay\\-persons, however, once appointed they are *all* board members. There is no legal obligation on a board member to attend board meetings.

Basically, the story is that Damien Riehl and Noah Rubin put every melody on a hard drive, thus automatically copyrighting them, in order to defend the independent creation of small musicians. In the following thought experiment, I am going to take one step further and try to copyright all creative works created hereafter. I'm not sure of its practicality, but I assure you it would be fun.\n\nLet me first introduce the Infinity Hard Drive. It is simply a device that echoes back its input. For example, if you feed a document/painting/music into it, it would echo back the identical document/painting/music. Essentially, it is merely a repeater that is unable to store anything like a conventional one, but you will see why I call it a hard drive in a moment.\n\nSay Alice publishes her creative work, and I would like to sue her for violating my copyright. I have the evidence that if someone feeds Alice's work into the Infinity Hard Drive, it will return the identical work. In fact, you can find anything in the Infinity Hard Drive, as long as you know what you are looking for.\n\nYou might say \"Seriously? You are literally taking Alice's work to generate yours!\" But think about it: what would Alice do if Bob sues her for violating his copyright law? She would read Bob's work, and try to find the relevant drafts on her drawer that proves her work is original and independent. Relevance is the key here: if Alice has thousands of drafts at hand, it would make no sense to submit all of them to a court in response to a lawsuit concerning a specific work. Alice can read Bob's work to find her relevant work, so why can't the Infinity Hard Drive read someone's work to find my original work? I am arguing that conceptually, the process is more like using Alice's work to query my infinite collection of creative works to compute the location where my work resides, rather than generating one from scratch. Maybe Alice doesn't need to read Bob's whole work, but this is because her collection is finite. The Infinity Hard Drive is infinite in capacity, so naturally, it takes more information to find a specific work. In fact, Damien Riehl and Noah Rubin also need to take a melody to locate its counterpart in their hard drive, so if their approach works, so will mine.\n\nTo reiterate, the Infinity Hard Drive serves as a \"tangible medium of expression\" of my infinite collection of creative works. From my understanding, the internal mechanism of such a media does not matter. It can be a piece of paper, an SSD, or the Infinity Hard Drive which conceptually contains everything. What really matters is the outcome, that \"(works) can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\"\n\nJust to clarify, what I\u2019m trying to (automatically) copyright is not the Infinity Hard Drive itself, or the process of \"querying\" stuff in it, or the idea of making one. I am copyrighting the conceptual contents within. Just like you don't copyright the ink on a paper or electronic signals on a hard drive; you copyright the conceptual content born.\n\nI probably also need to prove that my work is \"the result of creative decisions of a human being\", but that is arguable. We know that [a randomly\\-generated book is not a violation of copyright](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1985/is-a-randomly-generated-book-a-violation-of-copyright). Also, how could J.K. Rowling prove her work is creative instead of the accurate deception of an alternative universe? Anyway, if the contents of the Infinity Hard Drive is not copyrightable, then nothing is, because it contains everything.\n\nFinally, how do I prove that Alice had access to my infinite collection of creative works prior to her creation? Well, you are reading this right now, and the Infinity Hard Drive is, in fact, ubiquitous, e.g. a mirror, or a computer that echoes back your keystrokes on the screen.\n\nNow, can I sue you for copyright infringement with the Infinity Hard Drive? To extend the scope of this question a little, can I also claim its ownership? originality? If the answers to the above questions are all \"No\", then can I defend myself from a copyright infringement lawsuit with the Infinity Hard Drive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright requires originality\n------------------------------\n\nYour infinity hard drive appears to be a machine designed to violate copyright by immediately copying anything presented to it.\n\nDamien Riehl and Noah Rubin were creating original melodies. These do not have copyright until they are fixed in a tangible medium. That's what the hard drive is for. This is insurance against *them* being sued if they release a song and someone claims it violates that person's copyright \\- they can produce in court the melody with a date stamp of 2015 (or whatever). GitHub or similar would be even better evidence.\n\nIn this context there is a specific allegation that melody X infringes copyright. Riehl \\& Rubin can then go to their records (including metadata) and say no, here is melody X version 1 through n and they all predate your release so we didn\u2019t violate your copyright.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes why the \"Infinity Hard Drive\" concept would not be a valid defense against copyright infringement claims?\n\nA) The Infinity Hard Drive does not actually store any original content, it merely echoes back input.\n\nB) Copyright law requires human creativity, which the Infinity Hard Drive lacks.\n\nC) The Infinity Hard Drive violates existing copyrights by reproducing works without permission.\n\nD) The Infinity Hard Drive cannot prove prior creation or originality of works.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While all options touch on relevant issues, D is the most comprehensive and accurate answer. The Infinity Hard Drive concept fails as a copyright defense because it cannot demonstrate prior creation, originality, or creativity - key elements for copyright protection. It merely echoes back whatever is input, without creating or storing anything new. This means it cannot prove that any work existed before someone else's creation, nor can it show original authorship. Options A and C are true but don't fully capture why this wouldn't work as a defense. B is partially true, but the lack of human creativity alone isn't the main issue - it's the inability to prove originality and prior creation that's most crucial here."}, "19": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83133/does-the-unlocking-consumer-choice-and-wireless-competition-act-confer-a-right-t", "docs_id": 83133, "title": "Does the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act confer a right to unlock a phone one owns, or merely limit the scope of the DMCA?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Smart phones come in two different kinds: locked, and unlocked. A locked phone has been modified from its original design, in its software, hardware, or firmware, to only accept cell service from a specific provider. The provider sells these phones at a discount to a consumer, because the provider believes that the provider will make up the difference in price later when the consumer is forced to use the provider's phone plan.\n\nOrdinarily, circumventing the technological restrictions which prevent the user from accessing cellular networks other than the provider's would violate the DMCA. However, the Obama administration signed a law in 2014, creating an exception within the DMCA that permits users to circumvent technological restrictions for the purpose of unlocking their phones. This is called the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act.\n\nBut, many companies still sell locked phones, and they are not keen on people unlocking them. They put notices on the packaging of locked phones, stating that by buying the product the consumer implicitly agrees to their terms of service. Their terms of service state that the user is not allowed to unlock the phone, and that the user agrees that this action would financially harm the company. This presumably means that the company can sue the user (or, perhaps, a tech repair shop that unlocks the phone for the user) for financial damages if the user unlocks the phone.\n\nMy question is: is this really legally enforceable?

The DMCA exception permits unlocking, but it doesn't necessarily invalidate all related contractual obligations.

The banker, bound by client confidentiality, is expected to refuse such requests without proper authorization.

There will be a matter and they typically agree to certain file shares and certain email accounts. And often certain words \\- it is often referred to as go fish. If that come back to be 20 millions documents they will argue to trim the collection. The collection starts the chain of custody. The data is collected (e.g. hard drives), it is typically loaded into a litigation support application. There will be a formal definition of responsive document. In the Enron case it was certain type of trades. Responsive documents are identified and redacted. This is formally called review. Typically each page produced will have a bates number. Then the documents and agreed meta data are produced to the opposing party. There are a few common formats for these load files. Along with the production will be a chain of custody showing what server(s) and people that had access. It is formally called a production. Like me as a programmer they don't typically even let me have access to the customer data. If I have to get in I certainly don't change data but they would need to list me as someone that had access. Not every produced document will be introduced as evidence. The sides have to provide each other and the court a list of documents by bates number. There is no formal chain of custody between the time it is produced and introduced as evidence that I can tell. If the document has been altered it is up to the other side to say no that document has been altered since we produced it. \n\nSo lets say documents were formally produced to law firm A.

You may agree to certain delimiters and 1/2 through a file they will change. Or delimiters conveniently in a meta field.\n\n99% of the time I would not even need access to the actual document. I could just fix the load files with the meta data and have them load the actual documents. But sometimes you get jacked up file names and file paths. With the litigation support service firms I work with I have never had to access the actual document but I have a system guy I can tell here is what is wrong and here is what needs to be fixed. \n\nMost of these ligation support applications are Web (HTML) based so it is hard to have a stand alone version that could be loaded on a lap top and take into court.

Is that all it takes to make this kind of business legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From those articles, it seems that at least some versions of the \"Supreme\" Logo have been successfully registered. Therefore, any \"confusingly similar\" logo would be infringement, and could subject anyone using such logos in trade to an infringement suit. And it seems that the owners of the Supreme line are quite willing to sue.\n\nIt does not, therefore, follow that every possible logo consisting of a red box with white lettering in the Futura font would be an infringement. Similarity depends on the overall effect of a mark, and the main test is the likelihood of confusion or deception of reasonable customers or potential customers. If the text is, say, multiple words, none of which is the word \"supreme\" or any similar word, then it might arguably be not the Supreme logo, but a different logo that has some similar elements. (If you describe it as \"the Supreme logo but\" you make your opponent's case for them.) \n\nWhether a specific choice of words would be confusingly similar is more specific than this forum can get.

It uses a blue box instead of Supreme's iconic red box, creating a significant visual difference.\n2. The text \"Cool Stuff\" is not similar to \"Supreme\" in meaning or appearance.\n3. While it uses the Futura font, the overall design is sufficiently different from Supreme's logo to reduce the likelihood of confusion.\n\nOption A still uses the red box and could be seen as confusingly similar. Option B directly references Supreme, which could be seen as an attempt to associate with the brand. Option D uses a shortened version of \"Supreme\" and maintains the red box, making it very likely to be considered infringing.

In that early form, the King's Court exercised both judicial and legislative functions. In 1215, with the Magna Carta and the beginning of Parliaments, [the House of Lords assumed the judicial functions of the King's Court](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1834884).\n\nPrior to 1876, it was possible for any member of the House of Lords to hear appeals. Eventually, however, the judicial function tended to be exercised by those appointed specifically to judicial office in the House of Lords, although this was not a formal restriction until 1876\\.\n\nSince 1876 and [until 2009](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-types/law-lords/), the judicial function of the House of Lords was formally restricted to be exercised by the [Law Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_Appeal_in_Ordinary) (see s. 5 of the [*Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876*](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/39-40/59/enacted/data.pdf)). However, the outcome of the appeal was also still formally an action of the entire House of Lords, on the recommendation of the panel of Law Lords that heard the appeal (see Stanley Clark, [\"Gentlemen, Their Lordships\", p. 1443\\-44](https://books.google.ca/books?id=OBE7jTuhi74C&pg=PA1443&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)). And custom was that only the Law Lords that heard the appeal would vote, with all other members of the House of Lords abstaining.1 Rather than lords via hereditary peerage, the Law Lords were Lords/Ladies holding special qualifications and having received specific appointment to be a \"Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.\" Among other qualifications, they would have already served in a high court or practised as a barrister for fifteen years.\n\nAs an example of the kind of background a person might have before appointment as a Law Lord, this is [Lord Denning's Wikipedia introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Denning,_Baron_Denning):\n\n> He was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1923 and became a King's Counsel in 1938\\. Denning became a judge in 1944 when he was appointed to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice, and transferred to the King's Bench Division in 1945\\. He was made a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1948 after less than five years in the High Court. He became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in 1957 and after five years in the House of Lords returned to the Court of Appeal as Master of the Rolls in 1962, a position he held for twenty years.\n\nIn 2009, the judicial function of the House of Lords [was transfered to the UK Supreme Court](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-types/law-lords/).

The reason for the limitation is that if your employer asks for money back, you obviously should be able to defend yourself, for example by proving that you never received that money. After five or six years it is assumed that you wouldn't be able to provide any such evidence, so nobody can ask for the money back anymore. \n\nThat's not specific to overpaid wages but quite general. \n\nIn addition there is the question whether the pilots should have known they were overpaid. For example, I'm quite happy with my salary, but if it was less, I would look for and find a different job that pays better. If the company claimed in five years time that I had been overpaid all the time, then I would say that if they had given me the \"correct\" lower payment, I would have found a better job elsewhere, so asking me to repay the money seems quite unfair. \n\n(Why do you need to defend yourself?

I am aware of the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" standard in some legal systems but I'd welcome any more information of text to continue research. For an example, let us assume that it's proven that certain chemical compound can induce a specific disease \\- some type of cancer, for an example. It is also well established that exposure to that chemical is not sole cause of this type of cancer, so there is incidence in a healthy population. So, let say that incidence doubles and it is found that a factory upstream of affected population has been dumping this chemical into water source. Person that has this disease sues the factory. There is no scientific way to prove that the person wouldn't get it without exposure, but it can be proven that this is probable (50%) and that the person was exposed. How would such situation be viewed in continental or common law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As an academic matter, the US system has struggled with this, and law professors spend their lives debating it.\n\nAs a realistic matter, I'd bet that company in your example gets nailed.\n\nOn the theory, the issue here is but\\-for cause. Civil liability requires that the jury find it more likely than not, or over 50% likely, that but\\-for D's actions, P's injuries would *not* have occurred. Your hypo puts it at exactly 50, and tie goes to the defendant, so in this case even the theory is clear. But, say you change it a little bit to make it more like 65 or 70%. Now, you're getting into the territory of the classic blue bus case. A man is hit by a blue bus. Two companies in town own blue busses, and one company owns 90% of them. Can he recover against that company with no other evidence? The black letter answer is no, that naked statistical evidence doesn't cut it. The rationale is that if it were the other way, anytime someone got hit by a blue bus, that company would automatically have to pay out unless they had some evidence to disprove their liability. The burden of proof has been shifted, violating a fundamental tenet of our legal system.\n\nBut, this doctrine obviously poses an issue for plaintiffs like yours. It's one thing to say that someone hit by a bus needs to have more evidence. Theoretically, they could go out and get it: they could find the bus routes and schedules, examine where they were, and show that X company had a bus going by there at that time. They can also canvas for witnesses. It's much harder when, as your excellent hypo touches on, the science is so complicated. One controversial solution that has been debated a lot recently is market\\-share liability, but that doesn't seem pertinent here because you have mentioned another company.\n\nOn the legal realist side. As far as I can tell the system usually finds a way to hold the company responsible. One example is the tobacco litigation. My understanding is the science couldn't definitively *prove* that smoking caused cancer, but it could prove that it raised the risk significantly. Here's some information on that [https://www.tortmuseum.org/the\\-tobacco\\-cases/](https://www.tortmuseum.org/the-tobacco-cases/) from the American Museum of Tort Law, which, yes, is a real thing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a civil lawsuit against a chemical company, it's proven that exposure to the company's chemical doubles the risk of a specific type of cancer.

So, generally speaking, someone who enters the intersection, after coming to a full stop, when it is not safe to do so because someone else is in the intersection, is the one at fault (although, it is certainly possible that more than one car could enter an intersection when it wasn't safe to do so).\n\nIt isn't entirely clear from the facts presented in the question who is at fault, since the key question of who entered the intersection when it could not be safely entered isn't entirely clear from the facts presented in the question.\n\nAlso traffic law liability would not necessarily imply civil liability for damages, particularly if both parties were actually at fault, even if only one was cited with a traffic ticket.\n\nThere are other parts of the Texas Transportation Code which one might expect to apply, that do not:\n\n> \\[U]nder Texas law, drivers turning left must yield to traffic from the\n>  opposite direction. (Transportation Code, Sec. 545\\.152\\) That rule\n>  doesn't specify any particular type of intersection, and it does apply\n>  to four\\-way stops. But it's obviously meant to prevent collisions when\n>  the oncoming driver is not required to stop. . . . when two vehicles\n>  are at angles to each other, the one on the right goes first. But in\n>  Texas, that's true only when there are no stop signs, yield signs or\n>  signal lights.\n\nTexas also does not have a \"first\\-come, first\\-go\" rule, even though many people incorrectly believe that it does, because the effect of the rule that it does have is similar to a \"first\\-come, first\\-go\" rule in many, but not all, circumstances.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: At a four-way stop intersection in Texas, Car A arrives first and comes to a complete stop before turning left.

According to Texas law, which statement is most accurate regarding liability in this situation?\n\nA) Car A is automatically at fault because it was making a left turn, which always yields to oncoming traffic.\n\nB) Car B is automatically at fault because Car A arrived at the intersection first and therefore had the right of way.\n\nC) Liability depends on which vehicle entered the intersection when it was unsafe to do so, regardless of arrival order or turn direction.\n\nD) Both cars share equal fault because Texas has a \"first-come, first-go\" rule for four-way stops, and it's unclear who violated it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. According to Texas Transportation Code Sec. 545.151, the key factor in determining fault at a four-way stop is which vehicle entered the intersection when it was unsafe to do so. The order of arrival or the fact that one car was turning left are not the primary determinants of fault in Texas for this situation. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while left-turning vehicles often must yield, this rule is primarily for intersections where oncoming traffic doesn't have to stop.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because Texas doesn't have a strict \"first-come, first-go\" rule, contrary to popular belief.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect for two reasons: Texas doesn't actually have a \"first-come, first-go\" rule, and equal fault is not automatically assigned in such situations.\n\nThe correct approach is to determine which driver entered the intersection when it wasn't safe, based on the specific circumstances of the incident."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73296/list-of-state-and-federal-authorities-having-regulatory-control-over-microbrewer", "docs_id": 73296, "title": "List of state and federal authorities having regulatory control over microbreweries", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Upstate New York (USA) here.
