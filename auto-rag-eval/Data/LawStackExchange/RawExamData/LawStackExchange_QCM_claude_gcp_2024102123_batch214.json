If the store genuinely encountered unexpected supply chain issues beyond their control, this would likely not meet the criteria for fraud. However, the store may still be liable for civil damages or breach of contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because failing to deliver goods due to unforeseen circumstances does not automatically constitute fraud.\n\nOption C is incorrect because fraud is a complex legal matter, and the customer cannot unilaterally file criminal charges.

You're correct that there is a federal law against murder, [18 USC 1111](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111). However it applies only to a murder committed in the [special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/7). This covers situations like crimes committed on federal lands such as national parks or federal buildings, or crimes on US\\-flagged ships at sea, aircraft in flight, or in space. It does not apply to \"ordinary\" crimes committed at most locations within the US.\n\n[18 USC Chapter 51](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-51) covers a few other situations, such as murder of a federal officer, foreign diplomat, by incarcerated or escaped federal prisoners, US nationals murdering each other while abroad, and so forth.\n\nThe idea is that these restrictions keep the laws within the enumerated powers of Congress as stated in Article I Section 8 of the US Constitution. A federal statute covering all murders throughout the US would probably be unconstitutional for this reason.\n\nSo while what he says is not strictly correct, it is true that in the vast majority of cases, murders are covered by state laws and not by federal laws. Even if one was to agree with Ramaswamy that medical abortions are a form of murder, even still, no federal murder law currently on the books would apply to a typical abortion, except under very unusual circumstances."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the jurisdiction of federal murder laws in the United States?\n\nA) Federal murder laws apply to all homicides committed within the United States, regardless of location or circumstances.\n\nB) Federal murder laws only apply to crimes committed on federal property, such as national parks or federal buildings, and in certain special jurisdictions like U.S. ships at sea or aircraft in flight.\n\nC) The federal government has no jurisdiction over any murder cases, as all homicides are exclusively governed by state laws.\n\nD) Federal murder laws apply to all homicides committed by U.S. citizens, regardless of where the crime takes place, including abroad.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Federal murder laws, as outlined in 18 USC 1111, apply primarily to murders committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.

The title \"Postmaster\" without elaboration or further detail refers to the U.S. Postal Service official who is the top manager in charge of a particular post office, which could have just one or two employees in an rural area, or might have hundreds of employees in a particular post office in someplace like New York City.\n\nIt would be helpful to know why the person asking the question wants to know, in order to determine which position is really relevant and to make a more focused inquiry into that person's relevant duties, responsibilities, and authority.\n\nIn U.S. law it is frequently the case that issues that come up frequently are well defined, but that other issues which come up only infrequently if ever, have answers that are ill\\-defined, vague, or indeterminate.

Since the U.S. Postal Service is part of the federal government, rather than part of the state government, your New York State Assemblyman has absolutely no input or clout on this issue at all. The people you would need to contact would be your local member of the House of Representatives, and secondarily the two U.S. Senators for New York State.\n\nEach elected official in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate has staff members who are devoted to what is called \"constituent service\" which basically means helping ordinary people navigate the federal bureaucracy to meet their needs.

Co. v. Stout*, 84 U.S. 657\\. As I understand it, In general, if a person is injured while trespassing on someone\u2019s property then, unless the injury is due to some specific fault of the landowner, the landowner isn\u2019t liable. After all, if someone trespasses on your property, you shouldn\u2019t be liable for poor judgment exercised by the trespasser, especially since he shouldn\u2019t have been trespassing in the first place. But *Stout* created an exception to this, initially termed the \u201cturntable doctrine\u201d (named after the piece of railroad machinery that that the child Stout was playing on when injured). The idea was that young children are a special case requiring a higher duty of care.\n\n*Stout* was cited soon after in a similar turntable case, *Keffe v. Milwaukee \\& St. Paul Railroad Co.*, 21 Minn. 207 (1875\\). The term \u201cattractive nuisance doctrine\u201d originated in *Keffe*, which explained the attractiveness concept thus:\n\n> To treat the plaintiff as a voluntary trespasser is to ignore the\n>  averments of the complaint, that the turn\\-table, which was situate\\[d]\n>  in a public (by which we understand an open, frequented) place, was,\n>  when left unfastened, very attractive, and, when put in motion by\n>  them, was dangerous to young children, by whom it could be easily put\n>  in motion, and many of whom were in the habit of going upon it to\n>  play. The turn\\-table, being thus attractive, presented to the natural\n>  instincts of young children a strong temptation; and such children,\n>  following, as they must be expected to follow, those natural\n>  instincts, were thus allured into a danger whose nature and extent\n>  they, being without judgment or discretion, could neither apprehend\n>  nor appreciate, and against which they could not protect themselves.\n>  The difference between the plaintiff's position and that of a\n>  voluntary trespasser, capable of using care, consists in this, that\n>  the plaintiff was induced to come upon the defendant's turn\\-table by\n>  the defendant's own conduct, and that, as to him, the turntable was a\n>  hidden danger, a trap.\n\nTwenty years later, the New York Court of Appeals discussed the turntable doctrine in *[Walsh v. F.R.R. Co.](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5914cf45add7b049348205c4)*, 39 N.E. 1068 (NY 1895\\) and said *Stout* didn't apply in that case. Maybe I'm reading *Walsh* wrong, but it seems to me to be saying that *Stout* might apply in some cases, but it doesn't in that specific case.\n\nBut then *[Morse v. Buffalo Tank Corp](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3614924/morse-v-buffalo-tank-corp/)*., 19 N.E.2d 981, 280 N.Y. comes along in 1939 and says\n\n> The general rule which has prevailed since the well\\-known turntable\n>  case (*Walsh v. Fitchburg R.R. Co.*, 145 N.Y. 301\\) is that the so\\-called\n>  doctrine of attractive nuisance does not apply in New York, and that\n>  the only duty which an owner of land owes to a trespasser or bare\n>  licensee is to abstain from affirmative acts of negligence or not to\n>  injure intentionally such person.\n\nAnd from there to the present, supposedly New York doesn't follow the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine.\n\nHow can some states follow it and some others not? I've heard of circuit splits, but they can be resolved by a Supreme Court decision. In this situation, a Supreme Court decision already exists, so I don't see how there can be a circuit split on this.\n\n*(Reason for question: I am taking a paralegal class and one of the exercises asks the student to determine whether the attractive nuisance doctrine holds in the state where the student lives.)*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US Supreme Court only has jurisdiction in federal matters. So if someone is suing under federal law, or there is a constitutional question, the Supreme Court is the place to go for a definitive answer. \n\nHowever, states have their own laws. The Supreme Court cannot tell New York that it *must* apply the attractive nuisance doctrine, as it is neither a matter of federal law nor a constitutional matter. New York is free to make its own laws on the subject, and the New York courts are free to interpret those laws as they see fit. In fact, federal courts are required to defer to New York's interpretation if New York's laws apply to the case, even if the case is in federal court for some reason (like diversity of parties.)

Therefore, John's contract, signed in November 2018 (before the new law came into effect), is likely to remain valid for its full 2-year term. \n\nOption A is incorrect because laws typically don't automatically invalidate existing contracts unless explicitly stated. \nOption C is incorrect because without explicit retroactivity, the law wouldn't automatically shorten existing contracts. \nOption D is incorrect because there's no mention of required cancellation options for existing contracts in the given information.\n\nThe correct answer, B, reflects the principle that new laws generally apply to future contracts or renewals, not to pre-existing agreements, unless otherwise specified."}, "13": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25109/what-kind-of-document-to-keep-an-independent-contractor-waiting", "docs_id": 25109, "title": "What kind of document to keep an independent contractor waiting?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We're a small software consulting shop.

Sweet*, [2018 BCSC 1696](https://canlii.ca/t/hvc04#par129), citing *R. v. J.A.*, [2011 SCC 28](https://canlii.ca/t/flkm1). \"The definition of consent for sexual assault requires the complainant to provide actual active consent throughout every phase of the sexual activity. It is not possible for an unconscious person to satisfy this requirement, even if she expresses her consent in advance.\" *R. v. J.A.*, [para. 66](https://canlii.ca/t/flkm1#par66).\n\nThe Supreme Court has explicitly declined to decide \"whether or in which circumstances individuals may consent to bodily harm during sexual activity\" (*R. v. J.A.*, [para. 21](https://canlii.ca/t/flkm1#par21)). However, in the context of a non\\-sport fist fight or brawl, one cannot consent to another intentionally applying force that causes serious hurt or non\\-trivial bodily harm: *R. v. Jobidon*, [\\[1991] 2 S.C.R. 714](https://canlii.ca/t/1fskj).1 And at the provincial appellate level, it has been held that \"consent is not a defence to a charge of sexual assault causing bodily harm in circumstances where the accused has deliberately inflicted pain or injury upon a person that gave rise to bodily harm\" (*R. v. Quashie* (2005\\), [198 C.C.C. (3d) 337](https://canlii.ca/t/1l3dd) (Ont. C.A.)).\n\nConsent would be irrelevant in a charge of criminal negligence or manslaughter, if the activities were to escalate this far (*R. c. Deschatelets*, [2013 QCCQ 1948, para. 175\\-77](https://canlii.ca/t/fwk0p#par175)).\n\nThe content of advance negotiations is not relevant to whether the complainant was consenting to the impugned conduct, however, it may be relevant as evidence of expectations about *how* consent would be communicated between the parties throughout the conduct. See *R. v. Barton*, [2019 SCC 33, para. 93](https://canlii.ca/t/j0fqj#par93) (citations omitted):\n\n> For example, in some cases, prior sexual activities may establish legitimate expectations about how consent is communicated between the parties, thereby shaping the accused\u2019s perception of communicated consent to the sexual activity in question at the time it occurred. American scholar Michelle Anderson puts it this way: \u201c\u2026 prior negotiations between the complainant and the defendant regarding the specific acts at issue or customs and practices about those acts should be admissible. These negotiations, customs, and practices between the parties reveal their legitimate expectations on the incident in question.\u201d These \u201cnegotiations\u201d would not, however, include an agreement involving broad advance consent to any and all manner of sexual activity. As I will explain, a belief that the complainant gave broad advance consent to sexual activity of an undefined scope will afford the accused no defence, as that belief is premised on a mistake of law, not fact.\n\nSee also *R. v. Sweet*, 2018 BCSC 1696, [para. 141](https://canlii.ca/t/hvc04#par141):\n\n> ... consenting adults may enjoy the personal autonomy to establish rules such as \u201cno means yes\u201d. If so, in my view, this passage suggests a corollary requirement to establish an alternative \u201csafe word\u201d or other mechanism to ensure that each party is also able to maintain their personal autonomy to put an end to unwanted sexual activity.\n\n### Application\n\nA contract cannot provide advance consent, therefore it is irrelevant as to proof of consent during the acts. However, advance agreements can (and several courts suggests *should*) set out the expectations about *how* consent will be communicated. Any evidence of such agreements would be relevant to establishing the defence of \"mistaken belief in communicated consent.\"\n\nNone of this would assist an accused in the circumstance where a court finds that any consent was vitiated because the accused deliberately inflicted pain or injury that gave rise to bodily harm (this position has not been confirmed by the Supreme Court).\n\nIf you are simply asking how to prove a fact in litigation, see [this Q\\&A](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/86826/46948).\n\n---\n\n1\\.

Instead, it recommends clearly communicating that laws will be enforced starting from a specific date (early September), and then bringing in enough police forces to consistently enforce existing laws over several weekends. This approach of fair warning followed by consistent enforcement is presented as more likely to change behavior than just increasing penalties or creating new criminal offenses.

We are in the alpha implementation/testing phase for google play, and discovered the name we chose for the app is the same as a drilling rig parts manufacturing company located in Texas. Aside from the domain name also being owned by that company (doesn't really matter to us), we are concerned with Trade Mark law.\n\nThe mobile app we are developing already has a large marketing channel with a certain amount of anticipated downloads immediate. We could change the name slightly (adding even one letter). Is this even necessary (or effective?) given that this company has no reason to develop a mobile app for public use, and is in a completely different state and industry?\n\nMore specifically, the scenario we are concerned with: Our app quickly gains popularity, google search results for the name bring up our app primarily (not the manufacturing company) \\- this WILL likely happen immediately.

State trademarks are only protected in the state where they're registered. They are cheaper than Federal Trademarks, but you probably wouldn't want to use on if you want your app to be on a larger scale.\n\nWhat you want is the Federal Trademark. Federal Trademarks give you protection across the nation, and allow you more overall legal protection. The Federal Trademark is also divided by class number which specify the category the trademark is in (i.e. \\#162 Paper Making). Each Trademark must be registered in 1 or more classes.\n\n\\-You can find more information about State and Federal Trademarks [HERE](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/state-trademark-or-federal-trademark-which-one-is-right-for-you) \n\nMy recommendation to you is to first determine whether the Texan company holds a State or Federal Trademark (An easy way to tell is that if they have a 'TM' or 'R' next to their logo, it is federal). If they hold a state trademark, you are good to go. If not, you need to cross reference the class number you want, and the class numbers held by the Texans. If they don't overlap, you should be good. \n\n\\-You can find a list class numbers [HERE](https://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/selectnumwithtitle.htm)\n\n\\-You can check the on other company's trademarks [HERE](http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=tess&state=4808:36ee50.1.1)\n\nI helped found a company that had the same name as 3\\+ companies across the US.

Federal trademarks provide nationwide protection and are divided into specific classes based on the type of goods or services. If the manufacturing company has a federal trademark in a class that doesn't overlap with the app's category, the app developer may be able to use the name. This approach allows the developer to make an informed decision about potential risks and necessary actions, such as choosing a different name or seeking legal advice if there's potential for conflict.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply adding one letter may not be sufficient to avoid trademark infringement. Option B is misleading because while a state trademark only provides protection in that state, the manufacturing company could still have a federal trademark. Option D is incorrect because popularity in search results does not determine trademark rights or prevent potential infringement claims."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/57336/is-spitting-on-someone-an-assault-us-and-uk", "docs_id": 57336, "title": "Is spitting on someone an assault?

Corresponding legislation has been enacted covering Scotland and Northern Ireland. Battery is the application of unlawful force, and as well as spitting, covers incidents of pushing and slapping. Spitting, if done deliberately, is seen as an assault. Common assault carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison and/or a fine or community order. A prison sentence is generally reserved for cases where serious mental or physical injury was caused, and higher culpability is present. In other cases, a fine and community order is the more likely outcome. The offender will have higher culpability if they have previous convictions or there are aggravating factors, such as the attack being racially motivated, the assault was premeditated, or the victim was vulnerable. Increased penalties are being considered for offences aggravated by the intention to cause serious harm, such as disease transmission or the fear of it.\n\nEmergency workers, and public transport staff (e.g. bus drivers), are issued with 'spit kits' so they can take a sample if they are spat on (or spat at, and it lands elsewhere and can be collected), and this has secured arrests and convictions by use of DNA analysis.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7N01S.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7N01S.png)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QNhsQ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QNhsQ.png)\n\nEven [threatening to spit at police officers](https://www.gazetteherald.co.uk/news/18384920.man-jailed-coronavirus-threats-spit-cough-police-officers/) can get you six months chokey at the moment.\n\n> Common Assault \u2013 s.39 Criminal Justice Act 1988\n> \n> \n> Assault, as distinct from battery, can be committed by an act\n> indicating an intention to use unlawful violence against the person of\n> another \u2013 for example, an aimed punch that fails to connect.

The customer's inability to pay due to the restaurant's unexpected limitation on payment methods does not constitute criminal theft, as there was no intention to avoid payment. The customer can legally leave the premises without immediate payment. However, the restaurant retains the right to pursue the debt through civil courts if they have means to identify the customer, such as CCTV footage or other identifying information.

It did this by passing the [Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/17-18/4/contents).\n\nSection 1 of that Act also authorised the King to change his title by proclamation but it was understood (see [Hansard](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1927/mar/23/royal-and-parliamentary-titles-bill)) that he would not use the words *United Kingdom* in his title which became\n\n> George V. by the Grace of God of Great Britain, Ireland and the\n> British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith,\n> Emperor of India\n\nSubsequent British monarchs used a similar title and it was not until 1953 that the Queen changed her title to:\n\n> Elizabeth II. By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great\n> Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories\n> Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\n\nso that her title contained *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*\n\nBefore 1953 sometimes treaties were entered into in the name of *Great Britain and Northern Ireland* ([example](http://foto.archivalware.co.uk/data/Library2/pdf/1937-TS0033.pdf)) sometimes in the name of the *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland* ([example](http://foto.archivalware.co.uk/data/Library2/pdf/1931-TS0012.pdf)) but as far as I can see *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland* is used consistently after 1953\\.\n\nSo my question is by what means and when did the title of the country itself change to *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*? Was it a precise event or did the country gradually come to be called that by frequently using that name in international relations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The change in the *royal* title came about following the Imperial Conference of 1926, when the various governments of the Empire agreed that \"the group of self\\-governing communities composed of Great Britain and the Dominions\" were \"autonomous Communities ... equal in status\". The Conference declined to pursue developing any kind of Imperial Constitution, preferring instead to draw out a few specific consequences of that agreement. In [the Balfour Declaration](https://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/cth11_doc_1926.pdf), section IV(a) asks for legislation to change the King's title. There is also a longer discussion in V(a) about treaties, which affects the examples that you give in the question.\n\nBoth of your 1930 examples follow the recommendations in this Declaration.\n\n1. The convention on conflict of nationality laws is entered into by the King, with the governments of his realms separately represented and enumerated. It lists two plenipotentiaries \"For Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". The omission of \"the United Kingdom of\" is not material, much like talking about \"the Kingdom of Sweden\" versus just \"Sweden\".\n2. The agreement on Bulgarian financial obligations is between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and various other governments.\n\nThey both refer to Northern Ireland rather than Ireland but differ in form because they use the different structures of a treaty between sovereigns and an agreement between governments. As noted in the Declaration, prior usage was not always obvious to interpret, because of confusion about whether (say) Canada was meant to be bound by a treaty entered into in the name of the King of Great Britain. Likewise, [R v. Jameson \\[1896] 2 QB 425](http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs5/18962QB425.html) is an important case on extent of legislation to British possessions \\- in the past, it was not always explicit whether an Act was for the UK only, and this had to be deduced from context.\n\nIn debate on the 1927 Act in the Commons, the Home Secretary Sir William Joynson\\-Hicks (as he then was) [said](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1927/mar/09/royal-and-parliamentary-titles-bill):\n\n> It is clear that it is a misnomer to continue to talk of \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\" Quite obviously, since Southern Ireland has been granted Dominion Home Rule, there is no such thing as \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,\" but there is still \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\" Consequently, after full consultation and interviews with the representatives of Northern Ireland, with the Government of Northern Ireland, it has been decided to ask the House to alter the title of Parliament\\- and to make it \"The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\"\n\n[and](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1927/mar/15/clause-2-alteration-of-the-style-of):\n\n> Certain portions of Ireland have, as it were, slipped out of the United Kingdom, and we now call it the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but it is still the United Kingdom, and this is still the Thirty\\-fourth Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nIt is clear that he \\- on behalf of the government \\- saw the Act as sufficient to change anything *already defined in statute* which needed to be changed. (It was also debated whether the Great Seal needed to be renamed as well, etc.) The change to the name of the country did not need statutory authorization in contexts where the old name was not required by statute.\n\n* Diplomatic formulae are not statutory and so aren't mentioned here; the royal prerogative is already enough for the treaty language to be as envisaged going forward.\n* British passports also changed in 1927 to using \"United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland\" in place of \"and Ireland\". At the time, passport issuing was entirely on the basis of the royal prerogative, without any legislative regime.\n* Various other official publications, like statistical reports, used the new name going forward.\n\nSome other provisions in the Declaration were given effect in the Statute of Westminster 1931\\. This should be seen as part of a continuing effort to let the legal situation follow the policy (Commonwealth nations are equal autonomous peers) which itself followed the facts on the ground (the UK government could no longer expect to rule them directly). So there was not precisely a \"flag day\" when the UK's name changed, but there was a process of recognizing that the name *ought* to change, some wrangling over *how*, and the fairly rapid *implementation* of the change in 1927, at least on the part of the UK government itself."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the process by which the United Kingdom changed its official name from \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\" to \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\"?\n\nA) It was a sudden change enacted solely through the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, with immediate effect across all government documents and international treaties.\n\nB) The change occurred gradually over time, with no specific legislation or official process, and was eventually adopted through common usage in international relations.\n\nC) The change was initiated by the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, but its full implementation across various contexts (such as treaties, passports, and official documents) occurred over time without requiring additional legislation.\n\nD) The name change required a series of Acts of Parliament between 1927 and 1953, culminating in the official adoption of the new name when Queen Elizabeth II changed her royal title.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The process of changing the United Kingdom's name was more complex than a single act of legislation, but also more formal than gradual adoption through common usage. The Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 initiated the change by altering the name of the Parliament. However, the government viewed this act as sufficient to change anything already defined in statute that needed to be changed. The implementation of the new name then occurred across various contexts without requiring additional legislation. This included changes to diplomatic formulae (which didn't require statutory authorization), British passports (changed in 1927 under royal prerogative), and other official publications. The process was part of a broader effort to align the legal situation with the changing status of Commonwealth nations, but there wasn't a precise \"flag day\" when the name changed universally. The correct answer reflects this nuanced process of official initiation followed by gradual implementation across different areas of government and international relations."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86142/incorrectly-filing-a-civil-case", "docs_id": 86142, "title": "Incorrectly Filing a Civil Case", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What happens if a civil case is incorrectly filed?

So I remove the pic and article in full and I sent an email apologising for the mistake and even I offer to do an interview to the photographer or something similar, as we don\u2019t have money.\n\nThey replied in identical terms they told @user1889580 \u201cyou have infringed on our client's image, pay us right away to avoid legal issues\u201d, etc.\n\nSo, I reply with a more comprehensive letter, apologising again, explaining that we don\u2019t\u2019 receive money, plus we never make any profit from the work we published. Something easy to prove and in fact I invited them to check in internet, were you find that we don\u2019t receive more than 30 pounds a year. So, I said I would paid something, from my own pocket. \n\nThey haven\u2019t reply yet, but I have been doing a research and talking to colleagues and press associations. And there is a consensus: Copyrigth is a legal company but doesn\u2019t act ethically, they act as scam and there are many complains. Plus I found this: \u201cIn view of German copyright law and the respective jurisdiction of the German courts, the amount that Copytrack claims is far too high\u201d. \n\nThe amounts they usually charge are absurd. For instance, if a photo cost 30 Euros or 100 Euros, Copytrack asks for 500, 600, 1000 euros and more. We think this is because they don\u2019t charge for their services to their clients, so the way to get their fees is by doing this. \n\nI am are aware copyright infringement is something serious and we respect other people\u2019s work, but I want all this managed in a fair, ethical and reasonable manner from both sides. \n\nI have been asking for advice and my colleagues say, I must ignore it. But like @user1889580 , I am worried. I am ready to pay, but to be honest the blog doesn\u2019t have money and me either, so I I have asked for a symbolic fee or for the minimum amount. \n\nI am still checking and doing some research but I would appreciate your advice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Absolute Lofts South West London v Artisan Home Improvements](https://www.bristows.com/news-and-publications/articles/uk-damages-for-copyright-infringement-more-than-flagrancy/) is informative.\n\nIt suggests that the appropriate damages where the breach is not knowingly made and/or quickly remedied is \"the sum that a willing licensee would pay a willing licensor in a hypothetical negotiation\". That is, if you could source a stock photograph then the damages are about what you would pay for it (\u00a310\\-50 say) or if you couldn't source one, what it would cost to commission a photographer to take it (\u00a3150\\-300\\) say.\n\nWith respect to not having any money: the law does not care.

Option B would apply if a stock photo wasn't available and a new photo needed to be commissioned. Option C, while offered by the infringer, is not supported by the legal precedent mentioned.

(The number of electors that the district gets is the number of Senators and Representatives it would have if it were a state, but no more than the number of electors of the least populous state, so effectively the number will always be 3 electors, since each state has 2 senators and at least 1 representative, and there are some states with only 1 representative.)\n\n> Section 1\\.

Bush's presidency). So the issue would have come up then at least, if not sooner. The reasons they look at alcohol abuse is that, as the DoD says, Loose Lips Sink Ships, and as the Romans observed *In Vino Veritas* (In wine, there is truth). They also look into it for matters as an substance abuse issue could be exploited by an adversary or could lead to poor choices.\n\nTypically, these investigations are lenient on youthful indiscretion during college and high school, as it would be near impossible to find a new recruit who hasn't drank under\\-age during college. It's quite common. Additionally, the scope of these investigations is 10 years or to your 18th birthday, which ever is sooner. If Kavanaugh was 17 in 1982, than it would not be covered in a 2001 investigation. They also require that you list six separate non\\-familial witnesses, with four of them being able to vouch for you during the entire portion of the scope's time AND they cannot be family members. Kavanaugh's first background check was when he clerked for the Solicitor General of the United States, in 1990 or 1991 (cannot remember the specific date, but it was early) so his college years could have been investigated during that time, though I do not know what the DOJ process is.\n\nDrinking is not in and of itself enough to get you disqualified, but does need to be assessed with other issues to make a determination on if the subject of an investigation could be trusted to handle classified materials. As it's not an illegal substance, they are looking for a problematic pattern, not if the subject drank underage, even if it was a glass of wine at Christmas Dinner.\n\nIt should be stressed, that this is a very, very, through screening. As one DoD hiring manager I know personally has told me, the general rule for hiring for hiring for a position is that for one billet that needs to be filled, give a conditional job offer to 4 people.

Is there implicit or explicit ways to relate Responsibilities to Rights?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, rights are independent of \"responsibilities\". But, responsibilities is a very broad concept: some aspects of responsibility are encoded in law, others are not. You have an absolute legal obligation to not murder or steal, as defined by the law. Some people say you have a social responsibility to put others before your own interest: this may be legally true in certain contexts, especially fiduciary contexts where your broker is supposed to make decisions on your behalf that benefit you (regardless of personal effect on the broker).\n\nContracts are another source of obligations \u2013 you gain a right (access to someone else's property) in exchange for something, which may include standards of behavior. You thus have a legal obligation on SE to not be hurtful in your postings (enforcement is via suspension, in the worst case).\n\nThe rights spelled out in the Bill of Rights are about the government \u2013 it says what the government may not do, it isn't a source of permission for you to exercise your rights. Generally, the traditional US understanding of \"rights\" is that they are inherent in people and are not \"granted\" by the government, so the Bill of Rights is a codification of what that means.

The key factor is whether financial compensation is received. As long as the developer is not making any money from the project (no kickstarter, no external funding, no sales), they can continue using the non-commercial license. The developer's intentions or future plans do not affect the license status. Only when actual financial compensation is received does the usage become commercial, requiring a switch to a commercial license.

When power is delegated by Congress to a civil servant with civil service protections, the President's authority to direct how that power is exercised is even weaker.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court and conservative legal scholars have toyed with invalidating those laws as unconstitutional if applied in a manner contrary to the Unitary Executive theory, but has certainly not adopted that doctrine wholesale. The non\\-delegation doctrine has been applied inconstantly to limit Congressional delegation of legislative power to independent agencies, and at one high water mark, the Supreme Court invalidated the process of the legislative veto over regulatory action which nonetheless remains on the books in a great many statutes and is honored notwithstanding clear case law disallowing it.

In contrast, different legal consequences are present when someone signs a document, knowing what they are signing, for reasons that rely on false statements that have been made to them, which is called \"fraud in the inducement.\"\n\nIf someone tries to enforce an agreement that purports to be signed, and the person who allegedly signed it claims that the signature was forged by a third\\-party, inconsistency between the signature and other times that the person who allegedly signed something did so is evidence that the signature is a forgery.\n\nBut it is not conclusive evidence. People's signatures change over time for a variety of reasons, sometimes dramatically in a short period of time, for example, in the case of a stroke or a hand injury.\n\nWhen signatures differ over time and there are allegations of forgery, then it is a question of proof for a finder of fact (i.e. a judge or jury) to decide if the alleged forgery is really a forgery.\n\nMany businesses that routinely accept small dollar value personal checks, for example, also take a thumb\\-print of the person signing the check in order to make it cheap and easy to litigate the question of whether a signature on a check is forged, and to discourage litigants from falsely claiming that a check was forged in the first place. This practice was established because lying and claiming that a check was forged used to be a tactic that was used on a recurring basis in civil cases and in criminal bad check passing prosecutions to escape liability."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An employee signs various documents for a company using different methods over time: typed name, mouse-drawn signature, and traditional pen-on-paper signature. Which statement is most accurate regarding the legal validity of these signatures?\n\nA) All signatures must match exactly for the documents to be legally binding.\n\nB) Only the pen-on-paper signature is legally valid; electronic signatures are not recognized.\n\nC) The typed name signature is valid only if used consistently across all documents.\n\nD) All signatures are potentially valid, regardless of method, as long as they were made with the intent to legally agree to the document's content.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. As explained in the legal information provided, a signature's validity is not determined by its consistency or method, but by the signer's intent to legally agree to the document's content. The form of the signature can vary (typed name, mouse-drawn, pen-on-paper) without affecting its legal standing. What matters is that the signature was made by the intended person with the purpose of agreeing to the terms. Options A and C are incorrect because they wrongly assume consistency is required. Option B is incorrect as it disregards the legal validity of electronic signatures, which are widely accepted in many jurisdictions."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52951/does-violating-an-international-treaty-have-any-legal-consequence-in-united-stat", "docs_id": 52951, "title": "Does violating an international treaty have any legal consequence in United States?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm asking in general and also specifically in the example I'm going to show. In my country, international treaties have constitutional level since 1994, which means a violation of an international treaty is a violation of the constitution. For example, Argentina signed the declaration of human rights, so if a law violates a human right here, it's violating the constitution. How is this in United States? Does violating an international treaty have any legal consequence in United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For the US, violating the obligations of a treaty (for the purposes of international law) is not the same as a violation of the US constitution (for the purposes of domestic US law). The US Constitution is higher than treaties, and if a treaty is in conflict with the constitution, courts will rule the treaty null and void for the purposes of US law. See the Supreme Court decision in Reid v. Covert (1957\\). In addition, treaties do not have a privileged position over regular federal law, and simple acts of Congress can amend or repeal treaties for the purposes of US law. See the Supreme Court decision in the Head Money Cases (1884\\). In these cases, other countries may still regard the US to still be bound by the obligations of the treaty, even though the US may no longer be following the domestic law obligations, and thus the US may be \"violating\" the treaty from the perspective of international law.\n\nEven if a treaty has not been ruled unconstitutional and has not been amended by Congress, a violation of it might still not be a violation of US law. For example, Article 33 of the Refugee Convention (which is binding on the US because it's a party to the Refugee Protocol) prevents countries from returning refugees to a country where they are persecuted. But the US government has taken the [position](https://www.justice.gov/file/23326/download) that this treaty provision is \"not self\\-executing\" and does not by itself impose domestic legal obligations without separate domestic legislation (though others [disagree](https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1281&context=facpubs)). [This](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32528.pdf) Congressional Research Service report goes into detail about the issues surrounding the impact of treaties on US law."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal status and consequences of international treaties?\n\nA) International treaties automatically supersede the U.S. Constitution and federal laws, making any violation of a treaty a direct violation of the highest law of the land.\n\nB) Treaties have equal standing with the U.S. Constitution but can be amended or repealed by acts of Congress, potentially creating conflicts between domestic and international law.\n\nC) The U.S. Constitution takes precedence over treaties, and Congress can amend or repeal treaties for domestic purposes, but this doesn't necessarily absolve the U.S. of its international obligations.\n\nD) All ratified treaties are self-executing and automatically create enforceable domestic legal obligations without the need for separate implementing legislation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In the United States legal system, the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and takes precedence over treaties. As established in Reid v. Covert (1957), if a treaty conflicts with the Constitution, the treaty would be considered null and void for domestic law purposes. Additionally, as per the Head Money Cases (1884), Congress has the power to amend or repeal treaties through subsequent legislation for domestic law purposes. This means that while the U.S. might change its domestic law obligations under a treaty, it may still be considered bound by the treaty from an international law perspective. This creates a situation where the U.S. could potentially violate a treaty in the eyes of international law while adhering to its own domestic legal framework.\n\nOption A is incorrect because treaties do not automatically supersede the Constitution or federal laws. Option B is wrong because treaties do not have equal standing with the Constitution. Option D is incorrect because not all treaties are self-executing; some require implementing legislation to create enforceable domestic obligations, as exemplified by the U.S. government's position on Article 33 of the Refugee Convention."}}
