Therefore, no court has had an opportunity to rule on it.\n\nCongress, however, has (at least implicitly) interpreted this clause to mean that all natural\\-born citizens are eligible to be president if they also fulfill the other requirements, regardless of when they were born, so that is the prevailing interpretation unless someone manages to challenge the interpretation either before congress or in a court.

This interpretation has been accepted and applied in practice, allowing modern presidents to serve despite not being citizens at the time of the Constitution's adoption. The Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled on this matter, as the question has not been seriously challenged in court. The interpretation is based on a practical and widely accepted understanding of the Constitution's intent, rather than a literal reading that would disqualify all modern candidates."

According to the documentation, online reviews would be considered hearsay in a legal context. This means they can be used as evidence that the reviews were posted and what they contained, but they cannot be used as direct proof that the claims made in the reviews are true. The reviews don't automatically qualify as witness statements, and they aren't completely inadmissible. They have limited evidentiary value, primarily serving to show that complaints were made, rather than proving the validity of the complaints themselves. To use the content of the reviews as evidence of misconduct, the original reviewers would need to be willing to appear in court as witnesses, which would transform their statements from hearsay into admissible testimony."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In USA, mostly everywhere smoking has been prohibited for a pretty long time now. You cannot smoke in buildings, in libraries, in many city parks and bus stops, whilst dining or partying outside on a patio of a bar/nightclub in many cities, private apartments in some cities, anywhere on campus of pretty much every major research university (prohibition usually comes as a condition of [\"compliance with external cancer research funding requirements\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20170409090508/https://policies.utexas.edu/policies/tobacco-free-campus), and goes as far as not even providing any designated smoking areas at all anywhere on the whole campus) etc.\n\nHowever, with the proliferation of electronic cigarettes, it's been increasingly common that someone always thinks that it's OK to smoke in a confined space next to you. Recently, I noticed that the smokers don't even refer to this as \"vaping\" anymore, but call it straight for what it is \u2014 *\"you smoke?\"*, can be overheard as someone shows off their electronic equipment within a no\\-smoking area.\n\nIt is unclear what's the rationale for such decisions by some members of the public (considering that nicotine is highly addictive), however, a few years ago, I came across a list of smoke\\-free laws, where sometimes electronic cigarettes were specifically outlawed, whereas other times they were never mentioned; this has also been common on some no\\-smoking signs at some establishments, which sometimes expressly prohibit electronic cigarettes.\n\nCasual research showed absolutely zero jurisdictions where electronic cigarettes were specifically legislated as being allowed \u2014 they're always either expressly prohibited, or not at all mentioned. Logically, as nicotine is widely known to be highly addictive, it would seem reasonable to expect that the prohibitions aren't merely meant to address the risk of cancer.\n\n* From the legal standpoint, is it at all reasonable to expect that smoking electronic cigarettes is prohibited by generic \"no smoking\" laws and/or signs, or would it be legally allowed unless certain other conditions are met as well?\n* Does it at all matter that there is no known jurisdictions that allow one type whilst prohibiting the other? E.g., it's basically always the case that either both electronic and traditional cigarettes are outlawed, or there is simply no mention of the electronic ones in the laws and/or the signs.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> From the legal standpoint, is it at all reasonable to expect that smoking electronic cigarettes is prohibited by generic \"no smoking\" laws and/or signs, or would it be legally allowed unless certain other conditions are met as well?\n\nUnder [Wisconsin law](http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/101.123(1)(h)):\n\n> \u201cSmoking\" means burning or holding, or inhaling or exhaling smoke from, any of the following items containing tobacco:  \n> \n>  1\\. A lighted cigar.  \n> \n>  2\\. A lighted cigarette.  \n> \n>  3\\. A lighted pipe.  \n> \n>  4\\. Any other lighted smoking equipment.\n\nAssuming that e\\-cigarettes contain nicotine but not tobacco, it would seem that vaping is not covered under Wisconsin laws prohibiting \"smoking\". It is, however, still a \"[nicotine product](http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/134.66(1)(f))\", so laws applying to \"nicotine products\" would still apply (for example, you can't sell them to minors.)\n\nIt is my understanding that various states word their anti\\-smoking laws differently. You can't make a generalization without looking at how a particular state has worded its laws. See, for example, [this paper](http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/25/e1/e44), which says \"Twenty\\-eight states do not include e\\-cigarettes in their definitions of \u2018tobacco products\u2019 or \u2018smoking,\u2019 eight include e\\-cigarettes as \u2018tobacco products,\u2019 three include e\\-cigarettes in \u2018smoking.\u2019\"\n\n> Logically, as nicotine is widely known to be highly addictive, it would seem reasonable to expect that the prohibitions aren't merely meant to address the risk of cancer.\n\nWhen anti\\-smoking laws were passed, they were touted as a way to prevent people from being exposed to secondhand smoke. If e\\-cigarettes don't expose others to secondhand smoke, then the rationale for prohibiting their use in public areas isn't present. (Although the reason for the law would be more a Politics thing than a Law thing.)",

E-cigarettes typically contain nicotine but not tobacco, so they don't fall under this definition of smoking. However, they are still classified as \"nicotine products\" under Wisconsin law. This means that while e-cigarettes are not automatically banned in areas with generic \"No Smoking\" signs, they are subject to other regulations applicable to nicotine products (such as age restrictions on sales). The correct answer reflects this nuanced legal status, where e-cigarettes are neither explicitly banned nor explicitly allowed in no-smoking areas by default, but are treated as a separate category of nicotine products."

Bob is not under arrest, but Bob knows that the police may consider him a potential suspect. \n\nAny lawyer worth their salt would say Bob should not speak to the police at all, and that is no doubt the safest action. However, if Bob doesn't speak with the police he can't provide them with any relevant information he may have about his associate, information that could assist the police in finding the associate's actual murderer.\n\nSo let's say Bob decides to speak to the police anyways, despite knowing the safest option is not to talk to them at all, in order to share some details he believes are relevant to the case and wants them to know. How can he go about doing so in the safest manner to him?\n\nI imagine hiring a lawyer before speaking to the police would be the best option, but let's say Bob is poor and can't afford the cost of hiring a lawyer, and he can't find a pro bono lawyer either. If Judicial proceedings had started Bob would have a right to an attorney, but since he is only officially a person of interest at this point he would not be provided an attorney either. So what can he do to protect himself when attempting to assist the police?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The best course would be to contact the public defenders office and explain the situation to their intake or consultation services. Remember, you don't have to be going to trial to avail yourself of their services and sometimes, helping cops makes the cops suspicious about you (it would not be the first killer who cozies up to the police to learn what they know about his crime).\n\nIf the Public Defender thinks you're rich enough not to need their services, you should call criminal defense attorney practices. Most law offices will offer consultation free of charge as part of client intake, so they will be willing to hear your case and offer advice.\n\nIn either case, check with the lawyer that attorney client privilege is in effect. If they say yes, explain in detail to them, everything you know and want to discuss, even if some of it could criminally implicate you in this or another crime. Treat it as your deathbed confession and you know full well which circle of hell you're going to if the priest doesn't absolve you of sins (okay, too Catholic... but the Lawyer is not going to turn you in if the privilege is in effect... he could lose his license to practice law over it... we can make all the evil lawyer jokes we want, but this is one of the few sacred tenants of their profession.). Listen to his advise. Also see if you can find a second opinion. It's not that the first guy gave bad advice, but the next guy might give you something different.\n\nIf you still do not feel comfortable, then keep your mouth shut. If they arrest you for the murder, do not talk until you have an attorney present and prepare to tell him exactly what you did. Especially if you did do it. Always answer your attorney truthfully.",

This option provides several benefits:\n\n1. Public defenders can offer consultation services even if Bob is not currently facing charges.\n2. They can advise Bob on the potential risks and benefits of speaking to the police.\n3. Bob can explain everything he knows to the public defender under attorney-client privilege, ensuring his information remains confidential.\n4. The public defender can guide Bob on how to proceed and potentially represent him if the situation escalates.\n\nOption A is risky as speaking directly to the police without legal counsel could potentially incriminate Bob.

However, your description suggests that you might be better off by using two separate contracts.\n\nHaving your client sign two contracts instead of just one is not really an inconvenience, whereas mixing or cross\\-referencing contracts might needlessly convolute the task of ascertaining the parties' rights and obligations.\n\nAt most, the duration or reason of being of the web design contract is limited to the delivery (and fix of bugs) of your implementation. By contrast, you intend the hosting service to be an ongoing matter. This difference in time\\-frames which do not even overlap signals the pertinence of avoiding unintended/unforeseeable effects of contract cross\\-references.\n\nFurthermore, the nature of *hosting* services is too different from designing or implementing to interrelate both types of services. Having separate contracts might be better even if instead of *hosting* you were to offer *maintenance* services upon delivery of your implementation.

This answer reflects several key points from the provided information:\n\n1. It acknowledges that war crimes are codified in multiple sources, including international treaties (like the Geneva Conventions), customary international law, and domestic statutes.\n\n2. It recognizes the unique aspect of war crimes law that allows for potential enforcement against individuals or countries even if they haven't formally adopted specific treaties or laws prohibiting the conduct.\n\n3. It captures the idea that war crimes law is not strictly contractarian, meaning it's not solely based on formal agreements between nations.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they each present an overly limited view of war crimes law:\n\nA is incorrect because it restricts war crimes to domestic laws and prosecutions, ignoring the international aspect.\n\nB is incorrect because it limits war crimes to only the Geneva Conventions and their signatories, which is too narrow.\n\nC is incorrect because it fails to acknowledge the potential for enforcement against non-signatories based on customary international law."

Potential creditors must use \u201creasonable policies and procedures\u201d to verify the identity of an applicant before issuing credit in the consumer's name.

While the utility company incorrectly cited the Federal Trade Commission Act of 2006, the requirement for identity verification is actually based on the Fair Credit Reporting Act and FTC regulations. Opening an account with a utility company is considered an extension of credit, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (specifically \u00a7 605A(h)(1)(B)) requires creditors to use \"reasonable policies and procedures\" to verify the identity of applicants before issuing credit. The FTC has issued regulations under this act to prevent fraud and identity theft.

Based on this case and the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding a situation where someone enters a bank and politely requests money without making explicit threats?\n\nA) The act would be classified as robbery, as entering a bank with the intent to take money is inherently threatening.\n\nB) The act would be classified as stealing or theft, as it involves appropriating property through deception without explicit force or threats.\n\nC) The act would be considered legal, as politely requesting money is not a crime.\n\nD) The act would be treated the same as asking for charitable donations on the street, with no legal consequences.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The case of Missouri v. Coleman establishes a precedent where politely requesting money in a bank without explicit threats or force was not considered robbery, but rather stealing or theft. This is because the act involves appropriating property (money) through deception, without the use of force or explicit threats. The person is acting deceptively by implying they have a right to the money or that the teller should comply, even though they have no legitimate claim to it.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because, as shown in the Coleman case, entering a bank and politely requesting money without explicit threats is not necessarily considered robbery.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because, while the request may be polite, it still involves deceptively taking property that doesn't belong to the person, which is illegal.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because unlike charitable donations, which are voluntary and for legitimate causes, this scenario involves deception to appropriate property, making it a form of theft under the law."

I don't know if there has ever been an attempt by government to compel a judge to give an account of a case that was before him/her. If that is even possible. I'm just wondering what assurances the witness would have that, that conversation would not be used against him/her.\n\nSOURCE: [David SIegel's answer found here.](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74942/can-you-plead-the-5th-in-a-civil-case)\n\n> When the privilege is asserted in a court case, the Judge may question\n> the person asserting it in private, off the record, to determine\n> whether the fear of incrimination is reasonable.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe a frame challenge is necessary, as the underlying assumption of the question, and in particular the material quoted from another answer, is, I understand, incorrect.\n\nThis assertion, in short, is that if an invocation of the 5th is challenged, or perhaps just \"hard to understand (the validity of)\", then the judge may privately question the one asserting the right for more specific details. And from there they may then make the determination of the whether the invocation is valid. I've heard this logic many times myself, and have had it enter my head as fact at some point or another. It seems one of those persistent folk tales about the legal world.\n\nMy best guess is this stems from how the limits of the 5th amendment protection on self incrimination are typically phrased within major decisions, or popular summations thereof (including but not necessarily limited to, or specifically implicating, wikipedia pages). The phrasing I am most familiar with is \"an invocation of the 5th is valid if the person has a reasonable fear that the answer may be used against them in a prosecution\"; perhaps modified, more accurately reflecting the jurisprudence, to add \"or as a link which could lead them to evidence that could be used in a prosecution against them\".\n\nThe mistake then arises in applying an everyday understanding of this phrasing: how else are you to decide if a person is being reasonable unless you question them? Maybe they've got a good reason, maybe they have a psychotic delusion, maybe they're just trying to mess with the court for their own amusement, etc. etc. Surely you have to investigate to find out.\n\nBut within American courts, the term \"reasonable\" in such a standard almost never invokes the everyday understanding like this. Instead, it refers to some abstract and generic entity. A \"reasonable jury\" is not a judgment made about the particulars of a given jury, but rather an artificial construct created within the mind(s) of the judge(s) composed of purely hypothetical and generically \"reasonable\" everyday people. And the legal standard to uphold that the \"reasonable\" standard has been met is not whether the particular person/jury/whatever at hand was acting reasonably in the usually understood fashion. But rather if such an imagined being/group/whatever could possibly act in such fashions.\n\nAs such, if a Judge is considering overruling an invocation of the 5th, they must invoke such an abstracted entity, within the context at hand, and see if they can construe one who reasonably invokes the protection. The judge may be able to use certain facts about the particular entity at hand, depending. If you are invoking the 5th and the record already shows you have an extensive criminal record, the court may consider that this reasonable abstraction also has an extensive criminal record; at which point it may become clear that such a person may wish to invoke the 5th so as not to incriminate themselves in other crimes. Even moreso if the context is a far\\-ranging federal grand jury investigation into organized crime, and the questions you invoked the 5th on regard your connections to events of established interest to this investigation. And this is done without actually further questioning the person, beyond what is already in the record. All the court has to do is imagine some reasonable person with a reasonable fear within the context at hand; if it can, the invocation of the 5th is generally to be sustained. No actual determination of the particular person's \"reasonableness\" is required, or really even permitted.\n\nAll of the latter hypothetical was essentially the fact of the matter in the case [Hoffman v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/341/479/). It is a very interesting and informative read, and I think fairly accessibly written (as long as one isn't too easily thrown off the rails by the citation formatting). It covers a great deal of how any potential challenges to the 5th are to be handled. And the short is as I have indicated above: an abstract \"reasonable\" person is constructed, with such construction informed by the circumstances and knowledge at hand, and judgement of reasonableness made from there. It specifically points out that courts should be mindful of the fact that some people earn a living by violating and evading the law, and they are protected by the 5th as thoroughly and strongly as anyone else is, so the courts should consider the question of whether it would be reasonable for such a person to have invoked the 5th when deciding if it should be upheld.",

Instead, they consider whether a hypothetical \"reasonable person\" in the same context could have a valid reason to fear self-incrimination. This involves constructing an abstract entity based on the circumstances and available information, rather than investigating the specific individual's motivations. The explanation explicitly states that no actual determination of the particular person's \"reasonableness\" is required or permitted. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they involve methods not supported by the given explanation or case law cited (Hoffman v. United States)."

You have established that they owe you money and aren't deciding whether to extend credit which is what a credit report is used to do. A credit report does not identify the assets of a debtor, only their debts. This can be of a little help in the case of secured debt with assets of the debtor as collateral, but there are other public records that can be used to search the secured debt of a debtor (mostly real property records and Uniform Commercial Code records).",

Additionally, credit reports are primarily used for determining creditworthiness, not for identifying assets.\n\nOption B is the correct and most appropriate method. The documentation suggests that retaining a private investigator or a debt collection agency is a common and legal way to gather more information about a debtor. These professionals have the resources and expertise to legally obtain relevant information.\n\nOption C is incorrect because searching for someone's Social Security Number in public records is generally not legal or ethical. SSNs are considered sensitive personal information.\n\nOption D is both unethical and potentially illegal. Posting someone's personal information on social media for crowd-sourcing violates privacy laws and could lead to legal consequences for the creditor.\n\nThe correct answer, B, allows the creditor to use legal and professional means to gather more information about the debtor, which can assist in the debt collection process without violating privacy laws or ethical standards."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer maintains an open-source application project on a public GitHub repository under the MIT license. The project depends on a proprietary third-party library. The developer wants to store the proprietary library's source code in a private GitHub repository and link it as a submodule to the public project. The library's license requires maintaining the confidentiality of its source code using \"at least the same physical and other security measures as Licensee uses for its own confidential technical information and documentation, but in no case less than reasonable measures.\" Which of the following scenarios would most likely comply with the license terms?\n\nA) Storing the proprietary code in a private GitHub repository with a weak password like \"123456\"\nB) Keeping the proprietary code on an unencrypted USB drive in the developer's desk drawer\nC) Storing the proprietary code in a private GitHub repository with strong password protection and two-factor authentication\nD) Uploading the proprietary code to a public file-sharing website with restricted access\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most likely to comply with the license terms. Storing the proprietary code in a private GitHub repository with strong password protection and two-factor authentication provides a reasonable level of security that is comparable to how many developers protect their own confidential information. This approach uses industry-standard security measures and is in line with the requirement to use \"no case less than reasonable measures.\" \n\nOption A violates the terms by using a weak password, which is not a reasonable security measure. Option B, while keeping the code private, doesn't provide adequate protection against physical theft or unauthorized access. Option D, using a public file-sharing site, likely doesn't offer the same level of security as a private GitHub repository and could be seen as less secure than how the developer protects their own confidential information."

UK citizens abroad in an EU country may lose the right to be there, and essentially become instant illegal aliens (using a U.S.\nterm), because of \\#2, unless they obtain a visa like any other non\\-member citizen\n5. UK non\\-citizen residents who are EU citizens may continue to reside legally in the UK, because local UK laws derived from EU law continue to\nprevail until modified (as per \\#1\\).\n6.

A search warrant will have a header identifying it as a search warrant and will have something identifying the court that issued it. It will be signed by some sort of judge.

Also, it's not illegal for someone to lie.\n\nFor example, if Joe tells Bob he will pay him $500 for some work. Joe tells Bob his address but lies about it.

You as an applicant must effectively serve the document for your case to proceed. Sending a mail to a non\\-existent or fake address is against your interest.\n\nDifferent provinces may have slightly or significantly different rules. But usually sending a registered mail alone does not suffice (even when personal service is not required). You need to have a confirmation of delivery, preferably or sometimes imperatively with a signature of the respondent or someone in their household. If you send a mail to a fake address, it would be returned or signed by an unrelated person.\n\nIn that case, you must make a reasonable effort to ascertain where the respondent can be effectively served. If no valid mailing address can be obtained but you know where the respondent is or how to find them, or when personal service is required, you may also be able to, within the rules of the court in question, serve the respondent using a professional process server, or in some cases you could request the help of a bailiff or peace officer, or in some cases any non\\-professional capable adult may be permitted to serve a document and swear an affidavit of service.\n\nUsually as a last resort, a judge may permit a substituted service or alternative method of service, e.g. serving the documents to a known associate (friends, family, employer).",

The key difference between points 1.3 and 1.5 lies in who draws up the order and who checks or agrees to it. In 1.3, when a party draws up the order, it must be checked by the court before being sealed. This is typically done when a judge has given an oral ruling and a party is tasked with writing it down. In 1.5, when the court draws up the order, it must be agreed upon by the parties. This usually happens when the parties have reached a stipulation in court and the judge is writing it down.\n\nOption A is incorrect because 1.3 specifically mentions the order being drawn up by a party, not the court. Option C is incorrect because 1.3 doesn't require both parties to agree on the order, only that the court checks it. Option D, while mentioning a correct detail about the 7-day filing requirement in 1.3, doesn't capture the main difference between the two points and is therefore not the best answer."

Anyways, I don't understand how it points \"to the reasonableness of the clause\" on p. 10? It's wholly unrelated to the car's price because it seeks to exempt DM's liability.\n\n### Fact pattern\n\n> P, a director of a corporation, bought a second\\-hand car from DM (the defendant motor dealership), which could be used principally for entertaining the company\u2019s\n> customers but which would also be suitable for private use by P and the other directors. P managed to negotiate a 15% \u2018trade discount\u2019 on the price of\n> the car. The lengthy contract for the sale of the car, which P signed, contained the following\n> clause on p. 10:\n\n> > DM Ltd will refund the price of any defective goods provided that such defects are communicated to the company\n> > in writing no later than 3 days after the contract of sale is concluded but the Company shall not otherwise be liable\n> > for any loss or damage caused by defects in the goods.\n\n> Before leaving DM, P noticed that the car\u2019s windscreen\\-wiper blades needed replacing. P\n> therefore purchased two new blades from the parts department of DM, fitting them himself. The sales invoice contained the same exclusion clause as that in the contract for the sale of the car and was also signed by P. After using the car for two weeks, P had a minor accident\n> while driving the car in wet weather and the car was damaged. P discovered that the rubber\n> wiper blades had perished and had consequently failed to clear the windscreen of rain. In the third\n> week of using the car, its gearbox seized up and was ruined. DM had failed to refill the gearbox\n> with oil during the pre\\-delivery service of the car.\n\n### Answer from *Q\\&A Contract Law* 2 ed 2019, 78\\.\n\n> However, the [Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (UCTA 1977\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50)\n> seeks to control the use of exemption clauses between businesses.\n> By s. 1(3\\) the 1977 Act applies (subject to s.6(4\\)) where there is \u2018business\n> liability\u2019; that is, \u2018liability for breach of obligations . . . arising from\n> things done or to be done by a person in the course of a business\u2019.\n> As DM is a motor dealership the sale of the car and liability is in the\n> course of a business.

This suggests that both parties had input into the terms, including the exclusion clause. In assessing reasonableness under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, courts consider factors like bargaining power and whether terms were negotiated. The discount indicates a give-and-take in negotiations, potentially supporting the view that the exclusion clause was part of a balanced agreement rather than unfairly imposed by the seller. This could lead a court to be more inclined to find the clause reasonable, even though it might seem counterintuitive that a discount favoring the buyer would help the seller's position regarding the exclusion clause."

At the end of a congress (also called a term), any bill that did not become law (passed by both chambers and signed by the President or any veto overridden) is dead. It may be taken up in a later congress, but it starts again from the beginning of the process.\n\nSee [Article I, Section 7, Clauses 2 and 3 of the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentment_Clause)\n\nThe comments correctly point out that the constitutional provision cited and linked to above does not specify the rule that a bill must pass both chambers during the same Congress (sometimes called the same term of Congress). I am confident that the rule stated above is correct. I have read news stories about bills that did not pass both chambers \"dying\" at the end of a Congress, although I have no citations to hand at the moment.\n\nI have spent several hours over the last two days searching the House and Senate websites, reading the House rules, the Senate rules, and Jefferson's Manual. *Jefferson's Manual* began as notes on parliamentary procedure, made for his own use by Thomas Jefferson during his tenure as Vice\\-President (1797\\-1801\\), based on the then\\-current procedure of the English Parliament. It is the original basis for the Senate rules. I understand that it is still considered an authority on the procedures of Parliament as they existed in the period 1750\\-1801\\.\n\n[*Jefferson's Manual of Parliamentary Practice* section li (a session) (sec 588, page 316](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/HMAN-117/html/HMAN-117-pg315.htm)), reads:\n\n> Parliament have three modes of separation, to wit: by adjournment, by prorogation or dissolution by the King, or by the efflux of the term for which they were elected. Prorogation or dissolution constitutes there what is called a session; provided some act was passed. In this case all matters depending before them are discontinued, and at their next meeting are to be taken up *de novo*, if taken up at all. 1 Blackst., 186\\.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> \\[Sec 590, page 317] Congress separate in two ways only, to wit, by adjournment, or dissolution by the efflux of their time. What, then, constitutes a session with them? A dissolution certainly closes one session, and the meeting of the new Congress begins another. The Constitution authorizes the President, \"on extraordinary occasions to convene both Houses, or either of them.\" I. 3\\. If convened by the President's proclamation, this must begin a new session, and of course determine the preceding one to have been a session. So if it meets under the clause of the Constitution which says, \"the Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.\" I. 4\\. This must begin a new session; for even if the last adjournment was to this day the act of adjournment is merged in the higher authority of the Constitution, and the meeting will be under that, and not under their adjournment. So far we have fixed landmarks for determining sessions.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> \\[Sec 592, page 318] When it was said above that all matters depending before Parliament were discontinued by the determination of the session, it was not meant for judiciary cases depending before the House of Lords, such as impeachments, appeals, and writs of error. These stand continued, of course, to the next session. Raym., 120, 381; Ruffh. Fac., L. D., Parliament.\n\nThe practice of the English Parliament as set down by Mr. Jefferson seems to be the basis of the current US practice, but I can find no law, nor any provision of the current house or senate rules, explicitly adopting or codifying it, or setting it as a rule for the US.\n\nThe official page [*How Our Laws Are Made*](https://www.congress.gov/help/learn-about-the-legislative-process/how-our-laws-are-made#publication) has an extensive discussion of the progress of a bill from proposal to law, but nowhere mentions what happens to a bill not agreed to by both chambers.",

This is called a J.N.O.V. which is an abbreviation for a latin phase that means judgment not withstanding the verdict.\n\nIt would be highly unusual for a judge to do so without explaining the reason for the verdict, which judges almost always do, but that wouldn't influence whether the ruling could be appealed or not in a criminal case.\n\nA judge suffers no consequences whatsoever for decisions made in a judicial capacity. Indeed, it is the duty of a judge, sometimes, to overturn jury verdicts. It is certainly not a ground for removing a judge. But, most judges do face periodic elections and it could be raised as a campaign issue, although probably not a very strong one.\n\nYour outrage is misplaced.

That would mean that inadmissible evidence wound up affecting the trial despite its inadmissibility.\n\nSo, I have two questions:\n\n1. What are the consequences for the person that brought this inadmissible evidence to light? I expect this may vary depending on whether this person is a state official or not, and their involvement in the case.\n2. Will the case end as a mistrial, or will a new trial begin, due to the unlawful influences introduced?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nThis answer is based upon general principles of criminal procedure in the United States which are quite similar in most states, although not necessarily exactly identical. The answer is likely to be different in other jurisdictions.\n\nIf inadmissible evidence is offered by the prosecution and admitted at trial, this is a ground upon which the defense can move for a mistrial (which due to double jeopardy amounts to an acquittal), or upon which the defendant can appeal the conviction of the jury, if convicted.\n\nAcquittals of a defendant at trial cannot be appealed by the prosecution.\n\nBut, to appeal, the error in admitting inadmissible evidence must be contemporaneously objected to by the defendant's lawyer (or the defendant if the defendant is not represented by counsel), or the admission of the evidence must be \"plain error\" (which is very rarely met on evidentiary issues). If the defendant's lawyer doesn't promptly say \"I object\" that ground for contesting a conviction is usually lost.\n\nEven then, the standard of review on appeal is whether the judge abused the judge's discretion in admitting the evidence, not whether the appellate court would have ruled the same way if presented with that evidentiary question.\n\nAlso, even if there is an error, a conviction on a particular count will not be overruled if the error was \"harmless\", which is to say that there is a reasonable possibility that admitting the inadmissible evidence caused the defendant to be convicted of that count. Often, if the evidence is overwhelming, or the inadmissible evidence wasn't that prejudicial, a conviction will be affirmed notwithstanding the admission of inadmissible evidence.\n\nSometimes harmless error is evaluated considering all of the errors at trial as a whole, rather than individually, in addition to all of the other evidence admitted at trial.\n\nIf an evidence issue can be foreseen and is central to the case (e.g. suppression of evidence of possession of drugs in a drug possession case), the issue of the admissibility of the evidence will often be resolved in a pre\\-trial hearing and subject to appeal then, prior to trial, rather than being resolved in the trial itself where the prosecution has no right to appeal, and the defendant risks conviction if the ruling goes against the defendant.\n\nIf the conviction is overturned on appeal, the usual remedy is to remand the case to the same judge to conduct a new trial with a new jury, in a manner consistent with the appellate court's rulings.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential outcomes of this situation?\n\nA) The defendant can automatically appeal the conviction based on the admission of inadmissible evidence, regardless of the lack of objection.\n\nB) The admission of inadmissible evidence will always result in a mistrial, even if the defense did not object.\n\nC) The defendant may still be able to appeal if the admission of evidence is considered \"plain error,\" though this is rarely met for evidentiary issues.\n\nD) The defense's failure to object means the conviction cannot be contested on the grounds of inadmissible evidence under any circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the defense's failure to object usually means losing the ground to contest the conviction based on inadmissible evidence, there is an exception for \"plain error.\" This is rarely met for evidentiary issues, but it does provide a potential avenue for appeal even when no objection was made at the time.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the lack of objection typically means the ground for contesting the conviction is lost, except in rare cases of \"plain error.\"\n\nAnswer B is wrong because the admission of inadmissible evidence does not automatically result in a mistrial, especially if the defense did not object.\n\nAnswer D is too absolute. While failure to object usually precludes appealing on these grounds, the \"plain error\" exception means it's not impossible under all circumstances.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the importance of timely objections, the concept of \"plain error,\" and the complexities of appealing evidentiary issues in criminal trials."

Initially I did not pay much attention as I thought they are spam e\\-mails. But yesterday I received this e\\-mail.\n\n> We would like to inform you that despite our last two reminders to make the payment for this booking order, you are not reacting or answering. We will shortly send you a reminder by SMS and if we do not hear anything from you still, we shall forward the file to our legal representative to start the legal proceedings for the recovery of the amount \\+ 8% interest \\+ costs levied due to these proceedings. As per the Belgian laws and as mentioned in our terms and conditions on the bookings page (see below link), we are obliged to warn the clients 3 times in writing and then we can start charging 8% interest from the day of third warning and start the proceedings of recovery. Thank you for your kind notice of this and any response to our messages.\n\nThe problem is that I never booked any such trip from their website. The website never asked to activate my e\\-mail or my consent before finalizing the booking. They just sent an email notifying me that my trip has been booked, which as I earlier said I ignored.\n\nNow, my question :\n1\\. I travel quite a lot including EU and Belgium and I am little worried. Am I liable to pay them the money? \n2\\. Is it even legal to threat me for such payment? At what point, does it become cyber harassment? It is quite possible that someone mistyped his/her e\\-mail to mine. If no, is there someplace where I can report them? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is likely a simple case of someone giving them your email address by mistake, instead of their own. In any case, if you didn't make the booking you owe them nothing.\n\nYou should respond to the email, stating that you didn't make the booking and that you believe they have a case of mistaken identity. Suggest that they send the SMS message, as it is likely to go to the correct person.\n\nThere is little you can do about people making typos. If you could somehow discover their identity you might be able to seek compensation, but the amount would probably be low considering the amount of hassle it has created for you (not much).",

This approach addresses the issue directly, helps clear up the misunderstanding, and potentially assists the company in reaching the correct customer. Ignoring the communications (A) could lead to unnecessary escalation. Paying the amount (B) is unnecessary and inappropriate since the recipient did not make the booking.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In recent years there has been a fair amount of press about lawsuits brought under the California Voting Rights Act. As near as I can tell, this law essentially requires cities to draw council districts in such a way that the number of districts where the minority citizens\\-of\\-voting\\-age population (CVAP) forms a majority of the total district CVAP is roughly proportional to the total minority population as a proportion of the total population of the city. That is, the number of seats that *should* be \"allocated\" to minorities is determined by total population, but the determination of whether a given district *is* allocated to the minority is determined by the CVAP, not the total population. For instance, if a city has a 7\\-member council and 30% of the population is a minority group, two of the seats should be allocated to that minority; this means two districts must be drawn wherein the CVAP of that minority group forms a majority of the total district CVAP. (I am assuming here that other criteria for application of the law have been met, e.g., that there has been satisfactorily demonstration that the minority group is insufficiently represented.)\n\nWhat I am curious about is whether it can happen that it is impossible to draw such districts due to wide demographic disparities between the total population and the CVAP, and if so, what is supposed to happen under the law.\n\nTo take a random example, according to [data](https://www.census.gov/rdo/data/voting_age_population_by_citizenship_and_race_cvap.html) from the US Census, the city of Santa Maria has a total population that is roughly 71% Hispanic, while the CVAP is about 49% Hispanic. Supposing the city had a 7\\-member council, 71% would suggest there ought to be 5 out of 7 districts where Hispanics should constitute a majority to ensure proportional electoral representation. But because the Hispanic CVAP is only 49% of the overall CVAP, it could be difficult or impossible (depending on the geographical distribution of the population) to actually draw seven districts with equal total population while giving Hispanics a majority of the CVAP in 5 of them. (In fact Santa Maria has a 5\\-member council, but I'm just using these numbers to illustrate the kind of demographic situation I'm talking about.)\n\nSo what I'm curious about is, how is this sort of thing supposed to work? What happens if the demographics and the geography result in irreconcilable disparities between total population and CVAP? Or what happens if districts can technically be drawn to satisfy the requirements, but must be obviously and severely gerrymandered to do so? Has this question ever been raised?\n\nI'm not actually sure that the California Voting Right Act strictly requires that cities play off the total population and CVAP in this way, but that appears to be the basis for some of the decisions that have taken place (see e.g. references to CVAP [here](http://www.goldenstatenewspapers.com/patterson_irrigator/news/local_news/election-district-map-cemented/article_cbd53a54-0cd6-11e6-be7a-ab3d8817dcb8.html)). I would welcome an answer that clarifies the overall mechanics of exactly what cities must do to comply.\n\n(Also, just to avoid any misunderstanding, I want to make clear that I'm not asking this to try to cast doubt on the CVRA or its goals. The reason I'm asking is that the city where I live recently underwent a redistricting to comply with this law, and asked citizens to come up with district maps meeting the criteria outlined above. I tried my hand and found it rather difficult to do, and I wondered if other cities with larger population/CVAP disparities might have even greater difficulties in achieving proportional representation.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: According to the act:\n\n> Upon a finding of a violation of Section 14027 and Section 14028, the court shall implement appropriate remedies, including the imposition of district\\-based elections, that are tailored to remedy the violation.\n\nand\n\n> The fact that members of a protected class are not geographically compact or concentrated may not preclude a finding of racially polarized voting, or a violation of Section 14027 and this section, but may be a factor in determining an appropriate remedy.\n\nI have no idea what an \"appropriate remedy\" would be, in this situation. I guess the law leaves it for the court to decide.\n\nIn practice, it might be difficult to demonstrate that racially polarized voting is occurring, if the minority is not concentrated anywhere. Also, the act says, as its main point:\n\n> An at\\-large method of election may not be imposed or applied in a manner that impairs the ability of a protected class to elect candidates of its choice or its ability to influence the outcome of an election, as a result of the dilution or the abridgment of the rights of voters who are members of a protected class, as defined pursuant to Section 14026\\.\n\nIf switching to district elections would *not* improve the situation because appropriate districts are impossible to draw, then it's hard to say that the at\\-large method is, in fact, \"impairing the ability of a protected class to elect candidates of its choice or its ability to influence the outcome of an election\".\n\nThis act does not specify how districts should be drawn, by the way. I did find [Election Code Section 22000](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2005/elec/22000.html), which says districts must be \"as far as practicable, equal in population and in compliance with Section 1973 of Title 42 of the United States Code, as amended, to the extent those provisions are applicable.\" There's actually nothing currently at that section of federal law, because it was moved, but it refers to the federal Voting Rights Act. It's probably beyond the scope of the question to determine whether the federal Voting Rights Act actually requires the districts to be drawn the way you describe.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA), a city is required to implement district-based elections to remedy a violation. However, the demographic makeup of the city makes it difficult to draw districts that achieve proportional representation based on both total population and citizen voting age population (CVAP). In this situation, what is the most likely outcome according to the CVRA?\n\nA) The city must implement at-large elections instead.\nB) The court will determine an appropriate remedy tailored to the specific situation.\nC) The city must redraw its boundaries to achieve the required demographic balance.\nD) The CVRA violation is automatically dismissed due to impossibility of compliance.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The California Voting Rights Act does not prescribe a specific solution for situations where demographic disparities make it difficult to achieve proportional representation through district-based elections. Instead, the act states that \"Upon a finding of a violation of Section 14027 and Section 14028, the court shall implement appropriate remedies, including the imposition of district-based elections, that are tailored to remedy the violation.\" This language gives courts the flexibility to determine an appropriate remedy based on the specific circumstances of each case. \n\nOption A is incorrect because reverting to at-large elections would likely exacerbate the violation rather than remedy it. Option C is not within the scope of the CVRA, as cities cannot unilaterally redraw their boundaries. Option D is incorrect because the act does not provide for automatic dismissal in cases of difficulty; instead, it emphasizes finding appropriate remedies.\n\nThe correct answer, B, reflects the CVRA's approach of allowing courts to tailor remedies to specific situations, which is particularly important in complex cases where simple solutions may not be feasible."

When the attacker copies the canary file (without permission) and opens it in his computer, he could \\-unknowingly\\- send his IP address to the victim.\n\nGoogle Drive\n------------\n\nA victim can upload a big file that most people wouldn't bother searching for, let alone download, yet an attacker doing research on the victim probably will.\nBy doing so (and under certain circumstances) the following become [available](https://support.google.com/a/answer/4579696?hl=en#zippy=%2Cdata-you-can-view) to the victim:\n\n> User action such as View, Rename, Create, Edit, Preview, Print, Update, Delete, Upload, Download, or Share a Drive file.\n\nGoogle analytics\n----------------\n\nIt can sometimes be used to gather information of would\\-be stalkers. E.g. if a victim creates a website and enables Google Analytics he could place a 'bait' in his webpage like his real name, assuming it's not too common. Then the attacker by searching \"Jake Anderson home address\" would leave traces like:\n\n* approximate age\n* approximate location (e.g. city)\n* search term used to find the site in Google\n\nThis of course requires that the attacker is reckless with his privacy settings which is quite common.\n\nWhat limitations does the GDPR create in the use of such techniques when done with the sole purpose of identifying or getting a hint on the attacker's identity?\n\nNote that in some of the cases above the attacker has given consent to his data being used (e.g. being visible to the google drive account owner).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While some aspects of this might be OK, this sounds like a bad idea overall: such [honeypot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)) strategies are unlikely to yield useful information in a legal manner.\n\nI asked about this topic on the [data protection board](https://dpboard.org/t/can-a-honeypot-to-identify-a-stalker-be-gdpr-compliant/42) and would like to highlight some relevant aspects here.\n\nWhat is the exact purpose?\n--------------------------\n\nUnder GDPR, every processing of personal data must have a clear purpose. Collecting personal data because it might come in handy is not OK. Your suggested purpose is to identify stalkers or hackers. However, this is still fairly vague. What would you do with potentially identifying information?\n\nFor this answer, I'll assume that the goal is to collect enough information in order to file charges. Typically, an IP address is sufficient for this and the court can then subpoena the internet service provider for information on the subscriber for that IP address.\n\nDo you have a Legitimate Interest for such measures?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe GDPR requires that every processing of personal data has a \u201clegal basis\u201d. Consent of the data subject is the most famous basis, but is not useful here.\n\nInstead, we can consider whether this could be a *legitimate interest* (LI).\nArt 6(1\\)(f) GDPR provides three criteria for a LI:\nthe purpose must be legitimate,\nthe processing must be necessary for this purpose,\nand this interest must not be overridden by the rights and freedoms of the data subject.\nThis last point requires a balancing test between the different interests and rights:\nyour interest to make a police report, the stalkers interest in privacy.\n\nTo determine whether the purpose of collecting this data is legitimate, I think it is important to consider whether the threat posed by a stalker or hacker is real and current, or speculative. In a similar context \u2013 video surveillance \u2013 the EDPB writes in its guidelines 3/2019:\n\n> 20\\. The legitimate interest needs to be of real existence and has to be a present issue (i.e. it must not be fictional or speculative). A real\\-life situation of distress needs to be at hand \u2013 such as damages or serious incidents in the past \u2013 before starting the surveillance. In light of the principle of accountability, controllers would be well advised to document relevant incidents \\[\u2026] and related criminal charges.\n\nSo I do not think it is compliant to say \u201c*if* there are any stalkers, I want to gather any data about them\u201d. However, if there have been stalking or hacking incidents in the past which you haven't been able to pursue due to lack of evidence, then this would shift the balance of the LI test to your favour.\n\nIn general, the GDPR does recognize that security measures (cf. Recital 49\\) and data necessary to establish legal claims *can* be covered by a LI \u2013 but this doesn't absolve you from carrying out the balancing test.\n\nWhich concrete measures would be compliant?\n-------------------------------------------\n\nYou have suggested various measures in order to identify attackers. However, the GDPR will only cover measures that are adequate and necessary to achieve the stated purpose, see also the Art 5(1\\)(b) data minimization principle. Here, \u201cadequate\u201d means that that the measure is actually able to achieve the stated purpose. And you are only allowed to collect what is necessary for your purpose, not more.\n\nFiles with tracking pixels are adequate to disclose the attacker's public IP and will not yield unnecessary data. However, the same information could be obtained without tracking pixels by logging the IP in the web server's access logs when the attacker accesses a web page. Under certain circumstances, technologies like WebRTC might yield the visitor's real IP address even if they use a VPN.\n\nGoogle Drive might not actually yield any useful information \u2013 this approach might not be adequate. In particular, it will not log certain information from visitors that are external to the Google Workspace domain. The Drive Audit Log is also only available at higher Google Workspace subscription tiers and is not part of Google's B2C free tier. I don't buy the argument that the stalker would have given consent to tracking through the Google Drive user interface. \u201cConsent\u201d has a very specific meaning in a GDPR context.\n\nGoogle Analytics is quite unlikely to produce useful information. For starters, many browsers block such analytics outright. Even if the analytics work, the data is unlikely to enable identification. GA will not show you the visitor's IP address. The estimated location is derived from the IP address, but often extremely inaccurate (I've seen errors of \\~300km, due to network topologies of residential ISPs). Demographics information are an extremely rough estimate that relies on sharing visitor data with Google, which goes beyond what is necessary. This estimate will be too unreliable to assist with prosecution.\n\nWhat other compliance hurdles could there be?\n---------------------------------------------\n\nSome of the data you would collect would fall under the scope of the ePrivacy directive. For example, you can only set cookies if this is strictly necessary for the service explicitly requested by the user, or when the user has given their consent. For example, this means your proposed Google Analytics solution would require the purported stalker's consent to properly work.\n\nSpeaking of using Google services, it should be noted that these involve processing of personal data in countries that do not offer an adequate level of data protection. The continued use of such services might not be compliant following the 2020 \u201cSchrems II\u201d ruling.\n\nI also have doubts how you could fulfil your transparency requirements in this context. Per Art 13 GDPR, the data subject must receive transparent information about what is being done with their data. Usually, this would be satisfied with a privacy notice that is linked from every web page. However, this will mean that your honeypot cannot be fully covert.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nSome aspects of these proposed honeypots sound quite reasonable.\nFor example, keeping web server access logs for a short duration is likely to fall under a legitimate interest, likely to be permitted by ePrivacy, and likely to yield an IP address that could help with a useful police report.\n\nOther proposed methods such as misusing Google Analytics is less likely to work for technical reasons. All these methods must consider what is adequate and necessary for the actual purpose, and not just speculatively gather data.\n\nFinally, all of the compliance work should be done before the honeypot is set up. Done carelessly, such surveillance measures could be illegal which could backfire.\n\nThis answer has focused on stalkers because identifying those might be useful and possible. In contrast, professional hackers will know how to cover their tracks and will often be beyond the reach of the law. It is very good cybersecurity practice to detect attacks, and honeypots could be part of that. But in that context, it wouldn't be very useful to identify the persons behind an attack.",

Which of the following approaches is most likely to be compliant with GDPR regulations?\n\nA) Implement Google Analytics on all company web pages to collect detailed demographic information about visitors, including estimated age and location.\n\nB) Create fake employee profiles on social media platforms to lure potential stalkers and collect their personal information.\n\nC) Set up a system that logs IP addresses of visitors to specific web pages, but only after documented incidents of stalking or hacking have occurred.\n\nD) Use Google Drive to share seemingly confidential company documents and track who accesses them without the viewers' knowledge.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most likely to be GDPR-compliant because:\n\n1. It has a specific, legitimate purpose based on actual incidents rather than speculation.\n2. It collects minimal data (IP addresses) necessary for the stated purpose.\n3. It can be justified under the \"legitimate interest\" basis, especially if there have been documented security incidents.\n4. IP logging through server access logs is a common and generally accepted practice.\n\nOption A violates data minimization principles and likely requires consent under ePrivacy regulations. Option B involves deception and collecting excessive personal data without a clear legal basis. Option D may not provide useful information and could violate Google's terms of service, as well as potentially infringing on privacy expectations."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As the title states, What fiduciary responsibilities do real estate agents have for a buyer?\n\nAs a example to stir the thought process. Real estate agents have an inherit benefit of a buyer paying a higher price for a home as they get more commission since its based on a percent of the home's final sell price. If you can prove they give you advice in offering a higher price than required to buy the home. Can they be held liable for something?\n\nAnother example, What if you want to make a lowball offer on a home. The buyers agent says \"Hey to guarantee you get the home, you can offer over asking price by 40K and still get the home\". You say to them, \"I can offer at asking or below and still get the home. Why should I over pay?\". They then proceed to say they will put in the offer but never do. Then the home sells for the same amount you proposed to them. Are they liable for not putting in the offer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since you ask specifically about [fiduciary duties](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/fiduciary-definition-2866602) ...\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese exist in common law and are in addition to and complement any statutory or contractual duties.\n\nFirst, real estate agents do owe a fiduciary duty to their clients. The linked article breaks them into six categories, even though the duty is a wholistic one it gives a reasonable framework to think about it:\n\n> Obedience: You must obey your client\u2019s lawful instructions.\n> \n> \n> Loyalty: You must always act in your client\u2019s best interests, even if it means forgoing your own interests.\n> \n> \n> Disclosure: You must disclose any material facts about the transaction, including your relationship to the other party.\n> \n> \n> Confidentiality: You must keep your client\u2019s information confidential unless you have their permission to do otherwise.\n> \n> \n> Accounting: You must keep accurate records of all money and property involved in the transaction.\n> \n> \n> Reasonable Care: You must use reasonable care and skill when handling your client\u2019s business.\n\nUrging a buyer to offer a higher price, even though it is good for the agent, doesn't mean it's a breach of the fiduciary duty. If the objectively assessed reason (i.e. by the judge after the event) is that the advice was commercially sound and in the best interest of the buyer, then there is no breach of duty.\n\nFailing to follow the client's instructions to make an offer is more likely to be a breach of this duty but it still depends on the circumstances. It's always best for the client to give clear instructions, preferably in writing, or the agent may genuinely confuse an *instruction* as a *discussion*. Even where there is clear instruction the agent still has to act in the best interests of the client. For example, if while taking the offer to the seller's agent they are informed \"My client (the seller) has told me to reject all offers below the asking price and to no longer deal with that prospective buyer\" then it would not be in the client's interest to make the offer.",

John tells Sarah he wants to make an offer of $480,000. Sarah advises John to offer $520,000 instead, stating that the market is competitive and a higher offer would guarantee success. John insists on his original $480,000 offer. The next day, John learns the house sold for $490,000 to another buyer. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Sarah's fiduciary duties?\n\nA) Sarah breached her fiduciary duty of obedience by not submitting John's $480,000 offer.\nB) Sarah fulfilled all her fiduciary duties by advising a higher offer in John's best interest.\nC) Sarah breached her fiduciary duty of loyalty by suggesting a higher offer that would increase her commission.\nD) Sarah may have fulfilled her fiduciary duties if she had a valid reason for not submitting the offer, even if she didn't communicate this to John.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While Sarah's actions raise concerns, option D is the most accurate. Fiduciary duties are complex and context-dependent. If Sarah had a valid reason for not submitting the offer (e.g., the seller's agent informed her that offers below asking price would be rejected), she may have acted in John's best interest. However, her failure to communicate this to John is problematic. Option A is incorrect because we don't know for certain that Sarah didn't submit the offer. Option B is incorrect because Sarah's actions weren't entirely satisfactory, especially in terms of communication. Option C is incorrect because suggesting a higher offer isn't automatically a breach of loyalty if it's genuinely in the client's best interest, despite potentially increasing the agent's commission."

The woman appears to be drunk and unconscious, and is being supported by one of the men. The other man smells of alcohol, but is otherwise sober. They try to get a room. The receptionist, aware that the hotel is situated in the vicinity of a red\\-light district, is suspicious and lies that there's no room available. The trio say okay, they'll try another hotel, and leave. The receptionist then calls the police.\n\nCan the police act? On the one hand, the circumstances can be interpreted as a rape has happened or is about to happen, e.g. a date rape drug that knocks the woman out has been administered; on the other hand the receptionist can't be sure of that and the three could e.g. be blood relatives or even good Samaritans.\n\nIf this does meet the threshold for \"reasonable suspicion\", does it further meet the threshold for \"probable cause\"? If this does not meet the threshold for \"reasonable suspicion\", is it worth calling the police in this situation?\n\nIf it matters, the country is Singapore.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Singapore, being a former British Colony, would likely use Common Law Terms like \"Reasonable Suspicion\" and \"Probable Cause\" (Probable Cause is a the general principle that covers terms such as Reasonable Suspicion, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, ect. used in law.). At the very least, it would be reasonable to assume it is Common\\-Law Hybrid at best (Singapore is way stricter to criminals than most Common Law nations by punishment system only.)\n\nThe fundamental misunderstanding of theses terms expressed here is that it applies to ordinary citizens alerting the police. It does not. It only serves as rules of operation that constrain police officers to the limits of what they can do with respect to the case. There should be no reason why your friend should not call the police to (in good faith, mind you) report a possible suspicious action that may or may not be a crime in progress. It could be a crime... it could be perfectly logical explanation.\n\nFor comparison, I had to call police out to my neighbors house after I returned home after dark and observed a man with a flash light looking at a window before running behind their house as I drove into my parking spot. Additionally, I had observed some unusual people who were driving into the end of the street and driving off when approached a week earlier. This of course seemed to me to be the behavior of a possible thief or peeping Tom (On top of that, it was one of the coldest nights of the year, so no body was out in the neighborhood). Cops rolled up and after I explained the situation, one officer knocked on my neighbors door and then returned back. Turns out the guy slinking around the house was an appraiser (explaining the need to look at windows and go to the rear of the house) that the family was aware of (his \"suspicious\" behavior of ducking behind the house as I drove up was just happenstance and as far as I was aware, he never knew I was there).\n\nNow, I didn't get in trouble for this because that is part of the cops' job duties. The situation was unusual enough that there could be something there... at least, something that scared a citizen, but was ultimately perfectly normal and not a threat. Hell, its better to call and be wrong than to not call and be right.",

The receptionist can call the police in good faith to report suspicious activity without needing to meet any legal threshold. It's better for citizens to report concerns and let the police investigate, even if it turns out to be a misunderstanding. The police are trained to assess situations and determine if further action is necessary.

If someone makes these fonts for me for free, does that change anything? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The simplest way to do this is via the contract you have with the programmer, where you state that all copyright arising from this project is assigned to you. There does exist a \"work for hire\" doctrine, but that doesn't mean \"anything you pay to get created\". The problem (in part) is that a program is not included in the list of things that are works for hire: \"literary works\" are not included, and software is considered legally a \"literary work\".\n\nIf there is no money involved, that could be a problem for the customer. Ordinarily, there would be a [contract](http://jec.unm.edu/education/online-training/contract-law-tutorial/contract-fundamentals-part-2) between Customer and Programmer where Programmer creates the font and assigns copyright to Customer (one way of doing it), and in exchange, Customer pays Programmer \u2013 this is known as \"consideration\" (each party does something for the other, which they didn't have to do already). There does not actually have to be monetary payment, but a gift of a font is not a contract, and isn't enforceable in court in the same way. Whereas is the contract states that each party gets something of value, then you would have a contract (assuming you didn't foul up somewhere else).\n\nOne matter that you would want to discuss with the programmer / artist is exactly how much of the work product you want to prohibit him from using in the future. For example, the computer file doesn't contain ink drawings, but such drawings are likely to be necessary in creating the computer file. It may be, then, that your interest is in purchasing a TTF file but not precursor drawings, scans, etc. Or maybe you want everything. Carefully defining the objecting being purchased is a good idea: do not just say \"font\" and think that that is unambiguous.\n\nSince copyright transfer does not happen (in the desired way) automatically by law, under [17 USC 204(A)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/204),\n\n> A transfer of copyright ownership, other than by operation of law, is\n>  not valid unless an instrument of conveyance, or a note or memorandum\n>  of the transfer, is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights\n>  conveyed or such owner\u2019s duly authorized agent.\n\nHence something in writing, with a signature, is required to effect complete transfer of the programmer's copyright. This can be done electronically, so it doesn't need to be ink\\-on\\-paper.",

The documentation clearly states that a written contract assigning copyright is the simplest and most reliable way to ensure ownership.\nD is incorrect because verbal agreements are not sufficient for copyright transfer, and the lack of payment could actually make the agreement less enforceable.\n\nThe key point is that copyright transfer requires a written instrument according to 17 USC 204(A), making a written contract the most secure method for the author to obtain copyright ownership of the custom fonts."

Is this possible whether or not I've named a guardian?\n\nThis isn't about excluding a biological parent; the question is assuming that both parents are deceased. The jurisdiction is South Carolina.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can appoint a guardian, or write in anything regarding the guardianship of minor children into your will. That being said, if you fail to name a guardian, and you die with no other relatives to place the children with, then the court will look to blood relatives before anyone else. It would seem obvious that you'd name a guardian, if you're going to write in who you *don't* want your children with, but I felt I should mention this since you brought up the event of not naming anyone. \n\nMost people who set up a guardianship arrangement have second, and even third choices in place if the first choice is unable to fulfill that great obligation (along with trusts in place for their care and comfort). If you didn't have anyone named, or everyone you had named could or would not do it (one should always get the assent of the named guardian prior to naming them and work out financial arrangements) the court would take your wishes into consideration as a *factor* to consider, but it is not bound by them. If there is a family member who wants or is willing to take the orphaned child(ren), than It is always seen as better, in the absence of a pre\\-arranged guardian or clear proof to the contrary, to place children with family as opposed to strangers. \n\nWhen there is no plan in place, the placement is considered temporary while DHS/DCF investigates the situation and makes a plan for permanent placement. I am assuming you are **not** talking about disavowing the **other parent** \u2013 unless they've had their parental rights terminated for abuse or neglect. If there is a living parent, even if you have full parental rights and responsibilities, that is who the child will be placed with unless that person cannot or will not take custody. \n\nAssuming you're not referring to a parent, as with any court action involving children, a \"best interest of the child\" analysis is undertaken, and in a case like you're describing, many factors would be analyzed like fitness from a non\\-biased perspective (a guardian ad litem is appointed as well as a child services case worker) with frequent visits and interviews, background checks, well\\-being checks, and the like before any permanent placement order occurs. Also, if the child(ren) are older, they will also be heard as to their preference for placement if there are competing interests. Again, this all assumes you didn't name a guardian who was willing to take custody, and the other parent was also deceased or barred by law from taking custody.",

They want to exclude John's sister Sarah, who has a history of substance abuse, from being considered as a guardian. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their options?\n\nA) John and Mary can exclude Sarah in their will, and the court is legally bound to honor this exclusion regardless of other circumstances.\n\nB) John and Mary can name preferred guardians and express their wish to exclude Sarah, but the court will make the final decision based on the best interests of the children.\n\nC) John and Mary cannot exclude specific relatives in their will, as blood relatives always take precedence in guardianship decisions.\n\nD) As long as John and Mary name at least one guardian in their will, the court cannot consider any other relatives, including Sarah, for guardianship.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is correct because while John and Mary can express their wishes in their will, including naming preferred guardians and stating their desire to exclude Sarah, the court is not absolutely bound by these wishes. The court will consider the parents' wishes as a factor, but will ultimately make a decision based on the best interests of the children. The court will investigate potential guardians, including family members, and may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the children's interests. While family placement is often preferred, clear evidence of unsuitability (such as Sarah's substance abuse history) would be considered. The court is not legally obligated to choose Sarah simply because she's a blood relative, but neither is it absolutely bound to exclude her if she's deemed the best option after thorough investigation."

This gives the second part \"no work to do\" (as the court puts it) and since it's there for a reason, that interpretation can't be right.\n\nTherefore the second part extends the first part: work for us during working hours AND don't be \"engaged or concerned in any other trade or business\" at all times.\n\nIs it enforceable?\n------------------\n\nYes. Covenants on restraint of trade are unlawful *unless* they are reasonable to protect the employer's business.\n\nThe \"without the prior consent in writing of the Company\" makes the clause reasonable providing that the Company exercises their discretion reasonably.\n\nRestricting a \"senior software developer\" from writing software for a potential competitor is always going to be reasonable.

You see the chocolate and, of all things, you have a big appetite for chocolate. Because the chocolate is lying on the table so unobserved, the temptation to eat the chocolate immediately is great. But my daughter said she wouldn't do that. After a moment's thought, she said she would put 20 euros on the table and then eat the chocolate and leave a note saying that the chocolate tasted very good. Now I was irritated. Is that actually theft?\n\nI suppose if the owner of the chocolate sees the note and accepts the 20 euros, it would be a legal transaction, wouldn't it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is theft. While theft is defined in different ways in different places, the heartland of theft is \"larceny\" which involves knowingly taking property without permission of the owner, with an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property taken.\n\nIn general, one of the defining qualities of something that is \"property\" is that it can't be transferred without the permission of the owner, except in narrowly defined circumstances where the government authorizes a taking.\n\nIn a very different but analogous context, if a lawyer takes money held in trust for a client out of the client's trust account with the lawyer, without a valid legal basis for doing so, even if the lawyer intends to and does replace the funds in the trust account later, the lawyer is guilty of a crime.\n\n**Unintentional Conversion Compared**\n\nIf you accidentally and unknowingly take someone else's property, for example, taking the wrong coat from a coat rack, or taking the wrong umbrella, and that item is later destroyed, you have committed the civil wrong (a.k.a. the tort) of conversion, but you haven't committed a crime. Crime usually (but not always) involves acts committed with a bad intent.\n\nBut taking someone else's property on purpose, without their permission, is the crime of theft and not just a tort.\n\n**Implied Consent To A Purchase Compared**\n\nThe situation would be different, however, if there is implied permission to purchase the item taken from the person who owns it.\n\nFor example, suppose you walk into a convenience store which sells 20 euro candy bars, but there is no one available to sell it to you because the sole employee of the store is hung over and vomiting in the store's toilet. If you take the candy bar and leave a 20 euro bill at the cash register, you have not committed theft, because in that context, the owner of the property has implicitly consented to sell the candy bar to any member of the general public who wants to buy it for the stated price.\n\nSimilarly, this is why buying candy from a vending machine isn't theft.\n\n**Abandonment Compared**\n\nAlso, it is important to distinguish property that has been abandoned by the owner, to which a \"finder's keepers\" rule generally applies, to property which there is no indication that the owner intended to abandon.\n\nSo, if someone throws something in the trash, or simply leaves what would generally be thought to be trash in public, like a bag of dog poop, that would not generally be theft, since a reasonable person would assume that the property had been abandoned and no longer had an owner.",

Theft involves knowingly taking property without the owner's permission, with intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Even though Alice left money and a note, she still took the chocolates without the owner's consent. The owner's property rights were violated, as they did not have the opportunity to decide whether to sell the chocolates or keep them. Leaving money does not negate the act of theft, as one cannot unilaterally force a sale on an unwilling party. This situation differs from implied consent scenarios (like a store or vending machine) where the owner has clearly indicated a willingness to sell. The chocolates were also not abandoned property, as there was no clear indication the owner intended to give them up."

If so, approximately how much\n> should I expect it to cost? How would it work with the requirement for\n> him to pay the legal fees?\n\nYou would ordinarily either hire a lawyer or bring suit yourself in a limited jurisdiction court (the kind that handles misdemeanor criminal offenses and smaller dollar amounts owed, the exact name of the court differs from state to state). You can always bring suit in the county where the debtor resides. If the loan was not for consumer purposes, you could sue in the place where the loan \"was made\" or in a forum provided by the loan documents (which does not appear to be present), that might be different from the place where the debtor resides.\n\nUsually, you would want to hire a lawyer with offices not too far from the place where you are bringing suit, as limited jurisdiction courts often require in person appearances.\n\nNormally, a lawyer would ask to be paid up front, with you posting a retainer equal to a significant share of the estimated legal fees, called a retainer against which the lawyer would bill until it was exhausted, and would normally bill on an hourly basis. Fees on the order of $1,500\\-$5,000 wouldn't be unusual.\n\nOne factor that would increase the cost would be the fact that your loan is almost certainly at an illegally high rate of interest, and you and your lawyer would have to examine the relevant law to determine the effect of that on the enforceability of your loan, and the correct amount to claim. In some jurisdictions and circumstances, this might make your entitle loan or at least all interest on it and all fees incurred to collect the debt, uncollectible. In other jurisdictions it might just reduce the amount of interest you could recover.\n\nWithout this complication, it might have been a matter you could handle on your own. With this complication, you really need a lawyer.\n\nYou could probably not legitimately claim the full $18,000 plus attorney fees and costs.\n\nSome lawyers would take a case like this on a contingent fee basis with you only advancing court costs and out of pocket expenses like process serving charged, but they'd typically do so only if they were confident that they would prevail at trial and if they were also confident that the debtor had the ability to pay. On a one\\-off basis, a contingent fee percentage of 40%\\-50% would be more common in this situation that the \"usual\" one\\-third contingency rate.\n\n\"Reasonable\" legal fees would be added to the amount you are owed on the loan if the high rate of interest doesn't invalidate this provision. Amounts recovered for legal fees would be paid to you from which you could repay your lawyer whatever you owed your lawyer. In a contingent fee case, usually hourly based fees are awarded and included in the total amount recovered (once the debtor actually pays) and the lawyer would get a percentage of the total collected regardless of what the amount recovered is supposed to be for.\n\nAnother option would be to sell your debt to a debt collection firm which would charge you a small sign up fee and then collect a percentage of the debt recovered. The usurious interest rate involved, however, might discourage them from accepting you as a customer or buying the debt.\n\nIf the debtor is not collectible with a job and/or real estate with substantial equity, you probably won't be able to find someone to take the case on a contingent fee basis at all, and will probably have to pay an hourly rate.\n\n> Do I have the option to take this up via civil complaints? Or is that\n> only for people who are in the same state?\n\nIt isn't clear what you mean in these questions. A lawsuit is commenced by filing a civil complaint, filed by you or your lawyer in a court, and this can be done even if you don't live in the same state as the debtor, although it may be necessary to file it in the state where the debtor lives.\n\nBut, the government won't supply a lawyer to help you collect your debt in the way that it would appoint a prosecutor to bring criminal charges against someone who committed a crime in which you were a victim.",

I ended up wondering about members of Congress, who are protected against arrest and questioning for what they say when Congress is in session ([Constitution Article I, Section 6, Clause 1](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S6-C1-1-3/ALDE_00001048/)). If during a session of Congress, a Representative or Senator urged their supporters to invade the White House, but refused to comment outside of Congress, could they be charged with incitement? Furthermore, if yes (or no), to what extent could this be pushed? Could a member of Congress ask their supporters to assassinate members of the other party? Could the 14th amendment be applied to bar them from office for participating somewhat in an insurrection?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not in court\n------------\n\nThe [speech or debate clause](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_or_Debate_Clause) protects statements made in the chamber from civil or criminal proceedings absolutely.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences?\n\nA) The member can be immediately arrested and charged with incitement to violence by law enforcement.\n\nB) The speech is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause, but the Senate can take internal disciplinary action, including expulsion.\n\nC) The member can be sued in civil court by any individuals harmed as a result of the speech.\n\nD) The Department of Justice can prosecute the member for sedition, overriding constitutional protections.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Speech or Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 6, Clause 1) provides absolute protection for members of Congress against civil or criminal proceedings for statements made during official sessions. This means that the member cannot be arrested, charged, or sued in court for the content of their speech, no matter how inflammatory. However, this protection does not extend to internal disciplinary actions by the legislative body itself. The Senate (or House, for Representatives) retains the power to censure, reprimand, or even expel a member for conduct they deem unacceptable, including speeches made on the floor.

I understand the point about their inability to reinterpret state law already interpreted by state courts.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, it cannot:\n\n* Federalism allows state courts to have the final word on the interpretation of state laws.\n* Article III of the U.S. Constitution imposes a jurisdictional requirement of an actual \"case or controversy\" on all federal courts.\n* Therefore, without the authority to reverse the state court's decision, there is no \"controversy\" in a case where the interpretation of state law is the deciding question.\n\n**Long answer:** When the state\\-law interpretation is adequate to justify the state supreme court's decision and is independent of any question of federal law, a SCOTUS decision cannot change the outcome of the case. And if hearing a dispute cannot change its outcome, you have not satisfied Article III's \"case or controversy\" requirement\n\nThe Supreme Court has pretty much always adhered to the view that it has no jurisdiction to review a state court decision that rested on \"adequate and independent state grounds,\" meaning that the state court decision would not change if the meaning of some federal law changed:\n\n> \\[T]he relations which the State courts sustain to this court are not those of an inferior court of the United States. Congress cannot impose duties upon them, nor invest them with judicial power. They were created by the several States to interpret and give effect to their respective constitutions and laws, and to administer justice according to law. ... Human ingenuity may be challenged to offer a reason why \u2018the judgment or decree\u2019 of the State court should be reversed here upon a point having no relation to, or connection with, the question, in the absence of which this court would confessedly have no jurisdiction whatever of the suit.\n\n[*Murdock v. City of Memphis*, 87 U.S. 590, 612\u201313, (1874\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/87/590/#636) \n\nFor instance, imagine that you live in a state whose constitution provides protections against unreasonable searches and seizures identical to the those in the Fourth Amendment. The police arrest you, and you seek to suppress evidence that you say they took in violation of the state constitution. The state supreme court says the search violated the Fourth Amendment and therefore the state constitution \\-\\- suppress the evidence. \n\nThe state\\-law question is not \"independent\" of the federal question, so if the state court is wrong about what the Fourth Amendment allows, it is also wrong about what state law allows. SCOTUS can hear the case to decide the Fourth Amendment question, which could change the answer to the state law question, change the decision to suppress, and therefore change the outcome of the case.\n\nBut imagine the same decision in a state whose constitution provides protection against unreasonable searches and seizures greater than those provided in the Fourth Amendment. The state supreme court might be wrong about what the Fourth Amendment allows, but it can't be wrong about what the state constitution allows (at least not in any way that matters). \n\nWhat would happen if SCOTUS heard the case? There are two possible outcomes:\n\n* It might decide that Fourth Amendment analysis was correct \\-\\- suppress the evidence for violating the Fourth Amendment.\n* It might decide that the Fourth Amendment analysis was wrong \\-\\- suppress the evidence anyway for violating the state constitution.\n\nIf the outcome can't change, there is no case or controversy, which is also a jurisdictional requirement.

The state prosecutor wants to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's ability to hear this case?\n\nA) The Supreme Court can hear the case and potentially overturn both the state and federal constitutional rulings.\n\nB) The Supreme Court can hear the case, but only to address the Fourth Amendment issue, leaving the state constitutional ruling intact.\n\nC) The Supreme Court cannot hear the case due to the \"adequate and independent state grounds\" doctrine and lack of a justiciable controversy.\n\nD) The Supreme Court must hear the case because it involves an interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The U.S. Supreme Court cannot hear this case due to two primary reasons:\n\n1. The \"adequate and independent state grounds\" doctrine: When a state court decision rests on state law that is independent of federal law and adequate to support the judgment, the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction to review the case. Here, the state constitution provides greater protection than the Fourth Amendment, making it an independent and adequate ground for the decision.\n\n2. Lack of a justiciable controversy: Article III of the U.S. Constitution requires an actual \"case or controversy\" for federal courts to have jurisdiction. In this scenario, even if the Supreme Court were to rule that the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment, it could not change the outcome of the case because the state constitutional violation would still stand. This lack of ability to affect the outcome means there is no justiciable controversy for the Supreme Court to decide.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they suggest the Supreme Court can hear the case, which it cannot due to the reasons explained above. Option D is incorrect because the mere involvement of a federal constitutional issue does not mandate Supreme Court review, especially when there are adequate and independent state grounds for the decision."

Do \"Private Property\" signs imply the same laws as a \"No Tresspassing\" sign?\n\nAt one house in particular, the owner had posted a sign which said \"Private Property,\" but had covered the \"No Tresspassing\" part of the sign with duct tape. We skipped that house to stay on the safe side, but would like to know if there are actually any differences in meaning.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question for trespassing is whether the trespasser has been adequately notified of the possession interest that another person has in the property. Although it is legal to evangelize door\\-to\\-door without a permit, most jurisdictions will require you to leave promptly if the owner asks you to leave. In the absence of such verbal requests, you have a legally protected interest in engaging in conversation with your neighbors. \n\nBased on the law as I understand it, it is likely that your jurisdiction will recognize a right to proselytize to your neighbors door\\-to\\-door regardless of a no trespassing or private property sign. However, for the sake of certainty, here\u2019s a little bit about trespass law. Typically, states have statutes that define what it takes to make a sign \u201cconspicuous\u201d enough to create grounds for prosecution. Such laws include specifications for the thickness of markings and the sign\u2019s distance from the ground. Arkansas statutes have established that a person who enters or remains unlawfully on property has committed trespass, which means that the person must enter or remain in or upon the premises when not licensed or privileged to enter or remain in or upon the premises.\n\nCommunication is key. Arkansas law provides that if the property is unimproved and apparently unused, and is not fenced or otherwise \u201cenclosed in a manner designed to exclude an intruder,\u201d the person entering the property does so with license and privilege. Generally, however, if a person unlawfully enters property that has been improved, he has trespassed regardless of a sign on the premises devoid of some religious purpose for his visit.\n\nThus, there really is not a significant difference between the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign and the \u201cPrivate Property\u201d sign. Both would communicate to any potential intruder that the property he is about to enter is presently being possessed by another person and thus would likely be sufficient to provide grounds for claiming notice in court if a property owner should choose to bring a suit.",

According to the documentation, there is not a significant difference between \"No Trespassing\" and \"Private Property\" signs in terms of legal implications. Both communicate that the property is possessed by another person and would likely be sufficient to provide grounds for claiming notice in court. The key factor is whether the trespasser has been adequately notified of another person's possession interest in the property. Even though \"No Trespassing\" is covered, the \"Private Property\" sign still conveys this message. Therefore, the minister should treat this sign with the same caution as a full \"No Trespassing\" sign.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the legal implications don't change simply because part of the sign is covered. Option B is wrong because the \"Private Property\" sign is generally considered sufficient to establish grounds for trespass.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I occasionally see lawyers refer to something somebody else said or wrote, and they often insert, parenthetically, the words 'in terms'. Here is an example to motivate the question. Imagine there is a written report that makes a series of recommendations. A lawyer might say something like:\n\n> \"The report says, in terms, that procedures must be improved at once.\"\n\nWhat I am trying to understand is: what does the addition of 'in terms', as a parenthetical, accomplish? Put another way, if the phrase were removed, what confusion or ambiguity would be introduced?\n\nOne would hope this would be easy to answer with a quick search on Google. But the words \"in terms\" are so common that it's frustratingly hard. The interesting thing as a layperson is that I could imagine two quite different, and contradictory, meanings.\n\nFor example, does the insertion of 'in terms' mean \"what follows is a paraphrasing\"? As in:\n\n> \"The report said *words to the effect that* procedures should be tightened\"?\n\nOr might it mean the opposite: \"what follows is a verbatim quote\"? As in:\n\n> \"The report said, *precisely and specifically*, that procedures should be tightened\"?\n\nFinally: note that I'm asking here about the specific case of 'in terms' being used as a parenthetical. I'm not talking about sentences where it appears as 'in terms of' or 'in terms that'.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The report said clearly and directly that procedures must be improved at once, but may not have used the exact words \"procedures must be improved at once\". In a legal context, the precise words used by someone can be important, and legal writers may be in the habit of being careful about that detail even in contexts where it is not vital. Often, the writer is trying to summarize a text that is on point, but inconvenient or unnecessary to quote exactly.\n\nIn [R v Brown \\[1993] UKHL 19](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/19.html), Lord Slynn said, on the topic of consent and BDSM:\n\n> I agree that in the end it is a matter of policy. It is a matter of policy in an area where social and moral factors are extremely important and where attitudes can change. In my opinion it is a matter of policy for the legislature to decide.\n\nThen, the [Law Commission report of 1994](https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/app/uploads/2016/08/No.134-Criminal-Law-Consent-and-Offences-Against-the-Person-A-Consultation-Paper.pdf) on that concept was able to say:\n\n> Lord Slynn of Hadley said in terms that the ultimate issue was one of policy.\n\nWhile he did not use the precise words \"the ultimate issue is one of policy\", he said emphatically that this was a policy issue.\n\nSimilarly, from [In re E (a Child) \\[2008] UKHL 66](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd081112/inrea.pdf), Lord Carswell at paragraph 47 said:\n\n> The submission advanced by Mr Macdonald QC for the first intervener NIHRC went equally far. He argued in terms that the positive obligation under article 3 was absolute in its nature and that no element of proportionality entered into consideration.\n\nHe goes on to quote a paragraph from Barry Macdonald's written submission, which does not use the words \"obligation\", \"absolute\", or \"proportionality\", but still makes the stated argument in explicit and forceful language:\n\n> Likewise, the concept of balance is not in play in that the needs of the community cannot be weighed against the right of an individual not to be subjected to torture or other ill\\-treatment reaching the threshold. To express the standard of the state\u2019s responsibility in terms of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 therefore fails to reflect the categorical\n> imperative created by Article 3\\. Considerations of reasonableness may operate in deciding whether a proposed measure is available or likely to be effective to stop the ill\\-treatment in question but not otherwise. In circumstances where the state has it within its power to\n> prevent or stop inhuman or degrading treatment, it must take the measures necessary to do so. The only room for discretion is in determining the most effective means of achieving the object of preventing the ill\\-treatment. There is no room for opting not to prevent it.\n\nWe also often have negative phrases like \"the statute does not say in terms that...\" or \"the witness did not concede in terms that...\". These mean that whatever was said, was not said in an express and obvious way (but perhaps there is still something that can be concluded by implication).",

He decides that he will go and have a bit of restorative prayer at the Christian chapel provided.\n\nNow meet Dan, a devout Muslim who has a 15 hour layover. He is saddened to find there is no area set up for Muslim prayers so he is unable to say any of his Salah prayers.\n\nHas Dan been treated less favourably by the airport and unlawfully discriminated against?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not offering a particular service is not a crime and also not discrimination. In the example stated, the \"particular service\" would be \"prayer room for Muslims\".\n\nThe example provided is not optimal, since airport chapels are normally arranged so that people of every religion find what they need (e.g. they provide the Koran as well as the Bible). Of course, it's possible that Dan arrives just when there's a Christian service in the chapel, but then he can just wait for half an hour or so.\n\nIn the general case, no private entity is forced to offer a particular service. So even the airport would not be forced to offer a prayer room, let alone a *Muslim* prayer room. It could however be illegal discrimination if Dan wasn't allowed to enter a Christian chapel *because* he is Muslim. This is the same as if the waiter in a restaurant denies entry to black people (a serious crime in many countries). But it's of course legal for the waiter to not (specifically) offer food for Muslims (e.g. without pig).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An international airport has a multi-faith prayer room that includes religious texts and symbols from various faiths, but lacks specific accommodations for Islamic prayer (such as prayer rugs or a washing area). A Muslim traveler complains about religious discrimination. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal situation?\n\nA) The airport is guilty of unlawful discrimination for not providing specific Islamic prayer accommodations.\n\nB) The airport must immediately create a separate Muslim prayer room to avoid legal consequences.\n\nC) The airport is not obligated to provide specific religious accommodations, but cannot deny access to the existing prayer room based on faith.\n\nD) The airport is exempt from all religious accommodation requirements due to being a transit facility.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, not offering a particular service (in this case, specific Islamic prayer accommodations) is not considered discrimination or a crime. The airport is not legally obligated to provide specialized facilities for every religion. However, it would be discriminatory if the airport denied access to the existing multi-faith prayer room based on a person's religion. The key point is that while specific accommodations are not required, equal access to existing facilities must be provided regardless of faith. Options A and B incorrectly assume a legal obligation to provide specific religious facilities, while D incorrectly suggests a blanket exemption from religious accommodation considerations."

According to the documentation, when physical property is sold as part of a house sale on an \"as-is, where-is\" basis, the seller typically has no further liability once the sale is completed, provided they have represented all facts accurately and completely. While including a liability clause in the sale documentation can offer additional protection, it's not absolutely necessary if the sale is conducted properly.

We know that its judiciary isn't independent and the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) guidelines are that its judiciary, like anyone else in China, must ultimately serve CCP's interests. So, we have seen multiple examples when Chinese courts used tools like anti\\-suit injunctions and others to discriminate against US firms. We have seen Chinese firm Tencent block live\\-streaming of NBA broadcasts which cost NBA $600M, apparently in breach of its contract with NBA, which NBA even can't seek legal remedy to refund. Obviously, it was because of CCP pressure but NBA even can't enforce its contract.\n\nThere are other examples, too.\n\nWSJ reported some time ago that CCP forced DuPont to withdraw from a lawsuit if it wanted to avoid arbitrary scrutiny. That cost DuPont a valued chemical tech patent. Further, USTR releases each year foreign trade barrier report in which other cases of US companies' unfair treatment by Chinese courts can be found. So one obviously would then ask why Chinese companies are protected under fair legal process in the US.\n\nHuawei and other Chinese companies regularly sue the US government and exercise their unreciprocated constitutionally rights here in the US. And if any US government agency, presumably State Department, provided solid evidence of unfair discrimination against US companies in China in a US court, can US Congress/government pass a law that bars Chinese companies from fair legal protection in the US? And if US courts block that law, what else can the US government do to secure its economic interests that the US courts would deem acceptable that imposes reciprocity assuming that China doesn't accept third\\-party jurisdiction in any scenario?\n\nThe same can be generalised to any country which doesn't have an implicitly/explicitly independent judiciary, as widely regarded in the international arena.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nThe right to Due Process is a personal right of anyone who may come before a US court, or interact with an agency of any US government, Federal, State, or local. It is noit a national right, to be granted ort withheld depending on hoew US nationals are treated by a particular country. No one has authority to deny De Process to anyone who is physically within the US, nor to anyone who is interacting with any part of the US government/the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require the Fedferal and State governments, respectively, to grant Due process to al, and congress may not alter this by law, nor authorize any poat of the government to deny Due Process to anyone for any reason.\n\nDue Process is a somewhat flexible concept, and exactly what process is required may vary in different circumstances, but the basic elements of Due Process are not optional. All this is true no matter ow unjustly the courts or other agencies of a foreign government may treat US nationals. Such treatment may be addressed through diplomatic channels, or through economic or political pressure.",

The government cannot legally deny these protections to foreign entities or individuals, even in response to unfair treatment abroad. Options A, B, and C would violate constitutional principles.

Algorithms themselves are not subject to copyright protection. Copyright can only protect the specific implementation (i.e., the actual code written) of an algorithm, but not the underlying idea or concept. Patents, on the other hand, can protect the fundamental concept of an algorithm if it meets patentability criteria.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a copyleft license like GPL only affects the distribution of the specific code implementation, not the algorithm itself. Others can still reimplement the algorithm from scratch without being bound by the GPL.\n\nOption B is false because copyright does not apply to algorithms themselves, only to their specific implementations in code.\n\nOption D is incorrect because open-sourcing, regardless of the license chosen, does not give the developer control over how others implement the algorithm independently.\n\nThis question tests understanding of intellectual property concepts in software development, particularly the distinction between copyright and patent protection for algorithms."

This period may be extended by two further months (approximately 60 additional days) where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The controller must inform the data subject of any such extension within the first month, along with reasons for the delay. If this extended deadline is exceeded, the data subject can lodge a complaint with their supervisory authority, which is often an effective way to speed up the process.

The proprietor of LearnHub.org are *unlikely* to be an individual and are therefore not a Subscriber under the terms of use. \n\nUnder Clause 2, everything on Stack Exchange is copyright and some things are trade marked as well. The copyright for posts vests in the Subscriber and is licenced to SE (CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0\\) or vests in SE directly as the creator.\n\nClause 8\\.1a. of CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0 **requires** SE to grant a licence to any recipient of a distribution (e.g. on a web site) on the same terms. For this reason the limitations on the copyright in Clause 2 can only apply to those items where copyright vests in SE directly; not to the content of the Subscriber posts.\n\nAssuming that it is only Subscriber posts that they are reproducing then they either need to:\n\n1. Comply with CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0 and attribute the work as required by that licence; what they have put up does not on the face of it do that because:\n\t1. They are referring to an earlier version of the licence\n\t2. Attribution under 3\\.0 is detailed in Clause 4\\.c. and this doesn't meet the criteria.\n2. Have been licenced by the original copyright holder; which seems unlikely.\n3. Meet the fair use criteria; attribution would not be required but would certainly be polite. Fair use turns on the specific facts of the case \\- on the face of it they could put forward a credible argument that their use is fair use.\n\nComplications\n-------------\n\nJurisdiction matters here; copyright laws are not uniform across the world. For example, Australian copyright has a much more limited \"fair use\" concept than the US and also creates a \"moral copyright\" of the *author* that exists independently of the copyright of the *owner*.\n\nFor signatories to the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention); the country of origin for simultaneously published works (which online posting is) and therefore the law applying is the country that gives the shortest term of protection. The convention is annoyingly silent of what that means if there is more than one qualifying \"Country of Origin\"; this leaves scope for litigants to try to apply the most favourable domestic law that could be applicable and the case could be brought in any of several jurisdictions.

Sued for what? Surely the worst\\-case scenario is that somebody writes to me and asks me to take their comment down, and I'll just do it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It first depends on whether the author has granted permission to others to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). Hosting sites often include such licensing as a condition of using their service. Such a license eliminates any risk of a suit for copyright infringement.\n\nSupposing that there is some reddit\\-like site that failed to include a such a license for others (for instance, Reddit requires you to license to Redit, but not to other users), an author might decide to sue someone else for copying and distributing their posts without permission. In the worst case scenario, you might end up in court, being sued for copyright infringement. One way to defend yourself against that suit would be to established that is was \"[fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info)\", for example if you just copied one sentence, and/or you were making a comment on the text. If the author posted a short novel and you decided to copy it and put it on your web page, that would not be fair use and you would almost certainly be found liable for copyright infringement. Then the question would be, what was the damage? That is hard to judge, but it could be expensive, since you deprived the author of a possibly considerable amount of revenue. The bottom line could be in the millions of dollars, but more probably it would be in the thousands. [This article](https://www.dmcaagentservice.com/copyright-infringement-damages/) addresses the ways in which it could cost you. It talks about really huge awards up to $221M, or at least a half a million in the case of George Harrison, but literary works are unlikely to be so lucrative (assuming the author is not J.K. Rowling). The cost of litigating the suit is non\\-trivial: [this guy](https://www.traverselegal.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-pursue-a-copyright-infringement-claim/) says it can go up to 6 figures. It is improbably that an angry author would bother to litigate a case where you redistribute his Reddit post, since he is unlikely to be able to show much actual damage or loss of revenue and probably did not register his copyright. But if people pay for your pirated works per item, that would be revenue owed to the author, so it could get expensive.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner regularly posts screenshots of social media comments on their commercial website without obtaining permission from the original authors. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the potential legal risks and outcomes of this practice?\n\nA) The website owner faces no legal risks as long as they blur out personal information in the screenshots.\n\nB) The worst-case scenario is always a simple takedown request from the original author, with no further legal consequences.\n\nC) The website owner could potentially face a copyright infringement lawsuit, with damages ranging from thousands to potentially millions of dollars, depending on the nature and extent of the infringement.\n\nD) As long as the website owner claims \"fair use\", they are automatically protected from any legal action related to copyright infringement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While many people engage in this practice without apparent consequences, it does carry significant legal risks. The original author of a social media comment holds the copyright to that content, and reproducing it without permission could be considered copyright infringement. If sued, the website owner could face substantial legal costs and potential damages. The severity of the consequences depends on factors such as the nature of the copied content, its commercial value, and whether the copyright was registered. While option A mentions a common practice, it doesn't eliminate the legal risk. Option B underestimates the potential consequences, as a lawsuit could occur without a prior takedown request. Option D is incorrect because claiming \"fair use\" is not an automatic protection; it's a legal defense that must be proven in court if challenged."
