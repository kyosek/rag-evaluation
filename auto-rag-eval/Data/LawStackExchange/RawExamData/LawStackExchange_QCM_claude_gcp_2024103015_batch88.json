One day, John witnesses Sarah collapse in a public park and appears to be having a severe allergic reaction. Which of the following actions would be most appropriate for John to take in this situation?\n\nA) Ignore the situation completely and leave the area to avoid violating the restraining order\nB) Call emergency services but leave the scene immediately without providing any assistance\nC) Provide immediate first aid to Sarah and call emergency services, then explain the situation to authorities\nD) Take a photo of Sarah's condition and send it to her family members to alert them, without directly intervening\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate action in this emergency situation. While John is subject to a restraining order, the legal sources provided indicate that courts generally consider the context and reasonableness of actions when evaluating potential violations. In a medical emergency, providing immediate assistance and contacting emergency services would likely be considered a \"reasonable excuse\" for breaching the order. The court would likely view this as a necessary action to prevent harm, rather than an attempt to violate the spirit of the restraining order.\n\nOption A is incorrect and potentially dangerous, as it ignores a person in medical distress. Option B, while better than A, still fails to provide immediate assistance that could be crucial. Option D attempts to help indirectly but still avoids providing necessary immediate aid and could be seen as an unnecessary breach of the order when direct emergency action is needed.\n\nThe key is that in emergency situations, the court is expected to use judgment and consider the specifics of the case, including the seriousness of the breach and the intent behind the actions. Providing emergency medical assistance would likely be viewed as a justified and reasonable exception to the restraining order."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64926/receiving-a-certified-letter-and-the-contents-is-not-address-to-you", "docs_id": 64926, "title": "Receiving a certified letter and the contents is not address to you", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am in the United States and I have recently received a certified letter that was addressed to me (name and address).\n\nIt's about 80 pages actually.

And sometimes certified mail is delivered without obtaining the signature of any resident.\n\nIf, however, the envelope had your name on it, you were entitled to open it, and are not bound by any confidentiality statements in the cover letter, assuming that you had no previous relationship with the sender. You may well choose to respect them, but you cannot be legally bound unless you accepted such an obligation at some point, usually in a contract of some sort. If you did have a confidential relationship with the sender, then its terms would normally control, whatever they might be.\n\nYou could prepare an envelope addressed to the sender, enclose the document, and mail it back to the sender. You could optionally add a short cover letter explaining how you received the document. If the envelope was addressed to some other person, this would, I think, be the best thing to do. If the document was addressed to you, this is totally optional, you could legally just discard the document and forget about it, and you can probably legally read it and do whatever you like about the contents.

Aircraft are not, however, enentitled to use false markings.\n\nFrom [false flag Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#cite_ref-9)\n\n> In land warfare, such operations are generally deemed acceptable under certain circumstances, such as to deceive enemies, provided the deception is not perfidious and that all such deceptions are discarded before opening fire upon the enemy. Similarly, in naval warfare such a deception is considered permissible, provided the false flag is lowered and the true flag raised before engaging in battle.\n\nWhat happened:\n==============\n\nSokka a member of the water nation defended against an attack by the fire nation.

There are two basic tests: Does the person have a disability, and do they have a disability\\-related need for a service animal? (It *is* allowed to request documentation of the claimed need for an animal, but not e.g. to inquire about the underlying reasons, thus a doctor could just write a note saying \"Smith needs his ferret\". Also, it is only allowed to ask for documentation if the provider does not already know, or cannot readily tell that the conditions exist). Assuming \"yes\" to both questions, the housing provider must \"modify or provide an exception to a 'no pets' rule or policy\". This is mildly confusing because HUD also declares that a service animal is not a pet, so what they must mean is that any policy excluding animals, including but not limited to pets, must be overridden.

This exception applies to \"all areas of the premises where persons are normally allowed to go,\" unless doing so would impose an undue burden or fundamentally alter the nature of the housing services. The landlord cannot restrict the animal to only the tenant's bedroom (ruling out option A), cannot deny the request based solely on other tenants' objections (ruling out option B), and cannot require an additional deposit for a service or support animal (ruling out option D).

Nurdin* in 1841\\. In that case, an opinion by Lord Chief Justice Thomas Denman held that the owner of a cart left unattended on the street could be held liable for injuries to a child who climbed onto the cart and fell. The doctrine was first applied in the United States in [*Sioux City \\& Pacific Railroad Co. v. Stout* 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 657 (1873\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_City_%26_Pacific_Railroad_Co._v._Stout), an 1873 case from Nebraska in which a railroad company was held liable for injuries to a child who climbed onto an unsecured railway turntable. The term \"attractive nuisance\" was first used in 1875 in *Keffe v. Milwaukee \\& St. Paul Railway Co.*, a Minnesota case. The doctrine has since been adopted in some other common law jurisdictions, such as Canada, but not universally.\n\nConditions\n----------\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article listed above, quoting the *Restatement of Torts (second)* \u00a7339, an attractive nuisance is an **artificial** hazard which meets all of the following conditions. Natural hazards, such as lakes, do not fit the rule:\n\n> * The place where the condition exists is one on which the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely to trespass, and\n> * The condition is one of which the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should realize will involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to such children,\n> * The children, because of their youth, do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in inter\\-meddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it,\n> * The utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight as compared with the risk to children involved, and\n> * The possessor fails to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children.\n\nSome US jurisdictions, such as Maryland, do not follow this rule.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner has an old, rusty swing set in their unfenced backyard. The swing set's chains are weakened, and one of the swings is hanging at an odd angle. A 7-year-old child from the neighborhood enters the yard without permission, uses the damaged swing, falls, and is injured. Under the attractive nuisance doctrine, which of the following is most likely to be true?\n\nA) The homeowner is not liable because the child was trespassing.\nB) The homeowner is liable only if they knew children frequently played in their yard.\nC) The homeowner is likely liable because the swing set meets the criteria for an attractive nuisance.\nD) The homeowner is not liable because a 7-year-old should understand the risks of using a damaged swing.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The scenario described meets the key conditions for an attractive nuisance:\n1. The homeowner likely knows or should know that children might trespass to use a swing set.\n2. The damaged condition of the swing set poses an unreasonable risk of harm.\n3. A 7-year-old may not fully comprehend the danger of the damaged equipment.\n4. Removing or repairing the swing set would be a relatively small burden compared to the risk it poses.\n5. The homeowner failed to eliminate the danger or protect children from it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because trespassing alone doesn't absolve the homeowner of liability under this doctrine. Option B is too narrow; knowledge of frequent trespassing isn't required if the condition is likely to attract children. Option D is incorrect because a 7-year-old may not fully appreciate the risks associated with damaged equipment, which is a key aspect of the attractive nuisance doctrine."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42533/when-does-it-become-illegal-to-exchange-bitcoin-for-cash", "docs_id": 42533, "title": "When does it become illegal to exchange bitcoin for cash?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've read several \"stings\" and raids for running unlicensed money transfer businesses for people buying and selling bitcoin on localbitcoins.

Such crimes typically involve money laundering, identity theft, stolen card numbers, and the like. As quoted in [one of the links](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/how-a-canadian-was-charged-with-money-laundering-in-sale-of-bitcoins/article16831445/) you provide, \"*\\[t]he use of bitcoins in the transactions is a new technological flourish to this very old crime*\".\n\n> Is there any direct source or any laws with numbers?\n\nApropos of your first link, mentioning that \"*a Florida judge threw out money transmitting charges against a bitcoiner*\" (see also [here](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article91682102.html)), I will point out that the court's dismissal of charges against that defendant has been reversed early this year. See [*State v. Espinoza*, 264 So.3d 1055 (2019\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/inflco20190130174).\n\nAlthough the judges' narratives of a case are questionable and/or sloppy and to be taken with a grain of salt, the appellate decision cites language from Florida legislation as applicable to virtual currencies (and, impliedly, cryptocurrencies). You will notice that the focus in the *Espinoza* decision is the interpretation of Florida Statutes in its sections 560\\.125(1\\) and (5\\)(a) (regarding unauthorized vendors), and [560\\.103](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0500-0599/0560/Sections/0560.103.html)(21\\), (29\\) (defining *monetary value* as \"*a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in currency*\").\n\nAs usual, each legislation may present subtle and/or fundamental variations. For instance, the court in *Espinoza at 1065* identified that federal law is inapplicable there in that 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010\\.100(ff)(5\\)(i)(A) contemplates that \"*the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency **to another location or person** by any means*\" (emphasis added), and Espinoza's transaction(s) did not involve a third party. By contrast, the Florida statute does not allude to third parties in that transmission of monetary value, hence preventing the statutory sanctions from being *preemptively* foreclosed in the matter of Espinoza.\n\n> What about when someone buys with stolen money or money from illegal proceeds. Did you commit a crime if you sell bitcoin to someone and the money is stolen, or the gift cards are stolen?\n\nThat also depends on the jurisdiction and the facts of the case. In *Espinoza*, he was allegedly informed that the cash he received (or was about to receive) in exchange for bitcoins \"*derived from engaging in illegal activity and that \\[the buyer] was planning to use the bitcoins to engage in further illegal activity*\", *Espinoza at 1058*.

I can imagine two situations in which costs and benefits are such that the tenant might have good reason to reject your offer: \n\n1\\) Suppose the MRC (the tenant) had already made improvements to the property. It expected to recoup the cost of those improvements over the life of the lease. If it simply walks away from the lease, it will lose some of the money it invested in those improvements. \n\n2\\) Hughes, the landlord, *does not* own all of the rights to his property. Because of the lease, the MRC owns the right to use the property for the term of the lease. This right is valuable \u2014 that is why the MRC is willing to pay for it. Depending on how valuable that right is, the MRC might balk at simply giving this valuable property away for free. \n\nAssuming the lease prevents the MRC from subletting the property, then MRC and Hughes are stuck having to deal with each other. Bargaining in these situations is notoriously difficult. The only threat each side has is that it will insist on carrying out the terms of the lease. In many situations, as the OP suggests, such threats will not be credible. \n\n**Note:** Answer \\# 2 illustrates the old saying that property is like a bundle of sticks, with each stick representing control over some aspect of the property. In most cases, no one person owns all of the sticks in the bundle. Instead, rights to control various aspects are held by different people. For example, my neighbors may \"own\" the right to drive across \"my\" property to get to their garage through an easement. The city may \"own\" the right to decide what sort of building I can put on the property through zoning.

The leasehold interest represented valuable property rights owned by the Railway Company (the lessee).

One of the defining characteristics of modern business is selling digital products online, but obviously there are problems with legal protection on that front as it is newer legal territory. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not looking to hire a lawyer or get some kind of formal legal advice, but rather to find the right direction and a proper precedent for people facing this situation. Specifically, what is the best license agreement that allows any random person off the street to be legally protected when licensing purely digital content over the internet? \n\nWhat I mean is, say a business owner or sole proprietor wants to license a digital file, like a picture or audio file so that the buyer can use it to make and sell their own games, videos, commercials and freelance work, educational purposes, presentations, or really anything else that uses multimedia. But, the creator of the original digital product obviously doesn't want a buyer to simply start selling or distributing the individual files themselves or as a collection of files, they original creator or organization wants to retain their rights while preventing the buyers from selling specifically the files or modified versions of the files while allowing the buyers the utility to make commercial end\\-products with it.

You indicate that you want to prohibit resale of unchanged copies of the work, so you could include a license condition that forbids the sale of the unmodified work, but allows the sale of a derivative work. That would mean that the person can't just re\\-sell copies of the original image file, but that can package it with other works and sell a derivative work, or change the formal from GIF to JPG, or add a border around the file, and sell the derivative work. But that doesn't seem to be strong enough.\n\nIt's not clear what distinction you are drawing between forbidding the sale of \"the files or modified versions of the files\", but allowing \"the utility to make commercial end\\-products with it\". In order to \"use\" the material, you are copying it and transforming it in some way. You might be able to craft language in a specific license to use a high\\-resolution digital representation of a unicorn, which allows a certain free use of copies with a certain level of degradation, such as 5% of the original resolution and limited to 8 bit color.

So website operators can either ask for consent or serve the fonts from their own server instead.\n\nBut, what if my entire site is hosted at Google? Obviously Google receives the visitors' IP addresses starting with the very first HTTP request and I get no chance to ask them for permission BEFORE that happens.

When engaging a data processor they must be legally bound to only use the data on your behalf, for example with a contract / data processing agreement (DPA). See Art 28 GDPR.\n\nData processor status is attractive because processors are seen as an extension of the controller. In contrast, when sharing data with other controllers you would need a separate legal basis to authorize this sharing.\n\nGoogle offers tons of different services, so this question needs to be considered on a case by case basis. For Google Cloud services or Google Workplace, Google generally acts as a data processor. For other services, Google acts as a controller. Notably, Google Fonts does not offer a DPA so that you cannot claim they're acting as a processor in that context, regardless of what other Google services you use.\n\nAn equally important problem when using Google services is the data transfer problem. Google is controlled from the US, but the US do not offer an adequate level of data protection (see the Schrems II judgement). Comparatively few Google services allow you to select where the servers are located, as to prevent transfers of personal data to countries where privacy cannot be guaranteed. For example, this is why Google Analytics (GA) is problematic. Google acts as a data processor for basic GA features but makes no promises about the location of servers. Thus, using GA implies a (probably) illegal transfer of personal data to the US.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small EU-based company is considering using Google Cloud to host its website and Google Fonts for typography.

Word searches work well for some kinds of case law issues, but poorly for statutes and regulations. Some issues, however, are hard to research with word searches, even if they involve case law.\n\nWestlaw codes the important legal holdings of every published case in categories based upon their \"key\" system which has a subject\\-matter based digest of all case law. If you find one case with a key code that is on point, you can search all 50 states for that.\n\nThe \"Restatements of Law\" (e.g. Restatement of Contracts, Restatement of Torts) purports to be a summary of the majority common law rules in the named subject area, although it often reflects the lead author and supporting drafting committee's view on the \"better rule\" rather than the majority rule. These are very influential and often cited by courts in states where there is no case law on point. Some have been updated several times to reflect changes in the common law over time in different subject areas (e.g. the original Restatement of Contracts favored form over substances in a way that the later version do not). The American Bar Association signs off on these before they are published.\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures promulgates \"Uniform\" and \"Model\" acts that states may adopt with or without amendment and tracks which states have adopted them and with what modifications.\n\nMost areas of law are the subject of legal treatises that make comprehensive 50 state summaries of relevant case law, one or two of which are typically the \"leading treaties\" and widely used and relied upon.\n\nMany law review articles will do summaries of as many states' laws as possible on a given issue.\n\nMany lobbying and special interest groups and also nolo.com prepare 50 state summaries. A good, reasonably up to date and accurate source on many topics is Wikipedia.\n\nUltimately, all secondary sources rely on somebody digging through state statutes in every state, analyzing them and coding them accurately, usually with citations to the source material. In fast changing areas of law this can be tricky, since laws of the same subject could be codified in different kinds of places (e.g. one might put something in a criminal code, while another might put it in a public health code or a regulation rather than a statute).\n\nEvery legal search engine (there are about half a dozen main ones, one or two of which are free) allows for 50 state searches in some form of primary legal materials like statutes and published appellate cases.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A legal researcher is tasked with comparing marijuana possession laws across all 50 U.S. states.

If your business has goods or services sold in more than one category using the same mark, you can protect it in every category that applies.\n\nWith respect to each category, if a good or service in a category sold with a mark just like yours would harm your sales of goods and services that you currently provide, then it makes sense to seek a mark in that category. If your product line expands, you can also add categories later if someone else using the same mark or a confusingly similar one hasn't moved into that market in the meantime.\n\nIn the case of a medical manufacturing company, the cost of obtaining a trademark in an additional category after the first category (several thousand dollars or less), relative to the economic importance of the company's trademarks and the economic scale of your operations (which should be in the multiple millions of dollars), is so small that cost should be a non\\-issue. So, you should apply for a trademark in every category that you could plausibly and truthfully be said to do business in.\n\nIf you can't afford a few thousand dollars to perfect a trademark in a few additional categories, you should think twice about whether investing in trademark registration at all makes any sense, because enforcing a trademark in the face of potential infringement is far more expensive (tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars for each infringer who doesn't go away with a mere cease and desist letter and thousands of dollars a year monitoring the market for infringement) and if you fail to enforce your trademark in the face of clear evidence of infringement, you risk your trademark losing its validity entirely.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A medical device company is considering trademarking its brand.

As explained in the documentation, applying for trademarks in multiple categories is advisable when a business operates across different areas. In this case, the company produces medical devices (category 010) and offers design services (category 044). \n\nOption A is incomplete as it only covers the devices, neglecting the service aspect. Option B similarly fails to protect the physical products. Option D is risky, as waiting could allow competitors to claim similar marks in the meantime. \n\nThe documentation emphasizes that the cost of additional categories is relatively small compared to the overall value of trademark protection and the scale of operations for a medical device company.

The broadest is the non\\-legal \"in order to avoid all negative consequences\", in which case probably any and all. From the legal POV, you can distinguish two varieties of compulsion, one being ordinary tort or contractual liability. Theoretically, I could try to sue anybody that uses color distinctions to convey information on a web page. As an out\\-of\\-the\\-blue web surfer (no pun intended) I would probably have no luck. However, I might have a contractual relationship with a website, where I pay big money and they provide me information, only they do it via virtually imperceptable color differences like 123456 vs 123459\\. It is possible (but certainly not a foregone conclusion) that they would be in breach of the agreement. One would have to look at the contract. That then leaves the possibility that there is a federal or state regulation that obligates some/all web pages to comply with certain standards (which could lead to a discrimination suit). The short answer is, there aren't any across\\-the\\-board requirements. There are very many specific requirements.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the two relevant pieces of law are the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990) and the [Rehabilitation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973). Whether or not you have to do something to comply with these acts depends on what you are doing. One reason would be in connection with employment: as an employer, I have some legal obligation to comply. Regarding 42 USC 12111, an employer is\n\n> a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more\n>  employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in\n>  the current or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such person,\n>  except that, for two years following the effective date of this\n>  subchapter, an employer means a person engaged in an industry\n>  affecting commerce who has 25 or more employees for each working day\n>  in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding year,\n>  and any agent of such person\n\nand then it mentions exclusions, such as an Indian tribe, or the US, or a corporation owned entirely by the US government, etc. As an employer, I would have to make reasonable accommodations for a qualified individual (these are terms defined in the statute). The latter *may* include \"making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities\". If the web page (which the employee has to use on the job) employs the color scheme \"light greenish yellow vs. light yellowish green\" for conveying important information, and if that could be trivially re\\-coded to black and white by changing two constants, then that would be a reasonable accommodation (probably), where if it required massive and expensive reprogramming, that would not be reasonable. Even then, it would depend on the disability in question. There is a federal agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has jurisdiction over that and can decide what is a disability for their purposes. As far as I know, color blindness is not a protected disability, and the [EEOC Q\\&A on vision impairment](http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/qa_vision.cfm) and ADA does not suggest that this is a protected disability. That page has extensive examples that you can work through to get a feel for who might be covered, and what accommodations are reasonable.\n\nPursuant to [section 508](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973) of the (amended) Rehabilitation Act, the Federal government has to provide access to information for disabled persons that is comparable to that available to others. An obvious example of that would be web pages that could be listened to rather than only being read. This doesn't per se apply to private web pages, as long as you are not receiving federal funds. Also, this is not an absolute requirement, so if it would impose an undue burden on the agency to comply, then they can be in less than full compliance. Even so, assuming that color\\-blindness is not yet a legal disability, the widespread color abuses on web pages are not legally covered.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small tech company with 20 employees is developing a web application for a federal government agency.

Option A is incorrect because there are no across-the-board requirements for all websites to follow WCAG. Option B is incorrect because while color blindness may not be explicitly listed as a protected disability, the company still has obligations under federal law in this scenario. Option C is partially correct in that the company would need to make reasonable accommodations for employees, but it misses the key point about the federal agency client. \n\nThe correct answer is D because the company is developing an application for a federal agency, which falls under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

It does, however, not grant the same right to aunts and nephews etc. (including those by adoption), which could engender competing claims about legislative intent. It would then be relevant to look at the Washington analog of this statute, [RCW 26\\.04\\.020](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.04.020), which prohibits marriage:\n\n> (1\\)(b) When the spouses are nearer of kin to each other than second\n>  cousins, whether of the whole or half blood computing by the rules of\n>  the civil law.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) It is unlawful for any person to marry his or her sibling, child,\n>  grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew.\n\nHere, the blood\\-relation rule applies to (second) cousins and is absolute for aunts and sibling.

On gross earnings of $100k, the difference can be several thousand dollars.\n\nWhen the advice given is a government website specifically intended to give advice in this area, how are differences in interpretation generally handled?\n\nThe second website does contain a disclaimer about not being legal advice, but that seems pretty weak when the entire website is intended to guide employers and employees in their requirements and obligations.\n\nThe examples are from NZ, so an NZ specific answer would be nice, but I'd also like to hear what other countries and jurisdictions do as well.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In interpreting a statute, New Zealand courts must conform to the [Legislation Act 2019](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2019/0058/latest/DLM7298193.html), which says that\n\n> The meaning of legislation must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose and its context.\n\nThis carries forward a provision from the [Interpretation Act 1924](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2019/0058/latest/DLM7298193.html) at 5(j) that interpretation must \"best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act \\[...] according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\" In discovering what this purpose is, the entire text of the Act is available, including in this case the Holidays Act s. 15(c),\n\n> The purpose of this subpart is to \\[...] require employers to pay employees at the end of their employment for annual holidays not taken or paid out\n\nWhen they do this, the courts must be cautious not to make up their own laws; in the *Northern Milk* case, this was summarized as\n\n> The Courts must try to make the Act work while taking care not themselves to usurp the policy\\-making function, which rightly belongs to Parliament. The Courts can in a sense fill gaps in an Act\n> but only in order to make the Act work as Parliament must have intended.\n\n(This case, *Northland Milk Vendors Association Inc v Northern Milk Ltd \\[1988]* 1 NZLR 537 (CA), is a major authority for how far the courts can go. There, they were dealing with a gap in time between one statutory regime ending and the next one beginning, where Parliament had neglected to say what would happen in between. The Court of Appeal had to decide on the purpose of the Milk Act 1988 by looking at such textual matters as its long title, which said that it was meant \"to provide for the continuing home delivery of milk\", and so the status quo had to be maintained in the interim.)\n\nBut this exercise is focused on the statute itself. It excludes, for example, even such tempting targets as an *amendment* to that statute which was made subsequent to the case at hand, and which might clarify what was intended. (See [Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Databank Systems Ltd Co (New Zealand) \\[1990] UKPC 37](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1990/1990_37.html).) In some cases, reference might be made to the Parliamentary circumstances when the statute was passed. New Zealand, compared to other similar jurisdictions, is reluctant to bring in other kinds of non\\-statutory material to explain a statute. They also do not generally defer to government agency interpretations unless the matter is very technical, or the primary statute tells them they must.\n\nFor the Holidays Act, recent cases concerning some *different* ambiguities have been resolved without having to look beyond the text itself, and its broad purpose. (For example, *Postal Workers Union v NZ Post* \\[2012] NZCA 481, on whether unrostered overtime is part of \"relevant daily pay\", or *Tourism Holdings Ltd v Labour Inspector* \\[2021] NZSC 157, on holiday pay for somebody with a very irregular work pattern.) I would expect that in your example, government websites would *not* be used by the courts to determine what the law means. They would do their best to \"make the Act work\", starting from its actual text, and informed by its own statement of purpose. But they would not use a guidance note from a government website as evidence for what *Parliament* intended.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In New Zealand, when interpreting ambiguous legislation, courts primarily rely on:\n\nA) Government websites providing guidance on the legislation\nB) The text of the legislation itself, its purpose, and context\nC) Subsequent amendments to the legislation\nD) International legal precedents\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. According to the Legislation Act 2019, New Zealand courts must interpret legislation based on \"its text and in the light of its purpose and its context.\" This approach is reinforced by the principle from the Interpretation Act 1924, which emphasizes interpreting legislation according to \"its true intent, meaning and spirit.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because courts generally do not use government websites or guidance notes to determine the meaning of laws.

I am asking what lawyers do when one of their own clients owes them money and shows no signs of paying voluntarily.\n\nThe reason why I ask is that I trying to determine to what extent demand letters are just efforts to generate billable hours, or whether they have a legitimate purpose. If lawyers never bother to send demand letters when they collect their own debts, then obviously the letters are just a revenue\\-generation method.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Demand letters are often used to collect debts from one's own clients, most prominently, because filing a lawsuit against a client often triggers a counterclaim for malpractice or an ethical grievance, even if it is not justified on the merits. Demanding payment without suing rarely has these consequences and often isn't even enough to trigger an urge to post an unjustified (or justified) bad review of the lawyer online.\n\nDemand letters are not just efforts to generate billable hours. Lawyers want to generate billable hours for clients who pay them reliably, rather than devoting time to work collecting from a client who has a significant likelihood of not paying.\n\nOne reason to send demand letters is that sometimes, the reason that clients don't pay is not that they are unwilling to pay, or dispute the bill, but that they are currently unable to pay. A demand letter keeps the debt fresh in the client's mind when an ability to pay is restored. Quite a bit of hourly charge legal work is *de facto* contingent fee work because the client almost by definition won't have the ability to pay for it promptly if the outcome is a bad one (often for reasons beyond the lawyer's control).\n\nDemand letters are cheap, can often be drafted by administrative staff for attorney review, and because they are cheap, don't have to have a high success rate to be worth the effort. Even a 5%\\-10% payment rate for unpaid fees that are sought in demand letters makes them worth it.\n\nA second reason to send a demand letter can also trigger a written response acknowledging that the debt is owed and apologizing for not paying, and/or paying a token amount like $25, each of which extends the statute of limitations to collect the entire amount of the debt for unpaid fees.\n\nA third reason to send a demand letter is that it helps the lawyer to keep current on the client's address, if the client moves, while a mail forwarding order is still in place.\n\nA fourth reason to send a demand letter is that it discourages the client from trying to get the lawyer to do additional work on existing or new matters that the client can't afford to pay for (especially in non\\-litigation representations) because it reminds them that they already owe money to the firm.\n\nTypically, a lawyer sues when (1\\) the client is known to be collectible now, (2\\) there is not credible basis for a malpractice lawsuit and there was not a bad outcome, and (3\\) the statute of limitations is approaching or the client has a serious chance of not being collectible later.\n\n**The Business Model Context**\n\nIn a typical small and medium sized practice with a mix of litigation work done on an hourly basis and transactional work involving negotiations that are not flat fee, maybe 10% of unpaid bills are ever the subject of a collection lawsuit brought by the law firm that wasn't paid.\n\nA firm like that often ultimately writes off as much as 20%\\-30% or more of all the fees it bills to its clients on an hourly basis (with substantial variation from year to year), and typically receives maybe a third of all the fees that it is ultimately paid more than 90 days after the due date for the invoiced fees. A pattern of a client not paying for several months and then making a big lump sum payment for reasons that may or may not be related to the representation is fairly common. For reasons like this (and the timing of contingency fee payouts) solo practice and small firm lawyers with non\\-criminal practices typically have incomes that vary wildly from year to year, even though the amount of work actually done each year as measured by billable hours is quite consistent.\n\nLarge law firms are actually quite similar to this business model as well, although they charge higher rates and bill more hours on cases, and the law of averages keeps their monthly fee collections a little more consistent. Many large firms pay all of their expenses from a line of credit so that they don't have to worry about the timing of their collections to pay their monthly expenses, and then settle up with their bank at the end of the year.\n\nCertain kinds of firms (e.g. criminal defense) require all anticipated fees to be in a retainer before work is started. Other kinds of work (e.g. probate administration and flat fee transactional work and contingent fee work) usually is paid promptly and reliably when due.\n\nIn the insurance defense counsel business model, invoices are almost always paid so demand letters aren't needed, but are usually paid very slowly (90\\-180 days from invoice), the hourly rates are below average, and the insurance company routinely nitpicks bills to reduce hourly charges in any given month by 5%\\-10% or so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small law firm is considering its approach to collecting unpaid fees from clients.

Note this wasn't simply a matter of Bergsala's rights being violated, but rather a scheme to reduce parallel imports/exports which the Commission found to be anti\\-competitive.

The underlying political premise has been that disagreement is to be dealt with rationally and not through force, such as where opinions contrary to those articulated by the government are squashed (in order to eliminate divisions).\n\nThere have been numerous laws passed in the US to outlaw \"contrary\" speech including \"disrespectful\" speech, and they are constantly being overturned by the Supreme Court. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 and U.S. v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 are two recent reaffirmations that such laws are unconstitutional. The only way such a law can work is if the Constitution is amended to in some way re\\-write the First Amendment, like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Desecration_Amendment).\n\nOutlawing indirect insults towards political figures (\"not *my* Speaker of the House\", \"not *my* FBI director\") would require an even more extensive suspension of the First Amendment. It is possible that at some time, a bill was introduced to outlaw saying disparaging things about POTUS, but I would be surprised if it got out of committee, because it would fail challenge in court.\n\nThe most\\-likely retrenchment on our freedom of expression is likely to be a flag\\-burning law, which has relatively wide support in the US. There are a number of interpretive problems associated with the key concept \"physical desecration\". Even more interpretive problems would arise if Congress were given the power (via an anti\\-disparagement amendment) to outlaw \"disparagement of public officials\". Can one simultaneously \"respect the Office of the President\" and \"disrespect the holder of the office\"?\n\nAs for specifically restricting the military, that's a challenging issue. It *is* a court\\-martial offense for a commissioned military officer to use contemptuous words against the President and Congress ([10 USC 888](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/888)), and by directive from the Department of Defense this also applies to enlisted personnel. SCOTUS in Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 articulated the Military Necessity doctrine, that \"The fundamental necessity for obedience, and the consequent necessity for imposition of discipline, may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it\". So \"not my President\" probably *is* illegal for soldiers.

Attempts to outlaw such speech for the general public have been consistently overturned by the Supreme Court. However, for military personnel, particularly commissioned officers, using contemptuous words against the President is a court-martial offense under 10 USC 888.

It\u2018s just a thought that randomly came to mind.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The game *Five Nights at Freddy's* and the other elements in the [large media franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s) of the same name are surely protected by copyright. In addition the name of the fictional restaurant in the game may well be protected as a trademark, and I would be astounded if \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" was not protected as a trademark. Other names and phrases may well be trademarked also.\n\nIf the suggested actual restaurant was at all closely based on the images and descriptions from the games or the novels, it would be a derivative work. Unless one had permission from the copyright owner, creating such a restaurant would be an act of wilful copyright infringement. The owner could sue, and quite likely win. In the US the owner could get up to $150,000 in statutory damages for *each work* that was infringed, which in this case might well mean several of the games and novels, depending on just what images and descriptions were imitated or used. Or the owner could elect to receive damages and profits, meaning all damage provably done to the owner, plus all profits made by the infringer. In addition to either, the owner might well obtain an injunction against further operations of the restaurant.\n\nBeyond that, if the imitation used any of the trademarked names, slogans, or other protected trademarks, there could be a suit for trademark infringement. There could be no question that the marks were being used in commerce, and were not instances of nominative use. A restaurant is a very different thing from a video game, a novel, or a film, of course. No doubt it falls into a different trademark category. Normally trademark protection extends only to the category for which the mark is protected. But in the case of a \"well\\-known\" or \"famous\" mark, protection under US law is wider. Also, when the infringement might lead reasonable people to falsely belie that the infringing product or service has been endorsed, approved, or sponsored by the trademark owner, it may be a violation even in a significantly different category. This a successful suit for trademark infringement might well be possible also.\n\nOf course, if the new restaurant only vaguely resembled the one in the games and novels, and did not use the phrase \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" or the name \"Freddy Fazbear\u2019s\" or any other distinctive names from the media franchise, That might not be copyright or trademark infringement. But that would not seem to achieve the effect suggested by the question.\n\nIf the creator of the restaurant obtained **permission** from the copyright and trademark owner(s) then there would be no legal issue. But the owners might well not grant such permission, or might charge a high fee for it.\n\nI doubt that the idea is workable.\n\nAs a side note, many years ago I regularly patronized a restaurant named [\"Bilbo's Pizza\"](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/life/2017/01/27/archives-pizza-joints-we-miss/97081968/) It was decorated with murals obviously based on descriptions for *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*.

However, there appears to be no actual law that supports this. For instance, the [Animals Act 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/22) makes no mention of cats at all. As far as I can tell, the law is incredibly vague on this issue.\n\nWhy, then, is there apparently widespread belief that cats have a right to roam? Is there legal precedent establishing this? If a cat owner were found liable in a county court for their cat having committed damages during their roaming, would there be any legal basis to challenge this decision?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statement that cats cannot commit trespass is technically true, but is also a misreading of ss.4 and 4A of the Animals Act. Those sections replace a common\\-law doctrine called \"cattle trespass\", which was a specific tort (a civil wrong) concerning what happens when my cattle stray onto your land. Both old and new rules apply only to livestock, so not just cows but other kinds of farm animals as well \\- but *not* to dogs or cats. Horses are a special case (s.4A). Since cats are not livestock, they cannot be the subject of cattle trespass and are not covered by section 4\\.\n\nFurther, since they are animals, they cannot commit the tort of trespass at all. Animals themselves are not liable at law. As the *keeper* of cows, it would be *me* who was liable in a case of cattle trespass, not the cow. The point of s.4, and its predecessor in common law, is to make me liable for damage done to your property by my cows, regardless of whether I was negligent in the way I looked after them (it is a \"strict liability\"). The mere fact that they've strayed onto your land and done damage is enough.\n\nBecause cats are not cows, this particular rule does not apply. That does not mean that cats can't be the subject of other torts. In particular, cats could be involved in the tort of nuisance, which covers all sorts of potential scenarios \\- noise, smells, etc. This has typically happened when there are lots and lots of cats. And under the Animals Act, the keeper of *any* animal may be liable for damage that it does, including physical injury or damage to property.\n\nSection 2 of the Act establishes a statutory distinction between whether I am *liable* for the damage, or *strictly liable*. In a scenario where I am strictly liable, you do not have to prove that I was negligent in my management of the animal. Broadly, that applies if the animal belongs to a dangerous species, or is unusually dangerous in itself. (There has been very complex litigation on this point which I am not discussing here.) If my cat is not a real vicious bastard of a cat, but just a regular cat, then I can still be liable for damage that he does: it's just not automatic.\n\nFollowing Rachael Mulheron's *Principles of Tort Law* (CUP, 2nd ed., 2016\\), for an action in negligence there are several key points \\-\n\n> Proving that D, the owner/keeper of an animal, owed C a duty of care, where C was injured by that animal, has been a straightforward task.\n> \n> \n> The court must be satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of D, the keeper of the animal, would foresee a real risk of injury to C arising from D's particular acts or omissions in dealing with the animal. Otherwise, in the absence of that foreseeability, a reasonable D would have done nothing different in response to the risk posed by his animal.\n> \n> \n> To fall below the standard of reasonable care as a keeper of an animal, D must have failed to do that which a reasonable keeper would have done (to supervise/fence/control, etc, the animal), or have done something which a reasonable keeper would not have done.\n> \n> \n> In damage\\-by\\-animals cases, C must prove that, as in the usual negligence action, D's failure to supervise/handle/care for the animals caused C's injury on the balance of probabilities.\n\nAs in other negligence cases, there are various defences; if you hassled my cat and it scratched you, then that's your fault and not mine.\n\nFrom the material quoted above, we can see that for a normal cat in the UK, where the owner is not doing anything unusual by letting it roam freely outdoors (as is typical for UK cats), it is going to be hard to meet the tests. Things may be different if D knows that C is allergic to cats, or that the cat has been eyeing up C's delicious prize goldfish, or has a bone to pick with D's own cat and is likely to attack her, or something. Most of the big cases under the Animals Act have involved animals who are more likely to cause damage, such as dogs, horses and cows; a cat is only legally different because (1\\) unlike for dogs, horses and cows, there are no special rules applying to cats, and (2\\) factually, most cats don't do much harm.\n\nTo that point, even if D is liable in the way described, C may not get very much out of them by way of damages.

This means using the mark to label, identify, or advertise a product or service of the same general type as the product the mark is properly associated with. Using the mark, or a similar mark, in such a way that people are likely to be confused into thinking that a product or service came from the same source as the mark, or approved, endorsed or sponsored by the mark owner, is usually infringement. Using the mark to discuss the product or service, and in particular using it as the name of the product or service, is ***nominative use***. Nominative use is not infringement. Using an ad that includes trademarks to discuss the associated product is a form of nominative use.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A blogger plans to write a critical article about misleading online advertisements. The blogger intends to include full-screen captures of these ads in the article. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal considerations in this scenario?\n\nA) The blogger is likely to be sued for copyright infringement and should avoid using any images from the ads.\n\nB) As long as the blogger criticizes the ads, they can freely use any images without concern for legal repercussions.\n\nC) The blogger should only use small, low-resolution snippets of the ads to avoid any potential legal issues.\n\nD) The blogger's use of the ad images is likely to be considered fair use, especially if the use is transformative and doesn't harm the market for the original ads.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption D is the most accurate reflection of the legal considerations in this scenario. The use of ad images in a critical article is likely to be considered fair use for several reasons:\n\n1. The purpose is criticism, which is a favored category for fair use.\n2. Advertisements are largely factual rather than creative works, which leans towards fair use.\n3. The use is likely transformative, as the blogger is using the ads for a different purpose (criticism) than their original intent.\n4. The use is unlikely to harm the market for the original ads.\n\nWhile using full-screen captures might lean slightly against fair use compared to using smaller portions, it doesn't necessarily prevent a fair use finding, especially if the use is clearly for criticism or commentary.\n\nOption A is overly cautious and doesn't reflect the protections offered by fair use. \nOption B oversimplifies the issue; criticism alone doesn't guarantee protection without considering other factors. \nOption C, while a safer approach, is unnecessarily restrictive given the likely fair use protection.\n\nAdditionally, trademark concerns are minimal in this scenario, as using the ads to discuss or criticize the products or services would likely be considered nominative use, which is not trademark infringement."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/94371/how-to-best-approach-dealing-with-a-cybercriminal-in-a-distant-country-harassing", "docs_id": 94371, "title": "How to best approach dealing with a cybercriminal in a distant country harassing an entire internet community?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For years now, one person has been persistently doing everything they could to make the lives of several administrators/moderators miserable and as a consequence directly and indirectly prevented the normal functioning of the whole internet community these people are responsible for. This person keeps changing usernames and IP addresses, uses VPNs whenever needed and is actively spending money to keep doing what they're doing so any attempt at getting rid of them is futile.\n\nHere's what they have done over the span of a few years:\n\n* DDoSing several different server whenever there's activity on them. They have already done hundreds of DDoS attacks and keep doing them several times a week.\n* general harassment of several different people\n* finding the family members of some of these people and harassing them as well\n* death threats (not ones that could be taken seriously but this is not necessarily clear to some of the people that received them)\n\nPolice was contacted in the past but they didn't express much interest in taking any action.

This person has no life and they get a kick out of what they're doing so they are not going to stop by themselves any time soon.\nThere's a good few people in our community that are sick of this person and willing to take whatever action is needed for them to stop.\n\nWe know this person's full name, location, primary IP address and more, however, it would be difficult to actually prove their real identity to the authorities. It would be easy to retaliate in a similar manner to what we received but that's not what we want to do.

But in many countries, the activities you describe would amount to stalking, which can be a crime.\n* You mention that the police takes little interest.  \n\nIn many countries, the police prioritize specific, real\\-world incidents (cars being stolen, drugs being sold) over having to resolve an IP and probably getting nowhere.

This establishes an official record of the harassment and can potentially lead to further investigation. Retaliation (A) is illegal and unethical. Proving the harasser's identity (C) can be challenging and is not necessarily the victim's responsibility. Continuously reporting to multiple departments (D) may be seen as harassment itself and is not an efficient use of resources. The criminal complaint provides a formal basis for potential international cooperation in addressing the issue."}}
