The correct answer is C because Florida law, as stated in the documentation, requires wills to be in writing, signed, and witnessed (\u00a7 732.502). A voicemail message, regardless of its content or the deceased's intentions, does not meet these legal requirements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because oral wills are not recognized in Florida. The voicemail, no matter how clear or heartfelt, cannot serve as a valid will.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, while it might seem fair, Florida law does not allow for consideration of informal expressions of intent when there is no valid written will. The court is bound by intestate succession laws in the absence of a valid will.\n\nOption C is correct because it accurately reflects Florida's legal stance on intestate succession. When there is no valid will, the estate must be distributed according to the state's intestate succession laws (\u00a7 732.101-732.111), regardless of any informal expressions of the deceased's wishes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Florida does not recognize holographic (handwritten and unwitnessed) wills, let alone voicemail messages, as valid testamentary documents.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to apply legal principles to a complex scenario, understand the strict requirements of will execution in Florida, and recognize the primacy of statutory law over informal expressions of intent in matters of inheritance."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16330/constitutionality-of-laws-restricting-employment-practices-in-the-executive-bran", "docs_id": 16330, "title": "Constitutionality of laws restricting employment practices in the executive branch", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is a large body of US Federal law dealing with the employment of government workers.

Kerry, 576 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2015\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/13-628/). The court held that \"the power to recognize foreign states resides in the President alone\", and that \"if Congress could alter the President\u2019s statements on matters of recognition or force him to contradict them, Congress in effect would exercise the recognition power. An exclusive Presidential power disables the Congress from acting upon the subject.\" (Citing Youngstown Sheet \\& Tube Co. v.

SW General, Inc.](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/national-labor-relations-board-v-sw-general-inc/). The Executive is not challenging the constitutionality of the statute, though.

Lovett 328 U.S. 303 (1946\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/303/) is another case where Congress went too far. The background here was that Congress passed a law that said \"no salary or other compensation shall be paid to certain employees of the Government (specified by name)\". The court held that: \"Legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial, are bills of attainder prohibited by the Constitution.\"\n\nThis principle was refined in [Nixon v.

Which of the following outcomes is most likely if this action were challenged in court?\n\nA) The court would uphold the President's action, citing exclusive executive authority over staffing decisions\nB) The court would strike down all laws governing executive employee management as unconstitutional\nC) The court would likely rule against the President, upholding Congress's power to regulate executive branch employment\nD) The court would defer the decision to Congress, citing the political question doctrine\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the provided documentation, targeting higher cognitive levels. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that Congress has broad powers to enact laws controlling the executive branch, derived from Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution. This includes laws governing the management of executive branch employees.\n\n2. While there are limits to Congressional control over the executive (as seen in Zivotofsky v. Kerry), the example of NLRB v. SW General, Inc. shows that the executive branch generally acknowledges Congress's authority to regulate how executive employees are hired, fired, or directed.\n\n3. The court has previously struck down attempts by Congress to target specific individuals for punishment without trial (United States v. Lovett), but has upheld broader laws directing executive actions (Nixon v. Administrator of General Services).\n\n4. The President's argument about separation of powers is addressed in the documentation, which explains that many laws controlling executive conduct do not inherently violate this principle.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation does not support exclusive executive authority over all staffing decisions.

Where is the line drawn between \n\n1. studying example code and applying what you learned\n2. violating copyright\n\nFor example if I see some code with a license saying it can't be reproduced, and it has a method called `is_prime(int x)` and has a `for` loop checking odd numbers up with the square root, would I be breaking copyright if I wrote a similar method? What if I copied and pasted? What if I changed the names? (E.g. maybe is\\_prime is a better name for the method than check\\_if\\_prime.)

Is this not violating copyright as they just aren't looking at the code while they implement their own?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not having immediate access to the source doesn't preclude a finding of copyright infringement. If you have seen the source material, subconscious infringement can happen.\n\nHowever, in this example, both the short phrases doctrine and the merger doctrine would likely prevent the is\\_prime function from having copyright. Words and short phrases are not individually copyrightable, so the name would be free to take.\n\nRegarding the implementing code, if it isn't an *exact copy* (i.e. copy and paste), courts will apply the abstraction\\-filtration\\-comparision test.\n\nThey may find that you took the selection and arrangement of instructions from the original source, albiet using different names. That selection and arrangement would probably be considered a substantial similarity and, if not for the merger doctrine, infringement.\n\nHowever, given the limited number of ways to express the prime\\-detection algorithm means that the expression of that idea has *merged* with the idea, and thus is not protected by copyright.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The question touches on the merger doctrine, which states that when there are limited ways to express an idea, the expression merges with the idea and is not protected by copyright. Prime number detection algorithms are relatively standard and have limited implementation options.\n\n2. The abstraction-filtration-comparison test would likely find that the basic approach to detecting prime numbers (checking odd numbers up to the square root) is an idea rather than a specific expression, and thus not copyrightable.\n\n3. Short phrases, such as method names like \"is_prime,\" are not copyrightable under the short phrases doctrine.\n\n4. Implementing the same basic approach acknowledges that the underlying algorithm is not protected, while still requiring the developer to create their own expression of that algorithm.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it represents a clear attempt to copy protected work. Option B could potentially lead to subconscious infringement if the developer has recently viewed the original code. Option C, while better than A or B, might still be considered too close to the original if the code structure is very similar.

The opposite is actually true.\n\nIf you patent something, and it is felt to be potentially of national security interest, then they can take your invention for the nation, produce it, and prevent you producing it or sharing the design indefinitely (though it will be reviewed annually).

The court fee alone starts at [$1,530](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/fees), and litigation of this kind would normally be conducted by professionals at a cost of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars. The unsuccessful party would generally be required to pay the successful party's legal costs. Almost invariably, it would be in the mutual interest of all parties to negotiate a settlement.\n\nFor more information about shareholders' oppression in Australia, see Victorian Law Reform Commission, [The oppression remedy in the *Corporations Act*](https://www.lawreform.vic.gov.au/publication/trading-trusts-oppression-remedies-report-3/3-the-oppression-remedy-in-the-corporations-act/) (2021\\):\n\n> Irreconcilable differences may establish a basis for winding up, they do not of themselves constitute oppression or unfair prejudice \u2026 oppression connotes a lack of probity and fair dealing (although this is not a necessary condition), is something which is burdensome, harsh or wrongful, or is inequitable or unjust, or exhibits commercial unfairness \u2026 Examples of oppressive behaviour given by Brockett include where a majority shareholder:\n> \n> \n> * runs the company in their own interests and ignores the interests of minority shareholders\n> * improperly issues shares to themselves to outvote other shareholders\n> * excludes a minority shareholder from being involved in the management decisions of the company\n> * redirects business opportunities from the company to themselves\n> * pays themselves excessive salaries at the expense of paying dividends to shareholders.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, the minority shareholder is facing challenges with the other two directors/shareholders of \"NewCo\". Given the situation and applicable laws in Western Australia, what is the most appropriate and legally sound course of action for the minority shareholder to address their concerns?\n\nA) File a lawsuit to reclaim full ownership of the company based on having paid for the initial registration\nB) Unilaterally remove the other shareholders from the company registry, citing their failure to repay setup costs\nC) Seek a court order under s 232 of the Corporations Act 2001 for potential oppression remedy\nD) Threaten to dissolve the company unless the other shareholders agree to sell their shares\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate course of action is to seek a court order under s 232 of the Corporations Act 2001 for potential oppression remedy. This option addresses the complexity of the situation while adhering to legal frameworks:\n\n1. Paying for the company's registration doesn't automatically grant full ownership rights. The shares were allocated equally and documented, which is legally binding regardless of who paid the registration fees.\n\n2. The minority shareholder cannot unilaterally remove other shareholders, as this would violate corporate governance principles and shareholder rights.\n\n3. Seeking a court order under s 232 is the correct legal avenue for addressing potential oppression of minority shareholders. This provision allows courts to intervene if \"the conduct of the company's affairs is oppressive to, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, a member.\"\n\n4. While negotiation is preferable, the documentation suggests that amicable resolution has been unsuccessful. The legal remedy provides a structured approach to address the issues.\n\n5. The court can order various remedies, including winding up the company or mandating a share buyout, which aligns with the minority shareholder's desire to separate from the other shareholders.\n\n6. This approach acknowledges the complexity and cost of such legal action, encouraging all parties to potentially negotiate a settlement before full litigation.\n\n7.

I would like to put up a site where I share the recipes I used. I sometimes use recipes from the cooking book which obviously copyrighted work. Therefore, I decided what if I 'retell' the process involved when I am cooking the dish myself, producing 'my own' 'cooking instruction'? Of course, I would like my recipe to have the same ingredients as the reference book I am using, else the taste is not going to be the same. Is this allowed? How about international law since I am not in the US. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Recipe books can be, and often are, protected by copyright. If the individual recipes are by others, this would constitute a collective work or compilation. See [this recent answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/64800/17500) for more on the rights protected for a collective work.\n\nThe selection of which recipes to include would be a creative element, protected by copyright, and could not be copied or closely imitated without permission. However, division into groups by type of dish would be a \"natural and obvious\" arrangement, and not protected. So would alphabetical or chronological arrangement within a group, or over all. A \"non\\-obvious\" order of recipes would however be a protectable element.\n\nAn individual recipe may be protected by copyright, but this protects less than one might think. Copyright does not protect facts or methods. This means that the list of ingredients is not protected, nor is the general list of steps of preparation. Only the exact wording of the recipe will be protected.\n\nCreating a new collection of recipes based on several different previously published collections of recipes (whether from the web, books, magazines, or other media) and making one's own selections of which ones to include that is significantly different from any of the previous collections would not violate the collection copyrights of any of the previous collections. If the actual recipes were rewritten so that any creative expression from the originals was not copied, then it seems that no copyright infringement has occurred. Most recipes, after all, are not fully original but are modified from older ones.\n\nThere is no set figure for how many recipes could be copied from a given source before this becomes infringement. That would be, if a suit was field, a matter for the judgement of the count as to whether the new book was \"based on\" the alleged source. The more the list in the new work resembles a particular source, the more like a derivative work it seems and the more likely that it would be held to be an infringement. One could always ask for a license from the older source, to avoid any risk of suit, but it might not be available or the copyright holder might demand an excessive fee. Asking for a license risks drawing attention to the new work, as well, and might cause a holder to file suit who otherwise would not.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A food blogger wants to create a cookbook featuring her favorite international desserts.

For example, the Clay Institute\u2019s [Millennium Prize](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems) does exactly what you propose: it pays people who solve unsolved math problems. Similarly, the the Everglades Foundation used a [prize](https://www.evergladeswaterquality.org/meet-the-teams) to get people to come up with new ways to get phosphates out of the water sources.\n\nTo do what they did, you need to follow their lead, and set up and run a non\\-profit (aka, 501(c)(3\\), named after the relevant provision of the tax code).\n\nBecause non\\-profits are tax exempt under US tax law, you have to apply to the IRS to become a non\\-profit. Speaking broadly, the IRS imposes two requirements on non\\-profits: 1\\) It must serve a charitable purpose; 2\\) It must spend a certain percentage of its money every year doing charitable work.\n\nTo set up a foundation you have to specify the charitable purpose you will serve (\u201cencourage research in mathematics\u201d), and have a plan to do so (\u201cwe will award a cash prize to people who solve important unsolved problems\u201d). If the IRS decides your plan is genuine, then they give you a pass on paying taxes.\n\nTo make sure you are carrying out your charitable plan, the IRS requires you to spend a certain percentage of your money each year on charitable work. (This is called the \"distribution requirement.\") Meeting the distribution requirement may be a problem, since you may not award prizes every year.\n\nYou may be able to get a general idea about how the IRS deals with such situations by searching on line. At some point, however, you will probably need to talk to a lawyer with experience setting up non\\-profits. (FWIW, it looks to me as if the Clay Institute meets its yearly spending requirement by supporting lots of other activities that count towards the spending requirement.)\n\nOne other problem that it seems you won\u2019t have involves giving prizes directly to individuals. For obvious reasons, the IRS is generally suspicious of prizes given to individuals, so they impose restrictions. For example, for the winner to avoid taxes, the prizes have to be for previous work.\n\n**Where to go for more information:**\n\nUSA.gov has a nice overview of the application process [here](https://www.usa.gov/start-nonprofit).

This answer integrates multiple concepts from the documentation and addresses the real-world challenges of the proposed mathematics prize organization.\n\nA 501(c)(3) non-profit is the best choice because:\n\n1.

The underlying law, [RCW 43\\.06\\.220(h)](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.06.220) empowers issuing an order prohibiting \"Such other activities as he or she reasonably believes should be prohibited to help preserve and maintain life, health, property or the public peace\".

The correct answer is B, as the Supreme Court of Canada in Sullivan clearly stated that trial judges should follow prior decisions made by their own court on all questions of law, unless one of the Spruce Mills exceptions is met.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the principle established in Sullivan that trial courts can indeed create precedent that is binding on judges of coordinate jurisdiction.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it's not the appropriate procedure when faced with a potentially binding decision from a court of coordinate jurisdiction.

The precise scope of what actions are sufficient to establish that duress is present vary. A credible threat that someone will kill you or your child is generally sufficient in every state that recognizes the defense. There is also a closely related defense known as \"choice of evils.\"\n\nThis said, eight years is a very long time and usually the defense of duress is available only if the threat was imminent or immediate. So, it is probably less likely than not that a finder of fact would conclude that it was impossible to seek to involve authorities in the situation, for all of the time in that eight year time period, without reasonably risking the threatened harm.\n\nAlso, while you call his acts \"treasonous\", in reality the crime of treason is defined very narrowly in the U.S. Constitution to taking up arms against your country and providing aid and comfort to people who are doing so, and the fact pattern suggested probably does not constitute treason under U.S. law.\n\nFinally, while his circumstances only dubiously are sufficient to assert a defense of duress over the sustained eight year time period, this doesn't mean that authorities couldn't choose to refrain from prosecuting him, or that the couldn't seek only lesser charges with mitigating circumstances conceded in sentencing, in an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Often this exercise of prosecutorial discretion would be conditioned upon cooperation in the case brought against other defendants in related cases.\n\nIn an exceptional case, the pardon power could be invoked for relieve him from criminal liability as has been done in some past insurrections in U.S. history like the Whiskey Rebellion and the U.S. Civil War.

Can I save the cost of a trademark fee by doing them simultaneously?\n\nDoes doing them at the same time yield the same results as trademarking them separately? \n\nThanks \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is very common to register a trademark that is a combination of a distinctive name, word or phrase and a logo or other design for one filing fee. This raises the question of whether the design or the name/word may also be protected as \"registered trademarks\" when used separately, and the answer is no. A registered trademark is \"considered as a whole\" and if you want to protect parts of it, you would be required to apply separately for registration of those parts.\n\nA registration of a \"standard character\" mark may give much broader protection for a distinctive name than if it is only registered in combination with something else. Contrarily, a valuable (recognizable) logo may be the most important element, regardless of whether the name is with it.\n\nIn the USA, registration of a trademark is completely optional for enforcement in state or federal courts, although registration gives additional valuable rights, including \"national preemption\".\n\nSo, in theory, one could register a combination word\\-mark and design and then enforce the design (alone) or the word\\-mark (alone) outside of the registered rights (e.g., national preemption), and even place (tm) on it, but not \u00ae (circle R), if it is not federally registered as shown.\n\nThere are numerous gray areas in most aspects of trademark rules for registration, let alone enforcement, often tied to subjective evaluation of \"distinctiveness\" or \"related fields\" that may \"create a likelihood of confusion\" among reasonable consumers in that market.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about trademark registration, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A startup company wants to trademark both its name \"TechInnovate\" and its distinctive logo.

As stated in the documentation, \"A registered trademark is 'considered as a whole' and if you want to protect parts of it, you would be required to apply separately for registration of those parts.\"\n\n2. Registering the name in standard characters offers wider protection for the word mark, allowing its use in various styles and fonts.\n\n3.

At someone else's trial, he testifies on relativity as an expert. Answering questions, he explains both his special and general theories in terms a jury understands. Counsel thanks him. Opposing counsel in cross\\-examination asks Einstein if his theory includes a \"cosmological constant\". Einstein testifies firmly: \"No.\" Opposing counsel reads to the court from an earlier publication by Einstein that there is a cosmological constant. Einstein seems urgently about to say something but the judge reminds him that he may only answer questions he is asked and no questions are pending at the moment. Opposing counsel has no further questions, counsel who brought Einstein does not seek to ask anything (perhaps because not expecting this turn of events) and the witness is dismissed. Someone searching history would find that Einstein had publicly said that the cosmological constant was the \"biggest blunder of his life\", but a jury is not allowed to do outside research before issuing its verdict and this is not a nonjury trial. I understand that impeachment frequently works to persuade a trier of fact to disregard impeached testimony; assume such persuasiveness succeeds in this case.\n\nI think this illustrates an inadequacy of the system of determining the state of scholarship through expert testimony, among other reasons because it discourages bringing an expert who might ever have published a statement they would later dispute, and that would exclude most research scholars with long publication histories. Am I legally wrong about this hypothetical Einstein being easily impeachable? Does this vary much by jurisdiction of place?\n\nI'm not opening a debate on reform, just trying to see if I misunderstand the general law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your main misunderstanding is that opposing counsel cannot testify. He can ask a question, such as \"Did you say ...?\", which provides Einstein an opportunity to answer in a way that maintains the credibility of his testimony, but consel cannot just enter his own testimony into the record. In addition, counsel on \"his side\" has the opportunity to pose appropriate clarifying questions, e.g. could ask \"Did you repudiate that idea 88 years ago?\", though there is a problem that the attorney may not have the technical expertise to recognize the subject\\-matter question that they should ask. \n\nExpert testimony does not attempt to determine the state of scholarship in an area, it attempts to resolve a specific factual matter. The two are not the same thing. Einstein would not testify as to what his general and special theories of relativity say, except in a bizarre universe where some person is accused of the crime of denying the theory of relativity. Instead, he might be testifying for the defense, where the defendant is accused of an act that (it turns out) is physically impossible in light of the theory of relativity. If Einstein had been in the habit of posing random mutually\\-contradictory conjectures on a weekly basis, opposing counsel's question could be relevant to establishing that the witness's testimony is not reliable. Theoretically, counsel could \"hint\" that the witness is scientifically flighty, so Einstein would have to have a credible explanation for changing his position.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The scenario doesn't automatically invalidate the expert's entire testimony. While the apparent contradiction may damage credibility, it doesn't necessitate striking the testimony from the record (eliminating option A).\n\n2. The documentation explicitly states that \"opposing counsel cannot testify.\" They can only ask questions, not enter their own testimony into evidence, ruling out option B.\n\n3.

Supp. 613, plaintiffs successfully sued the school district \"to enjoin the enforcement of the Amarillo School District's absence policy which limits the number of excused absences for religious holidays to two days each school year\", where \"A fundamental tenet of the Church of God is that members must abstain from secular activity on seven annual holy days\". The school district imposed an absence polity where \"School work missed may be made up whether an absence is excused or unexcused\", and \"Excused absences shall be granted to students for a maximum of 2 days for religious holidays in each school year\". The court concluded that \"This policy poses an unquestionable burden on the Plaintiffs' religious belief\", and \"This burden is not ameliorated by the make\\-up work provision. The provision does not require a teacher to evaluate the work made up. It in fact directs the teacher to enter a zero for that work\". In this case \"Summary judgment is granted and judgment rendered enjoining the enforcement of the Amarillo Independent School District's excused absence policy insofar as it limits the number of excused absences for religious holidays\". This is not a matter of religious discrimination, this is a First Amendment issue. The policy is in violation of the Free Exercise clause.\n\nEliminating spring break per se is not a problem: doing so and providing no excused absences is the problem. In the above case, there was clear a religious principle of the church to the effect that one must be off the clock on the holiday.

What is the most appropriate legal analysis of this situation?\n\nA) The new policy is immediately enforceable as property owners have the right to change payment methods at will.\nB) Tenants can ignore the new policy as it contradicts their existing lease agreements and was implemented without reasonable notice.\nC) The policy is legal, but tenants have the right to a 30-day grace period before it can be enforced.\nD) Tenants must comply with the new policy, but can seek damages for any additional costs incurred due to the short notice.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of tenant rights, contract law, and reasonable expectations in property management. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Existing lease agreements typically specify payment methods, and unilateral changes by new owners cannot override these without proper notice and agreement.\n2. California tenant law emphasizes the importance of written agreements and reasonable notice for changes.\n3. The top answer in the documentation states, \"You can ignore any requirements imposed by the new landlord that aren't in the lease, just as the landlord could ignore any new requirement imposed on you.\"\n4. The short notice (5 days) for such a significant change is unreasonable, especially considering some tenants are far away.\n5. The answer also mentions that \"No judge will evict someone for paying rent by mail,\" indicating that alternative, reasonable payment methods should be accepted.\n\nOption A is incorrect because property owners cannot arbitrarily change terms without proper notice or agreement. Option C is incorrect as there's no specific mention of a 30-day grace period in California law for such changes.

Here, there is an intent only to hold possession of the keys during the shift and to return them.\n\nAlso, while the surrender of keys is contingent upon the incentive of further employment, it is still a voluntary surrender of the keys.\n\nThe place where theft issues could arise is if the keys are not returned by the person holding them, either at the end of the shift as punishment, or in mid\\-shift, if someone insists upon their return, either in an emergency or because they are sick of this manager and want to quit. If keys were retained in those circumstances upon a demand for their return, there might be a problem.\n\nThis is because continuing to refuse to surrender possession of property permissively given to someone when that permission is revoked, in the absence of a legal right to impose a possessory lien, would generally constitute theft.\n\nWhile the purpose for the manager holding keys in this particular situation don't seem very valid, I can imagine circumstances (e.g. MRI technicians, jail guards, underwater divers, the site only has [tandem parking](https://definedterm.com/tandem_parking_space)), where retaining keys during a shift might be reasonable and appropriate.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A company implements a policy requiring employees to surrender their car keys to their manager at the start of each shift.

The explanation in the documentation outlines several key points that support this conclusion:\n\n1. Theft generally requires an intent to permanently deprive someone of property. In this case, the policy clearly intends to return the keys at the end of the shift.\n\n2. The surrender of keys, while contingent upon continued employment, is still considered a voluntary action.

The key phrase is \"all rights to all material created **in the course of your employment** with the Company\"\n\nThis means things created as part of your new job.

Why or why not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, the ePrivacy Directive is way more general than cookies. The translated Swedish law seems close to the original in the ePrivacy Directive:\n\n> Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent \\[\u2026]. This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary in order for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide the service.\n\n(from Art 5(3\\) [ePrivacy Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02002L0058-20091219))\n\nSo, the general question when you access some JavaScript API is: what is the **purpose** of this access?\n\n* Is the access necessary for performing a service that the user explicitly requested? Then fine. For example, reading the browser window size or device class for the purpose of providing an appropriate layout is fine, because the user explicitly requested you to show them the website. Using LocalStorage to store user data for an offline\\-capable webapp is perfectly fine.\n* Otherwise, you will need consent. For example, reading the browser window size or device class for the purpose of better ad targeting would require consent, because the user did not explicitly request that you show them targeted ads. The user requested to see a website, and showing ads is not strictly necessary for that. Similarly, using any technologies that access or storage on the user's device to access, store, infer, or construct an advertising ID would require consent.\n\nThe WP29 has discussed this aspect of the ePrivacy Directive in their [Opinion 9/2014 on device fingerprinting (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp224_en.pdf). They explicitly note that \u201cJavaScript objects (e.g., document, window, screen, navigator, date and language)\u201d can be used to form a fingerprint, for example by accessing \u201cinformation relating to the screen size, colour depth and available system fonts. Other APIs may request access to information elements stored in the firmware (e.g. the CPU type), operating system (e.g. the OS type) or graphics card model. API calls may also reveal the presence of installed software (e.g. browser plug\\-ins) or even the precise version number\u201d.\n\nThe document defines criterion A and B to refer to the \u201ccarrying out the transmission\u201d and \u201cstrictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user\u201d exceptions, respectively.\n\n* For the specific case of first\\-party analytics purposes, WP29 notes:\n\n> However, the Opinion also stated that currently there is no exemption to consent for cookies that are strictly limited to first party anonymised and aggregated statistical purposes. Therefore, first\\-party website analytics through device fingerprinting do not fall under the exemption defined in\n> CRITERION A or B and consent of the user is required.\n* Similarly, for a user tracking for online behavioural advertising use case, WP29 states:\n\n> Opinion 04/2012 emphasised that third\\-party advertising does not fall under the exemption defined in CRITERION A or B. Therefore, device fingerprinting for the purpose of targeted advertising requires the consent of the user.\n\nThe [Opinion 04/2012 (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp194_en.pdf) discusses these \u201ccookie consent exceptions\u201d in more detail, but of course this is more general than cookies and applies equivalently to any JavaScript API. In the summary, they caution that the \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d criterion must be interpreted narrowly:\n\n> When applying CRITERION B, it is important to examine what is strictly necessary from the point of view of **the user**, not the service provider.\n\nThese guidelines are rather dated, but since ePrivacy has remained essentially unchanged since then the WP29 guidelines and opinions are still the most authoritative discussion of these matters. The only relevant change is that the GDPR changed the definition of consent. The ePrivacy directive leaves no room for national derogations from the consent exception, though some countries like the Netherlands and (until 2021\\) Germany do provide exceptions. However, it is expected that the ePrivacy Directive will eventually be replaced by an ePrivacy Regulation that allows for access in case of a legitimate interest, similar to the more flexible approach chosen by the GDPR.

Who owns the software if it isn't explicitly stated anywhere?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Software *qua* property is protected by copyright \\*perhaps patent, in some jurisdiction). The general rule is that whoever creates the thing (book, song, software) has the exclusive right to the thing. If an employee of Company 1 writes software for Company 2, that employee might (rarely) hold the copyright, but typically that scenario would involve a \"work for hire\", where the employee is hired by Company 1 to do such tasks as part of his duties with Company 1 (which might then be given to Company 2\\). This would then be a [work for hire](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf), and the copyright is held by Company 1\\. If the actual author was an independent contractor, he would hold the copyright \u2013 see [Community for Creative Non\\-Violence v. Reed](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/490/730/case.html) for analysis of the subtle nuances in making that determination.\n\nThe concept \"work for hire\" which crucially involves the \"employee\" relationship would not be applicable to Company 2 paying Company 1 for a product, and as long as the actual author is an employee of C1, C1 has not created a \"work for hire\" in the legal sense. Without some explicit disposition of copyright, Company 2 is in a sketchy position. Since C1 holds copyright, they must grant a license to C2 so that C2 can legally use it; or, C1 must transfer copyright to C2\\. This does not happen automatically, and (if C1 does not want to remedy the situation after the fact) C2 would need to take C1 to court to force a resolution to the situation. At that point, the issue would be what C1 *implicitly* promised, even though they didn't put it in writing. It is likely that the initial exchange was along the lines \"Can you make us a program that will do X?\", and the answer was \"Sure, that will cost Y\", and then \"Okay, go ahead, looking forward to the product\". The courts would not simply say \"Well, you didn't explicitly require a license, so you don't get to actually use the software that you paid for\". However, it's a somewhat open question whether the court would order a license (of what nature?) or a transfer of copyright. The disposition would depend heavily on the facts of the case (what was said, what C1 actually did, what kind of business they are, what did creating the work involve...).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A software development company (DevCo) was contracted by a manufacturing firm (ManuCo) to create a custom inventory management system. The project was completed successfully, and ManuCo paid DevCo in full. However, no explicit agreement regarding intellectual property rights was made. Six months later, ManuCo wants to sell the software to other manufacturers. Which of the following best describes the legal situation and potential outcome?\n\nA) ManuCo owns the copyright and can freely sell the software, as they paid for its development.\nB) DevCo retains the copyright, but ManuCo has an implied license to use and modify the software for internal purposes only.\nC) The individual developers at DevCo hold the copyright, and both companies need their permission to use or sell the software.\nD) DevCo owns the copyright, and ManuCo would need to pursue legal action to obtain rights to sell the software, with an uncertain outcome.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This scenario requires analysis of multiple concepts from copyright law and software development contracts. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. As per the documentation, the general rule is that the creator of the software holds the copyright. In this case, DevCo created the software, so they retain the copyright by default.\n\n2. The concept of \"work for hire\" doesn't apply here because DevCo is not an employee of ManuCo, but rather an independent contractor.\n\n3. Without an explicit agreement transferring copyright or granting a broad license, ManuCo's rights to the software are limited.\n\n4. ManuCo likely has an implied license to use the software internally, as this was the clear intent of the project. However, the right to sell or distribute the software is not automatically granted.\n\n5. For ManuCo to gain the right to sell the software, they would need to take legal action against DevCo. The outcome would be uncertain and depend on the specific details of their communication and the nature of their agreement.\n\n6. As mentioned in the documentation, courts would not simply deny ManuCo any rights to use the software they paid for, but the extent of those rights (especially regarding resale) is not clear-cut without an explicit agreement.\n\nThis question tests the application of copyright principles to a real-world scenario, requires integration of multiple concepts, and challenges the test-taker to critically analyze the situation beyond simple memorization of facts."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/71237/what-stops-free-content-creators-from-suddenly-making-their-content-copyrighte", "docs_id": 71237, "title": "What stops &quot;free content&quot; creators from suddenly making their content copyrighted, and suing everyone who has used their previously free material?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For example, pexels.com has a lot of stock images, free for any use including commercial sales, without attribution.\n\nThe content creators, i.e., photographers, know that by uploading their photo to that site, they give it away for free.

As stated in the documentation, the license is \"worldwide, non-exclusive, permanently, irrevocable, royalty-free.\" This means that once a photographer uploads their work to pexels.com, they cannot later change their mind and revoke the license or sue users who have used the image commercially.\n\nThe permanence and irrevocability of the license are crucial here. Even if the photographer deletes the image from pexels.com or attempts to re-license it elsewhere, the original license granted through pexels.com remains valid for all past and future uses of the image obtained through that platform.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the license cannot be revoked for future uses. Option B is incorrect because the photographer has no legal grounds to sue users who have used the image under the terms of the permanent, irrevocable license. Option D is also incorrect for the same reason - there is no mechanism for terminating the license once granted.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts (licensing terms, permanence, irrevocability) and applies them to a real-world scenario that tests critical thinking about the implications of digital licensing in the modern era."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58448/where-are-the-duties-of-a-sovereign-stipulated-in-international-law", "docs_id": 58448, "title": "Where are the duties of a sovereign stipulated in international law?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to Emmerich de Vattel, in his *The Law of Nations or The Principles of Natural Law*, first published in 1758, he writes:\n\n> It is a much discussed question whether a sovereign must observe the ordinary laws of war in dealing with rebellious subjects who have openly taken up arms against him.

You yourself point out that the visa process has not even started. The company's letter is merely an expression of its interest in your skills set. In this sense it reciprocates your expression of interest (from when you applied for the job), which does not restrict the company's right to eventually decline your application either. Once the company wishes to upgrade to a less ambiguous status, it can start by informing you accordingly and proceed based on your response.\n\nFurthermore, the prolonged uncertainty of both processing and granting of your visa in a country would make it inequitable to preclude you from trying to secure a job elsewhere.

The Art 2(2\\)(c) exemption for \u201cpurely personal or household activity\u201d does not apply since you're offering the service to the public.\n\nYou must consider GDPR compliance here. This is especially important as you are showing personal data to the *public*. Don't do that unless you have a very good reason, appropriate safeguards, and are clear to users how their information will be shown.\n\nOn a high level, GDPR compliance involves working on the following questions:\n\n* For what *purpose* are you processing personal data?\n\nContext: purpose limitation principle per GDPR Art 5(1\\)(b)\n* What is the *legal basis* for processing?\n\nGDPR Art 6(1\\) lists the available legal bases. Here, consent, necessity for performance of a contract, or a legitimate interest could be a legal basis. They may have further obligations attached. A legitimate interest requires a balancing test that considers the data subject's rights and freedoms. Consent must fulfil the conditions per Art 7 in order to be valid.\n* What is the *minimal data necessary* to achieve the purpose?\n\nPer the Art 5(1\\)(c) data minimisation principle, it is illegal to process personal data beyond what is necessary and adequate. You must provide *data protection by design and by default* per Art 25\\. Special categories of data per Art 9 such as health data are illegal to process outside of narrow exemptions. You must delete data once it is no longer necessary.\n* What *appropriate safeguards* and security measures should you apply?\n\nPer Art 24 and 25, you are responsible for determining and implementing appropriate measures. This depends a lot on your specific context, so there's no checklist you can apply. Per Art 25(1\\) you must pseudonymize the processed information if that is compatible with the processing purpose.\n* What *further compliance measures* do you have to consider?\n\nThere are additional GDPR and non\\-GDPR compliance measures. From the GDPR side:\n\n\t+ Use the answers to these questions to write a privacy policy, including the information that you must provide to data subjects per Art 13\\.\n\t+ Consider whether you have to maintain a Records of Processing document per Art 30, or if you have to make a Data Protection Impact Assessment per Art 35\\.\n\t+ If you use third party services, figure out whether they are a *joint controller* or *data processor* and apply appropriate safeguards.\n\t+ If you have data processors, ensure that you have a contract in place that covers the items from Art 28(3\\).\n\t+ If you share data with other controllers (not processors) you need a legal basis for doing so.\n\t+ If you transfer data into a non\\-EU/EEA country (after 2020: non\\-UK country) you need a legal basis per Art 44 and have to cover additional items in your privacy policy. Ideally, the target country is covered by an EC adequacy decision per Art 45\\. For US\\-based companies, this is the case only when they have self\\-certified under the Privacy Shield framework.Non\\-GDPR compliance steps could include cookie consent banners, or showing a VAT ID.\n* How can you prepare for *data subject requests*?\n\nData subjects have various rights per Arts 15\u201323, subject to the modalities in Art 12\\.

Which of the following best describes the legal and ethical implications of this strategy in the context of German employment law?\n\nA) It's legally permissible but ethically questionable, potentially damaging the employee's professional reputation\nB) It's both legally and ethically acceptable, as probation periods are designed for this purpose\nC) It's illegal due to the intentional misrepresentation of employment intentions\nD) It's legally risky due to potential breach of contract claims, despite the probation period\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex legal and ethical considerations. Legally, in Germany, employees can typically resign during a probation period with shorter notice (often two weeks). However, the intentional nature of accepting a job with plans to quickly leave could potentially be seen as acting in bad faith. \n\nThe top answer emphasizes the ethical implications, advising against this approach (\"Don't be a dick\"). It suggests being upfront with the first employer to avoid wasting their time and resources. This indicates that while it might be legally possible to use the probation period this way, it's ethically questionable and could damage one's professional reputation.\n\nThe answer also mentions negotiating a waiver of any break costs, which implies there could be financial penalties for backing out before starting. This adds a legal dimension, as the employee might be contractually obligated to pay these costs if they don't start the job.\n\nOption A best captures this nuanced situation, acknowledging the legal permissibility (assuming proper notice is given during probation) while highlighting the ethical concerns and potential professional consequences.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Copyright is automatic and begins when a work is created. The musician's original lyrics are copyrightable as soon as they are written.\n\n2. The melody from the old folk song is likely in the public domain due to its age (200 years). Using it in a new composition does not make it copyrightable again.\n\n3. The recording of the performance is a separate copyrightable work, even though it includes a public domain melody. This is because the specific performance and recording are new creative works.\n\n4. The combination of the public domain melody with new lyrics creates a new copyrightable work, but this doesn't extend copyright to the melody itself.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it wrongly suggests the old melody becomes copyrighted.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Criminal liability typically requires mens rea (guilty mind/intent), which the influencer lacked according to the scenario.\n2.

If this is truly the case, then there is no sexual assault.\n\nBut I don't think you meant to say this. As I explain below, in order to consent, A must not have been mistaken about the identity of B: A could not have thought that B was C. If she was mistaken, as you assert in the title and in the second paragraph, then she was not consenting at law in Canada.\n\nThus, I will assume you have used \"consent\" more colloquially, and move on to assess the scenario in which A merely \"consented\" in the sense that she was not physically or otherwise coerced into the physical acts.\n\n### Can mistaken identity result in sexual assault? Yes\n\nIn your scenario, where A thought B was C, the *actus reus* of sexual assault has occured: sexual touching without A's subjective consent. This is because consent is linked to the identity of the partner (see *R. v. Barton*, [2019 SCC 33](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17800/index.do) at para. 88\\).\n\nSee also *R. v. Hutchinson*, [2014 SCC 19 at para. 57\\-58, 63](https://canlii.ca/t/g62cv#par57):\n\n> **a complainant\u2019s mistaken belief about the identity of the partner** or the sexual nature of the act \u2014 whether or not that mistake is the result of a deception \u2014 **will result in no consent** under s. 273\\.1(1\\) of the Criminal Code.\"\n\n> ... if a complainant agrees to sexual activity with A, who is a specific individual known personally to her, she is not agreeing to sexual activity with B\n\n> ... the Ontario Court of Appeal in *R. v. G.C.*, [2010 ONCA 451](https://canlii.ca/t/2b6nr), 266 O.A.C. 299, leave to appeal refused, \\[2010] 3 S.C.R. v, adopted this approach and held that the complainant\u2019s belief that the partner was her boyfriend when it was in fact his identical twin resulted in no consent to the \u201csexual activity in question\u201d under s. 273\\.1 of the Criminal Code. (See also *R. v. O.A.*, [2013 ONCA 581](https://canlii.ca/t/g0qcv), 310 O.A.C. 305\\.)\n\nSince A was mistaken about the identity of the partner, there was no consent.\n\nB may very well have a defence available: mistaken belief in communicated consent (*R. v. Barton*). This defence asserts that the accused did not possess the *mens rea* of sexual assault (which is knowing of the lack of consent, or being reckless as to the lack of consent). This defence asserts that, despite A not consenting, B believed that A did consent. This was the attempted defence in *G.C.* and *O.A.*, cited above.\n\nFor this defence to be successful, B's belief in A's communicated consent must be based on reasonable steps taken by B to ascertain consent. Whether the steps taken by B were reasonable depends on what was known to B at the time.\n\n> the accused must take steps that are objectively reasonable, and the reasonableness of those steps must be assessed in light of the circumstances known to the accused at the time\n\nIn your scenario, you have not asserted that there is anything *known to B* about \"similar facial characteristics \\[he shares] with A's boyfriend.\" However\n\n* if it is well\\-known to B that he looks like C, and\n* depending on how similar the features are, and\n* depending on what B knew about A's ability to discern the difference between B and C\n\nthis might put an obligation on B to affirmatively confirm with crystal clear language that A knows that B is not C, failing which, he would not have the defence of mistaken belief in communicated consent. For example, in *G.C.* (the identical\\-twin case), \"\\[t]he trial judge recited the relevant facts of that night known to the appellant and concluded that without doing more than he did to make his identity perfectly clear to the complainant, the appellant could not be said to have taken reasonable steps necessary to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.\"\n\n---\n\nAnticipating comments that will always come up about evidence: this answer intentionally skips over questions like \"how would you prove X in court.\" This answer only says what the law is and what would have to be proven.

In the context of Canadian law, which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) Since Alice physically consented to the act, no sexual assault has occurred regardless of her mistaken belief about Bob's identity.\n\nB) Bob is guilty of sexual assault, but has a strong defense of mistaken belief in communicated consent if he was unaware of his resemblance to Charlie.\n\nC) The incident meets the actus reus of sexual assault due to Alice's mistaken identity, but Bob's criminal liability depends on whether he took reasonable steps to confirm Alice's informed consent.\n\nD) Bob is automatically guilty of sexual assault because consent obtained through mistaken identity is always invalid, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario touches on complex issues of consent and mistaken identity in Canadian sexual assault law. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. According to R. v. Hutchinson and other cited cases, consent is linked to the identity of the partner. Alice's mistaken belief about Bob's identity means there was no valid consent under Canadian law, meeting the actus reus (physical element) of sexual assault.\n\n2. However, for Bob to be found guilty, the mens rea (mental element) of the offense must also be proven. This depends on whether Bob knew or was reckless about Alice's lack of consent.\n\n3. Bob may have a defense of mistaken belief in communicated consent, but this defense is only valid if he took reasonable steps to ascertain consent given the circumstances known to him at the time.\n\n4. The question of Bob's criminal liability therefore hinges on factors such as whether he knew about his resemblance to Charlie, how strong the resemblance was, and what steps (if any) he took to ensure Alice was consenting to sex with him specifically, not Charlie.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of multiple legal concepts, including the elements of sexual assault, the nature of consent, and potential defenses.

The change being discussed is actually a change in how economists and corporate law theorists think about corporations. \n\nThe basics of corporate law did not change significantly in the 1970s. There were some minor changes starting to take place then in law and practice, however. \n\nThe most notable of these were the rise of insider trading laws with real bite, the innovation in financial practice of the leveraged buy\\-out which precipitated \"poison pill\" defense from board of directors, and the surge in CEO pay often in the form of stock options. \n\nThere has been a shift in perspective and framing of the issues, but these changes are not huge changes in corporate law *per se*. Legal decisions allowing \"poison pills\" were minor anti\\-shareholder rights innovations. Tax laws encouraging stock option compensation were minor shareholder value oriented innovations. The theoretical basis of insider trading laws is a doctrinal muddle. No one conception of the corporation is completely dominant today and drives all legal theory and policy decisions.\n\nSecondly, Lynn Stout is engaged in a misleading bit of ret\\-con in her article and is presenting a misleading history of the evolution of corporate law scholarship. \n\nThis history, by the way, isn't terribly old. The right to form a corporation without a specific piece of authorizing legislation of the kind that creates a government agency, for example, is only about 150 years old or so, and both internationally and until quite recently, was much harder to form (e.g. many countries, such as South Korea, require proof that a corporation has insurance in place and sufficient capital to pay its debts before it is allowed to incorporate \\- corporate law firms still face some of these restrictions in the U.S.) Before then, each corporation was an individual legislative concept to some extent.\n\nThe notion that corporations should maximize shareholder well being, because they own the corporation, is the older and traditional view. Milton Friedman and the authors of \"The Theory of The Firm\" were simply restating the consensus view in a more focused and economically defined manner, not innovating. These pieces were published as apologies for that traditional view once it started to be challenged.\n\nThe view of a corporation as a web of contractual relationship with bondholders, suppliers, employees, customers and shareholders is the more modern view that started to gain currency sometime around the 1960s and 1970s, which is why people like Milton Friedman felt the need to articulate a defense of the traditional view that had previously merely been assumed and gone unchallenged. \n\nThe web of contracts theory was articulated initially to a great extent by corporate law theorists seeking to provide a theoretical justification for corporations to act in a responsible manner that treats its employees well, behaves honestly, goes above and beyond its legal obligations to honor the spirit as well as the letter of the law, etc.\n\nSome of the most notable corporate law responses to that theory are the law of publicly held companies in Germany, which requires that employees have a minority number of seats on the board of directors of a company, and the laws in some Scandinavian countries that call for rough gender parity on corporate boards of directors. There have also been a smattering of laws passed at least authorizing corporations to consider factors other than profit maximization.\n\nAnother related version of corporate theory to the web of contract theory is the \"director primacy\" conception of the corporation that sees a corporate board of directors as the hub of that web of contracts and the body which corporate law should protect the power of. [Professor Stephen Bainbridge](http://www.professorbainbridge.com/about.html) at UCLA Law is one of the leading proponents of this minority view of corporate law which was starting to emerge in the 1980s to justify efforts by corporate boards to defend themselves from the emerging threats of leveraged buyouts and proxy fights.\n\nBainbridge's view is nonetheless significant because it is an overarching theory that explains a variety of major corporate law doctrines, particularly in Delaware, whose law is dominant in the governance of publicly held corporations, that seem to be at odds with a shareholder primacy view of corporate law. It can explain the legitimacy of both \"poison pills\" and large CEO pay packages, the Delaware court's hostility to derivative suits, and its hostility to shareholder activism. To some extent, the \"director primacy\" view of corporate law is the web of contracts theory twisted and seen through a conservative lens that uses the theory to urge the law to crush the kind of shareholder activism for social good and employee rights that the original web of contracts sought to advance.\n\nThe rights of everyone other than a shareholder in a corporation are simply contract law rights \\- bond contracts, purchase and sale contracts, employment contracts, etc. \n\nThe web of contracts theory argues that the legal rights of shareholders vis\\-a\\-vis a corporation really aren't that different and that this relationship is really more like any other contract right rather than really being a genuine ownership relationship like the kind of ownership someone has over their other property that should be entitled to special consideration. \n\nThis view has a lot to do with the fact that in publicly held companies, in reality, shareholders have no meaningful role in the governance of the corporation or selection of members of the board of directors via the occasional Soviet style ballots for directors that they complete. Instead, in this context, shareholders apply the \"Wall Street Rule\" and sell stocks of companies that they feel are ill governed and don't worry too much about their practical inability to compel dividend distributions since they can take profits from retained earns by selling their stocks. This makes them look more like people with any other commodity to trade with purely contract and not political/ownership rights. This view doesn't translate well to closely held corporations where shareholder governance rights, in practice, are much more meaningful.\n\nAlso, for completeness, it is worth noting yet another emerging view of corporate law theory, developed mostly by liberals who favor campaign finance restrictions for corporations and want to restrain what they see as abuses of power by big business. This is the anti\\-corporate personhood movement that questions the assumption of all previous theorists that corporations should be treated in most respects as a \"person\" under the law. \n\nFor what it is worth, in my opinion, this movement improperly conflates abuses and power divisions that arise from businesses being very large and those attributable to the corporate form of business organization itself which actually can be very helpful in regulating businesses and redressing the harms that individuals suffer from corporate activities, by making it unnecessary to identify who within the corporation in particular causes a harm attributable to the corporation in litigation and regulatory contexts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A large multinational corporation is considering restructuring its governance model in light of evolving corporate law theories.

To give just one example, in Denmark I have been told that it is illegal to grow and possess cannabis but not to buy or sell cannabis seeds. One could imagine that the intention in general is to make cannabis a forbidden substance, particularly consumption of it as a drug. But for various reasons, perhaps unrelated to cannabis specifically, they decided it may be excessive, or unjust, or undesirable, to ban.. some associated plant structure or something that is not itself psychoactive.\n\nBut this slightly forced, arbitrary division between allowed and not allowed only invites weird ways of toying with or working around the law.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. While the documentation suggests that omissions might not constitute perjury in some jurisdictions, it clearly states that omissions intended to pervert the course of justice are illegal under s319 of the Crimes Act 1900.\n\n2. The lawyer has a professional and ethical obligation not to encourage or allow their client to mislead the court, even through technically true but misleading statements. Doing so could risk legal sanctions or disbarment for the lawyer under s323, which prohibits influencing witnesses to withhold true evidence.\n\n3. Option A, while possibly avoiding perjury, would likely constitute perverting the course of justice and be unethical for the lawyer to advise.\n\n4. Option B, while legally permissible, doesn't address the ethical implications for the lawyer in potentially concealing relevant information.\n\n5. Option D would likely constitute perjury if the client does recall, and the lawyer would be unethically advising false testimony.\n\n6. Option C represents the most ethical and legally sound approach, as it ensures full disclosure and avoids any risk of perverting the course of justice or ethical violations for the lawyer.\n\nThis question tests the application of legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring critical thinking about the interplay between legal technicalities, ethical obligations, and potential consequences for both the client and the attorney."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82253/is-an-intimation-sent-by-sms-text-messenger-a-legal-notice", "docs_id": 82253, "title": "Is an intimation sent by SMS/Text/Messenger a legal notice?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Jurisdiction: Maharashtra, India\n\nAn agreement has recently come up for renewal.

To the best of my understanding (unlike Whatsapp which is built upon the TCP/IP stack) SMS is not a connection\\-oriented protocol i.e. Message Sent does not equate to Message Received. Although TSP do endeavour to provide a receipt, delivery of an SMS may fail silently. It may even transpire that an SMS is delivered only partially. Ergo, whilst the lessor may have sent the message (and have proof of dispatch) it does not follow that the message was received and received in the form intended.\n\nIs there a precedent elsewhere (outside India) for an intimation sent by SMS to be deemed a legal summons? What, if any, is the defence against this clause?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While I am not sure about an SMS precedent, it is not uncommon in US contracts for a contract to specify that a notice is deemed delivered when it is placed in ordinary First Class US mail, properly addressed, although such mail makes no attempt to assure a receipt, and is in no way guaranteed delivery. Indeed I suspect that SMS is rather more reliable, although I have no statistics at hand.\n\nNote that in this case the language specifies that notice is to be sent by registered post **and also by** email, SMS, or Whatsapp. Thus there should always be proof via the registered letter, and normally quick delivery by electronic means.\n\nIn any case the parties to the contract may specify whatever methods of delivery they choose.

The correct answer is B because it fails to meet the primary requirement of sending notice by registered post. The agreement explicitly states that the lessor must issue \"a prior written notice of not less than 3(three) months by registered post, or speed post.\" Electronic methods (email, SMS, WhatsApp) are specified as additional means of communication (\"and also by\"), not as replacements for the formal postal notice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the registered letter satisfies the primary requirement, even if the SMS fails.

The law states that an implement of husbandry must be \"in use for the exclusive function of serving agricultural, horticultural, or livestock operations.\" The key phrase here is \"exclusive function.\"\n\n2.

However, it's often up to lay citizens to notice these discrepancies and take them to court for appeal.

If y'all got any insights, I'd strongly appreciate them.\n\nThe DEFINITIONS part is particularly tricky for me, as we've got, off the top of my head:\n\n1. Agents\n\t* Public ones: Courts, Legislative Assemblies, Administrations, Department, Position (distinct to the person of the civil servant in it), \"Organ\", etc. (it's quite a tangled web of affiliations and dependencies, and liable to change quickly, too).\n\t* Private citizens, with the attributes thereof that are deemed relevant (nationals/EU citizens/foreign, major/minor, etc.)\n\t* Private associations: Privately or Publicly owned, For Profit or Non Profit, different types of corporation...\n2. Actions: For example, for a person to be \\[appointed to an Positon],\n\\-Organ A \\[nominates],\n\\-Organ B \\[introduces in the agenda],\n\\-Organ C \\[votes],\n\\-Organ D \\[vetoes or not],\n\\-Organ E \\[signs the appointment],\n\\-Organ F \\[publishes] in the official bulletin, etc.\n3. Documents: just in the example above, each action or lack thereof is recorded (actively or by default) in a document (Nomination, Minutes, Appointment, the Bulletin, etc.). Then you have stuff like Registries and Records, which are compilations of documents, and need to be distinguished from the Organs named after them that are in charge of running them. You have Contracts, which are a whole Thing themselves. You have your specific Administrative Acts and your General Decrees. And, well, I can't help but think of the myriad types of documents, both formal and not, that are introduced in \\- discovery, was it? \\- as Evidence.\n4. Dates and timestamps are very important, as are the specific windows and deadlines to perform this or that action.\n5. Principles: they're very annoying because they're unevenly applied and usually not self explanatory, but they're supposed to inform all legislation and, when they're in the Consitution, they're meant to be very binding indeed. Legality, Rule of Law, State of Law, Non\\-Arbitrariness, Objectivity, Impartiality, Transparency, Non\\-Retroactiveness, General Interest, Cooperation, Coordination...\n\t* It's possible to go to the Doctrine (i.e., the opinions of Respected Legal Scholars) or to Case Law (which tend to rule on ambiguities of this type) to construct something resembling a useful formal definition, but it's usually very difficult to avoid a degree of \"fuzziness\" and \"gradient\" in the concept.\n\t* As such, my impression is that any formal tests that one could devise to make sure the laws apply those principles would fall under the header of operationalization, i.e. answering a difficult question with a similar, much simpler one.\n\t\t+ The example I was given in Philosophy of Science class at Uni was: \"How much do you love your wife?\" vs. \"How high a voltage are you willing to be shocked with in order to guarantee that she herself does not get shocked?\"\n\t\t+ Likewise, \"is this law impartial\" could be turned into \"in practice, what demographics are disproportionately favored by it and what aren't\", although that requires going outside of the formal confines of the law. There's likely a way to formally test if, in theory, the law is impartial, but I can't think of one right now.\n\t\t+ Similarly, the concept of \"General Interest\" is quite problematic\n\t\t\\- a huge collection of subjective interests that seems incredibly hard to even *know* objectively, let alone turn into a set of quantitative criteria, or legislate for without biases or hidden assumptions,\n\t\t\\- and yet \"the Administration serves the General Interest Objectively and Impartially\" is an actual article of Law that is in effect and which you could refer to in court when appealing an administrative regulation or act that you have evidence serves Special Interests, is Subjective, or favors certain parties over others.\n\nI've been circling the problem, reading some law, attempting a chart and a pseudo\\-code, going to practical cases, reading some theory on the background thereof, learning about different coding languages and practicing simple exercises just to get the hang of them, etc. I'm slowly growing familiar with declarative, imperative, object\\-oriented, etc languages, as well as Controlled Natural Languages and attempts to make programming easy to parse for people and human language easy to parse for machine. I'm finding out about programs and AIs that are designed to parse language, and about statistical methods to hermeneutics and data analysis.\n\nIt's been quite haphazard and unstructured, and I feel like I may be wasting my time blindly touching an elephant's trunk and trying to figure out what sort of snake it is. But I'm afraid to raise my voice, explaining what I'm doing and ask, \"am I doing this right\" and of either being ignored or being told to ask a more specific and well\\-researched question. I'd really appreciate some guidance, though.\n\nI guess, for now, I'd be content with tips on how to approach the following problems, in order of priority:\n\n* automating the representation of laws as control flow charts\n* automating the discovery of\n\t+ undesirable loops and end\\-states in said flow charts\n\t+ fringe cases that are pedagogically optimal for explaining the nuts and bolts of the law to people learning it\n\t+ ambiguous language: when a word means different things depending on which \"semantic field\" of law we're in \\- for example, \"convention\" can mean very different kinds of agreements in Civil Law, Administrative Law dealing with private entities, Administrative law dealing with different tiers of the Administration, and International Law, just to name a few.\n\t+ formal contradictions between laws of equal and different tiers\n\nThat would be a good start \\- just a formal comprehension and testing of the law.\n\nOther than that, I'm aware that LawTech firms [are developing some truly interesting applications](https://www.legalgeek.co/startup-map/) on a number of subjects, with particular attention paid to contract drafting and enforcement, and the automation thereof, as well as to the prediction of outcomes in lawsuits based on case analytics. I'm not, however, aware of the theoretical and skillset edifice upon which this kind of work is build \\- but it interests me a great deal. In fact, I'm finding Law so fascinating and vitally important that I'm actually considering getting a Law degree myself \\- I understand that STEM\\-trained folks are actually rather welcome in Law Schools? I'd strongly appreciate any guidance on how to build my knowledge and skills base to begin to be able to grapple with such problems \\- and, eventually, if I'm any good at it, offer useful billable expertise that clients would purchase, of course.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can\u2019t have complete mathematics; you have no chance of a complete legal system\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Godel\u2019s incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) tell us that mathematics has no complete, consistent and finite set of axioms that can prove every correct statement.

As many online resources ([including StackExchange](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77282/under-the-gdpr-in-germany-is-a-privacy-policy-required-when-not-tracking-any-pe)) suggest, it is next to impossible to have a website and not fall under GDPR rules. Furthermore, there seems to be some confusion and back\\-and\\-forth on what is deemed compliant, and what's not.\n\nIf you want to clarify how GDPR rules apply in your case, the usual advice is to \"get a lawyer\". However, this is not practical for many small starting online businesses that have no resources to pay for a full time legal advisor. So I am hoping to gather some practical tips about doing this without employing a lawyer.\n\nFirst, let me lay out some assumptions on the nature of the business:\n\n* It is new and small in every sense of the word: a few dozen customers, $1k\\-2k monthly turnover\n* It is based in UK\n* It is not dealing with extra\\-sensitive data like bank account numbers or identity documents\n\nAnd now some specific questions:\n\n1. What would be the best strategy in terms of \"cost vs reliability\" to ensure GDPR compliance? Would it be practical to follow one of the many GDPR tutorials online to choose a proper hosting, security measures, etc?\n2. If I unintentionally use a non\\-compliant hosting configuration or a 3rd\\-party service like Google Analytics that transfers customers' data to a \"unsafe\" jurisdiction, what consequences is it likely to bring about? Are there any examples of this happening?\n3. How severe should data processing faults be for the business to be facing serious fines and lawsuits (vs. just fixing the fault and issuing an official apology)?\n4. What would be a sensible time to actually employ a GDPR advisor? Is this based on the kind of data that the company handles? On the number of customers? On the turnover?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is entirely possible to reach a reasonable level of compliance in a DIY approach, provided that you familiarize yourself with the relevant legal framework. The UK ICO has produced in\\-depth guidance to help here, which is significantly more digestible than the laws themselves:\n\n[ICO Guide to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/)\n\nFor a first reading, it is probably appropriate to focus on the summaries and checklists at the top of each section.\n\nYou will however notice that GDPR is a lot about *principles*, and requirements like selecting *appropriate* compliance measures yourself. On one hand, this means that you have some flexibility in your compliance approach, but it also means also that you can never be sure whether you're actually compliant. But this is also precisely why professional help can be valuable, since compliance professionals probably have a better overview of best practices, state of the art measures, and also potential pitfalls.\n\nIn some [other](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/83897) [answers](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/83565), I have written basic overviews/checklists to get started with a GDPR compliance effort.\n\nOn to your concrete questions:\n\n1. What is the best strategy to get started with GDPR compliance?\n\nThis is ultimately a business decision that you have to make. You have to consider how much compliance is worth to you, both in terms of time and money. Maybe you can DIY it, maybe you'll want to get professional help, maybe you'll just hope that no one ever sues you or lodges a complaint. There is no objective optimum, and only you know your particular situation.\n2. What are the consequences for unintentional infringement?\n\nNot being aware of the rules is not a valid defense (*ignorantia juris non excusat*).\n3. How are fines calculated?\n\nThe GDPR has two separate enforcement mechanisms: data subjects can sue you for compliance and damages, and the ICO can fine you.\n\nDamages are typically small compared to the cost of a lawsuit.\n\nWhen issuing fines, the ICO must consider a variety of factor per [Article 83](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/83), for example whether the infringement was willful or negligent. The ICO is not required to impose damages, and anecdotally many small problems can be resolved informally before it comes to a full investigation.\n\nIn particular, the [ICO's Regulatory Action Policy 2018](https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2259467/regulatory-action-policy.pdf) explains that \u201cwe will reserve our powers \\[to issue fines] for the most serious cases, representing the most severe breaches of information rights obligations. These will typically involve wilful, deliberate or negligent acts, or repeated breaches of information rights obligations, causing harm or damage to individuals.\u201d The policy also provides a 5\\-step process for arriving at fines: removing financial gain, accounting for scale and severity of the breach, considering aggravating factors, ensuring a deterrent for others, and considering mitigating factors.\n\nThis suggests that a good\\-faith effort to ensure compliance already goes a long way.\n4. When to get professional help?\n\nUnder some circumstances, the GDPR *requires* that you appoint a data protection officer, who doesn't have to be an employee. You mention that you do not process sensitive data, so that it is currently unlikely you'd be required to appoint a DPO (compare Art 37, but note that the list of sensitive categories of data in Art 9(1\\) does not match your examples). The requirement to appoint a DPO depends entirely on the kind and scale of your data processing activities, not on number of employees or revenue thresholds. However, some GDPR compliance obligations like Art 30 Records of Processing Activities can also trigger when you reach 250 employees.\n\nAside from that, it is a business decision whether and when to invest in compliance.\n\nNote that if your business offers goods or services to people in the EU/EEA, you may be required to appoint an EU representative. Some law firms offer package deals for DPOs \\+ EU/UK representatives.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about GDPR compliance for small online businesses, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A UK-based startup with 50 customers and \u00a31,500 monthly revenue has just launched its website, which uses Google Analytics for visitor tracking.

It addresses the specific concern about data transfers to potentially \"unsafe\" jurisdictions (as Google Analytics may transfer data to the US).\n2.

It reflects the documentation's advice that a DIY approach can be reasonable for achieving compliance, provided the business familiarizes itself with the requirements.\n\nOption A is overly drastic and likely too resource-intensive for a small startup.

In other words, the law is a set of propositions which must *all* be true, and unlike actual execution of instructions in a sequence, law is to be interpreted simultaneously but hierarchically (that is: the order in which clauses are written is not significant). The appearance that the law is self\\-contradictory is largely illusory, though the resolution of the conflict may require a careful reading of the law and knowledge of jurisdictional hierarchy (federal law is superior to state law, which entails a particular resolution of the apparent conflict). Sometimes there are real conflicts, which usually result from using words in conflicting ways (note the practice of re\\-defining words \"in this chapter/section/title\").\n\nThe reason why law is not a science is that law is normative, not descriptive: it dictates what is allowed (a determination made through the political process), and does not attempt to discover what independently is. The reason why the legal process cannot be implemented in software is that software does not yet correctly interpret natural language, and law is written in natural language following interpretations based on judgments of what choices a reasonable would make.\n\nPerhaps if you propose a piece of law that you think is contradictory, it would be possible to show how the contradiction is illusory.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about legal interpretation, here's a question that integrates multiple concepts and requires critical thinking:\n\nQuestion: A software engineer is tasked with creating an AI system to interpret local ordinances for a smart city project.

I have always thought you need some sort of medical information attached with the 18 identifiers to make it PHI, otherwise without the health information, it's PII. So a first and last name with the diagnosis of diabetes is PHI, but my first and last name is not PHI, only PII.\n2. Does it matter where the information originated from? For example if a person inputs their health information into a healthcare website, say weight and medical condition, is that different from a doctor inputting that same data into their EHR?\n3.

PHI relates to physical records, while ePHI is any PHI that is created, stored, transmitted, or received electronically.\nPHI only relates to information on patients or health plan members. It does not include information contained in educational and employment records, that includes health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in its capacity as an employer.\nPHI is only considered PHI when an individual could be identified from the information.

Being not a native of the UK I am new to the process and have nobody to ask advice from.\n\nHR told me that I would need to contact lawyers for them to review the documents given by HR. At the end of it they suggest two law firms they are used to working with from what they told me. They also say that they will reimburse up to \u00a3500 in lawyers' fees. From my perspective, it looks a bit suspicious that they give me the name of these two law firms.\n\nIs this normal or usual, and is it legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an increasingly common practice in the UK for dismissals, especially for reasons of redundancy.\n\nWhat is going on here is that they are attempting to enter into what until recently was known as a **compromise agreement**, and is now termed **settlement agreement**.\n\nNormally, when you are made redundant, you are entitled to statutory redundancy pay (amount depends on age and length of service; see [https://www.gov.uk/redundant\\-your\\-rights/redundancy\\-pay](https://www.gov.uk/redundant-your-rights/redundancy-pay)). You can take this and **do not need to sign anything**.\n\nHowever, sometimes companies make slightly more generous offers in exchange for you agreeing not to take them to tribunal/court or discuss/disclose certain matters. This would often involve more money and an agreed reference. **These agreements only have legal standing if you have taken legal advice from a person qualified to give it**. The UK's national conciliation and arbitration service ACAS has information on settlement agreements at [http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid\\=4395](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4395)\n\nTherefore the employer is offering to pay legal fees because they need you to get advice before you sign a document which protects them. They are suggesting solicitors because they know of solicitors willing to do this work for the price they are willing to pay.\n\nSome companies will do this for every dismissal and have a have a standard package for enhanced redundancy. Other companies decide for each case.\n\nBefore you proceed to arrange a solicitor, you should check:\n\n* That you are free to choose another solicitor who will do the same for \u00a3500\\.\n* That this will be paid whether or not you agree to the terms.\n* What your length of service is, what your statutory entitlement is and what the difference is between that and what you are being offered.\n\nYou should also think carefully about whether you have any potential claims against the employer \\- for instance, if you think you are not being made redundant because the employer is doing less of a particular type of work but because you have raised issues of discrimination. You are probably being asked to give up your right to pursue this.\n\nIn terms of choice of solicitor, a solicitor which gets work from employer recommendations probably won't be too forthright in encouraging you to challenge unfavourable terms (even if they do not work for employers). If you are a member of a trade union, they will be able to suggest lawyers who do settlement agreements for employees on a regular basis.

The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate action because:\n\n1. The documentation advises checking if you're free to choose another solicitor who will do the same work for \u00a3500, indicating that using the company-suggested firms isn't mandatory.\n\n2. It recommends finding a firm that specializes in representing employees, as solicitors getting work from employer recommendations might not be as forthright in challenging unfavorable terms.\n\n3.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Microsoft's official stance, as per the archived support page, states that developers can use Microsoft tools and frameworks to implement the Ribbon UI in Windows applications. The Windows Ribbon Framework is explicitly mentioned as a licensed option.\n\n2. For macOS, there's no clear permission or framework provided by Microsoft. The documentation mentions Microsoft uses a ribbon in macOS Office applications but doesn't indicate if other developers may use it on non-Windows platforms.\n\n3. Option A is risky because implementing a custom ribbon from scratch might infringe on Microsoft's IP, especially since there's been no clear statement that the ribbon is no longer protected.\n\n4. Option C is problematic because third-party ribbon controls may not have the necessary licenses from Microsoft, potentially exposing the company to legal risk.\n\n5.

The executor ... **is not bound by specific directions left in the will**.\n> * If there isn\u2019t a will or an executor hasn\u2019t been appointed, the next of kin is responsible for the body. If the next of kin doesn\u2019t want to be involved, the funeral may be arranged through the government contractor.\n> * Where a person who dies in hospital has no next of kin or friends to arrange or pay for the funeral, and had no money or other assets, and the coroner is not involved, the hospital where they died must accept responsibility for arranging and paying for the funeral through the government contractor.\n> * If a person died at home, and has no next of kin or friends to arrange or pay for the funeral, had no money or other assets, and the coroner is not involved, when a doctor has issued a medical certificate of cause of death, the police will complete a burial/cremation of a \u2018Deceased Destitute Person\u2019 form P372, which is sent to the Director of Public Health Unit (PHU) of the relevant Health Service. The government contractor will be contacted by the PHU to organise a funeral. If a medical certificate of cause of death was not issued, the body is taken to the coroner\u2019s morgue.\n> * The coroner issues an \u2018Order for Disposal of a Destitute Person\u2019 and forwards it to the Director of the relevant Health Service\u2019s Public Health Unit (PHU). The PHU, in turn, contacts the government contractor who forwards the invoice to the PHU for payment by the Area Health Service. See the section on destitute funerals. If a Coroner\u2019s case involves a destitute person, and there are next of kin, the counsellors at the Department of Forensic Medicine can be approached by the family to assist with funeral arrangements.\n> * If the deceased has no next of kin, but did have money or assets, the case is referred to the NSW Trustee and Guardian who arranges and pays for a funeral from the estate.\n\n> **If someone dies with a will, but does not mention their body or how to dispose of it who decides what happens?**\n\nAs stated above, your requests in your will as to the disposal of your body are **not** binding on your executor. They must decide how to dispose of the body with consideration of their duties to the estate and beneficiaries. For example, if your will requests a funeral costing tens of thousands of dollars but your estate is worth only a few thousand then the executor is duty bound to ignore that request.\n\n> **a parent has two children and dies leaving no will, which of the siblings decides?**\n\nThey decide together. If they cannot agree then they will have to go to court. In general, in Australia, courts take a very pragmatic view of what should happen: quickest and lowest cost option on the table will generally win.\n\n> **Who pays for the result of that decision?**\n\nThe estate is responsible for funeral costs (and court costs in arguing about them). As a practical matter, funeral service providers (and lawyers) will require the person engaging their services to pay the bill; that person can then claim reimbursement as a creditor of the estate. In the event that the estate is insolvent (i.e. has more debts than assets) then their reimbursement will be less than their costs.\n\n> **If one sibling wants to have a huge funeral and the other wants to just toss the body in a dumpster does the cost for the funeral come out of the estate before it is split?**\n\nObserving that to \"just toss the body in a dumpster\" would be illegal; the costs of the funeral come from the estate as a creditor of the estate. The residual equity of the estate would then be divided in accordance with the will or the law if there is no will.\n\nIt is worth noting that joint assets (e.g. real property owned as joint tenants, joint bank accounts) pass directly to the surviving owner and never become assets of the estate.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A wealthy individual dies unexpectedly, leaving behind two adult children and a will that doesn't mention funeral arrangements.

The will's silence on funeral arrangements: The documentation states that even if specified, funeral requests in a will are not binding on the executor.\n\n2. Decision-making authority: With two children and no clear executor, they would need to decide together or go to court.\n\n3.

Funeral costs as estate debt: Funeral expenses are considered a debt of the estate, to be paid before distribution to beneficiaries.\n\nGiven these factors, option B is the most likely outcome.

According to the NSW Crimes Act 1900 s86, kidnapping involves taking or detaining a person without their consent, with the intention of obtaining an advantage. While the 17-year-old friend consented to the trip, the law specifically states that a person who takes or detains a child (under 18) is treated as acting without the consent of the child.\n\nHowever, the driver's lack of criminal intent (no ransom, no serious indictable offense planned) and the fact that both individuals attend the same high school could serve as strong mitigating factors. The driver's intention was to help a friend, not to commit a crime.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overlooks the legal nuance regarding consent for minors. Option B is too absolute, not considering the lack of criminal intent. Option D introduces a different charge that may not be applicable in this jurisdiction and doesn't address the potential kidnapping aspect.\n\nOption C is the most accurate because it acknowledges the potential for kidnapping charges based on the strict letter of the law, while also recognizing that the circumstances and lack of criminal intent provide a strong basis for defense.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Patents only become enforceable when granted, not when filed or published. The company isn't legally obligated to stop development at this stage.\n\n2. However, the concept of \"provisional rights\" means that if the patent is eventually granted with claims substantially identical to those in the published application, the patent owner could potentially claim damages for the period between publication and grant.\n\n3.

Very few states allow anyone other than a prosecutor (or sometimes in minor cases, a law enforcement officer) to bring criminal or quasi\\-criminal charges.\n\nOf course, if compelling evidence of a violation is found and shared with the media, there may be powerful political pressure to bring a prosecution, but how that is developed would entirely depend upon the circumstances. \n\nStill, the relationship between prosecutors and law enforcement is so symbiotic, that prosecutors are loathe to press charges against law enforcement officers in all but the clearest of cases, especially for offenses occuring while a law enforcement officer is on duty in his home jurisdiction.\n\n> Legally speaking, do civilians have any right to apprehend an officer\n>  for a traffic violation?\n\nWhile this would depend upon state law, most states treat traffic violations as a class of offense different from other misdemeanors and infractions and never authorize a citizens arrest for a traffic violation. Normally, only law enforcement officers can stop and cite people for traffic violations that aren't actually misdemeanor crimes.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, true traffic infractions are defined as civil matters for which someone may be stopped and subjected to a citation but not arrested (even by a law enforcement officer). *See* Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 42\\-4\\-1701(1\\).

But between different eras of Supreme courts I guess the present takes precedence over the past? What is the rationale for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The House of Lords declared themselves able to depart from their own precedents in 1966, [stating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_Statement) (emphasis added):\n\n> Their Lordships regard the use of precedent as an indispensable foundation upon which to decide what is the law and its application to individual cases. It provides at least some degree of certainty upon which individuals can rely in the conduct of their affairs, as well as a basis for orderly development of legal rules.\n> \n> \n> Their Lordships nevertheless recognise that **too rigid adherence to precedent may lead to injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development of the law**. They propose therefore, to modify their present practice and, while treating former decisions of this house as normally binding, to depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so.\n> In this connection they will bear in mind the danger of disturbing retrospectively the basis on which contracts, settlement of property, and fiscal arrangements have been entered into and also the especial need for certainty as to the criminal law.\n> This announcement is not intended to affect the use of precedent elsewhere than in this House.\n\nThis applies equally to the Supreme Court, which has replaced the judicial functions of the Lords. The Practice Statement of 1966 itself overturned *London Street Tramways v London County Council* \\[1898] AC 375, in which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, had said:\n\n> A decision of this House once given on a point of law is conclusive on this House afterwards.\n\nIn the modern understanding, it is in the interests of justice for the Supreme Court to always be able to say what the law is, even if that conflicts with the understanding of the past. As it is the final court of appeal, there is no other court which could review or overturn its decisions. Parliament *could*, and sometimes has, done so, but it is not always easy to express the desired effect in statutory language; and Parliament has many other demands on its time. It was felt that the court itself should be in a position to say that a past judgement was wrongly decided, or should no longer be considered binding for another reason.\n\nIn the Scottish tradition, this power has long been held to be inherent in that country's highest courts, the Court of Session / High Court of Justiciary. It is allied to the *nobile officium*, or equitable jurisdiction of those courts to provide a just remedy in the absence of any explicit law. Judicial precedent is not a barrier to justice either. As Lord Kames said (*Historical law\\-tracts*, 1758; tract 8\\),\n\n> No defect in the constitution of a state deserves greater reproach, than the giving license to wrong without affording redress. Upon this account, it is the province, one should imagine, of the sovereign, and supreme court, to redress wrongs of every kind, where a peculiar remedy is not provided.\n\nThose courts have not held themselves to a strict idea of *stare decisis* with respect to their own decisions, feeling instead that in the interests of justice they should be able to decide what a particular case demands. John Erskine explained (*An institute of the law of Scotland*, 1773; book 1, title 1, section 47\\):\n\n> Decisions therefore though they bind the parties litigating create no obligation on the judges to follow in the same tract if it shall appear to them contrary to law.\n\nEnglish courts, at least once in their roughly modern shape following the reforms of the late 19th century, have taken a stricter view of precedent, in the interests of predictability. The reform of 1966 was influenced by differences between English and Scottish practice, and represents something of a course\\-correction away from the strict position of the prior era.\n\nIn terms of the present and the past, \"precedent\" doesn't precisely mean that the past wins out. It would be better to say that a past decision is *presumed to be right*, up until proved otherwise, or made obsolete by events such as the passage of new statutes. The presumption is binding on lower courts, and merely \"very strong\" for the highest court.

A judge's mere answer that he would follow *stare decisis* is as useless as if a candidate for investment management simply answered that he would \"*buy low, sell high*\".\n\nNot all of that evasion is improper, though. For instance, the [Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct](http://courts.mi.gov/courts/michigansupremecourt/rules/documents/michigan%20code%20of%20judicial%20conduct.pdf) in its Canon 3\\.A(6\\) reads:\n\n> A judge should abstain from public comment about a pending or\n>  impending proceeding in any court, and should require a similar\n>  abstention on the part of court personnel subject to the judge's\n>  direction and control. This subsection does not prohibit a judge from\n>  making public statements in the course of official duties or from\n>  explaining for public information the procedures of the court or the\n>  judge's holdings or actions.\n\n(Note: I doubt the the federal equivalent of these rules would significantly differ. In this regard, the U.S. consists of many jurisdictions copying each other this type of rules. I would call it *jurisdictional rip\\-offs*. The term *rip\\-off* applies also from the standpoint that many judges flagrantly violate these rules, but I am digressing from the topic.)\n\nIn theory, the rationale for that \"Canon\" is that a judge's (or judicial candidate's/nominee's) public comments about pending or impending cases are very likely to disrupt litigation, exacerbate court\\-shopping, and is perceived as catering to certain lobbyists or groups of power, thereby heating the undeniable trafficking of influences in court. Moreover, that kind of comments would prejudice the party who is not favored by the comments and who has no equal access to the forum or media in order to refute those comments.\n\nHowever, you can see that the same item of that Canon allows a judge to explain \"*for public information \\[...] the judge's holdings or actions*\". Thus, principles of transparency should compel a judicial nominee to openly answer questions about his or her own decisions. Of course, for an examination to be effective, it is necessary that the legislators come prepared to the hearing by having read various opinions (decisions) released by that judge.\n\nFurthermore, the Canon does not prohibit to answer inquiries about hypothetical scenarios. As long as the hypotheticals do not resemble a pending or impending case, a judicial nominee (or candidate, where elected by public vote) should promptly give others a \\[non\\-conclusory] walk\\-through of his or her judicial rationale.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A Supreme Court nominee is being questioned during a confirmation hearing about their stance on a landmark case that established a controversial precedent.

The correct answer is B because the documentation clearly states that a person can be charged with disobeying a lawful order even if they are already breaking that order. The act of continuing to run after being ordered to stop constitutes disobeying a lawful order, which is separate from the act of resisting arrest.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes that resisting arrest and disobeying a lawful order are the same offense, which is not supported by the information provided. Option C is a common misconception that the question addresses directly, stating that you can be charged with disobeying an order even if you're already breaking it. Option D introduces an irrelevant condition about verbal acknowledgment, which is not mentioned or implied in the given information.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a specific scenario, and distinguish between related but separate offenses in the context of law enforcement interactions. It requires critical thinking about the nature of lawful orders and how they interact with ongoing criminal behavior."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6048/does-the-apache-2-0-license-require-attribution-on-a-commercial-work-on-which-it", "docs_id": 6048, "title": "Does the Apache 2.0 license require attribution on a commercial work on which it is based?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm using [Nativescript](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/blob/master/LICENSE) which is licensed under the Apache 2\\.0 license.\n\nProvided that I do not intend to change Nativescript itseft, but I'm using it to develop an application, am I expected to give attribution to the license and/or Nativescript in the final app that I deliver?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yep, you are.\n\nYou still need to keep the LICENSE and NOTICE files in the repository, if there were any in your copy of the project. These files contain the terms and conditions for the project, and provide attribution to the original developers. If you're trying to attribute in the UI of your application, you probably should.

The developer plans to distribute the app commercially through app stores. Which of the following approaches best satisfies the legal requirements and ethical considerations of open-source software usage?\n\nA) Include attribution to Nativescript in the app's \"About\" section and keep the LICENSE and NOTICE files in the source code repository\nB) Modify Nativescript's source code to remove licensing information before compiling the final app\nC) Only provide attribution if the app directly exposes Nativescript functionality to end-users\nD) Purchase a commercial license from Nativescript to avoid any attribution requirements\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of open-source licensing concepts in a real-world scenario. The correct answer, A, reflects the best practice for using open-source software like Nativescript under the Apache 2.0 license. \n\nThe Apache 2.0 license requires retention of copyright notices and a copy of the license. Keeping the LICENSE and NOTICE files in the repository satisfies this requirement. Additionally, while not strictly required by the license, including attribution in the app's UI (such as an \"About\" section) is considered courteous and aligns with the spirit of open-source software.\n\nOption B is incorrect and potentially illegal, as removing licensing information violates the terms of the Apache 2.0 license. Option C is a misconception; attribution is required regardless of how the library is used internally. Option D is incorrect because Nativescript is already freely available under the Apache 2.0 license, and purchasing a commercial license is unnecessary and doesn't exempt the developer from attribution requirements.\n\nThis question tests the developer's understanding of open-source licensing obligations, ethical considerations in software development, and the practical application of these concepts in a commercial context."}}
