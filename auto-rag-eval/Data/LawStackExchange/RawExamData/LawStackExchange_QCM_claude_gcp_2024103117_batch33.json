Once they follow up and the person has responded, there's no longer a basis for prosecuting.\n\n> What is the point of one of the oldest laws, in which some people have cared enough to amend, but not enough to actually enforce?\n\nThe possibility of prosecution is presumably thought to increase the response rate even if virtually nobody is ever prosecuted. The law also serves as a formal statement by congress that responding to the census is important, even if the executive doesn't prosecute people for failing to do so.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that an element of the offense specified in [13 USC 221](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/13/221) is refusal or *willful* neglect. Without evidence of an affirmative refusal to respond, the prosecutor would need evidence of willfulness, which goes to state of mind, and that is notoriously difficult to prove.

If you leave a field for \"E\\-mail to answer back to you\" and the user fills it, he has already consented to you processing his e\\-mail for the specific purpose of answering. It would be a [\"clear affirmative action\"](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/what-is-valid-consent/).\n\nAsserting that you have consent could be a little more complicated if you were forcing the user to provide the e\\-mail in order to send the form, since consent must be \"freely given\". If the kind of communications that are send to you may not require a reply (for example, to inform you that your website has some mistake), then it could be better to leave the e\\-mail field optional2.\n\nBesides, consent is just one of the motives that allow you to process user data, and you might have a [*legitimate interest*](https://www.gdpreu.org/the-regulation/key-concepts/legitimate-interest/)(art 6\\.1\\.f).

Today we (and every other 2017\\-18 tenant) received an email stating that we need to respond that we are intending to stay, with a form including our signature, by October 2 (49 days into the term) otherwise our apartment will be \"marketed and available to prospective tenants\".

If the store would actually let someone enter without a purchase but represents that paying is necessary or helpful, or treats people who \npaid differently than those who didn't, it isn't a lottery, but is an illegal sweepstakes ([source](http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/legal_guides/u-3.shtml)). \n\nRunning a lottery in California, with the exception of chartable bingo, charitable raffles, and the official state lottery, is a crime. So is running an illegal sweepstakes. It can be reported to the police; the entity with standing to bring a case is the People of the State of California. \n\nAs for lawsuits, it is possible that someone who paid to enter could sue under section 17200 of the Business and Professions Code, which allows those directly harmed by unlawful business practices to sue. A [case](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1279149.html) before a California appellate court found that someone who paid to enter an illegal lottery could sue a payment processor who had actual knowledge that the site was a lottery; I can't find the ultimate result of the lawsuit (and the appeal doesn't cover the website itself), but it at least strongly suggests that someone who paid to enter can have standing to bring a lawsuit.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small business in California is running a promotion where customers who make a purchase are entered into a drawing to win a prize.

Is there a clear distinction between the civil and criminal offenses in cases like this, what is that distinction, and why is that?\n\nAlso, how does this distinction affect the outcome for a person liable/guilty of either?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> if a friend hires someone to fix something in their house, but after\n> the repairs are done, the friend refuses to pay, this would likely\n> fall under theft of service.\n\nThis is incorrect.\n\nThe most common distinction is intent. (The [federal Canadian criminal code provision](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-322.html) for theft (Section 332\\) requires intent to commit the crime, although \"[false pretenses](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-81.html#h-122229)\" (Section 362\\) is probably a better match within the Canadian criminal code to theft of services and also requires a showing of intent).\n\nIf breaching a promise to pay that the person making the promise to pay intended to be honor when the promise was made fails to pay (e.g. due to poor budgeting or losing a job) this is a breach of contract.\n\nSimilarly, if someone accidentally attaches the wrong cable line to their TV and gets the premium package rather than the regular one, but didn't realize that fact, the cable company might have a claim for negligence or for unjust enrichment, but this would not constitute theft.\n\nIn contrast, obtaining services knowing at the outset that you do not intend to honor your promise yet deceiving the service provider with your promise is theft. Theft (in the context of a theft of services) is intentionally obtaining services by deceit with an intent not to pay for them at the time that they are obtained.\n\nProving this intent is usually prohibitively difficult and no something that law enforcement will choose to press charges regarding, but with very clear evidence (e.g. an audiotape of the person making a promise to pay bragging immediately before or after making the promise to pay about how he never intends to pay in the first place, or in a case with a pattern of conduct involving many service providers on multiple occasions), charges can be pressed and a conviction can be won.\n\nAlso, to be clear, it has nothing to do, *per se*, with the power relationships of the parties. If an employer picks up a bunch of day laborers telling them that they will be paid an agreed rate at the end of the day for the work they are made to do, and the employer not only doesn't pay them at the end of the day but didn't intend to do so in the first place and perhaps has a practice of picking up day laborers and then refusing to pay them without good cause, that is theft of services a.k.a. wage theft.\n\n> if I play a movie from a streaming service and screen\\-share on Zoom, I\n> would be committing civil copyright infringement (if it is not fair\n> use), but if I give other people my login credentials for the\n> streaming service, it would be theft of service, I think, depending on\n> the jurisdiction\n\nThis isn't a good analogy as it implicates copyright law which is quite different from other bodies of law.\n\nSome acts are both civil and criminal copyright violations. But criminal copyright violations are generally not a theft of services.\n\n[In Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_(Canada)), the typical criminal copyright violation involves the sale or rental of the copyright protected material to third parties for money.\n\n> how does this distinction affect the outcome for a person\n> liable/guilty of either?\n\nCivil law violations are a basis to bring a lawsuit against someone who breaches the law in a civil manner for money damages sufficient to compensate the person bringing the lawsuit for the damages that they have suffered.\n\nTheft is a criminal offense. The prosecutor's office decides whether or not to bring charges and if it does bring charges does so (in Canada) in the name of the Crown, at the government's expense under criminal procedure rather than the civil procedure applicable to lawsuits. The victim is usually a witness and is usually consulted, but is not a party to a criminal case. If a conviction is obtained for a criminal offense, the penalty is usually some combination of incarceration, a fine, probation and community service, as authorized by statute, with court costs and restitution to the victim tacked on as an afterthought.

While trying to get the guy to admit to possession, a police officer tells the suspect that the weight of the entire package would be what he's charged with possession, saying it weighs about a pound (implying that the soda can's weight is included). I know that police officers in the United States are allowed to lie. Is this an example of the officer lying to the suspect to get him to admit to a smaller amount of cocaine, or is it true that for some reason the weight of the container is included when charging people for possession?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a slim chance that it is truish, depending on whose law you are asking about, and also depending on the facts (if the drug was in a baggie, it's unclear; it is was mixed with the soda, it's clear and it's true). As far as I know, the \"baggie in can\" theory has not been put to the appellate test (perhaps that is evidence that the can does not count). However, in the case [Chapman v. US](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/500/453/), 500 U.S. 453, defendant was convicted of the sale of LSD\\-laced blotter paper, and was sentenced accosting to the 5\\.7 gram weight of the blotter paper, not the 50 milligram weight of the LSD that it contained. SCOTUS upheld the sentencing based on the higher weight, holding that \"The statute requires the weight of the carrier medium to be included when determining the appropriate sentencing for trafficking in LSD\", because the statute is stated in terms of a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" ([here, 21 USC 841](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/841), are some of the current laws, which repeated use the formula \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of\").\n\nThe question that would arise is whether a can containing a bag of something is a \"substance\" or \"mixture\". The ordinary meaning of \"mixture\" precludes that interpretation, but of course you also have to look at the legislative history to determine what Congress's intent was in writing these laws. Saying that a can with a bag is a \"substance\" is also counter\\-intuitive, but not as plainly unreasonable as calling a can and a bag a \"mixture\". In *Chapman*, the court observed that \"Congress clearly intended the dilutant, cutting agent, *or carrier medium* to be included in the weight of those drugs for sentencing purposes\", but again you might interpret \"carrier medium\" as referring to something other than \"the means of carrying the drug\" \u2013 \"carrier medium\" is not statutorily defined, and its \"plain meaning\" is broad (but also note that the statute doesn't mention \"carrier medium\"). In its ruling, the court appeals to \"the history of Congress's attempts to control illegal drug distribution\", and a careful study of all of the pertinent documents for this case might definitively rule in vs. out an interpretation that the weight of the container is to be included.\n\nAn obvious ludicrous consequence of including container weight is that if you are arrested for possession of a trace amount of a drug, found in your car, the weight of the car is to be considered and you get life in prison. It is plausible that the officer has a vague acquaintance with the Chapman\\-type ruling, and has misapplied the law, thus he has a good\\-faith belief that his claim is legally correct (thus he did not lie, he was simply wrong).

US case established that the weight of a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of the drug should be considered for sentencing. This includes carrier mediums like blotter paper for LSD. However, the exact definition of what constitutes a \"mixture,\" \"substance,\" or \"carrier medium\" can be open to interpretation and may vary based on specific circumstances.

Obviously they can't actually *demolish* the house without your permission \\- but they ask the local authority \"what do you think of this idea?\" Needing your land is not a breach of any planning rules (and, as you say, the builder will be planning to persuade you to agree).\n\nThe covenant looks promising, but if you go ahead and allow the road to be built, who could enforce the covenant? If the person (natural or legal) who has the right to enforce no longer exists, and hasn't passed the right on to some successor then the covenant is worthless. Similarly if the person who has the right to enforce is now owned or can be bought off by the builder, the covenant is worthless.\n\nYou can object to the planning application in the normal way, but do make sure that you object on proper planning grounds (loss of amenity, overlooked, not according to the local plan, over\\-developed, etc).\n\nYou can also write to the developer directly (not the planning department), saying that they shouldn't waste any further time on this project, as you will not be cooperating. (This only works if there is no *other* property they could use as an access. If the project is large enough, they may even be able to buy another house, demolish it, and build the road through there.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer has submitted an outline planning application that includes using part of your land for access to a larger development site.

According to the documentation, you can object to the planning application in the normal way, but it's important to do so on proper planning grounds such as loss of amenity, being overlooked, not adhering to the local plan, or over-development. The existence of a covenant, while potentially useful later, is not a valid planning objection.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no automatic right to an injunction to stop a planning application, even if it involves your land.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the covenant is a separate legal issue and not a valid planning objection.\n\nOption D is incorrect because property owners and other interested parties have the right to object to planning applications, including those at the outline stage."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31030/making-profit-of-copyrighted-material-when-exactly-does-it-become-illegal", "docs_id": 31030, "title": "Making profit of copyrighted material - when exactly does it become illegal", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As I understand copyright is something that is inherent in creative work, as in, if you painted a picture you automatically \"own\" the copyright to it without having to do anything extra. \n\nSay I have a bunch of pictures that I know are painted by someone else.

Let's also say that the person who owns the pictures doesn't care about how they are used and whether someone's profiting from them, and hence doesn't do anything about it. \n\nIs the act of making profit still automatically illegal in this case, or does it become illegal when the copyright owner tries to sue me?

Trying to understand the law behind such exhibitions.\n\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Making a profit does not make the act illegal: it is illegal without there being any profit. The act of copying without permission is what makes the act illegal. Profit might maybe enter into the matter if you are talking about the \"[fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info)\" defense, since certain kinds of works can be partially copied for certain purposes. You could quote a few lines from a novel in a review, for instance. The judgment of whether a given act of copying without permission is allowed under fair use is complex and involves a balancing act. Profit becomes relevant in that a non\\-profit use favors fair use and a for\\-profit use disfavors it. Wholesale copying of works of art as you describe is illegal (is infringement).\n\nHowever... \"illegal\" is a pretty broad concept. If you infringe on my intellectual property, you almost certainly will not suffer any consequences unless I sue you. Taking \"illegal\" to mean \"in violation of the law\", infringing copyright *is* illegal because it violates the law, but I have to make a federal case out of your infringement \u2013 I have to sue you. As it happens, it can also be a crime to infringe copyright, and in that case, the government and not the copyright holder pursues the matter. If a person *knowingly* infringes copyright, he might be prosecuted, thus the [Megaupload case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload_legal_case) which in the US is realized in the indictment [US v. Dotcom](https://www.scribd.com/document/78786408/Mega-Indictment). Moreover, [profit motive is a required element](https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1851-copyright-infringement-fourth-element-commercial-advantage-or) for criminal infringement. (Also note that you don't have to actually make a profit for the profit element to be present).\n\nYou cannot sue a person unless they have harmed you, so if you know that Smith copied Jones' work you can't sue Smith for harming Jones. (This is what they call \"standing\"). You might sue Smith, but not for infringement itself. If they sold you an illegal infringing copy, then you could sue. Or, their infringement could diminish the value of your legal copy. \n\n[This website](http://www.inhouselawyer.co.uk/wgd_question/are-there-criminal-sanctions-for-infringement-of-any-intellectual-property-rights-and-if-so-what-are-they-and-how-are-they-invoked/) gives a multi\\-nation overview of criminal copyright infringement laws.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided copyright information:\n\nQuestion: Under what circumstances could a person be criminally prosecuted for copyright infringement?\n\nA) Only if they make a profit from the infringement\nB) If they knowingly infringe copyright, even without making a profit\nC) If someone other than the copyright holder reports the infringement\nD) Only if the copyright holder files a criminal complaint\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While profit motive is a required element for criminal copyright infringement, the key factor is knowingly infringing copyright. The answer states that \"If a person knowingly infringes copyright, he might be prosecuted.\" Additionally, it's mentioned that you don't have to actually make a profit for the profit element to be present. Option A is incorrect because profit isn't the sole determining factor. Option C is wrong because random third parties can't initiate criminal proceedings.

Although the student was not a paid employee, the student presumably used university equipment and resources, and perhaps the professional advice of the professor. This might justify an agreement granting the university some rights in such developments.\n\nThe students rights will also depend very much on what country this is in. Copyright and IP law is **not** the same in all countries, and might limit the effect of the contract. The student should get an official representative of the university to explain exactly what rights the University claims, and how the situation would be handled.

The specific contract between the student and the university is crucial, as it outlines the agreed-upon terms regarding ownership and commercialization rights. Additionally, local intellectual property laws can play a significant role, potentially granting the student certain \"moral rights\" such as the right to be recognized as the author/creator. The use of university resources during the project's development may justify some university claims to the product.

If you aren't we need to clear that up!\n\nAs for the copyright holders, you haven't received notice complying with 17 USC 512 (c)(3\\)(A)(i\\-iv). As such you don't have notice.\n\nEven if these notices don't qualify then we argue about whether you have red flag notice \\- based on facts and circumstances. (See *Grokster*)\n\nEDIT TO ADD:\n\n[17 U.S. Code \u00a7 512 \\- Limitations on liability relating to material online](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512) is one of the sections created by the DMCA. It is sometimes referred to as the safe harbor. You can read about it on Wikipedia\u00ae page for the [Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act).\n\nIf you read that Wikipedia\u00ae page you will see a short [section on Red Flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#Red_flags). They say it as well as I could: \n\n> \\[In addition to notice from a copyright holder, the second way] that an OSP can be put on notice that its system\n>  contains infringing material, for purposes of section 512(d), is\n>  referred to the \"red flag\" test. The \"red flag\" test stems from\n>  the language in the statute that requires that an OSP not be \u201caware of\n>  facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.\u201d\n> \n> \n> The \"red flag\" test contains both a subjective and an objective\n>  element. Subjectively, the OSP must have knowledge that the material\n>  resides on its system. Objectively, the \"infringing activity would\n>  have been apparent to a reasonable person operating under the same or\n>  similar circumstances.\"\n\nThe reason that notice is important is that the safe harbor provided is only available if you do not know that infringing is happening. Plaintiff's prove knowledge through the letter or through red flags.\n\nI am glad that you asked about Grokster, because that was the wrong case! The case to look at is [Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. Youtube](https://apps.fastcase.com/Research/Public/ExViewer.aspx?LTID=QFAa6aKgMWuDCaRi8w2YMDGn%20Zwe2ehy0aJsxEsFVsZDN/sL018ounD/S0GsxwYyrYiaDnD3bFnGp5tnw3mRv141q1UePyP%20Nv2YcZweo0HPdNR9oK%20vkbsgJUkIf0QHp5NTTB3tcDAjHDsBCQiGBucF5TSIPvI19N8cDySbQAQ=), Inc., 676 F.3d 19, (2nd Cir., 2012\\).\n\n> The difference between actual and red flag knowledge is thus not\n>  between specific and generalized knowledge, but instead between a\n>  subjective and an objective standard. In other words, the actual\n>  knowledge provision turns on whether the provider actually or\n>  \u201csubjectively\u201d knew of specific infringement, while the red flag\n>  provision turns on whether the provider was subjectively aware of\n>  facts that would have made the specific infringement \u201cobjectively\u201d\n>  obvious to a reasonable person. The red flag provision, because it\n>  incorporates an objective standard, is not swallowed up by the actual\n>  knowledge provision under our construction of the \u00a7 512(c) safe\n>  harbor. Both provisions do independent work, and both apply only to\n>  specific instances of infringement.\n\nIn other words, you lose your safe harbor protection if you know of facts and circumstances that would lead an ordinary person to know that infringement is happening.\n\nSo the question for you is \\- do the letters forwarded by Google mean that you have knowledge and are outside of the safe harbor? Well that's the question that lawyers fight about! In fact [Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. v.

If you read that case you will see that Fung was doing a bunch of shit that totally made it completely obvious that he was infringing. And he was earning money directly from it. He was screwed from the start.\n\nNow again, this does not really help you with the google blacklist problem, but it should help you understand what you need to do as a service provider to not be complicit in copryright infringement.\n\nYou really should read the *Fung* case and 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512 \\- they will go a long way to help you understand the analysis a court will apply.\n\nEDIT\n\nRegarding your legal exposure, I always assume that a cease and desist letter will precede a lawsuit. With that said, only you know how much infringing is coming across your server. Fung made his money directly from the infringement. He attracted website visitors specifically because of the infringement. He had emails and other documents proving this. \n\nDiebold is interesting because they attempted to use copyright to control the spread of their emails. First the court said no commercial harm and no diminishment of value of the works. Then the court found that the stuff wasn't even subject to copyright. This is obviously not a typical case. But it sounds like you see yourself as OPG in this case. **I don't see how you can become a plaintiff against bona fide copyright holders who follow the links as far as your server**. As I understand it, you are a reasonable target of the the notices, that's the result of running the proxy.

Firstly, I am unsure that tenants are legally responsible for mould, since it is fundamentally down to the house and the lack of ventilation systems (I know for a fact that for little over \u00a31000 systems can be installed in the loft that will near enough guarantee mould prevention throughout the house \\- my uncle works in the industry).

The trademark owner suddenly cancels the license without citing any breach of conditions. Which of the following statements is most likely to be true?\n\nA) The license cancellation is automatically illegal as it violates the implied perpetuity of long-term trademark licenses.\nB) The licensee has an absolute right to continue using the trademark based on the duration of past usage.\nC) The legality of the cancellation depends on the specific terms of the license agreement and applicable law.\nD) Trademark licenses are always cancelable at will by the trademark owner, regardless of the agreement terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The legality of a trademark license cancellation primarily depends on the specific terms outlined in the license agreement. If the agreement stipulates that the license can only be canceled for cause, and no breach occurred, the cancellation might be challenged. However, if the agreement allows for cancellation at will or requires periodic renewal, the trademark owner may have the right to cancel.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there is no automatic implication of perpetuity in long-term trademark licenses. The terms of the agreement govern the duration and cancellation rights.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because past usage alone does not grant an absolute right to continue using a trademark. The license terms and applicable law determine the rights of the licensee.\n\nAnswer D is overly broad and incorrect. While some trademark licenses may be cancelable at will, this is not a universal rule.

What this provision is about is that students have the right to access education records, but they do not have the right to access the faculty member's own personal notes about the hearing.

You would need to do all the normal things that PCBUs have to do: risk assessment, procedures, consultation, emergency response, first\\-aid facilities etc. to cover the activity but you\u2019re running a business so that would just be an extension of what you already do.\n\nIf this is an employee only operation then you would need to decide if you are a PCBU and, if you are, WHS law applies. For example, a ju\\-jitsu club is a PCBU, a bunch of mates mucking around, isn\u2019t.

As a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU), the company can allow sports activities but must extend its existing Work Health and Safety (WHS) practices to cover this new activity. This includes conducting risk assessments, implementing safety procedures, ensuring proper consultation, and having emergency response and first-aid facilities in place.\n\n2. The company needs to treat this as a business activity rather than just informal employee recreation, as failing to do so could result in fines or legal consequences if someone is injured.\n\n3. Injuries sustained during this activity would likely be covered under Workers Compensation, as it would be considered \"in the course of employment\" due to occurring on company premises and potentially being an employer-endorsed activity.\n\n4.

This is based on the precedent set by the Spanner Case in the UK in 1987. In this case, several individuals were prosecuted for aiding and abetting consensual sadomasochistic assaults upon themselves. This demonstrates that under UK law, a person can potentially be charged with aiding and abetting an assault even if they are the victim of that assault and consented to it. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Spanner Case shows that consent does not necessarily protect someone from criminal liability in such situations. \n\nOption B is false because consent is not always a valid defense against assault charges, as evidenced by the Spanner Case. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the Spanner Case proves that the law can recognize and prosecute consensual violent acts as assault under certain circumstances.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complex relationship between consent and criminal liability in UK law, particularly in cases of assault."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18082/jury-nullification", "docs_id": 18082, "title": "jury nullification", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've heard about jury nullification, and I find it very interesting, but I don't know how it works exactly, and what is the legality of it. \nI've never dabbled in the \"laws\", so I'm not exactly knowledgeable about a lot of stuff... \nHow legal is jury nullification actually ? \nCan they charge a non guilty person guilty whenever they want regardless of others opinions ? \nCan they let go of a guilty person despite perfect arguments if they so choose to ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The jury ultimately decides if a person is guilty or not. Jury nullification is when the person is clearly guilty or innocent, but for some odd reason the jury (who knows the person is guilty/innocent) gives the \"wrong verdict\"\n\nAn example of this in the UK was when a guy was being charged with a spy crime years after his crime happened (I cant remember the case), the jury essentially thought that so much time has passed that it was silly to convict him, so gave a non guilty verdict.\n\nThere are cases for and against jury nullification.\n\nIn my personal belief I think in certain cases, such as if edward snowden would be charged, I would find him non guilty as a matter of what is right to ky conscience, regardless of the fact that he clearly did something illegal", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes jury nullification?\n\nA) A legal process where the judge overrules the jury's decision\nB) The jury's right to disregard the law and vote based on their conscience\nC) A procedure that allows the prosecution to nullify an unfavorable jury selection\nD) The ability of a jury to convict a defendant despite lack of evidence\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Jury nullification refers to the power of a jury to return a verdict that goes against the letter of the law if they believe the law is unjust or wrongly applied in a particular case. This is reflected in option B, where jurors vote based on their conscience rather than strictly following the law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because jury nullification is an action by the jury, not the judge. Option C is not related to jury nullification but rather to jury selection processes. Option D is the opposite of jury nullification, which typically involves acquitting a technically guilty defendant, not convicting an innocent one.\n\nThe example given in the text about the UK spy case and the hypothetical Edward Snowden scenario both illustrate instances where a jury might choose to acquit despite clear evidence of guilt, based on their sense of justice or fairness.

The exchange of\n>  the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file\\-sharing\n>  or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed\n>  toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided\n>  there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with\n>  the exchange of copyrighted works\n\nThe first sentence may allow the kind of use that you're describing, since The Work could be made available for money, but not for commercial advantage (which I take to be code for \"profit\") or private monetary compensation (code for \"personal gain\"). The second sentence addresses exchanging The Work for Something Else Copyrighted, so would not appear to be relevant to anything that you could do in a museum. (It does, however, say that there can't be any monetary compensation, so if you put the stuff on a DVD, you can't recoup your materials cost, though you can require an exchange DVD).\n\nIn case the work in question is music, (d) and (e) are relevant, the Licensor (creator) asserts the right to collect public performance royalties in case the primary purpose is \"commercial advantage or private monetary compensation\". This mildly contradicts what 4 restricts. This is just crazy, but required by law, because US Copyright law already has the concept of [\"compulsory license\"](http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ73.pdf). The importance of that is that if the law allows X, the license cannot disallow X. [17 USC 115](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/115) compels the copyright holder to license nondramatic musical works under certain conditions, so the seemingly contradictory language pertaining to music just mirrors the situation with the law. It would have been a bit clearer if they had included the phrase \"The restrictions in section 4 notwithstanding\".\n\nCopyright law already contains a limit on the copyright holder's ability to limit the work, with respect to public performances and displays [(17 USC 110\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/110). The law allows \n\n> performance or display of a work by instructors or pupils in the\n>  course of face\\-to\\-face teaching activities of a nonprofit educational\n>  institution, in a classroom or similar place devoted to instruction\n\n(It is best to read the whole thing to see how much is applicable to the situation in question). So even with a blanket ban on collecting money, there is still statutory permission for non\\-profit educational performance / display. The combination of what the law says and a generic non\\-commercial license may accomplish what you want.

The key phrase in the license is that the use should not be \"primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.\" A museum charging an entrance fee, especially if it's a non-profit institution, would likely fall under this allowance as long as the fee is not primarily for commercial advantage or private gain. The other options are incorrect because: B) the license doesn't prohibit all monetary transactions, just those primarily for commercial advantage; C) additional permission is not required if the use falls within the license terms; and D) royalty payments are not typically required for non-commercial use under this license, except in specific circumstances related to music performances which don't apply here."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15712/legal-to-create-a-publicly-available-multiple-choice-test-on-a-publicly-availabl", "docs_id": 15712, "title": "Legal to create a publicly-available multiple choice test on a publicly-available resource?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am a web developer, and also have children, and had the idea of creating multiple choice tests on a \"resource\".
