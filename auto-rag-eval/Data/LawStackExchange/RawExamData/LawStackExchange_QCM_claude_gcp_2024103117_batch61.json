The question mentions that this could be \"accepted practice\" if the cycle starts on the 16th. Additionally, month-to-month contracts are not typically prorated on a daily basis.

In Washington state, it is legal to possess and purchase up to 28 grams of MJ. Suppose I purchase a legal amount in Washington, then travel to Florida (leaving my dope in Washington), but somehow Florida learns of my purchase in Washington. Is there case law (or any statute) whereby can't they prosecute me for committing an act that is illegal in Florida? It needn't be drugs.\n\nI know (or ought to know) that they don't \"have jurisdiction\": I am specifically looking for case law that officially establishes that in order for a government to have authority to prosecute an offense, the act had to have been committed within the geographical territory controlled by that government. Is there official law that expressly says this, or is this just part of the common historical understanding of \"jurisdiction\"? This need not be US law only.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the specific example you have given, Florida law could not be applied. A state has jurisdiction over a crime under constitutional due process limits on the scope of a state's criminal jurisdiction if the crime is either committed within the state (regardless of where the harm occurs) or is directed at or impacts the state (the classic example is a gunshot fired from the Ohio side of the state line killing someone located in Indiana, which could be prosecuted in either state, or in both states as it doesn't violate double jeopardy to be prosecuted for the same offense by more than one sovereign). \n\nSometimes these issues are framed not as \"jurisdictional\" per se, but as \"conflict of law\" questions limited by the constitution. The proof that a crime was committed in the territory where it is applicable is called proof of *locus delecti* and depends upon the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it. To determine where a crime is committed depends on what acts constitute the crime, something that leaves considerable room for flexible interpretation and a careful reading of the exact wording of the relevant criminal statute. \n\nThe most important limitation on the territorial jurisdiction of a U.S. state is the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This applies directly in the case of federal criminal prosecutions in the federal courts, and applies in state courts because it is incorporated to apply in state court cases through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States under 20th century case law applying the \"Selective Incorporation doctrine.\"\n\nThe Sixth Amendment mandates that criminal trials be conducted \u201cby an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\u201d \n\nIf a suspect is not present in a state to be criminally prosecuted, then the options available to a state are (1\\) to toll the running of the statute of limitations while the suspect is outside the state to the extent permitted by the relevant state statute and the U.S. Constitution, (2\\) to bring a civil lawsuit against the suspect instead of a criminal prosecution, or (3\\) to seek extradition of the suspect, which must be granted under certain circumstances under the United State Constitution and reads as follows in the pertinent part:\n\n> Article IV, Section 2, Clause 2:\n> \n> \n> A person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime,\n>  who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall on\n>  demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be\n>  delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the\n>  crime.\n\n(Note that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to civil lawsuits. Civil lawsuit trials can be conducted in a state other than the state where the breach of contract or tort giving rise to the lawsuit took place for jurisdictional purposes and not infrequently is brought in another state, although constitutional choice of law rules limit the circumstances under which a particular state's laws can be applied to a particular set of circumstances in a lawsuit.)\n\nThe Sixth Amendment, on its face, prohibits Florida from prosecuting a case in the example given in the question involving a crime that was committed solely in Washington State. \n\nOf course, the exact definition of the crime might determine where it was committed. In traditional \"common law\" \"blue collar\" crimes there is usually no ambiguity over where it is committed except in the most extraordinary circumstances, but in prosecutions of conspiracies and crimes involving economic activity (such as owning or mailing something), the question of where a crime is committed can grow much fuzzier.\n\nFor example, one could imagine a differently defined crime prohibiting providing funds to finance a purchase of marijuana in excess of 20 grams being committed both in Washington State and Florida at the same time (e.g. perhaps a purchase of marijuana in Washington State was financed by a Florida bank by delivering cash to a courier in Florida who is bound for Washington State knowing that the cash would be used to finance a marijuana purchase).\n\nSimilar ideas apply in international circumstances where the Sixth Amendment and Extradition Clause do not apply. But, in those cases, the more flexible and less well defined \"law of nations\" as interpreted by Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court and the President still does impose some territorial boundaries on prosecutions for actions which are not crimes in the country where they are committed under that country's domestic laws. But, those boundaries are not so hard and fast and the idea that a crime is committed in places where it has an impact allow for considerable flexibility in prosecuting crimes committed outside the United States.\n\nIt has also been well settled since the earliest days of the United States that \"The courts of no country execute the penal laws of another.\" *The Antelope*, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 66, 123 (U.S. Supreme Court 1825\\) and that this applies to states applying each other's penal laws as well. So, Florida cannot enforce a violation of the criminal laws of Washington State in its courts either. If you get in a bar fight in Seattle, you can't be prosecute for assault in a court in Orlando, even if both of the parties to the bar fight were Orlando residents and U.S. citizens.\n\nSome notable cases resolving the question of whether *locus delecti* is present in a particular case include the following: \n\nIn *Hyde v. United States*, 225 U.S. 347 (1912\\) although none of the defendants had entered the District of Columbia as part of their conspiracy to defraud the United States, they were convicted because one co\\-conspirator had committed overt acts in Columbia (225 U.S., at 363\\). So conspiracy is a continuing offense committed in all the districts where a co\\-conspirator acts on the agreement. \n\nSimilarly, *In re Palliser*, 136 U.S. 257 (1890\\) the sending of letters from New York to postmasters in Connecticut in an attempt to gain postage on credit, made Connecticut, where the mail he addressed and dispatched was received, an appropriate venue (136 U.S., at 266\u2014268\\).\n\nA typical state statute on the subject from Colorado's Revised Statutes (2016\\) is as follows:\n\n> \u00a7 18\\-1\\-201\\. State jurisdiction\n> \n> \n> (1\\) A person is subject to prosecution in this state for an offense\n>  which he commits, by his own conduct or that of another for which he\n>  is legally accountable, if: (a) The conduct constitutes an offense and\n>  is committed either wholly or partly within the state; or (b) The\n>  conduct outside the state constitutes an attempt, as defined by this\n>  code, to commit an offense within the state; or (c) The conduct\n>  outside the state constitutes a conspiracy to commit an offense within\n>  the state, and an act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs in the\n>  state; or (d) The conduct within the state constitutes an attempt,\n>  solicitation, or conspiracy to commit in another jurisdiction an\n>  offense prohibited under the laws of this state and such other\n>  jurisdiction. (2\\) An offense is committed partly within this state if\n>  conduct occurs in this state which is an element of an offense or if\n>  the result of conduct in this state is such an element. In homicide,\n>  the \"result\" is either the physical contact which causes death or the\n>  death itself; and if the body of a criminal homicide victim is found\n>  within the state, the death is presumed to have occurred within the\n>  state. (3\\) Whether an offender is in or outside of the state is\n>  immaterial to the commission of an offense based on an omission to\n>  perform a duty imposed by the law of this state.\n\nCase law under this statute sometimes describes the issue presented under this statute a question of \"sovereign jurisdiction.\" *See, e.g., People v. Cullen*, 695 P.2d 750 (Colo. App. 1984\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A resident of Florida travels to Washington state and legally purchases 25 grams of marijuana.

Florida cannot prosecute in this scenario because:\n\n1. The purchase and consumption occurred entirely within Washington state, where it was legal.\n2. No element of the offense occurred within Florida's jurisdiction.\n3. The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires criminal trials to be conducted in the state and district where the crime was committed.\n4. States generally cannot prosecute for acts that are legal where they were committed, even if those acts would be illegal in their own state.\n5. The principle of territorial jurisdiction limits a state's ability to prosecute crimes committed entirely outside its borders.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Florida's laws do not apply extraterritorially to legal acts in other states. Answer B is wrong because residency alone doesn't give Florida jurisdiction over acts committed legally in other states.

Prior to 2008, a 14 year old child could choose with which parent to live, unless the judge determined that the chosen parent is unfit.\n\nAs proving that a parent is unfit was not always easy, the Georgia General Assembly in 2008 replaced the unfit parent standard with a Best Interests of the Child Standard. This new standard provides more flexibility to the judge in determining custody.\n\nSome basic facts about how the law in relation to the child's selection of parent:\n\n* A parent that wishes to modify an existing custody arrangement must\nshow that a `material change` in circumstances has occurred that\nwarrants a new decision by the court.\n* If the child is 14 then the child's desire to select the parent may\nbe considered as the \"material change in circumstances\".\n* However the court will only consider the child's choice if at least\ntwo years have passed since the last custody determination.\n\nThese aspects of the law can be seen in Georgia statute 19\\-9\\-3, article 5, which states: \n\n> (5\\) **In all custody cases in which the child has reached the age of**\n> **14 years**, the child shall have the right to select the parent with\n>  whom he or she desires to live. **The child's selection for purposes of**\n> **custody shall be presumptive** unless the parent so selected is\n>  determined not to be in the best interests of the child.

Under common law principles, particularly as applied in many US jurisdictions, how would John likely be treated legally in this scenario?\n\nA) John would not be held criminally liable since he didn't physically steal the painting himself.\nB) John would be charged with a lesser offense than theft, such as contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\nC) John would be held equally criminally liable for theft as if he had stolen the painting himself.\nD) John would only be held liable if it can be proven that Tommy knew the act was illegal.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The scenario described aligns closely with the concept of complicity, particularly the aspect of causing an innocent or irresponsible person to commit an offense. As illustrated in the Ohio complicity statute, this type of action is typically treated as equivalent to committing the offense directly. John's intentional manipulation of an innocent party (Tommy) to commit a crime he himself intended would likely result in John being held criminally liable for theft, just as if he had committed the act himself. The fact that John used a child who lacked the necessary mens rea (guilty mind) does not absolve John of criminal responsibility, but rather demonstrates his culpability in orchestrating the crime."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51333/can-i-quote-an-article-which-license-is-cc-by-nd", "docs_id": 51333, "title": "Can I quote an article which license is CC-BY-ND", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a question about direct quotations (i.e. \"copy\\-and\\-paste\" portions of a work \\- with ellipses \"\\[...]\" if necessary \\-) and paraphrasing the content of a text article which license is CC\\-BY\\-ND.

The intention is to ensure that trade in the EU is not distorted by government incentives, so that factories get built in the most efficient location rather than where a government offers the biggest subsidy. This is the mirror image of the rules which prohibit tariffs; governments cannot protect their own industry from competition either by imposing tariffs on imports or by providing subsidies to exports.\n\nThe Irish government was found to have provided an illegal subsidy to Apple in the form of a tax reduction made especially for Apple. Hence the tax break was invalid and effectively did not exist.

The EU ruled that the Irish government provided illegal state aid to Apple in the form of a special tax reduction. This violates EU rules designed to prevent member states from distorting competition through subsidies. As a result, the tax break was deemed invalid and treated as if it never existed. Apple is therefore required to pay the taxes they would have owed without this special treatment, not as a punishment, but as a correction to bring their tax payments in line with what they should have been under EU law.

In the event my brother passed first, it's obvious I would be the sole heir.

If he had children, I'm sure they'd want it to go to them. However, if he didn't have children, can a clause be added to have it go back to me? She's entitled to 1/2 their accumulated assets during the marriage, but is there any way to deny her anything related to my parents' will?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In some jurisdictions, certain relatives cannot be disinherited without their consent (e.g. in community property states, your wife's right of inheritance is independent of any will). Daughter\\-in\\-law is not one of the statutorily\\-protected relations. So, in will, a parent can distributed their property as they see fit \\-\\- all to sister 1, split evenly between the brothers, split evenly between oldest son and oldest daughter, and so on. They can explicitly include a daughter\\-in\\-law if they want; they can include me if they want. Nobody gets a share if they are not mentioned.\n\nA will can have conditions, e.g. \"all to my wife, but if she dies before me, all split evenly among children A,B,C,D\". The hard part if for the testator to decide on / think about a hierarchy, such as \"Wife first; if wife dead, oldest female child; if oldest female child dead then children of oldest female child...\". Painful statements like \"Person X shall in no circumstance receive any portion of the estate\" indicates testator's intent, and following the testator's wishes (hence \"will\") is the basic principle of inheritance law. \n\nIt's certainly possible to write a will, especially if it is really simple.

Whether this be people flying there for business purposes, flying domestically, or leaving the country by helicopter.\n\nFor the answers, if there is an exception between civilian and military usage of helicopters then that would be interesting and a valid answer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Vatican City State did this between 1929 and 1984, indeed for all aircraft. The Lateran Treaty of 1929, between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy, said ([Article 7, paragraph 3](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html)):\n\n> In conformit\u00e0 alle norme del diritto internazionale, \u00e8 vietato agli aeromobili di qualsiasi specie di trasvolare sul territorio del Vaticano.\n\n> In accordance with the provisions of International Law, it is forbidden for aircraft of any kind whatsoever to fly over the territory of the Vatican.\n\nThe revision of 1984 did not preserve this provision (see [its Article 13(1\\)](http://home.lu.lv/%7Erbalodis/Baznicu%20tiesibas/Akti/Arvalstis_ligumi/Italijas&Sv.Kresla_konkordats.pdf)). The present situation is that Vatican airspace, managed by the Italian national authorities, is subject to flight restrictions preventing low\\-flying aircraft and drones. So you cannot legally buzz St Peter's Basilica in your helicopter, but you could fly at a higher altitude in the normal way. (The restrictions are for anything below 3500 feet, and for comparison St Peter's is about 450 feet tall.)\n\nThere are obvious exceptions for papal or other official travel, and Popes have used their own helicopters to travel in and out of the Vatican since 1976\\. Since 2015, the helipad has also been made available for emergency use by medical helicopters from a nearby children's hospital. That demonstrates the extent to which it is *not* available for routine travel. Therefore, I think that \"flying there for business purposes, flying domestically, or leaving the country by helicopter\" are all forbidden, unless you are the Pope or have his permission.\n\nYou also cannot land or take off in a fixed\\-wing aircraft, but that's largely a matter of geography, not law: there is no runway.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Lateran Treaty of 1929 between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy, which of the following statements was true regarding air travel over Vatican City until 1984?\n\nA) Only military aircraft were allowed to fly over Vatican airspace\nB) All aircraft were prohibited from flying over Vatican territory\nC) Helicopters were allowed, but fixed-wing aircraft were prohibited\nD) Aircraft could fly over Vatican City if they maintained an altitude above 3500 feet\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Lateran Treaty of 1929 explicitly stated that \"it is forbidden for aircraft of any kind whatsoever to fly over the territory of the Vatican.\" This blanket prohibition remained in effect until 1984 when the agreement was revised.

I've been watching them for over 6\\-months, so first\\-and\\-foremost I'm a fan. But after having thought about this situation for a few days, I'm not entirely sure if the lawsuit is unfair. In H3H3 videos, they don't just show small clips or images from videos that they make fun of; they show almost the entire work of the targeted author's video but in the form of small clips. \n\nThe format is essentially: \n\n* Show a clip/segment of the other person's video\n* Pause said clip\n* Change scene from the reviewed video to H3H3 making commnetary on that particular clip/segment\n* Pick up where you left off on the video and show the next 5\\-10 seconds\n* Rinse and repeat\n\nFrom watching their videos, I'd estimate that H3H3 shows at least half of the other author's video more than 95% of the time.

Does it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Only a court can decide if use is fair.** As Dale stated, we will know whether it was or was not legally fair when a court decides, and it ceased to be appealed. Unfortunately, there is no formula. Remember that fair use is an exception to rules that make copyright infringement illegal, so it occupies a narrow space practically by definition.\n\nFortunately this was already decided\n------------------------------------\n\n*(yes, I recognize that this is an old question)*\n\nJudge Katherine B. Forrest [decided in favor of your favorite YouTuber](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4356997/116/hosseinzadeh-v-klein/):\n\n> The Court has held that the Klein video constitutes fair use, and further that the Klein video does not infringe plaintiff\u2019s copyrights.\n\nand further that:\n\n> But even if this Court held the Klein video is not fair use, the Court would still dismiss Claim II because defendants clearly had a subjective \u201cgood faith belief\u201d that their video did not infringe plaintiff\u2019s copyrights. Cf. Lenz, 815 F.3d at 1153\\.\n> It is undisputed that defendants understand the concept of fair use and have an\n> established practice for ensuring their videos make fair use of copyrighted material.\n\nBut that answer isn't entirely satisfying, is it? Let's get specific.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFair use seems to be something that ***should*** be clear to both parties: the copyright holders and the user of copyrighted content. While it is true that the percentage of original content may be of concern, there is no specific percentage nominated in Title 17 Chapter 1 Section 107 of the US Code.\n\n> In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include\u2014\n> (1\\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n> (2\\) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n> (3\\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n> (4\\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n> The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.\n\nIt takes vigilance on the part of both parties to cohabit this narrow law. Fortunately, YouTube has [recently taken measures](https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2016/04/improving-content-id-for-creators.html) to ensure that use that ***should*** (presumably in their view) be judged as fair will remain live on their site while a dispute process is pursued. This procedure resolves cases outside of formal legal battles, which can be costly for both parties. However, YouTube has pledged to [pay legal fees](https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2015/11/a-step-toward-protecting-fair-use-on.html) of content providers that are sued for copyright infringement, in special circumstances (esp. when the use was fair, and when a claimant is abusing, again presumably as determined by some legal counsel at YouTube). They discuss similar matters in their [FAQ page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797449?hl=en&ref_topic=2778546).\n\n> Why did YouTube let an abusive claimant remove my video?\n> YouTube takes action to address cases of abuse and misuse in our copyright takedown processes. While we cannot comment on specific cases or our processes, we do look into abuse of our copyright tools and processes, and have a zero\\-tolerance policy for claimants we've deemed abusive. Misuse of the copyright process (for both takedowns and counter notifications) can result in termination of an account.\n\nAnd remember that courts love precedent\n---------------------------------------\n\n**Future cases will likely leverage the decisions made in the case you mention**. And while the following does not have any real legal value, you may find comfort in knowing: there are many YouTubers out there that heavily leverage others' content, and their videos are still up. Again this is not strictly speaking a precedent, but you can safely assume that in cases where a high\\-profile YouTuber (say CinemaSins, for instance) uses content from many content owners, and uses a great deal of it, they will likely have come up against claims of unfair use, and have emerged with an intact channel.

For some injury suffered by another HOA member in the form of reduced property values?\n\nOne bright line rule is that anyone against whom relief is sought, directly or indirectly, is generally a necessary party, so the nature of the claim brought and the relief sought are critical to evaluating who is a necessary party.\n\nIf the relief sought is to have a deck removed, the owner of the property served by that deck almost certainly has to be made a party.\n\nEven this rule has exceptions, however, in cases where a named defendant fairly represents the interests of the unnamed defendants in some cases.\n\nFor example, the beneficiaries of a trust owning a unit don't have to be named as parties if the trust is named as a party.\n\nRelief in the form of a money judgment against a defendant almost always requires that defendant to be joined as a party. Relief \"in rem\" limited to recovery involving a particular identified piece of property sometimes can proceed with fewer parties if notice by publication is given to potentially interested parties.\n\n**Who owns the common areas?**\n\nIn some HOAs, all members have a present, undivided tenants\\-in\\-common co\\-ownership interest in the common areas, while in others, the common areas are owned by the HOA and the members of the HOA don't have a property interest in the common areas.\n\nThis arcane and technical issue could be outcome determinative on a necessary parties question. If the common areas are owned as tenants\\-in\\-common, all members of the HOA may be necessary parties.\n\n**Who has permission to enforce covenant violations and is this a covenant violation?**\n\nWho has standing to complain about the failure of a homeowner to comply with the covenants in the governing documents?\n\nSome HOA governing documents limit this authority to the HOA only, others allow either the HOA or any HOA member to enforce covenant violations.\n\nIn other words, some HOA governing documents allow Bob to sue Sally directly, without even naming the HOA as a party, for some kinds of covenant violations. Others authorize only the HOA to sue Sally.\n\nBut if the problem is that the HOA approved something that it shouldn't have approved, it isn't necessary a covenant violation, even though it seems to be one on its face.\n\n**Statute of limitations issues**\n\nRelated to who can sue, is the issue of statute of limitations.\n\nIn Colorado, where I practice law, and in many other states, there is a short statute of limitations (one year) within which you can sue to assert that a completed structure is built in violation of HOA covenants, and sometimes what triggers the statute of limitations will be different for a claim brought be the association (which may run from the date of the violation or from when it had notice) and for a claim brought by a homeowner (which can run from the date that an HOA member has notice of the violation).\n\n**Have HOA members or the HOA done something actionably wrong?**\n\nA common scheme in HOA governing documents is that someone must seek permission from an architectural control committee to make some kind of improvement, and if the architectural control committee fails to act within a certain amount of time, the proposal is deemed approved, even if it clearly violates some HOA policy or covenant.\n\nIn those cases, there is no valid claim of anyone against the offending deck building HOA member, and there isn't necessarily a claim against the HOA for negligently failing to enforce its covenants either.\n\n**The nature of the claim governs whether it runs with the land.**\n\nSometimes the nature of the claim is that a particular owner at a particular time did something wrong for which they are responsible (e.g. allowed a dog off a leash that bit someone). Usually claims like that name only the owner who did something wrong.\n\nSometimes something related to whether the property can continue to be in the state it is will run with the land and apply to future owners, so will claims that are liens against the property (e.g. for unpaid assessments) that were perfected by the person imposing them prior to the sale and not cleared up at closing.\n\nAnd, nothing prevents a single complaint filed in court from asserting more than one kind of claim.\n\nThe distinction is harder than it seems because the issue of whether an offense is particular to the person who committed it, or runs with the land, is often non\\-obvious and not well developed in case law or statutes.\n\n**Bottom line: It's complicated.**\n\nBecause multiple aspects of the HOA governing documents and the precise nature of the relief sought in the case are so essential to determining who is or is not a necessary party to a lawsuit involving an alleged failure by the HOA to comply with its own policies, determining who is a necessary party isn't easy.\n\nFar more facts are necessary to answer the question correctly.\n\n### Bonus question\n\n> If Harry illegally built a deck and then sold his condo unit to Sally,\n> does Sally own the deck and have a responsibility to maintain the deck\n> or is it the Association's responsibility?\n\nThis is highly dependent upon the definitions used and responsibilities created in the HOA governing documents. A lot will depend upon whether the governing documents treat this as a part of a unit, a limited common element, or a common element, but there is more to it than that. Even if it was built in violation of HOA policies, it may be a fait accompli at some point that is treated as valid.\n\nThere is not one consistent way to handle this issue that is predominant in HOA governing documents.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Florida HOA, several owners have built wooden decks on common areas without proper approval.

Plaintiff was told to get a mumps vaccination (which involves chicken embryo) as a condition of employment, refused, and the offer of employment was refused. [The law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=12940.&lawCode=GOV), \u00a712940a makes it unlawful \"because of the religious creed of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person...\".

Seeger, 380 U.S. 163 and Welsh v. US, 398 U.S. 333\\. And the court points out that government agencies are granted wide latitude in interpreting enabling legislation (under which the government might allow or disallow an action).\n\nIt us noted that as of 2002, there were no California cases deciding what constitutes a religious creed w.r.t. FEHA and that regulation. The court then recited various statements from other California cases regarding the characterization of a religion \u2013 the main relevant point is that a religion does not have to be theistic to be a \"religion\". The court also reviews federal employment discrimination laws, and again considers the difference between traditional and non\\-traditional religions. There are many snippets in the review of the law section saying things such as that\n\n> the court should find beliefs to be a religion if they \u2018occupy the\n> same place in the life of the \\[individual] as an orthodox belief in\n> God holds in the life of one clearly qualified.\u2019\n\nWe can now move to the question in \u00a76, *Is Veganism a Religious Creed For Purposes of the FEHA*.

Until someone actually alleges that they have a religious belief that prohibits vaccination, we can't analyze those arguments. The gist of the \"veganism is not a religion\" is it is too narrow a belief to constitute a religious belief. The court found that did not find that it is a \"belief system (which) addresses fundamental or ultimate questions\", and that it does not a address fundamental questions such as \"the meaning of human existence; \u2009the purpose of life; \u2009theories of humankind's nature or its place in the universe; \u2009matters of human life and death; \u2009or the exercise of faith\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the court's ruling in Friedman v.

Nor on a greater offense implied by the same events. Not even if additional evidence comes to light.\n\nHowever, if an act (or set of acts) is a crime under both state law and Federal law, for example theft by deception (state crime) and wire fraud (federal crime) one jurisdiction may try the person even after ther has been an acquittal in the other.\n\nI think the same rule applies if an act is a crime within the jurisdiction of two different states, that both can trey the accused.\n\nIn many cases prosecutors will choose not to bring the second trial, but they can if they see fit.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A prosecutor charges a defendant with first-degree murder for allegedly killing his neighbor.

Voluntary manslaughter is typically considered a lesser included offense of murder.

The clause is unclear about whether \"choose to leave\" refers to the decision date or the actual departure date. Given this ambiguity and the principle of interpreting unclear terms against the drafter, a court would likely rule in favor of the employee.

I am trying to understand how this is even possible. Is there a French law that allows this to be done?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is quite common across jurisdictions\n-----------------------------------------\n\nFor example, people who mine uranium are often made responsible for disposing of the waste product at the end of life. More generally, most mine licences require remediation of the land at the end of the mine\u2019s life.\n\nAnother common one is to make tyre manufacturer\u2019s responsible for their disposal.\n\nGovernments can pass laws that make a business responsible for dealing with the use and disposal of their products.\n\nIn practice, these schemes usually require the company to pay the remediation cost to the government or into a trust at the time the product is made or sold.

Option B is incorrect as there's no mention of a consumer return program.

In the US, the rules for determining parentage are generally established by the [Uniform Parentage Act](https://www.uniformlaws.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=ccec4a4f-cf66-e428-04ba-2d5bd1b97c7b&forceDialog=1), instantiated for instance in Washington state [RCW Chapter 26\\.26A](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.26A&full=true). [RCW 26\\.26A.100](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.26A&full=true#26.26A.100) spells out the full set of rules:\n\nA parent\\-child relationship is established between an individual and a child if:\n\n> (1\\) The individual gives birth to the child, except as otherwise\n> provided in RCW 26\\.26A.700 through 26\\.26A.785;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) There is a presumption under RCW 26\\.26A.115 of the individual's\n> parentage of the child, unless the presumption is overcome in a\n> judicial proceeding or a valid denial of parentage is made under RCW\n> 26\\.26A.200 through 26\\.26A.265;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) The individual is adjudicated a parent of the child under RCW\n> 26\\.26A.400 through 26\\.26A.515;\n> \n> \n> (4\\) The individual adopts the child;\n> \n> \n> (5\\) The individual acknowledges parentage of the child under RCW\n> 26\\.26A.200 through 26\\.26A.265, unless the acknowledgment is rescinded under RCW 26\\.26A.235 or successfully challenged under RCW 26\\.26A.200\n> through 26\\.26A.265 or 26\\.26A.400 through 26\\.26A.515;\n> \n> \n> (6\\) The individual's parentage of the child is established under RCW\n> 26\\.26A.600 through 26\\.26A.635; or\n> \n> \n> (7\\) The individual's parentage of the child is established under RCW\n> 26\\.26A.705 through 26\\.26A.730\\.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7300\\-355 govern the use of genetic tests in determining parentage, according to which genetic test results can be evidence of parentage, but \u00a7\u00a7600 ff specifically address assisted reproduction and surrogacy agreements \u2013 RCW 26\\.26A.610 for example specifically assigns \"parentage\" to a person who consents to assisted reproduction by a woman with the intent to be a parent of a child, and under \u00a7605, a donor is not a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a hypothetical case, genetic material was stolen from Person X without their knowledge or consent.

In cases of assisted reproduction, consent and intent to be a parent are crucial factors. RCW 26.26A.610 assigns parentage to a person who consents to assisted reproduction with the intent to be a parent. Additionally, RCW 26.26A.605 states that a donor is not a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction.

If you search on YouTube \"the finest 15 biggest trucks in the world\" and if you go to 2:27 \\- 2:29 of the video, they\u2019re blurring the watermark on the video clip and they do this for every video, so is this legal? Because news channels do that as well where they blur watermarks on video clips.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [17 USC 1202(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1202) states:\n\n> *Removal or **Alteration** of Copyright Management Information*.\u2014No person\n> shall, without the authority of the copyright owner or the law\u2014 (1\\)\n> intentionally remove or **alter** any copyright management information,\n> (2\\) distribute or import for distribution copyright management\n> information knowing that the copyright management information has been\n> removed or **altered** without authority of the copyright owner or the\n> law, or (3\\) distribute, import for distribution, or publicly perform\n> works, copies of works, or phonorecords, knowing that copyright\n> management information has been removed or **altered** without authority\n> of the copyright owner or the law, knowing, or, with respect to civil\n> remedies under section 1203, having reasonable grounds to know, that\n> it will induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement of any\n> right under this title.\n\nIn the suggested sample, it is impossible to judge whether the blurred SE corner is \u201ccopyright management information\u201d, defined in para (c), because it has been, well, blurred. For example, if the blurred portion says \"Call now, operators waiting\" or \"Don't do this at home!\", that is not copyright management information. Assuming that this is the manufacturer's name (the video being a work for hire so Terex holds the copyright), then blurring that label without permission would be a violation of this section of copyright law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A YouTube content creator regularly uses clips from other sources in their \"Top 10\" style videos, applying voiceovers and minimal footage under fair use.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this practice?\n\nA) Blurring watermarks is always legal as long as the overall use of the clip falls under fair use.\n\nB) Blurring watermarks is illegal in all circumstances, as it violates Section 1202 of the U.S. Copyright Act.\n\nC) Blurring watermarks may be legal if the watermark does not contain copyright management information as defined by the U.S. Copyright Act.\n\nD) Blurring watermarks is legal only if explicit permission is obtained from the original copyright holder.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of blurring watermarks depends on whether the watermark contains copyright management information as defined in 17 USC 1202. If the watermark contains such information (e.g., copyright owner's name), blurring it without permission would violate the law. However, if the watermark does not contain copyright management information (e.g., it's just a logo or slogan), blurring it may not necessarily violate this specific provision of copyright law. It's important to note that while this might not violate Section 1202, it could still potentially infringe on other aspects of copyright law or fair use principles.

From what I've learnt, they only get the evidence by investigating your computer. Is that right?\n\nOr do they really need to investigate the hacker's computer? And if they do have to investigate the hacker's computer what exactly would they need to \"Find\" to convict him?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Anyone can be arrested, as long as the police (and in some cases, anyone) have probable cause to do so. This generally includes two points:\n\n* You are in the process of committing a criminal act\n* The police have probable cause, generally through evidence, that you are in the process of, about to, or have committed a criminal act. This usually requires obtaining a warrant for the arrest.\n\nHowever, it's important not to conflate searches with arrest. Arrests are when you are being taken into custody for the reasons mentioned above. Searches are when your personal belongings (i.e. property), are searched to collect evidence.\n\nIt is not up to police to *convict* someone. This is the job of the judicial system. There's a bit of terminology here: *convictions* basically mean being found guilty of an offence. Police don't have the ability to convict someone of an offence. They do have the ability to arrest, and *charge* with an offence. To charge someone with a crime basically means to accuse them of having done something.\n\n---\n\nNow let's get to the actual crime. Since you haven't mentioned a specific jurisdiction, I'm going to use Canadian cases and law, but in general, it should apply worldwide.\n\nIf the police have reason to believe that you are engaging in unlawful hacking\\-related behaviour, then they have the authority to arrest you. They simply need to have a reasonable belief that you are engaged in the crime. Something such as connecting you with an IP address and connecting that you were online at the time is enough.\n\nIf the police need to find out more information (which they generally do, to investigate further into the matter) \\- they can obtain a search warrant afterwards. With this, they can legally search into your computer, and investigate. Any evidence that they collect can be used in court.\n\nI've recently done some research into cyber crimes. One rather infamous case involved the attack on multiple large scale websites, including Dell, Yahoo, and Amazon, in 2000\\.

According to the information provided, law enforcement can make an arrest based on probable cause, which can include evidence like connecting a suspect's IP address to the time of the attacks. They do not need to have enough evidence to convict before making an arrest, nor do they need to search the computer first.

This license often directly forbids further sale of such keys. So according to manufacturer they can be \"pirated\".\n\nSecondly, there is a law applicable to your jurisdiction.

Your local jurisdiction may not recognize this transaction at all without a proper receipt or invoice.\n\nThis only skims the surface, because later you might want to exercise rights from the license (eg right to tech support or updates), however the license might be already violated.

As explained in the documentation, attorneys often use standardized engagement letters with preset paragraph numbering. The \"Reserved\" paragraph is likely a result of removing a standard clause that doesn't apply to this particular client's situation, while maintaining the overall structure and numbering of the document. This practice allows for customization of the agreement without altering the standard format.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because attorneys cannot unilaterally add terms after an agreement is signed.

The office agreed to cover the cost of the repairs in order to facilitate her coming to work as well.\n\nThe offer was made in May, and with the pandemic delays the repair work was finished in June and I was able to order a duplicate title in July. I was working remotely so I brought the title in and signed it, however we did not agree on date, etc. At that point and she was to leave the title at the office until things had been ironed out.\n\nShe had multiple reasons why she was unable to take possession of the vehicle and kept putting it off. I continued to pay for insurance on the vehicle as it physically remained in my possession. She finally told me that she got insurance on the vehicle at the end of August, although at this point her behavior was getting more erratic and her attendance at work was not consistent or reliable for months. I did not believe her and to be safe continued to pay for insurance on the car.\n\nI asked her multiple times when she would take the vehicle and always was told later dates. This past week, she once again called out at the last minute for 3 days straight and then told our office that she would no longer be able to work during the week and wanted to only work on weekends (we are a law office so this was not what she was hired for). After much consideration, we decided we still wanted to help her and agreed that we would come in on the weekends and allow her to work so that she would at least be able to make some money.\n\nHowever, at this point I informed her that the vehicle was off the table as she had yet to use it to come to work which was the condition of the gift and now she would not be coming to work on the weekdays as previously agreed. She was unhappy about this and told me the car was hers as she had removed the title from the office already. In addition, she never showed up for her shifts the following Saturday and Sunday and also never responded to multiple texts confirming her new schedule and asking her where she was when she was a no show.\n\nAt this point we accepted her lack of communication and absences as a resignation and sent her a letter outlining all the facts regarding her employment with us and stating that she was no longer with the company due to her actions.

The mere fact that one consideration entails a permanent effect (i.e., she would not have to return the vehicle) does not change the fact that the parties' ascertainable intent was an *exchange* of considerations.\n\nNow termination of her employment frustrates the purpose of *that* contract. Moreover, since (1\\) she kept postponing the picking up of the vehicle till you informed her of the withdrawal of your offer, and (2\\) her attendance did not improve significantly, the contract was voidable *by you* to the extent that her prior acts (i.e., incurring Uber expenses) misled and induced you to make that offer.\n\nEven if she were in possession of the vehicle already, her erraticism and unreliability suggests that she breached the *covenant of good faith and fair dealing* that is inherent to all contracts.

The arrangement between the employer and employee regarding the vehicle is best characterized as a contract with mutual considerations rather than a simple gift. The employer offered the vehicle in exchange for the employee's commitment to use it for work purposes, and the company even agreed to cover repair costs. This creates a contractual relationship with obligations on both sides.\n\nThe contract can be voided due to frustration of purpose (the employee no longer working regular hours) or breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing (the employee's erratic behavior and unreliability).

Are these two notions completely synonymous?\n\nNo. they aren't even that similar in meaning.\n\n> If not then what\u2019s the difference between them?\n\n**Frivolous** means not having a basis in the law or a sincere and reasonable effort to extend the law. Sometimes the term frivolous is also used in a broader sense to include not having a factual basis, even though it would be a valid lawsuit if the facts alleged were true. But a narrower definition calls something without a factual basis **groundless** and calls something without a legal basis **frivolous**.\n\nFor example, a lawsuit for breach of contract in circumstances where you are suing over a contract you wanted to enter into with someone even though you acknowledge that they didn't agree to that contract would be frivolous. You can only sue for breaches of contracts that are actually entered into and it is frivolous to bring a lawsuit when you don't argue that a contract was formed.\n\nA lawsuit alleging that a contract was entered into with someone and breached when, in fact, the other party to the alleged contract never interacted with the person bringing the lawsuit would be groundless, and within a broader sense of the term, frivolous as well.\n\n**De minimis** means that the magnitude of the harm is so small that the courts won't entertain a lawsuit to address the wrong even though the harm would otherwise be something that someone could bring a lawsuit over.\n\nFor example, if you sued someone for negligence for slightly bumping into when you were walking down a crowded sidewalk, even though you suffered no physical injury, and you weren't even made to fall or drop something as a result, that might be a lawsuit that is dismissed because the harm was *de minimis*.\n\nWhether a claim can be dismissed for alleging only *de minimis* harm varies by the nature of the cause of action. Some legal theories will award nominal damages (e.g. $1\\), if you prevail on the other elements of the claim but show only nothing more than *de minimis* harm.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, proof of damages are not necessary to prevail on a claim for breach of contract or negligence *per se*, and nominal damages will be awarded even if you fail to show damages.\n\nOther legal theories make a showing of more than *de minimis* harm one of the elements that must be proved as part of the cause of action for there to be any legal liability at all.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, a showing of more than *de minimis* damages is necessary in a negligence claim.\n\nThis is a distinction which matters a lot in cases where an award of costs and/or attorney fees depends upon which party prevails on particular causes of action.\n\nIn the federal courts, there is an additional subject\\-matter jurisdictional threshold of \"standing\", as a matter of constitutional law, which requires a showing that the person bringing a claim suffered \"actual injury\" which arguably involved more than a *de minimis* harm. But federal courts have recognized that at least for some kinds of lawsuits, standing is present even when the claim is only for nominal damages.\n\nA lawsuit seeking a remedy for a *de minimis* harm would rarely be considered to be frivolous.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A law student files a lawsuit against a classmate for negligence, claiming that the classmate's loud sneeze during an exam caused the student to lose concentration and score 1 point lower on a 100-point test. The professor confirms that the sneeze occurred but cannot verify its impact on the student's performance. How would a court likely respond to this case?\n\nA) Dismiss the case as frivolous, as there is no legal basis for such a claim\nB) Dismiss the case as de minimis, as the harm alleged is too trivial for legal action\nC) Allow the case to proceed, awarding nominal damages of $1 if the plaintiff prevails\nD) Dismiss the case for lack of standing, as there is no proof of actual injury\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This case would likely be dismissed as de minimis.

This goes beyond mere commentary or parody and enters the realm of commercial use of another company's intellectual property. The fact that they are selling the same product (coffee) as Starbucks, using Starbucks' trademarked logo and name, would likely lead to a successful trademark infringement case for Starbucks.
