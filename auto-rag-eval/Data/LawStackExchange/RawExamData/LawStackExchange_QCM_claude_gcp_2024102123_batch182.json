We are paid for the time the same as if we had been working. The self\\-help classes are by a \"Foot Zone\" therapist, and so far have involved both pseudo\\-science and religious undertones and terminology specific to the LDS (\"Mormon\") faith. The subject matter falls far, far outside the scope of work at our small software company. (Here's an article about the speaker, [Julie Cheney](http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/south/elk-ridge/foot-zone-therapy-a-natural-way-to-heal-users-say/article_df09d5f3-86ef-573e-b04e-cdad3da0a0b6.html))\n\nBoth the CEO and our one HR employee (small company, about 40 employees) are fully in support of these classes. These two people backing these classes means that even if it's not technically mandatory, there's certainly pressure for employees to attend or to at least not complain openly about it.\n\nEveryone in attendance was under the impression that it was mandatory, though at the end there was an unclear comment by the CEO indicating that it *might not* be truly mandatory.\n\nI plan to have a 1\\-on\\-1 talk with my manager to bring up the problems I have with this series of courses. I expect he will then bring it up with upper management and/or HR. I have plenty of good points and I already know that this manager disliked the class fairly strongly.\n\nIn the US, and in Utah, are there any laws prohibiting or proscribing this sort of thing by an employer? Does it matter if they are mandatory, as opposed to strongly encouraged but technically not mandatory?\n\nUPDATE:\nAs of Friday, Jan 8th, it's officially mandatory. Good grief.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: (For a definitive answer, consult an employment attorney).\n\nAccording to the federal [Equal Opportunity Employment Commission](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/religion.cfm), in general,\n\n> An employee cannot be forced to participate (or not participate) in a religious activity as a condition of employment.\n\nThis requirement comes from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\\.\n\nAnswer 14 on [this page](http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/qanda_religion.html) elaborates:\n\n> Some private employers choose to express their own religious beliefs or practices in the workplace, and they are entitled to do so. However, if an employer holds religious services or programs or includes prayer in business meetings, Title VII requires that the employer accommodate an employee who asks to be excused for religious reasons, absent a showing of undue hardship.\n> \n> \n> Similarly, an employer is required to excuse an employee from compulsory personal or professional development training that conflicts with the employee\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs or practices, unless doing so would pose an undue hardship. It would be an undue hardship to excuse an employee from training, for example, where the training provides information on how to perform the job, or how to comply with equal employment opportunity obligations, or on other workplace policies, procedures, or legal requirements.\n\nSo the questions would be:\n\n* Is the activity in question a \"religious service or program\"? This might be ambiguous, and you might have to consult an employment attorney for a more informed opinion.\n* Does it \"conflict with your sincerely held religious beliefs or practices\"?\n* Would it be an \"undue hardship\" for the employer to excuse you?\n\nNote that this law might not apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees. It also doesn't apply if you work for an employer such as a church, or a religiously affiliated hospital or educational institution, or the like."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee at a small software company in Utah is required to attend weekly classes that involve pseudo-scientific and religious content.

However, the situation is nuanced. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1) The classes need to be determined as \"religious\" in nature, which may be ambiguous given the pseudo-scientific content.\n2) The employee must demonstrate that the content conflicts with their sincerely held religious beliefs.\n3) The employer must be unable to show that excusing the employee would cause undue hardship.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because paying for attendance doesn't make it automatically legal. Answer B is incorrect because while Title VII typically applies to employers with 15 or more employees, state laws may have different thresholds.

Did Blizzard have to get licenses from the IP owners to include these references in their games ? This could be a possibility since there is really a *lot* of such references in WOW.\n\nIt could be also covered by 'fair use' but very unlikely.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking pop\\-culture references, like literary references, are neither trademark infringement nor copyright infringement.\n\nTrademarks\n----------\n\nOften a referenced item is in fact not a trademark. Most character names, for example, are not protectable as trademarks, because they are not used to identify the product or service, nor to advertise the product or service for sale. Similarly many pop\\-culture references which are associated with various groups, events, or products are not being used to identify or promote those things, and so are not protectable as trademarks.\n\nEven when a reference is (or includes) a trademarked phrase, it is unlikely to be trademark infringement. As long as the user of the trademarked term or phrase is not using it so as to identify the product or service where it is used, is not using it to advertise or promote that product or service, is not using it in such a way as to cause confusion by reasonable people on what the source of the product or service is, and is not using it so as to falsely state or imply that the product ore service is endorsed, sponsore, or approved by the owner of the trademark, then the use is not in fringement.\n\nOne may use a trademark to identify a related product or service, to indicate compatibility, or to make comparative claims, and that is ***nominative use*** (using the mark as the name of the thing marked). Nominative use is specifically not infringement.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nNames, taglines, titles, mottos, and other short phrases are not protected by copyright at all. See the US Copyright office Circular 33 \\-\\- Works Not Protected by Copyright, where it is stated:\n\n> Words and short phrases, such as names, titles, and slogans, are uncopyrightable because they contain\n> an insufficient amount of authorship. The Office will not register individual words or brief combinations of words, even if the word or short phrase is novel, , distinctive, or lends itself to a play on words.\n\nThis circulart includes as exMPLES:\n\n> * The name of a character\n> * Catchwords or catchphrases\n> * Mottos, slogans, or other short expression\n\nAs I wrote in [https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/60965/what\\-are\\-the\\-fair\\-use\\-rules\\-in\\-the\\-usa\\-for\\-short\\-quotes\\-from\\-books\\-or\\-song\\-lyric](https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/60965/what-are-the-fair-use-rules-in-the-usa-for-short-quotes-from-books-or-song-lyric)\n\n> Literary references, including short quotes, to other works of fiction are commonly allowed as fair use. They are usually appropriately attributed.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. Such references normally do not serve as a replacement for the original. They normally do not harm the market, actual or potential for the original. And they are often ***transformative***, that is, they re\\-user has a different purpose and achieves a different effect from the original. All of these factors are important in fair\\-use decisions, and all lean toward fair use for literary or pop\\-culture references. In fact, there are few cases to cite on such references, because it is so widely accepted that they would be fair uses that no on ever sues over them."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A video game developer includes numerous pop culture references in their game, including character names, catchphrases, and brief quotes from famous movies.

Option C is correct because:\n\n1. Most pop culture references are likely to fall under fair use, as they are often transformative, don't replace the original work, and don't harm the market for the original.\n2. Names, catchphrases, and short quotes are generally not protected by copyright due to insufficient authorship.\n3. While many references may not involve trademarks, the developer should be cautious about using trademarked phrases in ways that could imply endorsement or cause confusion about the source of the product.\n\nOption A is incorrect because licenses are generally not required for pop culture references.

This approach prioritizes safety while minimizing unnecessary harm.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it promotes excessive force, which can lead to unnecessary injuries or fatalities. Option B is flawed because the severity of force should be based on the suspect's current behavior, not the crime they're accused of committing. Option D is unrealistic and potentially dangerous in situations where physical intervention is necessary to protect public safety.\n\nThe Toronto van attack arrest shows that even in cases of severe crimes, officers can effectively restrain suspects without resorting to potentially lethal force.

Some businesses cannot be taken up freely but require permission first. In any case, you'll have to register with your Finanzamt, and will be required to file taxes in the future. You would likely do business as a sole proprietor (*Einzelunternehmer*). If this is just part\\-time work, you can likely opt into the *Kleinunternehmer\\-Regelung* which means you don't have to handle VAT/USt. While this is convenient for B2C services, you do need a VAT ID for B2B services when your client is in another EU country.

Some works might be more transformative than others for a variety of reasons like color, size, the style of the original work, etc.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the inquiry in a fair use defense is heavily dependent upon the purpose of the new work and the way that it is used, the nature of the work itself is only a small part of the inquiry. \n\nAn ASCII transformation in the context of an editorial cartoon might very well pass muster, while a similar ASCII transformation hung in an art gallery for sale in isolation with no real \"message\" might not.\n\nASCII transformations by students in a graphic design program in an art college might pass muster while a professional artist distributing them in mass produced fashion through a vendor selling them in Times Square to tourists might not.\n\nUltimately, while the law rarely comes out and says so in so many words, copyright infringement is about commercially appropriating the economic value associated with the original work for primarily commercial reasons, and the context informs the extent to whether that is happening or not. If it is not happening, a fair use defense is stronger, if it is happening, a fair use defense is weaker.\n\nThe law, in general especially in common law jurisdictions like the U.S. and England, is incredibly context and fact specific, and copyright law questions of derivative work and fair use are circumstances where this is particularly true."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An artist creates ASCII art versions of famous photographs and sells them as NFTs.

(so that it could be Googled)\n* What items would be on the list?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Many attorneys would have an \"intake form\" that they would like you to complete in advance, and every lawyer will want your name and contact information at a first meeting. But, other attorneys would prefer to meet with you first, without getting details about the work to be done, as many patent applicants are very reluctant to put information in writing that is shared with others and many patent applicants don't know what is relevant. \n\nThere is no special terminology for the things that you should prepare for prior to meeting with an attorney. And, anyone who completed a provisional patent application is not so half\\-baked in their idea that it is premature to meet with a patent lawyer. Having done a provisional patent application is more than enough due diligence and preparation for such a meeting. \n\nThe marginal cases where preparation by clients is often lacking are those cases where the concept of the invention isn't fully fleshed out yet and the inventor is trying to work with a patent lawyer to figure out what part of \"idea space\" isn't already protected by patents.\n\nThere are basically three kinds of information that are relevant:\n\n1. When was the invention invented, made public, or shared with anyone? Is there anyone else who could be considered a co\\-inventor? For example, if you have an employment agreement discussing intellectual property, you should bring it.\n2. You would need your full provisional patent application, which will explain most of the necessary information but may need to be clarified for a final application. If visual aids are helpful to explaining your invention or you have prototypes small enough to bring with you, you should bring them, even if they are beyond the scope of the provisional patent application's contents.\n3. You ideally should do some due diligence regarding \"prior art\" to provide some assurance that the idea you propose hasn't already been patented or discovered, but not every patent applicant has the ability to do such a prior art search. At a minimum, you should be able to say in good faith that you've never seen a similar invention and explain why you think personally that your invention is novel. Generally, you should not order a professional patent search before you have discussed it with your patent attorney. But, if you are able to do so and have reviewed existing patents, reviewed literature you are able to access, and have done some Google searches for similar ideas, that would be more than reasonable preparation. But, don't delay meeting with a patent lawyer because you haven't done those things. A patent lawyer needs lead time to prepare the application by the deadline for doing so (ideally, several months, and at a minimum, several weeks to a couple of months).\n\nIn addition, you should be prepared to discuss why your invention is not obvious to someone skilled in the relevant field and what utility your patent has to a user of the invention. Similarly, you should be ready to discuss the larger context of the field in which you have an invention, such as how others usually deal with the issue that your invention addresses in the status quo and what other notable new inventions there are in that field. \"Buzz words\" related to your kind of invention are also very helpful for doing searches of prior art.\n\nFinally, you should be prepared to demonstrate that you have the capacity to pay for the patent lawyer's work. Patent lawyers almost never do pro bono (i.e. charitable) patent work for individual inventors (sometimes they might, for example, for a university clinic aimed at inventing things for use in the Third World), and are loathe to do work on a contingent or on credit basis, although sometimes they would be willing to work on credit if you could provide security for the debt beyond the patent itself (e.g. putting the equity in your home up as collateral).\n\nA patent lawyer would almost always charge more than $10,000 to do the work beyond an initial consultation (which wouldn't be free but might cost $100\\-$1000\\), and often a patent could cost $100,000 for each patent for legal work, if it was at all complex. \n\nPatent lawyer have among the highest hourly rates of all kinds of attorneys. So, the more clearly thought out you are, the better organized your paperwork is, and the more efficiently you can communicate your invention, the less you will pay for meeting with the patent lawyer while \"the meter is running.\"\n\nEven in the unlikely case that the patent lawyer will do the work on credit, the patent lawyer will at a minimum insist that you provide the filing fees up front. If you are truly broke, you need a business partner to finance the patenting process for you. You can look at the relevant fee schedules at the patent and trademark office website. The patent lawyer would also expect any out of pocket costs for things like a professional prior art search, having quality drawings prepared, courier fees, and mailing costs to be paid in advance, even if doing some of the legal work on credit. The prior art search is the most expensive item and it would usually cost in the low single digit thousands of dollars."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An inventor has filed a provisional patent application and is preparing to meet with an IP attorney for the first time to discuss a utility patent application.

In the same way the EU cannot impose a treaty on the UK about movement of people or the North Ireland borders, the UK cannot impose a treaty on the EU allowing it trade without tariffs.\n\nIf the UK does not want the deal, the path is straightforward: the Parliament1 rejects the treaty proposal.

One is that it violates some specific (statutory) law, the other is that it violates some common\\-law principle especially pertaining to contracts. We can quickly dispose of the possibility that you have violated a statutory law: there is nowhere in the US where you are compelled by law to do anything about foreign language classes (take, avoid, pass, whatever). \n\nYour university has the right to establish and enforce whatever requirements it deems proper for awarding degrees and credits, and has the legal power to act broadly in providing an education.

Whereas, if you had satisfied all of the requirements for the degree, then they could not arbitrarily withhold the degree \\-\\- it is now a thing that you have a property right to.\n\nJust as the university has the right to impose requirements (with appropriate advance notice), they also have the right to suspend requirements, generally or according to circumstances (as long as it is not arbitrary). A typical actual example is \"that class hasn't been taught for 3 years\". In this case, the requirement was not suspended, but an agent of the university acting within the scope of their appointment judged that the requirement had already been satisfied in your case. The university administration might not actually approve of the professor's choice and might change their rules or sanction the professor (at *my* university this was common practice, albeit never officially sanctioned), but it is the sort of thing that is within the scope of the professor's job (to judge that you have satisfied the \"bottom\\-line\" requirements of the course).

When a person makes a material false representation during the formation of a contract, and the other party relies on that representation, the resulting contract is void. In this case, John falsely certified that he was not a resident of XYZ, which was likely a material factor in the ICO platform's decision to allow his participation. As a result, the contract formed between John and the platform would be void. This means that neither party can enforce their rights or be required to perform their obligations under the contract. Practically, this could leave John in a difficult position if he were to invest money or receive cryptocurrency tokens, as he would have no legal recourse to recover his investment or enforce any promises made by the platform.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while false certification might have serious consequences, it's not necessarily a crime in itself.

Could the vandal either be prosecuted or sued?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are some problems with this kind of vandalism, one of them clearly that the internet is international and vandalism can be performed from everywhere on servers everywhere in the world. And so it may be (both technically and legally) difficult to get hold of the vandal. Therefore, most wikis primarily focus on blocking offending accounts or their IPs and hope that this helps at least for a while. Only if it doesn't and the vandalism continues for extended time periods, legal measures are considered.\n\nLegally speaking though, vandalism is prohibited by many jurisdictions and of course by the terms of use of the wiki operators.\n\nFor instance, the [Swiss criminal code](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en) Art 147 explicitly puts \"abusing of data processing equipment\" under penalty and hence gives website operators a legal backup for setting up rules for the use of their services.\n\n> Computer fraud\n> Art. 147\n\n> 1 Any person who with a view to his own or another's unlawful gain, by the incorrect, incomplete or unauthorised use of data, or in a similar way, influences the electronic or similar processing or transmission of data and as a result causes the transfer of financial assets, thus occasioning loss to another, or immediately thereafter conceals such a transfer shall be liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding five years or to a monetary penalty.\n\n> 2 If the offender acts for commercial gain, he shall be liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding ten years or to a monetary penalty of not less than 90 daily penalty units.\n\nTechnically, the law even requires prosecution *ex officio*, even though without a hint from the operator, the police won't start an investigation. I'm sure the US has a similar law. The problem is, as with all internet crimes, it's practical application, particularly because often website operator and offender are not living in the same country.\n\n**Edit**\nAfter reading the exact text again (it was unavailable yesterday) Art 147 is mostly about fraud performed by computers (classical \"hacking\") but it shouldn't be difficult to argue that fighting and reverting vandalism requires significant (technical and personal) effort and hence the operator looses money. Additionally, there's Art 144bis which matches even better for the scenario here:\n\n> Damage to data\n> Art. 144bis\n\n> 1. Any person who without authority alters, deletes or renders unusable data that is stored or transmitted electronically or in some other similar way shall be liable on complaint to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetary penalty.\n\n> If the offender has caused major damage, a custodial sentence of from one to five years may be imposed.

Importantly, this offense is prosecuted ex officio, meaning authorities can pursue it without requiring a formal complaint from the victim.\n\nOption C, which involves deleting large amounts of valuable data, most closely aligns with this serious offense described in the law.

Therefore, he does not have to warn or protect them from potentially harmful conditions on the property.\nHowever, *an exception applies if a property owner knows, or has reason to anticipate, that children will trespass on his land.

He may not intentionally harm the trespasser or lay a trap for him.\n2. The trespasser is entitled to due care after his presence is actually known.\n3. There is no duty owed regarding the condition of the premises.\n4. The possessor of land has no duty to trespassers if he is engaged in a dangerous activity until the person's presence is know.\n5. The possessor of land has no duty to warn trespassers of dangerous hidden conditions (Conn. Law of Torts, \u00a7 47\\).\n\n### Duty Owed to Trespassing Children\n\nConnecticut's appellate courts have adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts rule regarding the duty of a property owner to trespassing children (Duggan v. Esposito, 178 Conn. 156 (1979\\), Neal v. Shiels, Inc., 166 Conn. 3 (1974\\), Greene v. DiFazio, 148 Conn. 419 (1961\\), Wolfe v. Rehbein, 123 Conn. 110 (1937\\), Yeske v. Avon Old Farms School, Inc., 1 Conn. App. 195 (1984\\)).\n\n> Under this rule, if an owner knows or has reason to know that children\n> will be on his property, he has the duty to protect them from injury\n> by either fixing the harmful condition or ensuring that the children\n> will not have access to that part of the property.\n> \n> \n> The rule states that a possessor of land is liable for harm to\n> trespassing children caused by an artificial condition on the land if\n> (1\\) the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely\n> to trespass in that place, (2\\) the condition is one the possessor\n> knows or has reason to know and should realize will involve an\n> unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to children, (3\\) the\n> children because of their youth do not discover the condition or\n> realize the risk, (4\\) the utility of maintaining the condition and the\n> burden of eliminating the danger are slight compared with the risk to\n> children involved, and (5\\) the possessor fails to exercise reasonable\n> care to eliminate the danger or otherwise protect children\n> (Restatement (Second), 2 Torts 339\\).\n\nPut in the letter that you are disclaiming any liability for injury to them that may occur on your property, and make them aware of all the ways they could be injured \u2013 so they've been informed. You don't have a duty to remove rock walls because unsupervised kids jump off them. They are not invitees, they are trespassers. So make it known you do not want them on the land and for any further breach you will call the police. Because otherwise you could be responsible.\n\nUsing CT again as an example, you could include the legal statute about trespass in your notice:\n\n### Trespass Crimes and Infractions\n\n> A person commits first degree criminal trespass when (1\\) he enters or\n> remains in a building or any other premises after the owner or an\n> authorized person personally communicates an order to leave or not\n> enter and (2\\) he knows that he is not licensed or privileged to be\n> there.

Serving a certified \"cease and desist\" letter to the parents is recommended as the most effective legal action. It formally documents the property owner's concerns, puts the parents on notice about the trespassing, and can help protect the owner from potential liability.\n\nD) Removing all potentially dangerous features is not necessary and may be unreasonable, as the property owner isn't required to remove normal landscape features like retaining walls or stones.\n\nThe certified letter approach provides formal documentation, addresses the parents directly, and can include specific legal language about trespassing and liability, making it the most comprehensive and legally sound option."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9424/company-assets-and-minority-share-holders", "docs_id": 9424, "title": "Company assets and minority share holders", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The majority share holder of this company allowed assets (land) to be auctioned off for non payment of municipal taxes through a deliberate scheme to escape paying profits to the minority share holders.

(If he does so through deceit then he is committing the common law tort of fraud, and quite likely a criminal offense.)\n2. A trustee or fiduciary that uses his control of assets to enrich himself at the expense of those to whom he owes a duty (e.g., minority shareholders) is guilty of various statutory offenses, among which may be \"Breach of Fiduciary Duty\" and \"Fraudulent transfer.\"\n3. Sales of corporate assets in general must be done through an \"arms\\-length\" mechanism. If they are being auctioned off, and the auction isn't open, so that an insider is able to purchase them below \"fair market value,\" then, once again, a fraud has been committed.

The majority shareholder's actions likely constitute multiple offenses under corporate law. These may include breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent transfer, and potentially criminal fraud. The scheme to deliberately allow assets to be auctioned off, only to be repurchased and personally acquired, is a clear violation of the duty owed to minority shareholders.

If you refuse admission, they must obtain a warrant (constitutional requirement), making the justification subject to judicial review, i.e. conformity with the states grounds for such entry.

Something like Creative Common for innovations. Is there such a method?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are correct that it is quite expensive to patent something in U.S. law.\n\nUnder U.S. patent law, once an idea is publicly published, if no one else has a patent application for the same idea that is pending, the idea enters the public domain and no one can obtain a patent of that idea. The publication become \"prior art\" with respect to any future patent application which cannot be protected by patent law.\n\nOf course, if you publish an invention which you discovered independently, that someone else already has a patent application pending for that will be approved the following week, the fact that you published it after the patent was applied for doesn't prevent the person with the pending patent application from having it approved.\n\nThe term \"invention\" rather than \"idea\" is what I will use for the remainder of this answer, because there are many ideas which may not be patented, while the lion's share of patentable ideas are appropriately described as \"inventions.\" But, understand that as used in this answer, the term \"invention\" is being used to refer to the concepts and ideas necessary to make the invention, and not to a particular instance of a product made using those concepts and ideas.\n\nWhen an invention is in the public domain, anyone can utilize the invention free of charge without a license. People who use the invention are not even required to acknowledge that you invented or discovered it.\n\nAn invention is also not eligible to be patented if more than a year has elapsed since the first sale of a product using it. But, in that case, the invention can still be protected as a trade secret until it is voluntarily disclosed in some fashion to someone who is not subject to a non\\-disclosure agreement. (I say voluntary, because the fact that, for example, an unauthorized corporate spy sees the trade secret doesn't end the status of the invention as a trade secret.)\n\nSome inventions, are effectively publicly disclosed and published the moment that anyone looks at it closely. \n\nThe patentable element of other inventions are invisible to an end user, or to observer of an end user.\n\nFor example, if the invention involves something in the interior of a device, or the invention involves something not visible to the naked eye (e.g. a process for synthesizing an industrial chemical from other chemicals where the chemical formula of the ingredients and end result can't be determined without a microscope or analytical chemistry tests), merely showing someone a product made using the invention will not put it in the public domain.\n\nIt is generally legal to reverse engineer or independently come up with an invention which is merely a trade secret. It is not legal to use a patented invention or process, even if it is not directly copied and is instead reverse engineered or independently discovered, during the lifetime of the patent.\n\nThere is no straightforward way to put an invention into the public domain while retaining any right to acknowledgement that you invented it or otherwise exercise control through a licensing agreement without patenting it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An inventor has developed a new process for synthesizing an industrial chemical, but doesn't want to patent it due to high maintenance fees.

I just looked at a candy bar wrapper and it carries an \u00ae. If there WAS a recent court case that changed the practice or influenced a change I haven't heard of it, and I've done some reading in recent major trademark cases. But I am not a lawyer, much less an IP lawyer, so I can't be sure.\n\nAnother possibility is that the comparatively large symbol adjacent to the large logo on the front of the package was removed, and a smaller logo, with symbol, was placed on the back of the package.

We live in the US (the state of Ohio) and have been divorced (technically a dissolution) for around 2 years. As our child is not yet school age we opted to put off assigning a \"custodial parent\" (which, I know, is rapidly approaching). \n\nSince before we were divorced I have suspected my ex has a drinking problem but perhaps naively (or more likely for lack of visibility) I had thought she compartmentalized her drinking to her off\\-parenting time. Recently, however, there was an event that gave me great cause for concern and I want to be sure I understand the law so as not to mistep. \n\nLast weekend, I was asked to watch my son for a few hours on a day that was scheduled hers (he had been cooped up in the house sick and was apparently driving her nuts). I took him out to run errands with me for a few hours but when it came time to drop him back off I received an alarming text message. \n\nEssentially, she let me know that she had been drinking so it wasn't a good idea for her to meet us at the playground where we were going to be, so instead could I drop him off directly at her house? Obviously concerned, I asked her how much she had drank, to please stop and indicated I could keep him for an additional couple of hours while she took efforts to sober up. She was (understandably?) outraged, claimed to have drank only 3 beers and demanded I drop him off immediately. I held my ground and (after a lot of arguing) we eventually rescheduled the drop\\-off time to later in the day. \n\nOne of the things she let slip (verbally) while we were arguing was that she apparently regularly drinks while she has him but never drives \"even after one beer\" and \"never gets drunk\" when he is around. \n\nSince this episode, I have been reading up on denied visitation and the contempt charges that can spur from that and so I want to be very careful in how I act. At the end of the day I want to protect my son but I'm also scared that I could jeopardize my ability to gain primary or full custody of him. I understand I need to document everything I see to begin building a case (which I have started) but I also want to be sure that if I have to involve the police that I do so in a way that doesn't harm my case.\n\nMy Questions:\n\n* Is there a legal standard as to how sober a care\\-giver must be to safely watch a child (or in other words) how drunk does my ex have to be for me to deny a drop\\-off? Is it entirely based upon outward signs or blood\\-alcohol level?\n* Am I correct in assuming that in order to protect myself from being accused of denying visitation, that (in the future) I need to involve the police if I suspect her of being intoxicated?\n* If I involve the police, do I need to be sure that she is extremely intoxicated in order to avoid a \"false alarm\"? (Obviously this scares me as I'd prefer she didn't drink at all)\n* What options do I have, if any, if she drinks around him in her own home? Is she within her legal right as long as she doesn't get in a car, doesn't pass out or does something blatantly abusive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In 50/50 custody you have the right to stand your ground to ensure the safety and well being of your children. You do not need to involve police unless it is an emergency. \"911 Operator, what is the emergency\". Only call them when you feel your children are in grave danger. For example, you know for sure that the other parent is drunk and driving, or the other parent is drunk and on the ground unable to move and the child is in danger, etc.\n\nIf you involve the police over your partner excessive drinking than, and they find that she was not excessively drinking, you will face false accusation charges and her lawyer will try to make you look like the bad guy trying to take away her children.\n\n**how drunk does my ex have to be for me to deny a drop\\-off? Is it entirely based upon outward signs or blood\\-alcohol level?**\n\n*You should not search for drugs or alcohol, or administer tests, as to avoid the accusation of an illegal search.*\n\nYou can, however, based on your judgment of common sense assess the situation and see how drunk (s)he is and make your decision based on that circumstances. Make a 1\\-page log to document the date, time, situation description (3\\-5 sentences of what you see and why you make that decision.) It would be wise to have a witness around, so write down the person name as well for reference, (NOT MANY PEOPLE LIKE TO BE WITNESSES, But you can write down the people names that you know were around that incident.) Don't tell your partner that you are making the log. Suprise them in the court when you have a full page of incidents due to drinking.\n\n**Am I correct in assuming that in order to protect myself from being accused of denying visitation, that (in the future) I need to involve the police if I suspect her of being intoxicated?**\n\n\\*Always protect yourself! Be Your Own Advocate. \\* Don't involve the police unless its am emergency, read the first comment above.\n\n**If I involve the police, do I need to be sure that she is extremely intoxicated in order to avoid a \"false alarm\"? (Obviously, this scares me as I'd prefer she didn't drink at all)**\n\nThis drinking incident is alarming itself. However, you should consult with your family law attorney. I would say that document five issues if it exceeds 5 in one month than filing a motion with the court to adjust the drinking problem, and that you request the child to be with you 60/40 custody. You must be able to demonstrate that you have the time, commitment and resources to take over the 60/40 custody.\n\n**What options do I have, if any, if she drinks around him in her own home?

This approach allows the concerned parent to build a case over time if there is a pattern of behavior, without risking false accusation charges or violating the other parent's rights. Calling the police should be reserved for emergencies where the child is in immediate danger. Administering tests could be seen as an illegal search. Denying visitation without proper documentation or legal guidance could potentially harm one's case for custody modification.

Can the officer allow *dispatch* to tell the citizen that he has permission?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\nThis is governed by state law (for state law enforcement officers granting this authority) or federal law (in the case of authority granted by a federal law enforcement officer), so the details may vary from case to case.\n\nIn many circumstances, however, a law enforcement officer has the authority to temporarily 'grant' his authority to another private citizen in order to deal with a specific incident.\n\nWhen this is done one says that the law enforcement officer \"deputized\" the person who was given this authority.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\n### The Power To Deputize Civilians\n\nMost states have statutory circumstances under which certain kinds of law enforcement officers can deputize a non\\-law enforcement officer to carry out a law enforcement function under the supervision, direction and control of a law enforcement officer, on an incident by incident basis.\n\nFor example, if a single sheriff responds to a bar fight with several people who need to be arrested, under most state's law, the sheriff could authorize a bouncer or patron at the bar who wouldn't have the power to make a citizen's arrest under the circumstances (e.g. because the patron arrived at the scene after the alleged fight took place) to detain a suspect whom the sheriff has the power to arrest, until additional law enforcement personnel can come to the scene to assist.\n\nColorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 16\\-3\\-202 is typical of such a statute. It states:\n\n> (1\\)\u2002A peace officer making an arrest may command the assistance of any\n> person who is in the vicinity.\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2002A person commanded to assist a peace officer has the same\n> authority to arrest as the officer who commands his assistance.\n> \n> \n> (3\\)\u2002A person commanded to assist a peace officer in making an arrest\n> shall not be civilly or criminally liable for any reasonable conduct\n> in aid of the officer or for any acts expressly directed by the\n> officer.\n> \n> \n> (4\\)\u2002Private citizens, acting in good faith, shall be immune from any\n> civil liability for reporting to any police officer or law enforcement\n> authority the commission or suspected commission of any crime or for\n> giving other information to aid in the prevention of any crime.\n\nFurther, another Colorado statute provides that \"conduct which would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal when it is required or authorized by a provision of law or a judicial decree binding in Colorado,\" including laws \"defining duties of private citizens to assist public servants in the performance of certain of their functions.\" Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 18\\-1\\-701 (in pertinent parts).\n\nThe exact details of how someone is deputized, who may deputize someone, and what authority this conveys varies in detail from state to state. Also, often this is done piecemeal, rather than globally, or is implied in part under common law agency principles. The power of a law enforcement officer to deputize someone to kill a dying deer hit in a car accident is likely to be in a different statutory section than the power of a law enforcement officer to deputize someone to make an arrest.\n\nPeople who are deputized by a law enforcement officer in this fashion are collectively called a [posse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse).\n\nThe posse was heavily used in rural areas and frontier areas into the early 20th century, but this authority is now, while still utilized, much less commonly used, and less familiar, especially in urban areas with large professional police departments. In these areas, it is more common for police to resort to mutual aid agreements with regional law enforcement agencies to seek reinforcements who are law enforcement officers at some other agency, rather than seeking help from private citizens.\n\n### Other Solutions\n\nOften, conduct that literally fits the definition of prohibited conduct, like possession of a wildlife carcass without a license, is resolved in regulations or definitions in a statute or regulation that exclude the conduct in question from what is prohibited.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, the definition of hunting, which is what you need a license to do, is defined in such a way as to exclude road kill related incidents. *See, e.g.,* Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 33\\-1\\-102(25\\.5\\), (29\\) and (43\\).\n\n### The Legal Doctrine Of Reliance On Official Authority\n\nThere is also another legal doctrine that can make it possible to achieve almost the same result.\n\nAs a matter of U.S. Constitutional law, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that a criminal defendant may not be punished for actions taken in good faith reliance upon authoritative assurances that the defendant will not be punished for his actions. *See U.S. v. Laub*, 385 U.S. 475 (1967\\); *Cox v. Louisiana*, 379 U.S. 559 (1965\\); and *Raley v. Ohio*, 360 U.S. 423 (1959\\).\n\nFor example, suppose that a 911 dispatcher tells a passing motorist that she has the authority to authorize the motorist to shoot and kill the deer because she is deputizing the motorist to do so, and that the applicable state law actually provides that a private citizen may be deputized to euthanize a deer struck in a car accident when a law enforcement officer deputizing the citizen is physically present. Despite this fact, if the motorist has no reason to believe that the dispatcher doesn't have this authority (even though the dispatcher does not have this authority under state law), the motorist is immune from criminal liability for shooting a deer out of season without a license pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court cases cited above.\n\nAnd, while the dispatcher's conduct may have technically violated state law by directing someone to violate the law under circumstances when the dispatcher did not have the authority to do so, the District Attorney is likely to decide that this technical violation of the state's hunting laws by the dispatcher, whether or not the dispatcher knew that the dispatcher did not have the authority to deputize the motorist, is not an offense that warrants prosecution. Indeed, prosecutors routinely overlook technical violations of the law by law enforcement officers who are carrying out their duties in good faith or for other non\\-selfish reasons (e.g. out of a desire to treat the downed deer humanely without diverting law enforcement resources urgently needed elsewhere at the time)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A sheriff in Small-town, USA receives a call about a mortally wounded deer on the side of the road.

The legal doctrine of reliance on official authority, as established by U.S. Supreme Court cases like U.S. v. Laub and Cox v. Louisiana, protects individuals from criminal punishment when they act in good faith reliance on authoritative assurances that their actions are permissible. Even if the sheriff or dispatcher lacked the actual authority to deputize the caller or authorize the euthanization of the deer, the caller's reliance on what they believed to be official permission could provide protection from criminal liability.\n\nOption A is incorrect because automatic protection is not guaranteed; it depends on the specific circumstances and laws of the jurisdiction. Option B is too absolute, as it doesn't account for the doctrine of reliance on official authority or potential state laws that might allow such deputization.

The passage states that \"Account would not be taken of unlikely hypothetical breaches, since it would be very difficult to draft a clause that would never operate in a penal way.\" This means that courts generally overlook unlikely hypothetical breaches because it's practically impossible to draft clauses that would never be considered penal in every possible scenario, no matter how unlikely.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the focus is not on actual vs. hypothetical breaches, but on likely vs. unlikely scenarios.\n\nOption C, while plausible, is not supported by the given text. The passage doesn't discuss the relevance of breaches to the main purpose of the contract.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the court's assumption about parties' intentions is not mentioned as a reason for overlooking unlikely hypothetical breaches.\n\nThe key point is that courts recognize the practical difficulty in drafting perfect clauses and thus don't invalidate otherwise reasonable liquidated damages clauses based on their potential penal nature in highly unlikely scenarios."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17171/why-do-boxing-fights-need-to-be-sanctioned-by-state-authorities", "docs_id": 17171, "title": "Why do boxing fights need to be sanctioned by state authorities?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Why does boxing (and perhaps MMA) need to be sanctioned by state authorities like the [Nevada Athletic Commission](http://boxing.nv.gov/) or [New York State athletic commission](https://www.dos.ny.gov/athletic/)? \n\nOther sports like baseball require no such state license, nor does a contact sport like football or even a sport that includes *actual physical fighting* like hockey. \n\nWhy isn't engaging in a boxing match a form of protected free speech that the state cannot obstruct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Boxing doesn't have to be regulated by a government agency, but it generally is regulated in this way (1\\) because states are concerned about regulating fighting with an intent to do physical harm to the other player (which is strictly speaking against the rules even in contact sports like hockey), which would otherwise violate criminal laws unless there was a statutory exception, and (2\\) because they want to regulate gambling associated with the events (which, again, they wouldn't have to do, but in practice, all states completely ban gambling subject to specific regulated gambling systems, or *de minimis* exceptions).\n\nHistorically, many boxing \"leagues\" were corrupt and manipulated both to punish people disliked by organized crime by forcing people to participate to cleanse what would otherwise be illegal gang vigilante activities and to cheat people betting on matches by fixing the results of fights.

States allow contact sports because they choose to do so as a matter of policy, not because the right to engage in contact sports is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nThere is a constitutional right to have sex with other consenting adults under the U.S. Supreme Court's *Lawrence v.

Boxing and MMA are regulated by state athletic commissions primarily because these sports involve intentional physical harm to opponents, which would typically violate criminal laws.

While some retailers might engage in this practice, it doesn't make it legal or less risky. Consistently undervaluing shipments makes it difficult for the retailer to claim it was a mistake, especially given that electronic records of actual order values exist. Customs authorities take such fraud seriously, and if a pattern is discovered, the retailer could face significant fines, penalties, and even criminal charges for tax evasion and customs fraud.

To protect its competitive advantage, WonderWidget takes all sorts of measures to ensure that AAA Widgets never learns about the benefits of the cinnamon additive.\n> \n> \n> WonderWidgets hires Jane, an engineer with a PhD in cinnamonology to make improvements to the additive. She signs a confidentiality agreement promising to protet the company's trade secrets. After a year with WonderWidgets, Jane is recruited by AAA Widgets. WonderWidgets sues them both to prevent them from consummating an employment relationship.\n\nAssuming that the information Jane acquired from WonderWidgets is a protected trade secret, the idea here is that everyone knows exactly why AAA is hiring Jane, and that it would basically be impossible for Jane to work for them without applying the knowledge she acquired from WonderWidgets, i.e., there her employment would lead to an inevitable disclosure of WonderWidgets' trade secrets.\n\nI think most people would agree that there's at least a reasonable argument to be made in favor of WonderWidgets, there are also efforts to apply this doctrine in much shakier circumstances. For instance, WonderWidgets might try to prevent its janitor from going to work for AAA because it taught him how to mop floors, and it has cleaner floors than AAA, and therefore its cleaning techniques must be superior, and therefore those techniques must be protected.\n\nThere are some states in which WonderWidgets would win the cinnamon case, and some where Jane would win, because the state doesn't recognize inevitable\\-disclosure at all.

It is the author of the work who claims ownership.\n\nYou will have to figure out the technical details of such file sharing, but the legal details are pretty simple: everybody involved would be liable. Any such data is contained on one of more physical devices, and gets copied to one or more devices.

That permission can be rescinded, but only by the owner. The owner seems to have given permission and has stated in advance some conditions under which permission might be rescinded. The towing company could be called (by the owner) to act as the agent for the owner and remove the offending vehicle; but the towing company cannot just up an do this on their own. If they *were* to spontaneously tow a vehicle without officially acting on behalf of the owner, they would be liable for damages, owing to their having torted some guy's chattels. So the company will want to know that they are protected, in acting as the agent of the property owner. One way to do that is to verify that the person calling the towing company is the owner. Another would be to get the caller to swear that they are the owner and indemnify them against damages, in case they get sued. That pound of cure is more costly and annoying than the ounce of prevention of making sure that you're towing a car with proper authorization, so it's unlikely that they would just tow the car on your say\\-so.\n\nYou might try suing the complex owner for some kind of breach of contract, if you think you have a contractual right to a parking space and they are negligent in doing what's necessary to meet your contractual right.

Justice Scalia's comments refer to the Framers' intent to protect minority factions through the separation of powers, which creates gridlock in the legislative process.

Instead, it creates a system where passing laws is difficult, which indirectly protects minority interests.\n\nThe key point is that Scalia is referring to ideological and political minorities rather than racial minorities, and the protection comes from the difficulty of passing new laws rather than from direct representation or veto power."}}
