            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A very large site and my site are both licensed to use product images created and photographed by the same vendor. Now the large site comes after my site and sends a DMCA notice to my hosting provider, asking us to take down quite some of our most popular products.\n\nWhile it's absolutely a false claim and it's possible that they had no idea we were licensed just as they were, it seems I have to take down the *infringing* materials and send back a counter\\-notice and wait for **14 days**?\n\nMy question is is this fair?\n\n14 days are enough for Google to **de\\-index** the page and for it to **lose** all the ranking juices. Not to mention the **sales losses**.\n\nWhat if they actually know we are licensed but just wanted to ruin our site rankings and keep coming after us in future?\n\nDo we still have to follow the legal procedures to take down whatever products they claim *infringing* for 14 days? What better options do we have here?\n\nUpdate\n======\n\nAfter I first posted this question, my host restored the allegedly infringing product after 14 days of my providing the counter DMCA notice. Now the same complaint is after us again on another of our popular products. This is really annoying and stupid. \n\nHow can I end this once and for all? \n\nWe are not physically in United States, can we still find someone to win the lawsuit for us? Or is there any other way to stop them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a slight confusion here: The large company sent the DMCA notice to your host, not to you. You are not taking down anything. The host does that. \n\nIf the DMCA takedown notice is following all the rules, then your host has two choices: Take down your content, or be willing to be part of a copyright court case. Assuming that the host doesn't want to go to court and potentially lose tons of money, they will take down your content. Until you send a counter notice. \n\nNow you can only legally create a DMCA notice as the copyright holder or their agent. Whoever sends the takedown notice must under threat of perjury declare that they are the copyright holder of material that they believe you are infringing upon. It seems that company is not the copyright holder, therefore perjury. (If they make a mistake, and your material is not their copyrighted material, that's legally Ok. But if they are not copyright holder, that is perjury). If you are sure that happened, a good lawyer will love to take them apart.",

According to the documentation, when a hosting provider receives a properly formatted DMCA takedown notice, they have two options: either remove the allegedly infringing content or be willing to participate in a potential copyright lawsuit. This is true even if the claim turns out to be false, as the host is initially acting on the information provided in the takedown notice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the website owner can dispute the claim through a counter-notice.\n\nOption B is false because only the copyright holder or their authorized agent can legally file a DMCA takedown notice. Filing a false notice could be considered perjury.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the website owner has the right to file a counter-notice and potentially have the content restored after a waiting period.\n\nThis question tests understanding of DMCA procedures, the responsibilities of hosting providers, and the rights of website owners in copyright disputes."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was recently viewing a property to buy in the UK, with an asking price of \u00a3400k. On the day of the viewing, but before my appointment, the estate agent informed me that two offers had already been made that same day, and both had been accepted. Although he couldn't reveal the amount of these offers for legal reasons, it was \"not worth me making an offer below the asking price\". So, I make an offer for \u00a3407k, and this was accepted. After thinking this through, I am now wondering how likely it is that these two other offers were genuine, and how likely it is these two offers never actually existed, but were made up to encourage me to make an offer over the asking price.\n\nAs another anecdote, after a previous viewing at a different property, the estate agent informed me that an offer for the asking price had just been accepted, and asked whether I would like to make an offer to myself. I replied that I was not interested in making an offer, but then only to find out a few days later that an advert for the same property was re\\-listed at \u00a310k below that original asking price. Yes, I know that often the finances don't work out and the buyer has to back out, but it certainly seems possible that in that case too, this other offer was fake.\n\nSo, my questions are (and relating specifically to the UK, but other comments welcomed):\n\n1. When estate agents state that other offers have recently already been made and accepted, is it common for these to be fake? If anybody has any real insider knowledge about this (e.g. if you are / have been an estate agent yourself), comments would be welcomed on how often estate agents make up other offers when trying to get a buyer to increase their offer.\n2. Is it actually defined in law that it is illegal for estate agents to suggest that other offers have been made, when this is completely untrue?\n3. If I was suspicious about the estate agent faking an offer, how could I go about finding out the truth? If I were to ask the estate agent, he would certainly say to me that it was not within his capacity to reveal the details of his other clients who made these offers. So it seems difficult to ever know, even if you were very suspicious.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Yes, I believe it is common in *some* cases for people to lie about alternative offers in order to drive up asking price or encourage a quicker offer. But there are also brokers who would never consider it. People are night and day. How common it is depends on the culture of real estate transactions in a particular region and the particular person you are dealing with.\n2. Legality depends on your jurisdiction, and there is a distinction between illegality and what can be done about it. Technically it may be fraud or in violation of ethics regulations. Consult an attorney in your jurisdiction who does not regularly work with this broker.\n3. You can't necessarily know. You have to assume a selling agent is lying about everything and protect yourself by ignoring most of what he says and having a good attorney. I would especially do that when the agent tells you he has already accepted two offers on the same house, because that means he has already broken a deal today and is planning to break the second if you give him more money.\n\nThe best approach is probably, practically, to mostly ignore the claim about the competing offer and take it as a price change. If you'll pay more and be happy, fine. If you aren't willing to pay more, walk away. If they're faking the offer, they'll almost definitely come back to you and then you can even potentially negotiate a price cut. \n\nHowever, check with a local real estate attorney first about whether this increases the risk of litigation over the property that you won't want to get involved in.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK real estate market, an estate agent informs a potential buyer that two offers have been accepted on a property before the buyer's viewing. The buyer then makes a higher offer which is accepted. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The estate agent's claim about prior offers is definitely true and should be taken at face value.\nB) The estate agent's claim is likely false and should be reported to authorities immediately.\nC) The buyer should assume the estate agent may be lying and make decisions based on their own willingness to pay, regardless of claimed competing offers.\nD) The buyer should always walk away from any property where the agent claims there are competing offers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the expert advice given, buyers should assume that selling agents might not always be truthful about competing offers. The best approach is to largely ignore claims about other offers and make decisions based on one's own willingness to pay for the property. This doesn't mean the agent is definitely lying, but it acknowledges the possibility and protects the buyer's interests. Answer A is incorrect because blindly trusting the agent is not advisable. Answer B is too extreme without concrete evidence of falsehood. Answer D is also too extreme, as walking away from every property with claimed competing offers could unnecessarily limit opportunities."

The therapist recently disclosed her information, including what they have talked about in counseling sessions, to other people in the agency. Being confronted, the therapist pointed the finger back and accused her of false things and refused to see her again.\n\nWe would like to know if there are laws and regulations applicable in this situation. Are there federal level regulations applicable in this situation? The agency is responding indifferently. We are considering filing a complaint with the state board of psychology. We found several possible names on the state's professional licensing website, but can't be sure which one is the therapist, since the therapist keeps her full name from us.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We're missing a lot of information that we'd need to offer a full answer. Here are some of the things that will probably drive the analysis:\n\n* the type of counselor we're talking about;\n* the types of information the counselor disclosed;\n* the reason she disclosed it;\n* the job functions of the people to whom she disclosed it;\n* the reason the client is bothered by the disclosure.\n\nGenerally speaking, a mental\\-health counselor has a fiduciary duty to maintain the confidentiality of patient information, but my understanding is that in most cases, the counselor would be allowed to discuss a case with colleagues for the purposes of advancing the patient's treatment. So discussing the facts of a tough case with a supervisor is not going to be as problematic as idly gossiping about clients with custodial staff.\n\nBeyond the permitted disclosures, there are also situations in which counselors are *required* to disclose confidential information, including cases where the counselor suspects child or elder abuse or where the counselor believes the client poses a danger to herself or others.\n\nIf the disclosure was truly not permitted, then it may be that the client has a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. In Georgia, proving that case requires evidence that:\n\n1. That the counselor had information relating to the client that she knew or should have known was confidential;\n2. That the counselor communicated the client\u2019s confidential information to third parties;\n3. That the client did not give informed consent to the counselor\u2019s conduct;\n4. That the confidential information was not a matter of general knowledge; and\n5. That the disclosure harmed the client.\n\nAs you noted, the client could also file a complaint with the state licensing board. I don't know of any federal laws or regulations that would come into play in the situation you've described.",

According to [their website](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenancies/solving-problems/dispute-resolution/serving-notices-for-dispute-resolution) allowable methods are\n\n* give a copy directly to the person\n* Leave a copy with the landlord\u2019s agent (tenants should note the name of the person)\n* Send a copy by registered or regular mail to the person\u2019s residential address (or the place where the landlord conducts business as a landlord)\n* Leave a copy in a mailbox or mail slot at the address where the person lives (or the place where the landlord does business as a landlord)\n\nIt seems to me delivering a copy to the landlords house is cheapest. If I do this what should I do if no one answers the door? What should I do if someone who I don't know answers the door? I don't think this happened, but how can I verify the landlord still lives there and hasn't recently moved?\n\nI'm thinking of going with a friend who could act as a witness. Is it alright to take a video with a cellphone of putting the evidence through the mailbox?\n\nWhat happens if the landlord refuses it? For example he comes to the door and won't take it from my hand, or wouldn't sign for the delivery?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Filming something isn't illegal, but I doubt it would serve as good evidence anyway.\n\nSince you are serving evidence personally, you've got a few options to verify that:\n\n* Bring a witness\n\nThis is probably your best bet. Bring a witness, and have them swear, or affirm, that they witnessed giving you the documents. This says so on the website that you linked.\n\nNow to go over your concerns:\n\n> If I do this what should I do if no one answers the door? What should I do if someone who I don't know answers the door?\n\n[According to this document (despite being in Ontario),](https://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/courts/guides/Guide_to_Serving_Documents_EN.pdf) if they appear to be over the age of 18, you can give it to them. Make sure that you catch their name. Make sure that the document that you are serving is in an envelope that is addressed to your landlord. Make sure that the person that you speak with also lives there. However, the document also says that you need to mail it to them on the same day. Make sure to get a receipt of this to verify that you served the document through mail.\n\n> I don't think this happened, but how can I verify the landlord still lives there and hasn't recently moved?\n\nIf you don't think this happened, I don't think you should worry about it.\n\n> What happens if the landlord refuses it? For example he comes to the door and won't take it from my hand, or wouldn't sign for the delivery?\n\nAgain, according to the Ontario document, ~~throw it at their feet and run~~. No but seriously, if your landlord refuses to accept the document, you can drop it to the floor, at their feet, and the document will be considered served. I would definitely try to have a witness in this one, and make sure that this is a detail that is noted in the case.\n\nDo what you need to do to serve the document. Chances are, you can ask the small claims court to honour your costs associated with serving the document: assuming you did so through mail or courier.",

John keeps detailed records, actively markets his sheds online, and plans to expand his product line. Given this information, how would the IRS likely categorize John's activities?\n\nA) As a hobby, because John is not making a significant profit\nB) As a business, regardless of the current profit level\nC) As neither a hobby nor a business, because John is not a U.S. citizen\nD) As a hobby, unless John makes more than $10,000 per year\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The IRS would likely categorize John's activities as a business, regardless of the current profit level. The determination of whether an activity is a business or a hobby is based on various factors, not just profitability. In this case, several factors point towards a business classification:\n\n1. John invests significant time and effort into the activity.\n2. He keeps detailed records, which suggests a business-like approach.\n3. He actively markets his products, indicating an intent to make a profit.\n4. He plans to expand his product line, showing adaptation to increase profitability.\n5. While not currently profitable, the activity has the potential for profit in the future.\n\nThe fact that John is not a U.S. citizen does not affect the IRS's classification of the activity as a business or hobby. However, it's important to note that operating a business in the U.S. as a non-citizen may have legal implications regarding visas and work authorization, which is a separate issue from the IRS classification."

Presumably, purely numerical questions are too.\n\nSlight modifications to copyrighted works is usually considered derivative work, and if done without the author's permission is considered infringement.\n\nMy question is whether slighly modified math questions are considered derivative as well, or would it be original/transformed work, considering that merely changing the numbers in a math question would usually create a new problem to be solved. And TBH is probably how many, if not most, math questions for pedagogical purposes are generated.\n\ne.g.\nOriginal\n\n> A tap on the top of a 20L tank fills it at the rate of 4 liters per hour, and another at the bottom empties it at 2 liters per hour.

Does/would a court agree that you are copying?\n\nIf you took the question as it is and modified it, that would usually be a derivative work. However, in science or mathematics, a tiny change can change a question completely. If someone writes \u201cthe earth rotates around the sun\u201d, then \u201cthe sun rotates around the earth\u201d is most likely not a derivative work.\n\nSo if you took an existing question, and changed it so that a different answer can be found in exactly the same way, I\u2019d call it derivative and a court would likely do the same. If you changed the numbers in a way that totally changes the character of the question then I wouldn\u2019t call it derivative but a court with a judge who is not a mathematician quite likely would.\n\nIt would be best not to start with an existing question. There is no copyright on the idea behind the question, so you can still develop your own from scratch. That would not be derivative\\- but you still have the problem of convincing a judge. In this case, there are similar questions found everywhere, so it would be very hard to prove which particular work yours is derived from.",

This approach demonstrates the creation of original work inspired by mathematical principles rather than deriving directly from the copyrighted material.\n\nOption A is likely to be considered a derivative work as it only changes the numbers while keeping the same scenario and structure. Option B, while more transformative, might still be seen as derivative if it closely follows the structure and concept of the original. Option C is a direct translation, which is typically considered a derivative work requiring permission from the copyright holder."

But I cannot recall the name of the case, and I have not been able to find it using Google searches.\n\nThe facts as I recall them: A man, in fact a former slave, had been accused and convicted of murder, or perhaps manslaughter, in West Virginia. An appeal was filed on the grounds that the judge who tried the case and imposed sentence had been a Virginia legislator during the Civil War, and had voted for the act of secession and for acts funding the Confederate forces, thereby \"engaging in rebellion\". The appeal claimed that the judge was therefore subject to removal under section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and his sentence was thereby invalid.\n\nShortly after the Civil War (or perhaps in its latter days) the former legislator had been appointed to be a county judge in the newly organized state of West Virginia.\n\nThe court ruled that the section was not self\\-executing, that no process had been brought to remove the judge, and that to collaterally invalidate otherwise valid court judgements would lead to chaos.\n\nThe case occurred after the ratification of the 14th, and before the passage of the Amnesty Act in 1872\\.\nCan anyone provide the name and proper citation for this case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a factually similar impeachment case. But there might be a court case fitting these facts as well.\n\nNo such case is annotated by West under 14th Amendment, Section 3 either with the note or on its list of citations. It is also not mentioned in a law review article looking a WV civil war era jurisprudence up to 1872 when WV's new constitution was adopted.\n\nI suspect that the case you are looking for is a pair of related cases (neither of which involves West Virginia), one tried by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court alone on a habeas corpus petition when riding circuit, and a related decision of the Texas Supreme Court involving the same defendant. *[Griffin's Case](https://cite.case.law/f-cas/11/7/?full_case=true&format=html)*, 11 F. Cas. 7, 2 Am. Law T. Rep. U. S. Cts. 93; 8 Am. Law Reg. N. S. 358; 25 Tex. Supp. 623 ; 2 Balt. Law Trans. 433; 3 Am. Law Rev. 784 (Circuit Court, D. Virginia, May 1, 1869\\) and *[In re Caesar Griffin](https://cite.case.law/supp-tex/25/623/)*, 25 Tex. Supp. 623 (Tex. April 1869\\).\n\nThe official summary of the fact and procedural posture of the main case on point was as follows:\n\n> Caesar Griffin, a negro, was indicted in the county court of\n> Rockbridge county, for an assault with intent to kill. He removed his\n> case as under the law he had the right to do into the circuit court\n> for that county, and was there tried by a jury which found him guilty\n> and assessed his punishment at imprisonment for two years in the\n> penitentiary. He was accordingly sentenced by the court to that\n> imprisonment While on his way thither, in the custody of the sheriff\n> of Rockbridge county, he sent out this writ which was served on the\n> sheriff. That officer produced the petitioner in the district court\n> then in session in Richmond, and made return to the writ that he held\n> him by virtue of the conviction and sentence of the circuit court for\n> Rockbridge county, making the record of the trial and conviction there\n> a a part of his return. This return the petitioner traversed, denying\n> that there was any court or judge in Rockbridge county as pretended by\n> said pretended record, and that the paper exhibited was any record as\n> alleged. The state of Virginia appearing by the attorney\\-general,\n> Mr., Judge H. W. Sheffey, the judge of the circuit court for\n> Rockbridge by Bradley T. Johnson, Esq., and the sheriff by James\n> Neeson, Esq. they joined issue on this traverse. The petitioner then\n> proved that Judge Sheffey had been a member of the house of delegates\n> in 1849\\. That in 1862, he was speaker of the house of delegates, and\n> that his votes were recorded for affording men, money and supplies to\n> support Virginia and the Confederate States, in the war then flagrant\n> with the United States. It was admitted that he was duly appointed on\n> February 22, 1866, by the then government of Virginia, to be judge of\n> the circuit including the county of Rockbridge; that he immediately\n> entered on the duties of that office, and that he has ever since and\n> still is discharging the functions of the same.\n> \n> \n> The cause was argued at great length in the district court, before the\n> district judge in December, 1868, who ordered the discharge of the\n> petitioner, whereupon an appeal was prayed by the sheriff under the\n> habeas corpus act of 1867 \\[14 StaL 385], to the circuit court, and the\n> petitioner admitted to bail. Before the circuit court could meet other\n> writs of habeas corpus were sued out by other parties convicted of\n> felonies, two of them of murder, on the same ground as in this case,\n> and the petitioners were discharged. A motion was then made by James\n> Lyons, Esq. in the supreme court of the United States for a writ of\n> prohibition against the district judge, to restrain him from further\n> exercise of such power. The supreme court advised on the motion, and\n> never announced any conclusion, but shortly afterward the chief\n> justice opened the circuit court at Richmond, and immediately called\n> up the appeal in Griffin\u2019s Case. This statement is necessary for a\n> full understanding of the pregnancy of the chief justice\u2019s statement\n> that the supreme court agreed with him as to the decision he rendered\n> in this case. In consequence of the failure to oust the state officers\n> disfranchised under the fourteenth amendment by these and similar\n> judicial proceedings, congress in February, 1869, passed a joint\n> resolution directing that all such officers should be removed by the\n> military commanders of military districts into which the late\n> Confederate States had been divided. Thus all the old officers of the\n> state government of Virginia were removed except a very few, and new\n> ones appointed not obnoxious to the denunciation of the federal bar \u2014\n> the supreme court of appeals of Virginia; the judges thereof having\n> been removed by the major general commanding, he appointed as judges\n> in their stead, a colonel of his staff, and two others, who had held\n> or did then hold commissions in the United States army. The president\n> judge of the court performed his functions and drew his pay as colonel\n> and judge advocate on the staff, overlooking the execution of the laws\n> of the military, and at the same time those of presiding judicial\n> officer of the state.\n\nThe procedural posture of the case and its result match your description even though the state does not, and there is a supreme court connection even though it is not a U.S. Supreme Court decision.\n\nThe West Virginia association is probably a mental mangling of that case with a somewhat similar case from right time frame, a WV murder conviction overturned due to all white jury requirement by U.S. Supreme Court in *[Strauder v. West Virginia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/100/303/)*, 100 U.S. 303 (1880\\).",

In Griffin's Case, Chief Justice Chase, sitting on circuit, ruled that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment was not self-executing and required a formal process to remove an official. The court held that allowing collateral attacks on judgments based on Section 3 without a formal removal process would lead to chaos in the legal system. This aligns with the description that \"The court ruled that the section was not self-executing, that no process had been brought to remove the judge, and that to collaterally invalidate otherwise valid court judgements would lead to chaos.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the court explicitly ruled against Section 3 being self-executing. Option C is wrong because the Supreme Court did not overturn the conviction; in fact, the case was heard by the Chief Justice on circuit, not by the full Supreme Court. Option D is incorrect because the case occurred before the 1872 Amnesty Act, as stated in the original question."

Mississippi Code Section 97-29-101 deals with the distribution of obscene material, not its mere possession or creation. The U.S. Supreme Court case Miller v.

Options A and D are incorrect because writing erotic fiction itself is not illegal, and the law does not prohibit all forms of erotic fiction. Option B is also incorrect, as mere possession of offensive material does not create civil liability under the described laws."

Which of the following methods is MOST likely to secure copyright ownership for the company?\n\nA) Sending a message in the platform's chat box stating \"This is work for hire\" before the project begins\nB) Verbally agreeing with the designer that the company will own the copyright\nC) Having the designer sign an explicit contract that transfers copyright or grants an exclusive, unlimited license\nD) Waiting until the work is complete and then claiming ownership based on payment\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most reliable method to secure copyright ownership is through an explicit contract (option C). The documentation emphasizes that work-for-hire arrangements must be noted in a contract and don't apply to all types of work. A simple chat message (A) may not be legally sufficient. Verbal agreements (B) are difficult to prove and enforce. Claiming ownership after completion based solely on payment (D) is not legally valid, as copyright initially belongs to the creator unless explicitly transferred. An explicit contract that either transfers copyright or grants an exclusive, unlimited license (depending on jurisdiction) provides the strongest legal protection for the company's ownership of the logo."

Adding watermarks to images containing other companies' logos is illegal for two main reasons:\n\n1. Copyright infringement: Modifying copyrighted material (like logos) without permission or a valid fair use defense is a violation of copyright law.\n\n2. Trademark infringement: Using another company's logo in a way that could confuse consumers about the source or affiliation of goods/services is a trademark violation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the size of the watermark doesn't change the fundamental legal issues.\n\nOption B is wrong because simply adding text or watermarks doesn't create a new, legally distinct artwork that overrides existing copyrights and trademarks.\n\nOption D is incorrect because even with a disclaimer, the use still infringes on both copyright and trademark rights."

The information provided indicates that there is no constitutional requirement for copyright protection in the United States. Congress has the authority to repeal Title 17 of the US Code, which governs copyright law. Additionally, while international agreements like those required for WTO membership do mandate copyright protection, the U.S. could theoretically withdraw from such treaties. However, the answer notes that this is politically unlikely due to the long history of copyright protection in the U.S. and globally.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Constitution allows for copyright protection but does not mandate it. Option B is partially true about international treaties, but it overstates their power \u2013 the U.S. could withdraw from these treaties if it chose to do so. Option C is incorrect as copyright is not a fundamental right that cannot be altered; it is a form of intellectual property protection granted by law and can be changed by legislative action."

The GDPR requires that you have *a* legal basis for processing per Art 6\\. Here, there might be a *legitimate interest* for processing, in particular the legitimate interest of the party planner. Before relying on legitimate interest as a legal basis, you must do a balancing test to ensure that the legitimate interest outweighs the affected rights and freedoms of the data subject. You should also implement safeguards to limit abuse.\n\nHowever, a key GDPR principle (Art 5\\) is transparency. Putting up a privacy policy on your website is not good enough, and Art 14 lists various information that you must provide to the data subject if you didn't obtain their personal data from the data subject themselves. You must provide this information within a reasonable period, but at the latest:\n\n* within one month\n* at the time of the first communication with the data subject\n* when the information is disclosed to a third party\n\nHere, it seems likely that your system would send out invites to all involved persons. In that invite, you should also make the Art 14 information available, in particular the information that the data subject can object (Art 21\\) to further processing: legitimate interest means opt\\-out.\n\nThe point of being a data controller vs a data processor is a good one, but doesn't quite apply here. A data processor is bound by some contract per Art 28, which is common/necessary in a B2B context. You could structure your signup flow so that such a contract is formed with the party planner, and the party planner would then be the sole data controller who would be responsible for selecting a suitable legal basis and providing information to data subjects.\n\nBut don't do that. Such terms would likely run into consumer protection issues and might be unenforceable. Being a processor is also not a get\\-out\\-of\\-jail\\-free card, because you still have substantial compliance obligations towards the controller.\n\nMore reasonably, you and the party planner are *joint controllers* per Art 26\\. The party planner is responsible for legally sharing the data about guests with you and for the processing they do, and you are fully responsible for any data processing or storage you do. This is the model under which consumer\\-facing internet services generally operate.",

The GDPR allows for legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing, which could apply in this case.\n2. The application must provide transparency information to data subjects (guests) as per Article 14 of GDPR.\n3. Guests must be given the opportunity to object to processing (opt-out) when legitimate interest is used as the basis.\n\nOption A is incorrect because explicit consent is not always required under GDPR; other legal bases like legitimate interest can be used.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the application developer is likely to be considered a joint controller with the party planner, not just a processor. Being a processor doesn't exempt the developer from compliance obligations.\n\nOption D is incorrect because merely having a privacy policy on the website is insufficient. The application must actively provide required information to data subjects, especially when their data is collected indirectly."

While there isn't a specific California law mandating the use of \"3 months\" over \"90 days,\" these terms represent different time periods and should be used precisely. \"90 days\" is a fixed number of days, while \"3 months\" can vary slightly depending on which months are involved.

The law in California as it deals with prescriptions ([Controlled Substances Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&division=10.&title=&part=&chapter=4.&article=1.&goUp=Y), or [general pharmacy regulation](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&division=2.&title=&part=&chapter=9.&article=2.)) does not imply a requirement for a \"prescription\". If we switch to \"doctors orders\", then perhaps there is a requirement. This comes up in [this letter](https://www.lsbme.la.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Advisory%20Opinions/Self-Referred%20MRI%20Testing.pdf) ([mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/20170126044242/https://www.lsbme.la.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Advisory%20Opinions/Self-Referred%20MRI%20Testing.pdf)) from the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, who take the position that self\\-referral for MRI is the practice of medicine, which is illegal without a medical license. A radiologists who performs the procedure would exceed the scope of their license. However, there is no specific statute that says \"You must have a doctors orders to perform an MRI\", instead that follows from more general laws. They do point out that MRIs often entail injections which cannot be administered except under a doctor's orders. MRI technology is regulated under Louisiana law (start [here](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2014/code-revisedstatutes/title-37/rs-37-3200/)).\n\nX\\-ray technicians are similarly regulated in [California](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&division=104.&title=&part=1.&chapter=4.&article=5.), but that article does not apply to MRI. You must be licensed to perform an x\\-ray, acting within the scope of that license, and under the supervision of an appropriate licentiate of the healing arts. Bills have been [introduced to widen state control](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1092), to include MRI technology, but this has not yet happened. When a contrast agent is involved, you have to have a doctor's orders.\n\nIn short, it depends primarily on the extent to which MRI is regulated, but also whether an injection is required. There are orthogonal liability issues and regulatory [interactions with Medicare](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/482.26).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal requirements for obtaining an MRI scan?\n\nA) A formal prescription is always legally required to get an MRI scan in all states.\nB) There is no federal law requiring a doctor's order for an MRI, but individual state regulations and facility policies may necessitate one.\nC) MRI scans are completely unregulated, and anyone can obtain one without any medical oversight.\nD) Only licensed medical doctors can legally operate MRI machines in all states.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. There is no federal law explicitly requiring a doctor's order for an MRI, but individual state regulations and facility policies often necessitate one. The situation varies by state and depends on several factors:\n\n1. The term \"prescription\" typically applies to drugs, not medical procedures like MRIs.\n2. Some states, like Louisiana, consider self-referral for MRI to be the practice of medicine, which requires a medical license.\n3. When contrast agents are used in MRIs, a doctor's order is generally required due to the injection involved.\n4. Many facilities and radiologists require a doctor's referral due to liability concerns and best practices.\n5. States like California have considered expanding regulations to include MRI technology, but this isn't universal.\n6. Medicare regulations and other insurance requirements often necessitate a doctor's order for coverage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there isn't a universal legal requirement for a formal prescription in all states. Option C is false because MRIs are regulated to some degree, even if not uniformly across all states. Option D is overly broad and incorrect, as MRI technicians and radiologists, not just licensed medical doctors, can operate MRI machines in many states."

I'd like to read those which were legally uploaded. However I am unsure about how I can determine if the uploaded copy on a webpage is the original, the single reproducible copy or a further\\-copied pirate copy. Do you have any tips? If it's not possible to determine this, would the legally wiser choice be to read the document or to assume that it's an illegal copy?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It does not matter whether the document is authentic, because it is true, by law. Under copyright law, you must have permission of the copyright holder to copy any protected work (original creative work not created as a work of the US, as an example under US law). This is true whether or not the copyright holder tells you that copying requires permission.\n\nA matter for more concern is \"false permission\", where a person without the right to grant permission utters something that the courts would usually interpret as being \"permission\", for example releasing a Harry Potter book under CC\\-0\\. The legal requirement is that you have actual permission, not that a prohibition was not communicated to you.\nIt is in your interest to know whether the actual person making available a work under some license actually has the right to grant a license. But there is no way to know for certain who holds copyright. You can, however, attempt to determine that a work has been registered with the US copyright office, looking [here](https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First). Works are still protected when not registered, so failing to find a copyright registration does not guarantee that the work is \"open access\". It would tell you who the registered copyright holder is.\n\nThere is no \"innocent infringement\" defense, but under [\u00a7504(c)(2\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504), your liability for statutory damages can be reduced to as little as $200, if you can prove that there were no indications that the work is protected.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of using this document?\n\nA) The researcher can freely use the document as long as they include the copyright statement in their work.\n\nB) The researcher must conduct a thorough search to verify if this is the original or a legally reproduced copy before using it.\n\nC) The researcher should assume the document is an illegal copy and avoid using it to be legally safe.\n\nD) The researcher needs permission from the copyright holder to use the document, regardless of how it was obtained or presented online.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because according to copyright law, permission from the copyright holder is required to use any protected work, regardless of how it was obtained or presented online. The statement on the document does not grant permission for further use; it actually prohibits it. The authenticity or legality of the online copy is not relevant to the need for permission. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they either assume permissions that aren't granted, place undue emphasis on verifying the copy's authenticity (which doesn't affect the need for permission), or suggest avoiding the document entirely, which isn't necessarily required if proper permission is obtained."

(There are numerous plot reasons that prevent me placing this action in e.g. the UK where I am *slightly* less ignorant about the law and law enforcement.)\n\nThe question is, given the following circumstances, who can search the dead man's residence, and on what basis?\n\nThe hypothetical situation: a man has died in an incident at work \\- whether it is an accident, homicide, or what we call in the UK manslaughter (which is to say death incidental to other action and without intent...) is unknown at the time law enforcement would like to perform the search (partly in hope of discovering whether a crime has in fact been committed).\n\nThe man is reasonably believed to be in (legitimate) possession information concerning a threat to US National Security. Because of the national security issue, the FBI are involved in a counter\\-intelligence role. The information may be on computers/devices in the man's home.\n\nThere is no evidence per se that the man's death was due to sabotage, but there is prima facie evidence of unauthorised interference with the employer's computer systems, which might have caused the man's death.\n\nI cannot find any basis for a warrantless search of the man's residence based on his death alone (having reviewed various sources including [California Code, Government Code \\- GOV \u00a7 27491\\.3](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-27491-3.html), 4th Amendment and some commentary on related Supreme Court decisions), given that he died at work.\n\nHis sole living relative (daughter) does not reside at the property. She does however have a key and might therefore be considered \"in control\" of it. (But if so, would she have to enter the property first?)\n\n**Questions**: Is a warrant required/advisable to search the man's home, or could the daughter be asked to permit entry? If a warrant is required, who would apply for it? UCSD PD or FBI, and on what basis?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A warrant is required: you cannot just bust into a home because the owner died. Nothing that you describe resembles the kind of emergency situation that allows a warrantless search. In order to get a warrant, you have to have a good enough reason.\n\nSuppose that campus police found a suspicious object at the scene which was evidence of a crime and which had an identifiable connection to his home. Campus police might get a warrant to search the home, to find evidence related to the possiblity that this was a murder. That evidence could be evidence that he had uncovered a terrorist plot to bomb Needles CA, and he was killed because of that. His home computer might contain records of contact between him and the terrorists: so the judge might grant a warrant. The FBI might also go to a federal court for a warrant for a different suspected crime, for example a planned bombing of Needles. Since this involves national security, this could be a [FISA court](https://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/), which is a secret court for surveilling foreign spies in the US.\n\nThe daughter has the (apparent) authority to consent to a search \u2013 police are not required to inquire very deeply into a person's authority to consent to a search. If she doesn't consent, the police of the FBI might have probable cause for a warrant \u2013 it has to be an articulable reason, not just a mystical intuition (TV cop shows notwithstanding) that there *must* have been a crime and the house has evidence of the crime.",

There are no emergency circumstances described that would justify a warrantless search. While the daughter might have apparent authority to consent to a search, this alone is not sufficient given the complexity of the case. The correct procedure would be for either local law enforcement (like UCSD PD) or the FBI to apply for a warrant. They would need to present specific evidence to a judge, such as suspicious objects found at the work site or concrete reasons to believe the home contains evidence related to the death or national security threats. The national security aspect could potentially involve a FISA court, but this would still require a warrant application. Option C correctly summarizes this process, emphasizing the need for a warrant based on specific evidence, regardless of which law enforcement agency is involved."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner, Sarah, hired a contractor, Tom, to renovate her kitchen. The renovation work was completed on March 15th. Tom sent the final invoice on April 1st, which Sarah disputed. They exchanged emails about the invoice until May 10th, with no resolution. On September 20th, Tom threatens to file a lien on Sarah's property for the unpaid amount. According to Washington State lien law, what is the correct assessment of this situation?\n\nA) Tom can still file a lien because the dispute over the invoice extends the 90-day period for filing liens.\nB) Tom cannot file a lien because more than 90 days have passed since the last actual work was performed on the property.\nC) Tom can file a lien within 90 days of the last email communication about the invoice.\nD) Tom can file a lien at any time until the dispute is resolved, regardless of when the work was completed.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Washington State lien law, a contractor must file a lien within 90 days after ceasing to furnish labor, professional services, materials, or equipment. In this case, the actual work was completed on March 15th, which is more than 90 days before September 20th. The subsequent communications about the invoice do not extend the period for filing a lien. The case law cited (Brashear Electric, Inc. v. Norcal Properties, LLC) supports this interpretation, stating that even repairs done later to fix non-conforming work do not \"reset the clock\" for lien filing. Therefore, Tom has lost his right to file a lien due to the passage of more than 90 days since the completion of work."

My understanding is that they/their parent company handle payment processing, escrow, and payout themselves. When people inevitably use it for illegal means, what kind of liability does Venmo face? How do they mitigate this? Does it make a difference that they use a wallet scheme and hold funds in escrow rather than make direct transfers?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Venmo mitigates their liability by making users click through <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_wrap> and accept a 13K\\+ word TOS [https://venmo.com/legal/us\\-user\\-agreement/](https://venmo.com/legal/us-user-agreement/) . This happens when you sign up and enter personal information and back account details and click through the TOS acceptance. (See also LSE Answer [Are terms of service legal contracts?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13549/are-terms-of-service-legal-contracts/13571#13571) )\n\nThat TOS states that Venmo will not assume any liability from individuals due to illegal use of their service. Venmo protects themselves from you \\- and everyone else \\- when you agreed to the TOS.\n\nThe TOS also points out that you agree not to break any laws in the use of their service.\n\n> You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Venmo\n>  Services is in conformance with applicable federal, state and local\n>  laws and regulations.\n\nThe TOS outlines restricted activities and acceptable use, and that Venmo is not liable for illegal things such as:\n\n> 13. Acceptable Use\n> \n> \n> You agree you will not use the Venmo Services to violate any law,\n>  statute, ordinance, or regulation relating to sales of:\n> \n> \n> \u2022counterfeit goods;\n> \n> \n> \u2022narcotics, steroids, certain controlled substances or other products\n>  that present a risk to consumer safety;\n> \n> \n> \u2022drug paraphernalia;\n> \n> \n> \u2022items that encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to\n>  engage in illegal activity;\n> \n> \n> \u2022items that promote hate, violence, racial intolerance, or the\n>  financial exploitation of a crime;\n> \n> \n> \u2022items that are considered obscene;\n> \n> \n> \u2022items that infringe or violate any copyright, trademark, right of\n>  publicity or privacy or any other proprietary right under the laws of\n>  any jurisdiction;\n> \n> \n> \u2022certain sexually oriented materials or services;\n> \n> \n> \u2022ammunition, firearms, or certain firearm parts or accessories; or\n> \n> \n> \u2022certain weapons or knives regulated under applicable law;\n\nYou may be liable for such illegal things, if you do them, and Venmo discovers it; but Venmo will not be liable. Venmo may not be aware of your activities, but they can say they won't be liable if/when law enforcement takes action against you. When authorities deal with individuals conducting transactions deemed illegal in the TOS, Venmo can say, in a legal sense, \"Hey, they agreed to not do anything illegal and that we wouldn't be liable anyway.\"\n\n**Edit 11/11/16** see comments: \"Venmo cannot escape criminal liability for their own acts or omissions (in some jurisdictions).\"\n\nI'm sure Venmo monitors their systems in some ways to detect fraud and illegal transactions \\- perhaps with algorithms and keyword searches (see [https://venmo.com/legal/us\\-privacy\\-policy/](https://venmo.com/legal/us-privacy-policy/) ) \\- and they would be required to cooperate with law enforcement under the terms of the state and federal laws that regulate the banking industry and services such as Venmo. See [https://venmo.com/legal/us\\-licenses/](https://venmo.com/legal/us-licenses/) And if the authorities discovered Venmo's efforts at fraud and detection of illegal activity were not adequate, they would legally require Venmo to make changes.\n\n**The escrow system** is a Venmo feature that can make users feel more secure with a transaction, knowing that a refund or a cancellation of the transaction may be easier with an escrow system rather than trying to get a payment service to \"claw back\" funds from another user. Venmo \"may hold your funds for up to 180 days if reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability.\"\n\nThe escrow service could be used to mitigate illegal activity, but it may fall to the end user who discovers they have been a victim of fraud or illegal activities and can report it while funds are still in escrow.\n\nNow, the escrow system requires more \"back and forth\" between users, i.e time to process and release funds; this, combined with the fact that Venmo monitors transactions, may give Venmo more time to analyze transactions and detect fraud and illegal transactions before they are completed.\n\n**PayPal:** Venmo is a PayPal company (clearly stated in the footer of the site) and PayPal has their own click\\-through TOS which outlines account requirements and illegal activities: \n\n> Venmo is a service of PayPal, Inc., a licensed provider of money\n>  transfer services (NMLS ID: 910457\\).

This TOS, which is over 13,000 words long, explicitly states that Venmo will not assume liability for illegal use of their service and that users agree not to break any laws while using the platform. The TOS also outlines specific restricted activities and acceptable use policies. While Venmo likely does monitor transactions to some degree and may have other measures in place, the primary method of liability mitigation mentioned in the passage is the TOS agreement. Options A, C, and D are not supported by the information provided and misrepresent Venmo's approach to liability mitigation."

Could a restaurant refuse to serve unvaccinated individuals, even including those with sincere religiously\\-founded anti\\-vax beliefs? What about if this mandate is just company policy, not legally required?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Do vaccine mandates amount to religious discrimination?\n\nThe term \"vaccine mandate\" is not sufficiently clear to tell, in a vacuum. Is it a mandate to get a vaccine? A mandate not to serve an unvaccinated individual in a public place? A mandate to vaccinate children that attend public schools? A mandate to serve unvaccinated individuals at public accommodations? Or what?\n\nThe details of the mandate, how it was enacted, and the circumstances under which it is being challenged, are all critical to determining its legal validity.\n\nAs noted in the linked answer (text reordered for clarity):\n\n> Under the US Constitution, a public health authority could even make\n> vaccination mandatory, and this was done in some historical epidemics.\n> \n> \n> In *Jacobson v. Massachusetts*, 197 U.S. 11 (1905\\), the US Supreme\n> court held such mandatory vaccinations to be constitutional. . . . In\n> *Zucht v. King*, 260 U.S. 174 (1922\\) the US Supreme Court upheld as constitutional a public school district's exclusion of unvaccinated\n> students. . . . *In Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur v.\n> Louisiana Board of Health*, 186 U.S. 380 (1902\\) the US Supreme Court\n> upheld as constitutional an involuntary quarantine law.\n\nLikewise, facially neutral health and safety regulations of businesses are generally valid even if they disproportionately impact members of a religion, under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (and as it is applies to state and local governments under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution).\n\nThe [Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993](https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1308) tips the balance somewhat to make accommodations in some circumstances to facially neutral laws that disproportionately impact the free exercise of religion, but still does not prohibit facially neutral laws that serve a compelling public purpose from burdening the free exercise of religion. The core language of that Act which sets forth the substantive standard in those cases states that:\n\n> SEC. 3\\. FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION PROTECTED.\n> \n> \n> (a) IN GENERAL.\u2014Government shall not substantially burden a person's\n> exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general\n> applicability, except as provided in subsection (b).\n> \n> \n> (b) EXCEPTION.\u2014Government may substantially burden a person's exercise\n> of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to\n> the person\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest;\n> \n> \n> and\n> \n> \n> (2\\) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\n> governmental interest.\n> \n> \n> (c) JUDICIAL RELIEF.\u2014 A person whose religious exercise has been\n> burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a\n> claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate\n> relief against a government. Standing to assert a claim or defense\n> under this section shall be governed by the general rules of standing\n> under article III of the Constitution.\n\nThe standards referenced in the act tap into well established case law that was previously applied less broadly than under the Act, when the U.S. Constitution alone, unaided by the Act, was implicated.\n\n> Could a restaurant refuse to serve unvaccinated individuals, even\n> including those with sincere religiously\\-founded anti\\-vax beliefs?\n\nYes.\n\nUsually, businesses can establish facially neutral rules even if they have a disparate religious impact. Generally, private businesses do not have an affirmative duty to serve anyone.\n\nCertainly, it could do so as a matter of company policy, if the law did not forbid discrimination specifically on vaccination status (which it currently does not in most or all places in the U.S., although there may be recent legislation on this of which I am not aware).\n\nFor example, it is legal to operate a restaurant that only serves bacon cheeseburgers and operates 7 days a week, all year long, without holidays (in many places that lack blue laws for restaurants), even though this effectively denies service to strictly observant Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and (on Fridays during Lent) to observant Catholics, and could make it an uncomfortable place for such workers to work.\n\nThe harder question is whether the restaurant could serve an unvaxxed individual when the business and the customer both want to do so, and both have sincere religious beliefs that cause them to feel that they must do so (the business owner might have sincere beliefs about serving everything, the customer might have sincere beliefs about being unvaxxed for religious reasons).\n\nEven then, when religious people aren't singled out for being religious, this requirement might be upheld if there was no alternative that meets the public health goals of the requirement, although the case that there could be some alternative that is less restrictive might be pretty good.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A restaurant implements a policy refusing service to unvaccinated individuals, citing public health concerns. An unvaccinated customer claims this policy discriminates against their sincere religious beliefs opposing vaccination. Under current U.S. law, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The restaurant's policy is illegal as it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.\n\nB) The customer can successfully sue the restaurant for religious discrimination under the First Amendment.\n\nC) The restaurant can legally enforce this policy, even if it disproportionately affects those with religious objections to vaccines.\n\nD) The restaurant must provide a religious exemption to their policy for customers with sincere religious beliefs against vaccination.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Private businesses generally have the right to implement facially neutral policies, even if they disproportionately impact individuals with certain religious beliefs. The restaurant's policy of not serving unvaccinated individuals applies to all customers regardless of their reasons for being unvaccinated, making it a neutral policy. While it may have a greater impact on those with religious objections to vaccines, this alone does not make the policy illegal.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Religious Freedom Restoration Act primarily applies to government actions, not private businesses. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the First Amendment's protections against religious discrimination generally apply to government actions, not private businesses. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because private businesses are not typically required to provide religious exemptions to neutral policies, especially when there are compelling public health reasons for the policy.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the interplay between public health policies, religious freedom, and the rights of private businesses in the United States legal context."

The 270-day rule applies to those married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen, but over a 3-year period, not 5 years.

You would need to get permission to use that trademark.\n\nThe artwork of the game is copyrighted and cannot be duplicated without violating that copyright.\n\nIn general, the labels meaning phrases like \"Go to Jail\" and \"New York Avenue\" are probably copyrighted and some court decisions have decided that labels are a copyrightable element. However, there is some gray area.\n\nThe game mechanics are not copyrightable and can be duplicated.\n\nWhat this means is that if you clone the game and use new labels (like new property names and card titles) then you are probably fine. You would have to make a novel board design.\n\nIf you clone the game, but use the game's labels, then you could potentially lose in court.\n\nOf course, remember that corporations will sometimes sue just to intimidate people, even if they have a losing case. Just because your clone is non\\-infringing doesn't mean they won't sue you.\n\nIt costs them money to sue people, so if your clone is obscure or not used by many people it could fly under the radar and be ignored by the company. If your clone was a success and became widely used, that would significantly increase the chance you could get sued.\n\nIn most cases a company will threaten infringers before they sue them, because it is a lot cheaper to threaten somebody than sue them. Therefore, you could make your clone and just plan on discontinuing it if they threaten you. Of course, there is a small risk they would sue you anyway. If you made no money then you are probably safe because it would be a lot harder for them to argue that you commercially damaged them if you made no money.",

The practice of tying parking space rental to content insurance, while unusual, falls within the realm of legal business practices. The answer also notes that antitrust violations are unlikely in this scenario, as neither the parking lot operation business nor the car insurance business are highly consolidated. Option A is incorrect because there's no law prohibiting this type of bundling. Option B is incorrect because antitrust issues are unlikely given the market conditions.

They kind of have to sign it, or they're hosed.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. What does this language protect the company against?\n2. What employee rights does this forfeit if the employee signs?\n\nThat is, what purpose does this language serve?\n\nThe reason I am wondering is: There are many contracts *without* this language, are those contracts therefore not protected against claims that signing them was forced? For the implication that \"if you don't like it don't sign it\", isn't that true of any contract even without this sentence? If the company didn't put this language in, it seems like it would be similar to any other typical contract that also does not have this language, so if it was a generally required protection I would expect to see it all the time. What could make this agreement different as to require that statement?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"Severance Agreement\" is a contract between the company and you. It spells out what the company will do and probably what they expect you to do going forward.\n\nSimple enough.\n\nThe statement you referenced merely says that you are not being forced to sign the agreement. That's all.\n\nYou don't, presumably, have the option of remaining employed at this company but you DO NOT have to sign this agreement. But if you don't, it's likely that any benefits being promised in the agreement will not be delivered to you.\n\nSo specifically in answer to your questions:\n\n1. It protects them against a claim that they somehow forced you to sign the agreement.\n2. Likely anything that the agreement says the company will do such as pay you a certain amount of money and the like.\n\nBottom line is that if you don't like the agreement, don't sign it. If you want the benefits they are promising in the agreement, then sign it and move on.",

While the employee may feel economic pressure to sign in order to receive severance benefits, legally this is not considered coercion. The statement reinforces that the employee had a choice to sign or not sign, even if refusing meant forfeiting benefits. This language helps establish that the contract was entered into voluntarily, which is important for its enforceability. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they misinterpret the legal significance of the statement. The statement doesn't nullify the agreement under duress (B), it's not legally meaningless (C), and it doesn't require additional compensation (D).

The wall has \"battlements\" (rocks extending periodically from the top), but is very low if approached from above, along the grass areas. A reckless person could potentially fall to the road from the top; however:\n\n**(a)** there are no paths leading through these grass areas towards the wall\\-drops\n\n**(b)** these grass areas are out\\-of\\-the\\-way: the designated paths pass down handrailed stairs, next to the wall\\-drops, or across them at a distance of about 5m from the top of the wall\\-drops\n\n**(c)** there have been no accidents, RIDDOR reports, etc. in the 17 years the property has existed in its present form related to these wall\\-drops\n\n**(d)** the grass areas are intended as decorative areas, not for traversal\n\n**(e)** there are neighbouring children who pass by occasionally\n\n**Situation:** There are two of these wall\\-drops. A recent ill\\-advised management decision removed bushes which were near these wall\\-drops. These bushes prevented access to one of the wall drops; the other was unguarded. Now the management is considering placing railings, at considerable expense, along the tops of the walls and around the grass areas because of \"health and safety\". Are such railings a legal obligation? Is anything required, or would \"Keep off the grass\" signage be sufficient? Would bushes identical to what was there before (blocking access to one wall\\-drop only) be sufficient?\n\n**Other research:** My own research has uncovered two similar case studies on the HSE webpage, under the mythbusting section:\n\n**(a)** [A 25\\-year\\-old pond (comparable age) did not need railings](http://www.hse.gov.uk/myth/myth-busting/2014/case333-managing-agent-says-garden-pond-to-be-fenced-in.htm)\n\n**(b)** [A very similar situation had railings as a \"sensible approach\" but recommended further discussion to find alternatives](http://www.hse.gov.uk/myth/myth-busting/2015/case345-barrier-on-sloping-grass-bank.htm)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The relevant [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupiers%27_Liability_Act_1957) is the Occupiers Liability Act \\- unless you are employing people (which may be the case if you are contracting work e.g. the gardening) \"health and safety\" law is not applicable.\n\n> \\[T]he occupier extend a \"common duty of care\" to all lawful visitors, although it keeps the low duty of care towards unlawful visitors such as trespassers. This duty is described as \"a duty to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there\".\n\nYou have foreseen a risk that someone could fall off the edge of a lawn where a lawful visitor is not prevented from going. You need to take reasonable precautions to mitigate that risk. A fence seems reasonable to me.",

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects their legal obligations under the Occupiers Liability Act?\n\nA) The company has no legal obligation to install railings as long as they put up \"Keep off the grass\" signs.\n\nB) The company is only required to install railings if there have been previous accidents or RIDDOR reports related to the wall-drop.\n\nC) The company must install railings immediately to comply with health and safety regulations, regardless of cost.\n\nD) The company should take reasonable precautions to mitigate the foreseeable risk, which may include installing railings or other suitable barriers.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The Occupiers Liability Act requires property occupiers to take reasonable care to ensure lawful visitors are safe. In this case, the company has identified a potential risk (the wall-drop) and needs to take reasonable precautions to mitigate it. While railings are a sensible approach, the law doesn't specifically mandate them. The correct answer allows for other potential solutions while emphasizing the need for reasonable precautions. Options A and B underestimate the company's duty of care, while C overstates the specific requirements of the law."

I've asked four times there for a link to the (official) Spanish ruling, but no luck.\n\nI find searching for Spanish law on the [BOE site](https://boe.es/index.php) difficult.

It was based on the Moscow consulate\u2019s *suspicion* that the applicants\u2019 income claims were false and therefore they might be tempted to work in Spain. Nevertheless, the dicta in the paragraph cited is pretty clear that \u201cla legislaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola, \u2026, no es que el solicitante de este tipo de visados no realice trabajo alguno, sino que no lo realice en Espa\u00f1a.\u201d\n\nThe design of [CENDOJ](http://www.poderjudicial.es/search/indexAN.jsp) uses Javascript to serves the rulings in PDF, and so I am not able to provide a direct URI.

The court ruling (RoJ: STS 1859/2012) includes language suggesting that Spanish legislation does not prohibit non-lucrative visa holders from working, as long as the work is not performed in Spain. Specifically, the ruling states \"la legislaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola, \u2026, no es que el solicitante de este tipo de visados no realice trabajo alguno, sino que no lo realice en Espa\u00f1a,\" which translates to \"Spanish legislation... does not require that the applicant for this type of visa not perform any work, but rather that they do not perform it in Spain.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the ruling does not explicitly prohibit all forms of work. Option B is too broad, as the ruling does not explicitly allow remote work without restrictions. Option D is incorrect because, while the case originated from suspicions about false income claims, the ruling's language does address the broader issue of work for non-lucrative visa holders.\n\nIt's important to note that despite this ruling, many Spanish consulates have continued to deny non-lucrative visas to applicants intending to work remotely, and the government has since created a new visa type specifically for remote workers."

Calling a staff member \"selfish\" because they are Jewish \\= harassment; calling a staff member \"selfish\" because you don't like their shoes \\= not harassment.\n\nIs it true? Where I can find a complete list that includes all the possible words?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is it true?\n\nNo, that is inaccurate. References to *protected categories* are not a requisite element of *harassment*.\n\nTypically *harassment* is defined as a pattern of conduct (thus encompassing two or more acts) consisting of unconsented contact that would cause a reasonable person to be frightened, annoyed, distressed, molested, and/or experience other unpleasant emotions. See, for instance, the definition of harassment in Michigan legislation, [MCL 750\\.411h(1\\)(c)](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(c52sqae3mdxfxetiqb4gkkmv))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-750-411h).\n\nThe notion of harassment can \\-\\-but does not necessarily\\-\\- involve targeting or attacking of one or multiple *protected categories* in which the victim belongs. For instance, sexual harassment is understood as harassment with purposes of mocking the victim's sexual orientation, or procuring sexual gratification from/with that person. The adjective \"*sexual*\" merely qualifies the context of the troubling pattern of conduct, but that term in and of itself is not what imports the character of harassment.\n\nThe examples in the paragraph you quote are inaccurate and/or inconclusive because they would highly depend on the context. The adjective \"*selfish*\" is not sufficiently related to Judaism, whence it would be unreasonable for a Jew to allege *religious harassment* merely because somebody called him \"selfish\". Instead, a finding of religious harassment would involve repulsive allusions to themes or elements to which Jews would be sensitive based on historical grounds (such as nazism, and antisemitism), doctrinary grounds (jokes about pigs), and so forth.\n\n> Where I can find a complete list that includes all the possible words?\n\nFor the reasons explained above, there is no such list. Words would have to be assessed in light of the context in which the course of conduct takes place.\n\nFurthermore, not all harassment involves words. Harassment, regardless of its type, can be in the form of drawings, gestures, physical contact (such as sexually molesting a person), voiceless phone calls, and following a person, to name just a few methods.",

The documentation clarifies that harassment is typically defined as a pattern of unconsented conduct that would cause a reasonable person to experience negative emotions such as fear, annoyance, or distress. This definition does not require the behavior to target protected characteristics, although it can involve them.\n\nOption A is incorrect because harassment can take many forms beyond verbal communication, including gestures, drawings, physical contact, or following a person.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the documentation explicitly states that references to protected categories are not a requisite element of harassment, although they can be involved.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no comprehensive list of words that automatically constitute harassment.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In *Property*, fifth edition, by Dukeminier and Krier, on pages 843\u201354, we are told that in Vermont, railroad companies have the power of eminent domain: they can take land that they need for building tracks. What they take is an easement, but it seems just barely short of fee simple: the land reverts to the permanent owner or successor only if the railroad stops running trains along the track and thereby abandons the easement, but until then it seems to be entirely theirs. Railroads seem to continue operating on a particular track for well over a century sometimes.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* In which states in the U.S. do railroads have this power?\n* Might that be the reason why many railroad rights\\-of\\-way are held in easement rather than in fee simple?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL; DNR: \n\n1\\) It is not clear which states gave railroads the power to seize property. It is clear that eminent domain has been used to take land for railroads in every state. However, not every railroad had the power to take land; some governments took the property and then gave it to the railroad. \n\n2\\) No, railroads didn\u2019t have to use easements because they got to use eminent domain. Railroads had to use easements for the same reason they got to use eminent domain \u2013 they were using their property to serve the \u201cpublic interest\u201d. As a result, they got various subsidies and special deals. In return, they were subject to heightened government control. That control included not always having fee simple ownership of their land. \n\nHere are some details: \n\n1\\) Like many private businesses \u2013 from grain mills to canals to shopping malls and hotels \u2013 railroads got some of their land via eminent domain. Who could take the land, and under what conditions and restrictions, varied from state to state (and over time). \n\nUnfortunately, as far as I know, there is no list online telling which states gave which powers to railroads. There may be such a list in one of the treatises on eminent domain, such as Nichols' \"The Law of Eminent Domain,\" or on railroad law. (By their nature, treatises are exhaustive.) \n\nHowever, there is enough information online that you could make a fairly complete list in a few hours; my search for railroad\\+eminent\\+domain\\+(state name) got plenty of hits for every state I tried, including Hawai'i. \n\nRecent changes to state laws show how much state laws vary. In response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kelo v. City of New London, many states made it harder to use eminent domain for development projects. Some of states (South Dakota) explicitly target railroads, while others (Vermont) explicitly exempt railroads. \n\n2\\) It\u2019s an oversimplification to say railroads either: a) own their land outright (ie, fee simple); or, b) have an easement. Railroads use other forms of property, including fee\\-simple with conditions and licenses. What these forms of property share is reduced railroad control over its property. As mentioned above, the reason is simple. To encourage railroads to serve the public, they got subsidies. In return, their rights over their property was attenuated. Thus, railroads couldn't set rates at will. One of the valuable rights they gave up was the right to sell the property once they were no longer using it for railroading.\n\n3\\) The issues of eminent domain and ownership of railroad rights of way are not merely of academic interest. For example, many people today are interested in what to do with abandoned rail rights of way. Who gets the land, under what conditions, and at what price? Can the land be sold outright, \u201crailbanked,\u201d (using it in ways that allow an easy conversion back to rail in the future), turned into trails, utility rights of way, and so on. Not surprisingly, advocates for each of these uses argues that their use is most consistent with existing rights. \n\nThe growing interest in high speed rail raises again the issue of how to get the land for rail projects. \n\nIf you want to know more, there is a nice short summary of the history of railroad rights to rights of way in this [article](https://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/39-3-07_Wright.pdf) from the Vermont Law Review. Her footnotes have lots of good references.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between railroad companies' power of eminent domain and their property rights in the United States?\n\nA) Railroad companies in all states have always had unlimited power of eminent domain and exclusively own their land in fee simple.\n\nB) The power of eminent domain for railroads and their property rights varied by state, with many railroads holding easements or other limited forms of ownership as a trade-off for public subsidies and serving the public interest.\n\nC) Railroads never had the power of eminent domain; all land for railroad tracks was seized by the government and then gifted to the companies.\n\nD) Railroad companies universally hold their land through easements, which automatically revert to the original owners if train service stops for any length of time.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately reflects the complexity and variability of railroad property rights and eminent domain powers across different states. The document indicates that railroad companies' ability to use eminent domain varied by state and over time. Additionally, railroads often held their land through easements or other limited forms of ownership, not always fee simple, as a result of the public interest nature of their service and the subsidies they received. This arrangement allowed for greater government control and restrictions on how railroads could use or dispose of their property. Options A and C are incorrect because they present extreme, universalized statements that don't match the nuanced reality described in the text. Option D is too specific and doesn't account for the variety of property arrangements mentioned in the document."

Whatever the OiC supposedly contravenes plays no role in that analysis (including your suggestion of \"common law constitutional right,\" assuming that even has a well\\-defined meaning in UK law). This is because the UK has a strong tradition of [Parliamentary supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty_in_the_United_Kingdom) and courts are not allowed to quash primary legislation of the Parliament.\n\nWhat's unusual here is that Parliament specifically decided to elevate OiCs to the status of primary legislation with respect to the Human Rights Act 1998\\.

It was a very basic course and in order to make the topic digestible more easily for us students, the lecturer was providing some anecdotes. As the course was provided by an Austrian university, some of the examples referred to the Habsburgans and the Austro\\-Hungarian Empire. \n\nThe lecturer told us that before a law could pass, a member of the common people had to read the law text and explain it in his own words. Only if that was possible and purpose of the law could be reflected, a law could become active and valid.\n\nThe idea behind this was to ensure that the population, which received only basic education back in the days of Maria Theresa, could understand the meaning and implications of the law. This person had a specific name, if I remember correctly, it was Hungarian for \"simple person\" or even \"stupid person\". Does anyone know the term for this person?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the United States, we use the phrase \"[Reasonable Person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person)\" which is not to say an average person or a simple man, but an individual who understands the limitations of the situation and would act in accordance with that knowledge. For example, if a doctor improperly rendered help a patient, his actions would be evaluated based on reasonable knowledge of people with his medical knowledge, where as a person practicing medicine without a license would be subjected to a more common\\-man standard.\n\nThe phrase person is therefor substituted for a reasonable individual and thus, a \"Reasonable Landlord/Renter\" could exist in housing cases, or a \"Reasonable Doctor\" in medical torts or \"a Reasonable Woman\" in sexual assault cases, so the \"Reasonable Person\" is often used to allow the jury to put themselves in the shoes of the witnesses and the accused and see how they would react (Historically, the term was called a \"Reasonable Man\" though \"Reasonable Person\" was used to make the term more neutral to what the definition of \"Man\" was (A human male or a member of the Human Species, regardless of gender).",

This term is widely used in legal contexts, particularly in the United States, to describe a hypothetical individual who would act with ordinary prudence in a given situation. It's not necessarily an average person or a simple individual, but rather someone who understands the situation's limitations and would act accordingly.\n\nThe \"Reasonable Person\" standard is flexible and can be adapted to specific situations, such as a \"Reasonable Doctor\" in medical cases or a \"Reasonable Landlord\" in housing disputes. This concept allows juries to put themselves in the position of witnesses or the accused to evaluate how a prudent person would act under similar circumstances.\n\nOption A (Simple Person) is incorrect, as it doesn't capture the nuanced legal meaning. While it might be similar to the Hungarian term mentioned in the original question, it's not the standard legal term used in most jurisdictions.\n\nOption C (Common Man) is close but not precise enough. The legal standard isn't about being common, but about being reasonable and prudent.\n\nOption D (Average Individual) is also incorrect because the \"Reasonable Person\" isn't necessarily average, but rather someone who exercises appropriate care and judgment for the situation."

Since I have no direct connection to anyone in the legal field, I thought I would ask some knowledgeable users about something that's always had me wondering. (Just saw the film again tonight.)\n\nI am aware that an acquittal means one can not be tried for the same crime again (double jeopardy). But a dismissal *may not* provide such protection. Acquittal meaning the prosecution could **not prove** the defendant committed the crime, whereas dismissal *may* allow for retrial.\n\nSo, is there a *legal* basis for Trotter dismissing a case merely because he'll clearly lose? Common sense leans towards thinking this may be \"Hollywood fluff\" and it could not *actually* happen at the final stages of a trial so close to jury deliberation. But.. again, I don't *really* know.\n\nI *think* this is fluff because if it were *actually* possible, why wouldn't *all* prosecutors merely drop charges if they fear they are going to lose, then go build a better case and retry the defendant.\n\nAre the requirement for an actual dismissal more stringent than the film would have the audience believe or in this aspect, is the film pretty close to reality?\n\n(I am referencing U.S. criminal law in general)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is entirely possible in a number of different motions that could have been made. At this point, Vinny had destroyed the Prosecutor's eyewitnesses by showing they had issues that called their testimony into question (The first has a timeline that doesn't line up with events, the second has poor vision and her prescription glasses were not doing their job, and the third had many obstructions blocking his view of the scene). His first witness tears apart the \"expert\" witness, who was only there to testify that the tires were the same brand (albeit, a popular brand at the time... loads of cars had the same tires).\n\nWhile it might go by a different name in different jurisdictions, the Prosecutor is allowed to make a motion to dismiss at any point prior to the jury goes to deliberation (as is the Defense; Also they might be able to make motions while the jury is in deliberations).\n\nIf properly titled, the Prosecutor should have made a \"motion for *nolle prosequi*\" (not prosecuting). This can mean any number of things including the prosecutor no longer believes the evidence can prove the charges OR even that the prosecutor is no longer convinced that those charged committed the crime.\n\nIn the \"My Cousin Vinny\" case, as the jury was seated the case cannot be retried by the State of Alabama at this point.\n\nThis is possible because the Prosecutor's duty is to uncover the truth behind a crime, no matter what that truth becomes. In this case, despite his previous beliefs, the prosecutor in My Cousin Vinny, upon realizing he was wrong, admitted it and dropped the charges. Given his backstory of having worked as a defense attorney and making the switch after getting a client off some serious charges (and knowing the client was guilty) shows that he was inherently an honest man and dedicated to finding the truth of the matter (as a government employee, he undoubtedly took a pay cut when he switched to prosecution. Private industry almost always pays way more than a government equivalent). With that in mind, it is expected of prosecutors to be perfectly honest with what evidence they have and make the choices in the case based on that evidence. This comes up in another scene when Mona Lisa Vito explains to Vinny that the prosecutor was required to give Vinny all the files he had on the case... because Vinny, by representing the Defendant, is allowed to examine all evidence against his clients. The only dirty trick he pulled was the stunt where his expert witness was not disclosed and while bad, really it's the judge allowing the witness to testify that would have caused a problem with the trial (his response to Vinny's objection could have created a mistrial on appeal).\n\nTo give a real world example, I was charged with driving on a suspended license which I had no idea I was doing at the time. As it turned out, the license was suspended for an unpaid traffic ticket that I had paid in the last minute... essentially the DMV forgot to unsuspend. A quick call fixed that issue but I still had to go to court over the charge. The day of the trial, I show up in the court room and the prosecutor walks over and tells me that they were going to enter a motion of \"*nolle prosequi*\" for the charge... essentially dropping it... because the matter was a clerical error on the state's part and not anything I did wrong.\n\nEdit: Additionally had the prosecutor not motioned to dismiss, Vinny certainly could have. In fact there are two points during the trial where Defense attorneys are expected to make these motions. The first is when the Prosecution rests their case. The second is before the jury is given the case to deliberate.\n\nAs for why it was called a motion to dismiss in the film, it's likely to due with the fact that the audience would not know what a \"motion for *nolle prosecui*\" and it is a type of motion to dismiss.",

As explained in the documentation, prosecutors can indeed move to dismiss charges at any point before the jury begins deliberations. This is often called a motion for \"nolle prosequi,\" which means \"not prosecuting.\" It can be done for various reasons, including when the prosecutor believes the evidence is insufficient to prove the charges or is no longer convinced of the defendant's guilt. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the scenario is not purely fictional and can happen in real courtrooms. \n\nOption B is wrong because prosecutors are not limited to dismissing charges only before the trial begins. \n\nOption D is incorrect because in this case, as the jury was already seated, the state could not retry the defendants on the same charges due to double jeopardy protections.\n\nThis question tests understanding of prosecutorial discretion, legal procedures during a trial, and the concept of double jeopardy in the U.S. legal system."

The attack targets a server in Australia, and the perpetrator is a citizen of Canada. Which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding jurisdiction in this case?\n\nA) Only Russia has jurisdiction because the crime occurred in its airspace.\nB) The United States and Japan have exclusive jurisdiction as the origin and destination countries.\nC) Australia has sole jurisdiction as the location of the targeted server.\nD) Multiple countries, including but not limited to the US, Japan, Russia, Australia, and Canada, may claim jurisdiction.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. In complex international cybercrime cases like this, multiple countries can claim jurisdiction based on various factors. The United States (departure country), Japan (arrival country), Russia (airspace where the crime occurred), Australia (location of the targeted server), and Canada (perpetrator's citizenship) all have potential grounds for jurisdiction. Additionally, the country where the aircraft is registered could also claim jurisdiction. It's important to note that jurisdiction in such cases is not exclusive to one country, and several nations may have valid legal claims to prosecute the crime."

If this is true, what are some examples? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, and sometimes it even makes perfect sense that such an activity would be a crime.\n\nFor many crimes, attempting the crime is a crime. The attempt may have no actual effect on any person or property, but is still illegal.\n\nAccording to [16 U.S. Code \u00a7 1538](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1538)(a)(1\\)(C) it is illegal to kill an endangered species on the high seas. A whale in international waters cannot really be considered anyone's \"property\" (and since it's in international waters there can't even be some weird theory of it being the government's property) but it is still illegal.\n\n[18 U.S. Code \u00a7 700](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/700) purports to prohibit the desecration of a flag, although this was found unconstitutional.\n\n[18 U.S. Code \u00a7 708](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/708) makes it a crime to commercially use the coat of arms of the Swiss Confederation, for some reason. And [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 711a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/711a) makes it a crime to use the slogan \"Give a Hoot, Don\u2019t Pollute\" for profit, except as authorized. (But maybe that sort of thing counts as intellectual property.)\n\n[18 U.S. Code \u00a7 342](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/342) makes it a crime to operate a passenger train under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This really only affects people and property if the train is driven improperly as a result; if you make it safely, you'd probably never even know. But the driver would still be facing up to 15 years in prison if he was caught doing that.\n\nAnd finally, according to [A Crime a Day](https://twitter.com/CrimeADay/status/951268565998559234) on Twitter:\n\n> 33 USC \u00a71232(b), 33 CFR \u00a7401\\.101 \\& \u00a7401\\.94(a) make it a federal crime to violate the St. Lawrence Seaway regulations by not having a copy of the St. Lawrence Seaway regulations while you pass through the St. Lawrence Seaway.",

According to 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 342, operating a passenger train under the influence of alcohol is a crime, even if no accident occurs and the journey is completed safely. This scenario demonstrates how the act itself is criminal, regardless of its immediate consequences.\n\nOption A is incorrect because attempted theft, while a crime, does have an intended immediate effect on another person's property.\n\nOption C, while illegal, involves unauthorized use of intellectual property, which could be argued to have an immediate effect on the rightful owner of the slogan.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it involves killing an endangered species, which has an immediate effect on the animal and potentially the ecosystem, even if it occurs on private property."

Twitter, like most businesses, is entitled to retain copies of communications for legitimate purposes. The ability to delete would depend on whether the exchange is part of records required by law to be retained, which is unusual.

Are there any examples of a judge ignoring precedent without setting new precedent, or is that paradoxical?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Precedent in common law is based on a hierarchy of courts. [This](https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/court-structure/) is the hierarchy in the UK: as they say, it's complicated because it represents 1,000\\+ years of organic growth rather than a system that was planned.\n\nPrecedent is binding on courts lower in the hierarchy than the one who set the precedent. If a judge ignores a precedent (that was argued by one side or the other1) then the decision is **wrong** and would be overturned on appeal.\n\nPrecedent at the same level and in parallel jurisdictions is *persuasive*, if a judge ignores it they better have good reason for doing so (and put those reasons in the judgement) or they will probably have their decision overturned on appeal. A parallel jurisdiction is a common law jurisdiction in another country like Australia, Canada or (rarely) the USA. It is quite common for parliament when drafting new laws to look at similar laws in other jurisdictions as a starting point. When cases are brought under such new legislation it is right that precedent set on similar law in other jurisdictions serves as the starting point for case law in the U.K.\n\nPrecedent turns on the law and the facts involved. If parliament changes the law then many precedents may be invalidated. Similarly, the facts of cases are never exactly the same, argument in court is often not about the facts \\- these may be agreed \\- but about why these facts are the same/different so that this precedent should/should not apply.\n\nIncidentally, precedent is one of the main differences between common law (English) and civil law (European) legal systems: common law has it, civil law doesn't.\n\n1. A judge must decide the case that is argued before them, deciding on a basis that the parties didn't argue is a breach of natural justice: if both sides fail to raise an applicable precedent then it is not something the judge should consider. A judge who is aware of a precedent that neither side has raised it should draw it to their attention so they *can* argue it.",

According to the documentation, precedent is binding on lower courts. However, the facts of cases are never exactly the same. If a judge believes that the facts of the current case are significantly different from the precedent, they should explain their reasoning in the judgment. This allows for the possibility that the decision might be reviewed on appeal, where the higher court can determine if the judge's reasoning for not applying the precedent was justified.\n\nOption A is incorrect because ignoring precedent without explanation would likely lead to the decision being overturned on appeal. Option B is too rigid, as it doesn't account for the possibility of significant differences in facts. Option D is unnecessary, as lower court judges can distinguish cases from precedents when appropriate, provided they explain their reasoning."

Yes. Unintended? Not so much.\n------------------------------------------\n\n[Source](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UTSLawRw/1999/20.html)\n\n**Sources of Parliamentary Privilege**\n\nIn [new\\-south\\-wales](/questions/tagged/new-south-wales \"show questions tagged 'new-south-wales'\"), Parliamentary Privilege derives from Article 9 of the *Bill of Rights 1688* (no, 1688 is *not* a mistake) which provides:\n\n> ... the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.\n\n**What are \"proceedings in Parliament\"?**\n\n\"\\[P]roceedings in Parliament\" is defined by case law.\n\nIn Canadian and English jurisprudence, the definition includes things done outside Parliament in the furtherance of Parliamentary business such as correspondence, and press releases. The leading cases are *Roman Corp Ltd v Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Co Ltd* and *Re Clark and Attorney\\-General of Canada* for Canada, and *Rost v Edwards* for England and Wales.\n\nAustralian case law is split. The leading case is *Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Chatterton* in the Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court where Zelling AJC held that privilege applies to restatements by an MP outside Parliament of things said inside, possibly including answering questions about those things in an interview. Prior J rejected this and Jacob J didn't address it. That's one win, one loss and one DNF for those keeping score.\n\nFor the Federal Parliament, the *Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987* defines \"proceedings in Parliament\" as:\n\n> ... all words and spoken acts done in the course of, or for purposes of or incidental to, the transacting of the business of a House or of a committee, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes:\n> \n> \n> (a) the giving of evidence before a House or a committee, and evidence so given;\n> \n> \n> (b) the presentation or submission of a document to a House or a committee;\n> \n> \n> (c) the preparation of a document for purposes of or incidental to the transacting of any such business; and\n> \n> \n> (d) the formulation, making or publication of a document, including a report, by or pursuant to an order of a House or a committee and the document so formulated, made or published\n\nThe [northern\\-territory](/questions/tagged/northern-territory \"show questions tagged 'northern-territory'\") has similar legislation.\n\nIn *Laurance v Katter*, there was a judicial split in the Court of Appeal in the Queensland Supreme Court about whether this definition was unconstitutional.\n\n> Pincus JA held that s 16(3\\) was incompatible with the implied freedom of political communication. Following the High Court's decision in *R v Richards; Ex part Fitzpatrick and Browne*, Fitzpatrick P held that s 16 could not be invalidated or read down to accommodate the implied freedom of political communication. Davies JA read down s 16(3\\); in his view, the section was enacted merely to make it clear that parliamentary privilege applies not only where a member or witness is sued but also where evidence is sought to be tendered; in both cases, the privilege applies only where the parliamentary proceedings would be impeached or questioned. Davies JA then held that this was not the case in these proceedings.\n\nThe High Court gave special leave to appeal this decision but the matter was settled before the appeal was heard.\n\nSo, the exact boundaries of Parliamentary privilege in Australia remain uncertain. However, a prudent journalist should assume that it extends not just to statements made in the House or before a Committee but to statements about those statements made outside by the MP or their staff.\n\n**Who has the privilege?**\n\nThe privilege belongs to Parliament, not any individual MP, and can only be waived by Parliament. It cannot be invalidated by the courts due to the doctrine of separation of powers. Australian parliaments take the attitude that the waiver of privilege is a procedural matter about their own internal workings and does not require legislation.\n\nIn England and Wales, legislation has been passed that allows an MP to waive privilege over their (and only their) statements but no such law exists in Australia.\n\n**Effect of Parliamentary Privilege**\n\nThere are two limbs to Parliamentary Privilege:\n\n1. It provides **absolute immunity** to the MP (and possibly their staff) for statements made under privilege. That is, following *Barilaro v Shanks\\-Markovina (No 2\\) \\[2021] FCA 950*, anything and everything that is under privilege is completely inadmissible in court.\n2. By legislation in each Australian jurisdiction, **qualified immunity** is provided for the \"fair and accurate reports of parliamentary proceedings. Thus, a media organization is protected from liability for defamation in respect of the publication of a fair and accurate report of parliamentary proceedings unless the plaintiff can establish that, in publishing the report, the media organization was actuated by malice.\"\n\nThe Federal and Northern Territory legislation appears to go further and may provide absolute immunity but that has not been tested.\n\n**Actuated by malice**\n\nMalice in law does not mean what it means in everyday English. It means, with respect to defamation, that a statement was made either knowing that it was untrue or with reckless disregard for its truthfulness. In other words, you were deliberately lying, or you made no effort to find out if you were lying.\n\nWithin the context of Parliamentary Privilege, you cannot rely on the truthfulness of statements made in Parliament to establish that what you reported was the truth. The existence of the statements might be admissible, for example, to establish if privilege attaches to them but the content of the statements themselves has no probative value. In some ways, this is like a hearsay statement: you can testify that the statement was made (if that's relevant) but you cannot testify that there is any truth\\-value to what was said.\n\nTherefore, if you make a nasty remark (that goes beyond \"fair and accurate reports\") and your only reliance on the truthfulness of your statement comes from things under Parliamentary Privilege then you have no defence to a defamation claim. So, accusing someone of perjury for what they said to a parliamentary committee rather than just reporting what they said is clearly actuated by malice: it may be true but you know that you can't prove it's true \\- that amounts to reckless disregard for the truth.\n\n**Consequences**\n\nThe purpose of Parliamentary Privilege is to allow MPs to vigorously advance the interests of their constituencies (i.e. us) without the fear that they will be called to account for what they say in either a civil or criminal court.\n\nIt has been [argued](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/apr/09/top-judge-attacks-growing-abuse-of-parliamentary-privilege) that some uses of Parliamentary Privilege are an abuse, particularly where they subvert the operations of the judiciary or law enforcement such as by naming suspects, defendants, and witnesses or where the statements would be defamation but for the privilege. However, if they are, it is for the Parliament to discipline the MP by sanction or expulsion, or for the electorate to do so through the ballot box. Such discipline is rare, partly because no one wants to unleash a weapon that could be turned upon themselves but mostly, because Parliament is loath to interfere in the electorate's right to choose their own representatives even if they are wankers.\n\nThis privilege is clearly at odds with the principle of free speech and inhibits the ability of media outlets to editorialise on matters covered by privilege. **This consequence is not unintended**, rather it is a deliberate trade\\-off of one pillar of democratic life against another.",

This is one of the last flats available in the block and the builder is in a rush to complete and get the money as soon as possible. They set a deadline to complete the transaction of one month from the time we put down the reservation. This is much sooner than my partner and I would have liked, but we're accomodating their schedule, at a cost to ourselves: for example, my partner has taken time off work in order to attend an inconveniently scheduled appointment with the mortgage broker on a day's notice, and we will have to take a loss on a several weeks' rent as we were not able to find another person to take over our current lease in time.\n\nAs the scheduled completion date draws nearer, I'm beginning to worry that any minor setback will push us past the deadline. The dates that have been set by the builder are incredibly tight and don't allow any room for error. For example, the bank requested a reference letter from my employer, and the builder's schedule allowed 24 hours' notice to my employer to provide it. I work in a large corporation with a small and inefficient HR department, which has other priorities. It took a full day of emailing and calling to plead with them to get them to turn around the letter in that short period of time, and it very nearly didn't happen despite my best efforts. \n\nAccording to the terms the builder set, if we fail to complete by the date they set, they have the right to cancel our reservation. The builder has been vaguely threatening about what will happen if we don't meet the deadline but has not said specifically what their plans are. I'm worried that even minor delays that are outside of my control could result in us going over the scheduled time and thus losing our reservation, the money we've put down, and the flat itself. As a first time buyer, I'd also like to make sure I have enough time to fully research and understand every step, rather than having to make important decisions under pressure. \n\nMy question is, what recourse do we have if we go over the deadline and the builder imposes a financial penalty and/or cancels our reservation? Does it matter that the deadline that they imposed in the first place was unreasonably tight and did not allow room for anything to go wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: In the situation described, where a buyer has put down a reservation for a new-build flat with a tight completion deadline set by the builder, what legal recourse does the buyer have if they fail to meet the deadline due to factors outside their control?\n\nA) The buyer can sue the builder for imposing an unreasonable deadline and recover their reservation deposit plus damages.\nB) The buyer can request an extension from the builder, which the builder is legally obligated to grant if the delay is not the buyer's fault.\nC) The buyer can file a complaint with the local housing authority to force the builder to honor the reservation despite missing the deadline.\nD) The buyer has no automatic legal recourse if they fail to meet the deadline, regardless of the reasons for the delay.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Unfortunately, in this situation, the buyer has no automatic legal recourse if they fail to meet the deadline set by the builder, even if the deadline was unreasonably tight or the delay was caused by factors outside the buyer's control. The terms of the reservation agreement, which the buyer agreed to, likely give the builder the right to cancel the reservation and potentially keep the deposit if the deadline is not met. While the buyer could try to negotiate with the builder or seek legal advice to challenge the terms, there is no guarantee of success. This scenario highlights the importance of carefully reviewing and negotiating contract terms before signing, especially in high-stakes transactions like property purchases."

In the event of a legal dispute, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding applicable laws?\n\nA) Only Swiss law applies, as the developer is based in Switzerland.\nB) Only US law applies, as the software is hosted on a US server.\nC) The laws of the user's country always take precedence in any dispute.\nD) Laws from multiple jurisdictions could potentially apply, depending on where the plaintiff chooses to file the lawsuit.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. As stated in the documentation, a plaintiff can choose where to sue, provided the chosen court has jurisdiction. This means that laws from multiple jurisdictions could potentially apply, including those of the developer's location (Switzerland), the hosting location (USA), or any user's location. The court's jurisdiction will generally apply its own laws, but may also consider laws from other relevant jurisdictions. This complexity highlights why it's crucial for developers to seek legal advice when crafting user agreements or licenses, as these can sometimes (but not always) help specify which laws should apply in case of disputes."

I film this activity and report it to the police. The police decide on the basis of the film that someone was committing a robbery. They identify and arrest a suspect, identify and present a victim, etc.\n\nI am introduced in court as the person who took the film. I take the stand and testify that I did so. I then disclaim knowledge of any actual crime, and claim only that the activity looked \"suspicious,\" and I took it and handed the film to the police.\n\nI would expect the defense to cross examine me about the film. \"Where did you take this film? When did you take this film? At what angles/lighting, etc. did you take this film? How long have you had the camera? How much experience have you had operating this or similar cameras? How did you operate this camera?\" etc.\n\nBut suppose the defense goes into other areas: \"Do you feel that a crime has been committed? Why did you go to the police? Do you know if the defendant is the same person as in the film? How about the victim? (I did not introduce any of these topics on direct examination.\")\n\nWhat then happens if I say, \"I don't know whether a crime has been committed? or \"I don't know whether the defendant is the same person as in the film?.\" etc. and, \"all I can say is that I took this film and the film speaks for itself.\" and \"After receiving the film, the police acted independently of me, because I told them nothing else.\"\n\nIs the defense allowed to question me on those grounds? Will my answers stand up if they are true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The situation you describe is extremely unlikely\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, you will have been required to give a statement to the police who would have asked you most or all of the questions that you suggest before anyone gets anywhere near a courtroom and likely before any arrest has been made.\n\nThat statement will be part of your evidence in chief. As in \"Is this your statement?\" \"Yes\". \"Is this your video recording?\" \"Yes\". After that, your evidence in chief is pretty much done.\n\nA witness of fact (rules for expert witnesses are different) can only testify as to what they personally sensed and what their state of mind was. So questions about what you saw, heard, tasted etc. are all perfectly legitimate as are questions about what you thought or felt. You are required to answer these questions honestly \\- if that means \"I don't know\" then say \"I don't know\".\n\nAll of the hypothetical questions look fine but as I said, they will all have answers in your police statement. The only one that's off\\-limits is \"\"Do you feel that a crime has been committed?\" \\- nobody knows if a crime has been committed; that's why we're having a trial.",

This includes several shotguns, rifles and handguns. He died with no will. My son was also his power of attorney. We may have to sell a couple of these guns to help pay for my step\\-dad's final arrangements. What should we know regarding legal ownership and the sale of these guns?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are really two questions embedded in this situation.\n\nThe first would be no different if the property in question were cigars instead of guns. If the stepdad really and truly gave the cigars to his stepson before he died, then that is the end of the story. The presence or absence of a will, and the existence of a power of attorney (which terminates upon death by operation of law) is irrelevant. The question seems to imply that there is some doubt about whether the gift of that property really happened, however. In that regard, it is worth noting that if the gift was made by the step\\-son using the power of attorney to make a gift to himself, that the transfer may have been invalid since most powers of attorney do not confer the power to make gifts.\n\nThe second question, which isn't completely unrelated, concerns issues particular to firearms regulation. \n\nThe first sub\\-question (which the question seems to assume has happened, but which is probably behind some of the uncertainty over whether the guns were actually given as a gift), is whether the stepfather actually complied with any paperwork required in Florida to transfer a gun by lifetime gift to someone entitled to own a gun.\n\nThe second sub\\-question is what is necessary for a legal owner of a firearm to sell a firearm to someone else in Florida.\n\n[The answer to these questions](https://legalbeagle.com/6756222-florida-gun-transfer-laws.html) is that neither the gift nor a private sale of a firearm must be registered or documented in any particular way comparable to what a gun dealer must do in terms of background checks and record keeping in a commercial sale of a firearm in Florida. But, better practice is to document a sale with a writing to prove that it took place and to make clear that the seller no longer owned the gun as of the documented date in case it is used in a crime.",

John's stepfather died without a will, and Mark held power of attorney. The family is considering selling some guns to cover funeral expenses. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal ownership and potential sale of these firearms in Florida?\n\nA) The verbal gift is invalid without written documentation, and the firearms must be considered part of the stepfather's estate.\n\nB) Mark's power of attorney allows him to retroactively document the gift, ensuring his ownership of the firearms.\n\nC) If the gift was properly made before death, Mark legally owns the firearms and can sell them without additional documentation, though a written record of sale is advisable.\n\nD) Florida law requires all firearm transfers, including gifts and private sales, to be registered with the state before ownership can be recognized or sales can occur.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Florida, if the stepfather truly gave the firearms to Mark before his death, the gift is valid even without written documentation. The power of attorney is irrelevant after death and doesn't affect the gift's validity. Florida doesn't require registration or documentation for private firearm transfers or sales, including gifts. However, it's advisable to create a written record of any sale to prove the transfer of ownership. Options A and D are incorrect because they misstate Florida's firearm transfer laws. Option B is wrong because power of attorney terminates upon death and can't be used to retroactively document gifts."

By naming the museum after the collector rather than the company, it avoids implying an official affiliation. Describing the exhibits as manufactured by the toy company in promotional materials is a nominative use that doesn't suggest endorsement. This approach balances the collector's right to showcase her collection with the company's trademark protections.\n\nOption A directly uses the company's name, which could imply an official affiliation and likely lead to legal challenges.

If the license does not permit you to distribute modified versions, than doing so would be a copyright infringement. I cannot see how this would fall under fair use or fair dealing.

A modified version of source code is a derivative work, and the right to prepare and distribute derivative works is one of the rights that together make up copyright. \n\nIf someone were to distribute, in violation of the license, and without such separate permission, a modified version, the copyright holder could sue, and quite possibly be awarded damages, perhaps sizable damages.\n\nHowever, if one were to merely take the general purpose and design of the previous application, and rewrite it totally, not copying or modifying the original source code, tht would be a new and different work with its own copyright.

The definition doesn't formally say so, but only someone who owes allegiance to the United States (i.e. a U.S. citizen) can be guilty of treason. The federal treason statute states:\n\n> Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, **levies war against\n> them** or adheres to their **enemies**, giving them aid and comfort within\n> the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer\n> death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under\n> this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of\n> holding any office under the United States.\n\n18 USC Section 2381\\.\n\nThe main limitations are in bold.\n\nThe word \"enemy\" has a technical meaning in the area of treason and foreign relations, which means a country or insurgent group with whom the United States is at war. Thus, the following are not \"enemies\" of the United States:\n\n* the foreign nation is a close ally of the US\n* the foreign nation has neutral relations with the US\n* the foreign nation is a bitter rival with cold relations to the US\n\nBut, this one is an enemy of the United States:\n\n* the foreign nation is in a state of open, declared war with the US\n\nHence, a U.S. citizen giving aid and comfort to ISIS (with whom we have a Congressionally authorized war) as it tries to mount a terrorist attack on the U.S. might very well be treason, but assisting Russia (with whom the U.S. is not at war) in assassinating an American would not be.\n\nI don't know if North Korea is a current \"enemy\" of the United States or not. The Korean War is not over, but I don't know if the U.S. declaration of war on North Korea is still in force.\n\nIt is also a lesser felony to failure to report treason in progress to the authorities, with treason itself defined in essentially the same way. 18 USC Section 2882\\. Thus, U.S. citizens have a legal duty enforceable with criminal law to affirmatively report treason.\n\nRebellion or insurrection\n-------------------------\n\nAlso rebellion or insurrection is a crime defined as follows:\n\n> Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages **in any rebellion or\n> insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws\n> thereof**, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this\n> title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be\n> incapable of holding any office under the United States.\n\n18 USC Section 2383\n\nThe bold language greatly restricts the applicability of this crime. This is not something you can really do by yourself, you need to be part of an organized insurgency group actively trying to overthrow the U.S. government by force.\n\nAffiliation with a foreign power is irrelevant to this offense.\n\nSedition\n--------\n\nSedition (actually seditious conspiracy) is defined as:\n\n> If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place\n> subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to\n> overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the\n> United States, or to levy war against them, or **to oppose by force the\n> authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the\n> execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take,\n> or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority\n> thereof,** they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not\n> more than twenty years, or both.\n\n18 USC Section 2384\\.\n\nThe highlighted portions are the least culpable ones that qualify for the offense of seditious conspiracy, which are subject to some significant case law glosses of interpretation. At a minimum seditious conspiracy must involve defiance of the authority of the United States.\n\nSimply committing serious crimes against the United States (e.g assassinating a high government official or blowing up a government building), while acknowledging that the United States is the legitimate government of the United States acting within its authority and not seeking regime change (not just new personnel but a new constitution not adopted by constitutional means), is not sufficient.\n\nYour involvement with a foreign power is neither necessary nor sufficient for conduct to be seditious.\n\nAdvocating the overthrow of the United States government\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdvocating the overthrow of the United States government is also a crime in some circumstances (subject to significant judicial case law glosses):\n\n> Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches\n> the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or\n> destroying the government of the United States or the government of\n> any State, Territory, District or Possession thereof, or the\n> government of any political subdivision therein, **by force or violence,\n> or by the assassination of any officer of any such government;** or\n> \n> \n> Whoever, with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such\n> government, prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells,\n> distributes, or publicly displays any written or printed matter\n> advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability,\n> or propriety of **overthrowing or destroying any government in the\n> United States by force or violence, or attempts to do so;** or\n> \n> \n> Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group,\n> or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the **overthrow\n> or destruction of any such government by force or violence;** or **becomes\n> or is a member of, or affiliates with, any such society, group, or\n> assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof\u2014**\n> \n> \n> Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty\n> years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by the United\n> States or any department or agency thereof, for the five years next\n> following his conviction.\n> \n> \n> If two or more persons conspire to commit any offense named in this\n> section, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n> than twenty years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by\n> the United States or any department or agency thereof, for the five\n> years next following his conviction.\n> \n> \n> As used in this section, the terms \u201corganizes\u201d and \u201corganize\u201d, with\n> respect to any society, group, or assembly of persons, include the\n> recruiting of new members, the forming of new units, and the\n> regrouping or expansion of existing clubs, classes, and other units of\n> such society, group, or assembly of persons.\n\n18 USC Section 2385\\.\n\nCollaboration with a foreign power isn't an element of this crime and is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish it. The key limitations and most inclusive provisions are in bold. The First Amendment significantly limits that application of this crime as applied, but it is not unconstitutional in all circumstances.\n\nYour Examples\n=============\n\nNumbers 1\\-2 would never be crimes of any kind as described and not reading anything else into them.\n\nNumbers 3\\-6 are not illegal *per se*, but you may be required to register as a foreign agent and these activities may be illegal for someone holding certain government offices.\n\nNothing in 1\\-6 would constitute treason or sedition or rebellion.\n\nCivil disobedience is a description that speaks more to the reason and motive for the action than the action itself so it is hard to say what you mean by 7\\-8\\. Somebody could call blowing up the Capitol \"civil disobedience\" or could mean protesting in violation of a curfew ordinance. Some of those activities could constitute a seditious conspiracy.\n\nWith respect to 9\\-10, the acts involved are more clear, but the motive and context remain in doubt. Some of this activity could conceivably be a seditious conspiracy, but we don't have enough context here to know.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under U.S. federal law, which of the following scenarios would most likely constitute the crime of treason?\n\nA) A U.S. citizen publishes a biased article criticizing U.S. foreign policy, collaborating with journalists from Russia.\n\nB) A U.S. citizen organizes protests against the government, receiving funding from a Chinese corporation.\n\nC) A U.S. citizen provides tactical information to North Korean military officials during an active war between the U.S. and North Korea.\n\nD) A U.S. citizen participates in riots and looting to protest government policies, coordinating with activist groups from France.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Treason is constitutionally defined as levying war against the United States or giving aid and comfort to its enemies. It can only be committed by someone who owes allegiance to the U.S. (i.e., a U.S. citizen). The key factor is that the aid must be given to an \"enemy,\" which has a specific legal meaning - a country or group with which the U.S. is at war.\n\nOption A involves collaboration with Russia, but as Russia is not currently at war with the U.S., this would not constitute treason.\n\nOption B involves receiving funding from China, but again, China is not at war with the U.S., so this is not treason. It might require registering as a foreign agent, but it's not treasonous.\n\nOption C is the correct answer because it involves providing aid to North Korea during an active war with the U.S. This scenario meets the constitutional definition of treason.\n\nOption D involves domestic criminal activity, but coordination with French groups does not constitute treason as France is not an enemy of the U.S."

If that is not possible how much can you limit the right to a divorce with a contract or something similar?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> When you get married is possible to have contract renouncing both\n>  parties right to a divorce.\n\nNo. That clause would be redundant, materially indistinguishable from breach of contract, and otherwise unenforceable.\n\nIt is redundant because the legal definition of Marriage (Black's Law Dictionary) states that it is \"*A contract, according to the form prescribed by law, by which a man and woman \\[...] mutually engage with each other to live **their whole lives together** in the state of union which ought to exist between a husband and a wife*\". Thus, the perpetuity as expressed in the term *whole lives* preempts the conceiving of an eventual separation.\n\nInsofar as marriage is legally cognizable as a contract (see legal definition), it might specify or imply remedies in the event that one or both spouses decide(s) that substance of marital relationship no longer exists; that is, in the event that a breach of that contract occurs. A court may order to the breaching spouse performance of certain acts (for example, alimony) in accordance to statutory law or common law. However, a prohibition to divorce goes beyond the scope of what is legally permissible.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in [*Roberts v. United States Jaycees*, 468 U.S. 609, 617\\-618 (1984\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/19841077468us60911057) helps explaining why a *prohibition to divorce* would be unenforceable:\n\n\"*In one line of decisions, the Court has concluded that choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships must be secured against undue intrusion by the State because of the role of such relationships in safeguarding the individual freedom that is central to our constitutional scheme. In this respect, freedom of association receives protection as a fundamental element of personal liberty.*\"\n\n> If that is not possible how much can you limit the right to a divorce\n>  with a contract or something similar?\n\nThere is no possible limit or requisite duration of a marriage, as that would inherently infringe a person's *fundamental element of personal liberty* mentioned in the *Roberts* case.",

The legal definition of marriage, as cited from Black's Law Dictionary, already implies a lifelong commitment (\"their whole lives together\"). Therefore, a contract clause renouncing the right to divorce would be redundant. \n\nOption A is incorrect because such a contract would be unenforceable, as it would infringe on personal liberty protected by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nOption B is incorrect because any limitation on the right to divorce, even for a specific period, would still be considered an infringement on personal freedom and thus unenforceable.\n\nOption D is incorrect because even if both parties agree, contracts limiting divorce rights are not enforceable due to the fundamental right to personal liberty, as established in case law like Roberts v. United States Jaycees."

The information provided suggests that while access to court transcripts or recordings is generally available to parties involved in proceedings, there are exceptions. The example from the Civil Procedure Rules in England and Wales demonstrates that courts can have the power to restrict access, even for parties involved in the proceedings, particularly in sensitive cases like those related to terrorist financing.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage indicates that there is likely no absolute right to access transcripts or recordings worldwide, as courts have inherent powers to make directions.\n\nAnswer B is false because the example provided shows that courts can indeed restrict access in certain circumstances.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the passage suggests that regulations may vary between different common law jurisdictions, and there isn't a uniform standard across all of them.\n\nThe key point is that while access is generally available, courts in some jurisdictions retain the power to restrict it under certain circumstances, making C the most accurate answer."
