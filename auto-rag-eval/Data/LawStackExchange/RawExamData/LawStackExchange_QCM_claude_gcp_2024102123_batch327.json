However, I told him (person\\-to\\-person) two days prior to moving out, that I was moving out Friday morning and requested the driveway clear, which he obliged; however, he stated nothing about where I could or couldn't park. \n\nI also asked him if he would do a walk\\-through of the room with me, to verify any damages, after I moved and cleaned the room out, which he did not do while I was present and simply stated \"I'm sure it's fine\" \\-\\- he also refused to do a pre\\-move\\-out inspection that's in written as a Right in my lease.\n\nMy question: Is this actually enforceable, since I did park in a public space and not necessarily on his property? \n\nI had trouble with this landlord since I moved into the house. I have a brief write up of my concerns posted [here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/3c5tve/where_to_turn_to_when_landlord_doesnt_return/) prior to my move. I did follow through with what was suggested in the thread (take photos, document, save texts, etc.), but I've yet to talk to a lawyer, as I don't think it's quite that time\n\nIt will be three weeks since I moved out on the August 21st. I'm going to wait a week until the 28th to send him a certified letter requesting my full deposit be returned if it already hasn't, and if I don't hear anything back I'll probably be taking him to small claims court.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Agreement\n---------\n\nYou say:\n\n> my landlord added a clause stating: \"All moving must be done in rear of driveway or pay $250 (near basement door)\"\n\nWas this addition made at the time you signed the lease or subsequently? This matters because the terms of a contract cannot be changed unilaterally, they must be agreed. If the change happened after the lease was signed then , unless you agreed to it, it has no effect whatsoever.\n\nSince that resolution is boring; I will assume that it was always there.\n\nEnforcability\n-------------\n\n> Is this actually enforceable, since I did park in a public space and not necessarily on his property?\n\nYes, it is enforceable. People can agree in a contract to do (or not do) anything so long as that thing is not illegal \\- that is what a contract is; a legally enforceable agreement for two people to do certain things.\n\nYou agreed \"All moving must be done in rear of driveway ... (near basement door)\" and you didn't do what you agreed to do. Therefore you broke a term of the contract. It doesn't matter that you don't know why he wanted you to do this or if it was reasonable or if it meant that you couldn't use your parent's truck \\- if these were issues for you they should have been raised before you agreed to do it. If the clause said \"When moving out you will wear a blue double breasted suit with a yellow and purple bow tie\" then that is what you must do.\n\nConsequences\n------------\n\nThere are a number of options open to the wronged party when the other party breaches a term of a contract. The most relevant in these circumstances is to sue for damages.\n\nSo how much are damages? Well, they are an amount to restore the wronged party to the position they would have been in if you hadn't broken the agreement.\n\nIn situations where damages can be hard to calculate, contracts can make a provision for [liquidated damages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidated_damages); a pre\\-agreed amount of what the damage will be: in this case \"$250\". However:\n\n> In the United States, Section 2\\-718(1\\) of the Uniform Commercial Code provides that, in contracts for the sale of goods:\n> \n> \n> Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.\n> \n> \n> This largely mirrors the common law rule, which applies to other types of contracts under the law of most US states.\n\nOn the face of it, it would appear that $250 may be \"unreasonably large\" given the nature of the breach where it appears that the landlord has actually suffered no damage."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the scenario described, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the enforceability of the $250 fee for not moving out through the rear driveway?\n\nA) The fee is definitely enforceable because it was written in the lease agreement.\n\nB) The fee is unenforceable because the tenant parked on a public street, not on the landlord's property.\n\nC) The fee may be enforceable, but could potentially be challenged as an unreasonable liquidated damages clause.\n\nD) The fee is completely unenforceable because the landlord didn't suffer any actual damages.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the clause itself is part of a contract and generally enforceable, liquidated damages clauses in the US are subject to a reasonableness test. The $250 fee could potentially be challenged as unreasonable given that the landlord doesn't appear to have suffered any actual damages from the tenant moving out from the street instead of the driveway. Courts would likely examine whether this amount is a reasonable pre-estimate of potential damages or if it's punitive in nature. Option C reflects this nuanced legal reality, acknowledging that while the clause may be enforceable, it's also open to challenge based on the specific circumstances."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/liabilities-without-explicit-consent-in-contracts", "docs_id": 1539, "title": "Liabilities without explicit consent in contracts", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been wondering for quite a while now about the following question and have been unable to get a definitive answer. I have asked lawyers who do not know for sure (and this is their field). \n\nMy question is if a User of some Service can be held liable for a legal infringement that the Service commits. That sentence was a bit confusing, so let me explain/elaborate:\n\nIn the case of Kazaa (I think it was called), a file sharing service, some users were held liable for the illegal downloading of music from this service. The *users* had to pay horrendous fines for in essence using the services which facilitated these actions. I am not sure if the Users signed a contract that says that they are liable for (knowingly or unknowingly) illegally downloading music from the Service. If a contract was signed, then that would definitely justify the fines to the Users, not the Service.\n\nHere is a theoretical example: A company sells a service which allows users to mask their IPs so that it seems that they are in the continental US. A user, \"Bob Doe\", is using this service. The user does not have to sign any contracts or sign their consent to anything. This user attempts to use an unaffiliated service which is only available in the continental US (and a couple other places) and prohibits its use outside of it (a service such as this one is Netflix, I think). Bob Doe uses Netflix in Uzbekistan (definitely *not* a place where Netflix is available) through the first mentioned service that masks his IP. Is Bob Doe held liable for any legal complications resulting from his use of Netflix through the IP masking service or is the IP masker shielding him too (is this IP masking service held liable)?\n\nI have also heard the argument that the User is causing the Service to commit an illegal act, hence the User is responsible (even though no contract was signed by the user).\n\nMy question basically is: If a User does *not* sign a contract saying that *they* are held liable for any illegal act which they 'cause the Service to commit', then who is held liable; who has to pay the fines?\n\nThanks a lot for any responses! All are welcome and greatly appreciated!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is unlikely that you find a *commercial* provider of a service such as the one you describe that does *not* require its users to consent to some kind of agreement.\n\n1. The service provider, in spite of the absence of a contract, is unlikely to be held liable or named as a defendant in proceedings unless it can be shown that they ought to have been aware of the activities being undertaken.  \n\nIf it is found that the service provider reasonably ought to have been aware, and could have taken steps to prevent the activity, they could possibly be named as a defendant, in addition to or instead of the end user.  \n\nSee *A\\&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.*, 239 F.3d 1004 (2001\\) for a court decision with a similar fact pattern involving copyright infringement, rather than contract breach. It is also unclear whether such a case would be tried in the US, though it is likely.\n2. The end user is likely to be in breach of Netflix's Terms of Use (relevant clause extracted below); in this case, Netflix would have to sue for breach of contract, and it is quite likely that judgement would be in their favour. The possible damages awarded would vary by jurisdiction.\n\nEssentially \\- yeah, the user is almost certainly going to breach contract. There generally aren't fines for it, but a court may order restitutional damages and/or an injunction.\n\n[**Netflix Terms of Use**](https://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse \"Netflix Terms of Use\")\n\n> 4\\.3\\.

He is in breach of Netflix's Terms of Use, which specify that users may only view content in geographic locations where Netflix offers its service and has licensed the content.\n\n2. Even without signing a contract with the IP masking service, Bob is the end user who knowingly used the service to circumvent geographical restrictions.\n\n3. The IP masking service provider is unlikely to be held liable unless it can be proven that they were aware of the specific illegal activities being undertaken by their users.\n\n4. Netflix would likely pursue action against Bob for breach of contract rather than against the IP masking service.\n\n5. While the IP masking service could potentially face some liability if it's proven they should have been aware of such uses, the primary responsibility falls on the end user who actively chose to violate the terms of service.\n\nThis question tests understanding of liability in complex scenarios involving multiple parties and services, as well as the importance of terms of use in digital services."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13606/is-it-legal-for-a-company-to-require-an-extra-software-license-for-a-backup", "docs_id": 13606, "title": "Is it legal for a company to require an extra software license for a backup?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I work for a company that has purchased a software license for software that is needed to make our company run smoothly.

It's definitely not the norm \\- at least in my experiences \\- but it *is* a possibility so you'll need to consult your program's license agreement.\n\nThere's also a possibility that the company misunderstood you and was thinking that you were *running a backup server* (in the sense of a redundant infrastructure) and not *making an offline backup of your entire server*.

This study summarizes US public records law on a state by state basis, if the issue is about the US. Taking Massachusetts as an example, the law defines public record [here](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleI/Chapter4/Section7), so if the item is not a public record, it is not required to disclose the item. Clause 26 has a long list of exceptions such as \n\n> (j) the names and addresses of any persons contained in, or referred\n>  to in, any applications for any licenses to carry or possess firearms\n>  issued pursuant to chapter one hundred and forty or any firearms\n>  identification cards issued pursuant to said chapter one hundred and\n>  forty and the names and addresses on sales or transfers of any\n>  firearms, rifles, shotguns, or machine guns or ammunition therefor, as\n>  defined in said chapter one hundred and forty and the names and\n>  addresses on said licenses or cards ... \n> \n> \n> (o) the home address and home\n>  telephone number of an employee of the judicial branch, an unelected\n>  employee of the general court, an agency, executive office,\n>  department, board, commission, bureau, division or authority of the\n>  commonwealth, or of a political subdivision thereof or of an authority\n>  established by the general court to serve a public purpose, in the\n>  custody of a government agency which maintains records identifying\n>  persons as falling within those categories; provided that the\n>  information may be disclosed to an employee organization under chapter\n>  150E, a nonprofit organization for retired public employees under\n>  chapter 180, or a criminal justice agency as defined in section 167 of\n>  chapter 6\\.\n> \n> \n> (p) the name, home address and home telephone number of a family\n>  member of a commonwealth employee, contained in a record in the\n>  custody of a government agency which maintains records identifying\n>  persons as falling within the categories listed in subclause (o).\n\nIf the information is not legally a public record, there is no obligation to disclose. There is a general requirement via statute, regulation and court rulings requiring the government to protect personal information, such as [this](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter93h/Section2). You can get a list of sources on that topic [here](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-law-about-privacy#massachusetts-laws-).

While Massachusetts has laws requiring the government to protect personal information (such as Chapter 93H, Section 2), this doesn't automatically mean the town must redact or remove the information. The information might be considered a public record, but there are exceptions in Massachusetts law for certain types of personal information. The resident could potentially argue that their information should be protected under these laws, but there's no guarantee the town will be forced to comply. The town might claim the correspondence is entirely public record. While the resident has a basis to request removal or redaction, enforcement might be challenging without legal assistance.

He's 35 years old and had a vasectomy a few months ago. After the waiting period, he underwent the lab test to check that the procedure was successful. A few days after submitting his sample, he received an email from the urologist's office saying he had new information in his record (online patient portal). \n\nTo his excessive surprise, the new information was NOT the results of the lab test, but was in fact a record of a cancer diagnosis. Double testicular cancer, to be precise. After a bewildering and frantic hour, he was able to get confirmation from the urologist's office that no, he doesn't actually have testicular cancer. An orchiectomy (testicle removal) had also appeared on his record, although this was clearly false, if only due to the date on the record; the office confirmed that also didn't belong on his record. This was all an accident made by someone in the office, presumably. \n\nA few weeks later, after many phone calls and two in\\-person visits to the office, the cancer diagnosis moved to a classification as a past condition, implying that it had been cured. The patient portal is handled by some other group, and the office claims they don't have the ability to remove records, hence the large volume of phone calls and trying to reach someone who does have that ability. Eventually, one cancer diagnosis was removed, but the other testicular cancer diagnosis and orchiectomy remain.\n\nIt seems clear that having this appear on his medical record will affect my husband negatively, at the very least in regards to insurance.

Specifically you are looking at [Title 3, Division 13, Article 1](https://library.municode.com/ca/orange_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT3PUMOSAWE_DIV13PRMA), Sec 3\\-13\\-4(11\\):\n\n> **Sec. 3\\-13\\-4\\. \\- Prohibited Conduct.**   \n> \n>   \n> \n> Except as provided in section 3\\-13\\-6, exemptions, it shall be unlawful for any responsible party having charge or possession of any real property in county territory to:  \n> ...\n>   \n> \n> (11\\) Keep, store, or maintain upon any premises under his/her control any abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle, or part thereof, except as permitted by Table 3\\-13\\-6(c).\n\nYou may store/work on this vehicle from a building or location that is not visible from the street, but you cannot work on or store the vehicle on the street or driveway. You might also be able to erect a 6' tall opaque fence around the car, provided the fence meets standards.\n\nThe code making this illegal is a county ordinance for Orange County, CA, which is not applicable to other counties in California (other counties/cities may have their own ordinances). Codes which cover this sort of activity are generally made at the county or city level. They vary dramatically from location to location, and are often different based on the zoning of the property within the county or city."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Orange County, CA, a resident has been working on a non-operational classic car in their driveway for several months.

Simply covering the vehicle with a car cover does not comply with the ordinance, as it would still be visible and considered an inoperable vehicle in the driveway.\n\nB) Incorrect. While registering the vehicle as inoperable may be required by the DMV, it does not address the county ordinance's requirement of keeping inoperable vehicles out of sight.\n\nC) Correct. According to the information provided, erecting a 6-foot tall opaque fence around the car that meets standards would be a permissible way to keep the vehicle on the property without violating the ordinance, as it would no longer be visible from the street.\n\nD) Incorrect.

Readers of Law StackExchange like to citations to reliable sources; I'm not going to do that, just describe my experience.\n\nMany states do indeed allow a person to adopt a new name through usage. Government agencies and large commercial agencies don't like that, and they can and do thwart the law by imposing their own administrative procedures. If you don't like their procedures, fine, give a lawyer a $20,000 retainer, have the lawyer sue, and wait three years. And after spending all that money, the court might find that although it isn't a crime for a person to change their name by usage, there is no law requiring the administrative agency to accept it.\n\nIf you don't have tens of thousands of dollars to waste or years to wait, you have two choices.

Depending on exactly what happens, you could be committing one of two torts, fraud or nuisance.\n\n[**Fraud:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud#Civil_fraud) If your stunt causes homeowners to panic and sell to you at a lower price because they fear the homeless are moving into their neighborhood, you have committed fraud.

While the individual's actions are unethical, they may not necessarily constitute a criminal conspiracy unless there's evidence of an agreement to commit an illegal act.\n\nB) Incorrect. Fraud typically requires a direct misrepresentation to the victim.

The fact that the item is located 40 miles away is not per se an unconscionable burden on you, but if it is impossible or very expensive for you to get there because of the new location, they could have some responsibility to mitigate the situation (e.g. give you a ride to and from)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A pawnshop with two locations had its Federal Firearms License (FFL) suspended at one store.

The summary available at this link, which is probably based upon a press release of the government, rather than its proposed legislative language, is as follows:\n\n> * India\u2019s proposed tax rate on income from virtual assets is steep, but it signals that the government recognizes the country\u2019s\n> cryptocurrency industry, the CEO of crypto exchange CoinSwitch told\n> CNBC.\n> * In the Feb. 1 annual budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a 30% tax on any income from the transfer of digital assets\n> and said no deductions would be allowed.\n> * Losses incurred from such transactions could not be set off against any other income.\n> * India also planned to impose a 1% tax deducted at source, or TDS, on payments related to the transfer of digital assets.\n\nBasically, this is a capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies and [non\\-fungible tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) (NFTs), but with no deductions for cryptocurrency/NFT losses against income other than cryptocurrency/NFT income, together with a 1% sales tax on cryptocurrency/NFT transaction payments.\n\n*Example One*\n\nYou buy 800,000 rupees of Bitcoin and 200,000 rupees of limited edition online trading cards for celebrities like cricket players, Bollywood stars, famous pop singers, businessman, politicians, mathematicians, scientists and historical generals (which are non\\-fungible tokens) on January 1, 2023, then on December 31, 2023, you sell the Bitcoin for 400,000 rupees and all of your NFTs for 1,200,000 because you get in a bidding war with Mukesh Ambani over his own NFTs.\n\nYou have a 400,000 rupee loss on the Bitcoin which reduces your 1,000,000 rupee gain on NFTs, for net digital asset income of 600,000 rupees, giving rise to a 180,000 rupee digital assets income tax.\n\nIn addition, you would pay a 10000 rupee digital asset transaction tax (1%) on the purchase and a 14000 digital asset transaction tax on the sale for a total digital asset tax of 204,000 rupees\n\nNote that it isn't entirely clear from the available information if the transaction tax on digital asset payments is owed by both the seller and the buyer, by only the seller, by only the buyer, or half by each. These examples assume that the 1% transaction tax applies to both the seller and to the buyer, but this might end up being different in the final adopted legislation.\n\nAfter the digital assets tax, you would have 1,396,000 rupees left over from your starting investment of 1,000,000 rupees. Good job! You can afford a wild and crazy party with your friends from your profits.\n\n*Example Two*\n\nBut, suppose you only bought the Bitcoin, and not the NFTs, and had a loss of 400,000 rupees, but also had 1,000,000 rupees of salary income from you job as an architect that year.\n\nYou wouldn't have any digital asset income tax, but your digital asset transaction tax would be 12,000 rupees, even though you made a loss (subject to the lack of clarity in how the transaction tax works). You wouldn't be able to apply your Bitcoin losses to the taxes you owe on your ordinary income from your salary, however.\n\n> For example if X person purchases software say MySQL commercial\n> edition from YZX private limited and YZX Pvt ltd purchased MySQL\n> commercial edition from oracle itself will this new 30% tax be applied\n> on this transaction or not?\n> \n> \n> So it will look:\n> \n> \n> \\-\\-\\> Oracle (produces MySql COmercial Edition) \\-\\-\\> sold to a distributor \\-\\-\\> sold to YZX Pvt ltd \\-\\-\\> End user say X person\n> \n> \n> Now:\n> \n> \n> Q1\\.

The new tax law will probably have an exemption from the digital assets tax for software and will probably treat software the same way that it does now under India's tax laws.\n\nEven if it did apply to software, however (and the details may change in the legislative process) it would only be a 30% tax on the profits YZX Pvt ltd made from selling the software to a retail purchaser, not a tax on the gross sale price of the softwware, although there might be a 1% sales tax on the gross sale price if the tax were expanded from the current proposal to include software."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company in India, TechSolutions Pvt Ltd, purchases a commercial database software license from Oracle for 1,000,000 rupees and resells it to a client, DataCorp, for 1,200,000 rupees. Assuming the proposed digital asset tax is implemented as described, what would be the tax implications for TechSolutions Pvt Ltd?\n\nA) TechSolutions Pvt Ltd would owe 60,000 rupees in digital asset income tax (30% of 200,000 rupees profit) plus 22,000 rupees in transaction tax (1% of both purchase and sale amounts).\n\nB) TechSolutions Pvt Ltd would owe 360,000 rupees in digital asset income tax (30% of 1,200,000 rupees sale price) plus 22,000 rupees in transaction tax (1% of both purchase and sale amounts).\n\nC) TechSolutions Pvt Ltd would not owe any digital asset tax, as software sales are not intended to be covered by this proposed tax.\n\nD) TechSolutions Pvt Ltd would owe 12,000 rupees in transaction tax (1% of the sale amount) but no digital asset income tax.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The proposed digital asset tax is primarily intended for cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), not for software sales. As stated in the documentation, \"This tax is not intended to apply to software sales and sales of digital services. The new tax law will probably have an exemption from the digital assets tax for software and will probably treat software the same way that it does now under India's tax laws.\" Therefore, TechSolutions Pvt Ltd would likely not be subject to this new digital asset tax for their software resale transaction. The company would instead be subject to regular business income tax on their profits from the software sale, as per existing Indian tax laws."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27929/am-i-responsible-for-my-spouses-careless-behavior", "docs_id": 27929, "title": "Am I responsible for my spouse&#39;s careless behavior?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My spouse is a great person, but careless.

I also do not understand how such a law would be beneficial in any way: if a women feels that her religion imposes on her the burka, and if you forbid her from wearing it, she will simply stay at home and not walk in public. Hence the burka ban seems to accomplish just as much female degradation and oppression as the burka itself is supposedly doing.\n\nTo be clear, my questions are: \n\n1. Assuming a burka ban is in place, how can it be phrased whilst also protecting all other people covering themselves for a multitude of sensible reasons.\n2. What exactly is the law supposed to accomplish? **Who** is it helping? If there really is a group of women being forced to wear the burka in western societies, what an atrocity, but is banning the burka really helping them? Would their families not just force them to stay inside then or only have limited access to public places, hence making their already terrible situation much worse?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We could start with the [Australian bill](http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/s1054_first-senate/toc_pdf/1701620.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf), which is not a law but might become one.

Then [the Belgian ban](http://unia.be/files/Z_ARCHIEF/010.pdf) says more or less the same, framed in terms of being non\\-identifiable, with exceptions pertaining to labor regulations, or \"with the permission of a police ordinance on account of festivities\" (discussion in [this article](https://lib.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/001/892/123/RUG01-001892123_2012_0001_AC.pdf)).\n\nIt is also claimed towards the end of Apr. 2016 that [Latvia banned the burqa](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/islamic-muslim-face-veil-niqab-burqa-banned-latvia-despite-being-worn-by-just-three-women-entire-a6993991.html), though the [Latvian government says](https://www.tm.gov.lv/en/news/the-cabinet-supports-the-draft-law-on-restriction-of-face-coverings) that toward the end of August 2017, it supported a draft law to that effect (suggesting that there was not actually a law yet): their summary of the law indicates that it is about facial identification, and has the expected set of weather, safety, and festivities exceptions.

This mesh is not secured on either end only being held up by a couple of small stacks of fire wood and only approximately 2 1/2 \\- 3 feet tall (the height of the dog standing). Of the two dogs, one is a pit bull and both charge the fence very aggressively barking, growling, baring their teeth. Neither dog are otherwise secured or on a leash and often allowed to roam the back yard at will even without supervision. The owner finds the aggression funny even in the face of the obvious terror of pedestrians walking along the street.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Law:\n---------------------\n\n**3 P.S.

Section 459** (Definition of a dangerous dog.)\n\n> * the dog has injured a person, without provocation, on public or private property,\n> * the dog has killed or injured a domestic animal without provocation, while off the owner's property,\n> * the dog has attacked a human being without provocation, or\n> * the dog was used to commit a crime.\n\nWhere it seems there are holes in the law:\n------------------------------------------\n\n*2\\. firmly secured by a means of collar and chain or other device so that it cannot stray beyond the premises on which it is secured, or*\n\nIt seems clear to me that the unsecured wire roll does not comply with **other device so that it cannot stray beyond the premises**, however, the homeowner claims the dogs do not go past the wire. How are they to know? Is it not a matter of time? How would the law see this?\n\nThe definition of a dangerous dog requires an attack, kill, or injury. It seems to me any dog that has a consistent history of making a credible or reasonable threat of attack or injury without control of the owner either by confinement or leash is also dangerous. I see it as akin to a drunk driver that has not crashed yet. The drunk driver is still a danger.\n\nMy Questions:\n-------------\n\nMy questions are, given the scenario, is it at least reasonable to consider the unsecured wire roll regardless of the claim of the owner inadequate?

This should not be an issue. This is a very relaxed environment. However, relaxed also means that the local police may not respond to a complaint unless forced to legally. Often, this is because the police are so busy chasing down drug offenses, they opt not to enforce quality of life issues such as this one. Even when the police chief is a personal friend.

Any clarity would help. Cheers!!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume that the fence and dog are outside, not within the premises (buildings) of the property. An outside dog area with two 8 foot sections missing and patched with thin wire mesh such as chicken wire fails to satisfy the requirements of \"other device so that it *cannot* stray beyond the premises on which it is secured\", though it could satisfy a weaker and non\\-existent law only requiring that the device \"might tend to hinder escape\". A first violation of the law is a summary offense, punishable by fine of $100\\-$500, 90 days, or both.\n\nThe question arises what level of culpability attaches to this crime, that is, does conviction require recklessness, malice, or what? [State law on culpability](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=3) \u00a7305(a) says\n\n> The requirements of culpability prescribed by section 301 of this\n>  title (relating to requirement of voluntary act) and section 302 of\n>  this title (relating to general requirements of culpability) do not\n>  apply to:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) summary offenses, unless the requirement involved is included in\n>  the definition of the offense or the court determines that its\n>  application is consistent with effective enforcement of the law\n>  defining the offense\n\nFor example, speeding is a summary and strict liability offense: you're guilty if you're over the speed limit. [Baehr v. Com](https://casetext.com/case/baehr-v-com-ex-rel-lower-merion-twp), 414 A.2d 415 held that the law (a first violation) \"unmistakably speaks in terms of strict liability for its violation\". The legislative intent is to prevent risky behavior, not just to punish people for damages that result from risky acts.\n\nThere is an escape, though, if the responsible person has already been convicted of this, because a second offense is a misdemeanor, not a summary offense. Culpability requirements thus hold, and it would have to be established that defendant acted \"intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly\", as held in [Comm v. Raban](http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-3-2013do.pdf).\n\nA pedestrian's recourse is to notify the police (leaving aside his recourse if the dogs break free and attack him). The presence of chicken wire might be proffered as a defense against prosecution, and then it would come down to questions about the effectiveness of the wire patch. A simple test is, throw a reasonable sized pumpkin at it, and if it gives way, a pit bull *could* escape."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to Pennsylvania law, which of the following statements is correct regarding the scenario with the dogs and the damaged fence?\n\nA) The thin wire mesh is legally sufficient as long as the dogs have not actually escaped.\n\nB) The homeowner is only in violation if the dogs have previously attacked someone.\n\nC) The unsecured wire mesh likely does not comply with the law requiring dogs to be firmly secured.\n\nD) Local police are required to immediately enforce the law if a complaint is filed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The law requires dogs to be \"firmly secured by a means of collar and chain or other device so that it cannot stray beyond the premises on which it is secured.\" An unsecured wire mesh that is only 2.5-3 feet tall and held up by stacks of firewood likely does not meet this standard, as it does not firmly secure the dogs or prevent them from potentially straying. The law focuses on prevention, not just whether an escape has occurred. Answer A is incorrect because the legal requirement is about firm securing, not just preventing actual escape. B is incorrect because the confinement law applies regardless of previous attacks. D is incorrect because while police can enforce the law, they often prioritize based on available resources and may not immediately respond to all complaints."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87104/is-it-legal-to-use-a-friends-online-gambling-account-with-their-consent", "docs_id": 87104, "title": "Is it legal to use a friend&#39;s online gambling account with their consent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the United States, assuming a friend creates an online gambling account legally, and gives you full consent to use the account, are there any potential legal ramifications?

The relevant provisions are set out below.\n\nFirst, the definition of insider dealing which is relevant to the scenario:\n\n> 52(1\\) An individual who has information as an insider is guilty of\n> insider dealing if, in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (3\\),\n> he deals in securities that are price\\-affected securities in relation\n> to the information.\n> \n> \n> 52(3\\) The circumstances referred to above are that the acquisition or\n> disposal in question occurs on a regulated market, or that the person\n> dealing relies on a professional intermediary or is himself acting as\n> a professional intermediary.\n\nThis is subject to a number of defences, one of which is:\n\n> 52(4\\) This section has effect subject to section 53\\.\n> \n> \n> 53 (1\\) An individual is not guilty of insider dealing by virtue of\n> dealing in securities if he shows \u2014 \\[...] (b) that at the time he\n> believed on reasonable grounds that the information had been disclosed\n> widely enough to ensure that none of those taking part in the dealing\n> would be prejudiced by not having the information, \\[...]\n\nIn order to understand the definition at section 52(1\\) above, we need to turn to the interpretation sections (emphasis added to show the terms which are being defined):\n\n> 55(1\\) For the purposes of this Part, a person **deals in securities** if\n> (a) he acquires or disposes of the securities (whether as principal or\n> agent); or (b) he procures, directly or indirectly, an acquisition or\n> disposal of the securities by any other person.\n\n> 57(1\\) For the purposes of this Part, a person has **information as an\n> insider** if and only if (a) it is, and he knows that it is, inside\n> information, and (b) he has it, and knows that he has it, from an\n> inside source.\n\n> 57(2\\) For the purposes of subsection (1\\), a person has\n> **information from an inside source** if and only if (a) he has it through\n> (i) being a director, employee or shareholder of an issuer of\n> securities; or (ii) having access to the information by virtue of his\n> employment, office or profession; or (b) the direct or indirect source\n> of his information is a person within paragraph (a).\n\n> 56 (1\\) For the purposes of this section and section 57, **\u201cinside\n> information\u201d** means information which (a) relates to particular\n> securities or to a particular issuer of securities or to particular\n> issuers of securities and not to securities generally or to issuers of\n> securities generally; (b) is specific or precise; (c) has not been\n> made public; and (d) if it were made public would be likely to have a\n> significant effect on the price of any securities.\n> \n> \n> 56(2\\) For the purposes of this Part, securities are **\u201cprice\\-affected\n> securities\u201d** in relation to inside information, and inside information\n> is \u201cprice\\-sensitive information\u201d in relation to securities, if and\n> only if the information would, if made public, be likely to have a\n> significant effect on the price of the securities.\n\nNote that information is not inside information if it has been made public, pursuant to section 56(1\\)(c) above. So we now need to turn to the definition of \"made public\":\n\n> 58(1\\) For the purposes of section 56, \u201c**made public**\u201d, in relation to\n> information, shall be construed in accordance with the following\n> provisions of this section; **but those provisions are not exhaustive as\n> to the meaning of that expression**.\n> \n> \n> 58(2\\) Information **is** made public if (a) it is published in accordance\n> with the rules of a regulated market for the purpose of informing\n> investors and their professional advisers; (b) it is contained in\n> records which by virtue of any enactment are open to inspection by the\n> public; (c) it can be readily acquired by those likely to deal in any\n> securities (i) to which the information relates, or (ii) of an issuer\n> to which the information relates; or (d) it is derived from\n> information which has been made public.\n> \n> \n> 58(3\\) Information **may be** treated as made public even though (a)it can\n> be acquired only by persons exercising diligence or expertise; (b) it\n> is communicated to a section of the public and not to the public at\n> large; (c) it can be acquired only by observation; (d) it is\n> communicated only on payment of a fee; or (e) it is published only\n> outside the United Kingdom.\n\nLooking at the bolded parts, information may be considered to have been made public even though it is not in a manner explicitly listed in section 58(2\\). However, if a person wants to be absolutely sure that they will not commit the offence, then they would be advised to use one of those methods in 58(2\\). The bolded word \"is\" there ensures that it cannot be called into question. A person working in a listed company will almost invariably use the method in 58(2\\)(1\\): \"*published in accordance with the rules of a regulated market for the purpose of informing investors and their professional advisers*\"\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nI'm working on the assumption that we are talking about shares which are listed on a regulated market. \"Regulated market\" also has a specific definition but I won't get into that other than to say that there are markets which are not regulated for the purpose of this offence.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n*It is possible for an influent (private) agent, namely someone who has the power to direct the market, to buy a stock before giving a positive announcement about the stock itself?*\n\nThis will likely result in commiting the offence of insider dealing, assuming that person and the information falls within the defintions above.\n\n*Does his investment need to be public so that other investors can understand that his move can be just a manipulation of stock's value?*\n\nThis is likely insufficient. It is the *inside information* which must be made public, not the mere fact that he is purchasing the shares. So again, the offence is likely to be committed.\n\nTo avoid committing the offence, the person should make the positive announcement about the stock (preferably in accordance with s 58(2\\)) and only *then* make the purchase for himself."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An influential private investor learns of positive news about a company that has not yet been made public.

Even if he is unable to find work, surely as the spouse of a US citizen he ought to be able to stay in the US for longer than six months pending final approval of permanent residence status. Is this not the case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: He cannot get K1 since he is married. K1 is only for fianc\u00e9s. There is the K3 visa for spouses of US citizens who are waiting on a pending I\\-130, but K3 has been obsolete for many years, and he is very unlikely to get a K3 even if he applies for it. My understanding is that they process he I\\-130 and the I\\-129F for K3 together, and the I\\-129F will not be approved faster than the I\\-130, at which point one is no longer eligible for K3 and will continue processing for the immigrant visa directly.\n(Also note that if he enters the US on K3, he would have to apply for Adjustment of Status, which is expensive and takes a year or more, before he becomes a permanent resident, whereas if he enters the US on an immigrant visa, he becomes a permanent resident immediately.)\n\nIf he were inside the US and applying for a green card through Adjustment of Status in the US, he would be eligible to apply for an EAD (employment authorization document) for free together with the Adjustment of Status filing, which would allow him to work in the US after a few months while his Adjustment of Status is still pending. However, since he is outside the US and getting a green card via Consular Processing for an immigrant visa, that is not available to him. And he cannot enter the US as a visitor or most other types of nonimmigrant status with a preconceived intent to file Adjustment of Status during that stay.\n\nHaving a pending or approved I\\-130 does not allow him to stay in or work in the US. As he is doing Consular Processing, he does not have the ability to stay in the US until he enters the US with his immigrant visa (at which point he would be a permanent resident). People doing Adjustment of Status can stay in the US while the application is pending, but Adjustment of Status is only for people applying from within the US.\n\nMost types of nonimmigrant status, including TN work status, are subject to presumption of immigrant intent, and so he would be very likely to be denied entry even if he had a job offer, since he is planning to immigrate to the US very soon. The only work statuses that are not subject to immigrant intent are H1b and L1, and those are not likely available to him in the near future (H1b has a lottery and requires entry in the April before work starts in October. L1 is for intra\\-company transferees who have already worked for the company for 1 year.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A Canadian citizen married to a U.S. citizen is awaiting his green card through Consular Processing.

There is no such provision.

The classic and most obvious case is the use of eminent domain to aquire actual title to the property by a government (Federal, State, or local). This is always a takign, and compensation nis required. The more questionable cases have occurred when some law or regulation leaves the owner with title, but significantly restricts the uses to which the property may be put, particularly when the existing use becomes unlawful. Courts have ruled in different ways in such cases, but I think the current standard is that when a regulation removes all, or almost all, economic value from the property there has been a \"regulatory taking\" and compensation must be paid.\n\nBut as far as I know, a tax on the property has never been considered to be a taking inn this sense."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the U.S. Constitution and legal interpretations, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding property rights and government actions?\n\nA) The Constitution explicitly states that citizens have an absolute right to property that cannot be infringed upon under any circumstances.\n\nB) Property taxes are considered a form of \"regulatory taking\" and require just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nC) The \"takings clause\" in the Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from imposing any restrictions on property use.\n\nD) The government may impose property taxes and certain regulations on property use without violating constitutional protections, as long as they don't remove all economic value from the property.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The Constitution does not explicitly guarantee an absolute right to property. The Fifth Amendment's \"takings clause\" requires just compensation when private property is taken for public use, but this has been interpreted to allow for property taxes and regulations. Courts have ruled that a \"regulatory taking\" occurs only when regulations remove all or almost all economic value from a property. Property taxes have not been considered a \"taking\" in this sense.

The would\\-be cover artist can either negotiate for permission and a royalty rate, or use a compulsory license, known as a \"mechanical license\", at a royalty rate fixed by law. The right to do this is given by [17 USC 115](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#115). However that section of the copyright law is rather complex and confusing. The [Nolo press explanation of cover rights](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/question-when-mechanical-royalty-due-28002.html) says:\n\n> To record a song for release to the public, a performer must obtain permission from the music publisher of the song and pay a fee, called a mechanical royalty. A mechanical royalty must be paid when songs are reproduced, for example on compact discs or records.\n\n> There are two ways to get permission and pay the mechanical royalty:\n\n> * A compulsory license may be used, and the preset statutory mechanical royalty rate paid directly to the music publisher\u2014the easiest, least stressful method.\n> * Permission and a mechanical royalty may be negotiated directly with the music publisher or the Harry Fox Agency.\n\n> Under the compulsory license procedures, you need not ask the music publisher's permission to make the recording or negotiate a license fee. Instead, you merely inform the publisher of the recording and pay a license fee set by law.\n\n> You can get helpful information about the procedure by downloading Circular 50, Copyright Registration for Musical Compositions, from the U.S. Copyright Office.\n\n> When using the compulsory license procedure, the music publisher must be paid a mechanical royalty rate set by the government\u2014sometimes known as the statutory rate.\n\nThere are additional restrictions. A mechanical license is not available unless the4 copyright owner has previously made or authorized a recording of the work and released it for distribution. A mechanical license is only available for the purpose of creating and distributing copied for individual use, not for broadcast.\n\nHowever, as explained in [this Soundfly article](https://flypaper.soundfly.com/hustle/how-to-legally-cover-a-song/) if the musical work is presented along with any visual content, such as a video, a \"synchronization license\" is also needed. This would very likely apply to a video game. As Soundfly says:\n\n> Typically, in order to acquire a sync license, you just need to ask the publisher. Unfortunately, there are no set prices for this kind of thing \u2013 we don\u2019t even have a pricing scale available! Sometimes you can get it for free, and other times it\u2019s going to cost you dearly. Hopefully, it won\u2019t be the latter.\n\nThis is not covered by the compulsory (mechanical) license, and must be obtained via negotiation. That means the would\\-be user must find out who the copyright holder is first.\n\nBy the way, the compulsory license is called \"mechanical\" because this provision was originally passed to permit making rolls for player pianos, which reproduced notes mechanically.\n\nIn short, both a cover license and a sync license are needed, and the second must be negotiated.\n\nSee also [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version#U.S._copyright_law)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A video game developer wants to include a cover version of a popular song in their game.

A synchronization license: This is needed because the song will be synchronized with visual content (the video game).

One simple way to see this is that people who do not itemize their deductions have never been able to take this tax deduction. \n\nThe power of the federal government to impose taxes is not entirely unlimited under the U.S. Constitution, but it has the express power to impose an income tax, and income defined without a state and local tax deduction is not so far afield from the meaning of \"income\" that it ceases to be an income tax without it.\n\nIn contrast, denying a deduction for the cost of goods sold of a business, converts the income tax from an income tax to a sales tax and this interpretation when applied in the case of Internal Revenue Code Section 280E was held to violate the constitution, forcing a different interpretation of that section that allowed a cost of goods sold deduction, in order to make the section constitutional.\n\nTherefore, the hypothetical case has little legal merit."}, "answer": "Question: Based on the constitutional powers of Congress and the information provided about state and local tax deductions, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the constitutionality of the 2018 federal tax plan?\n\nA) The removal of state and local tax deductions is unconstitutional because it disproportionately affects high-tax states.\n\nB) Congress has unlimited power to levy taxes, making any federal tax plan constitutional by default.\n\nC) The 2018 tax plan is likely constitutional as Congress has the express power to impose income taxes, and removing deductions does not fundamentally alter the nature of the tax.\n\nD) The tax plan would only be constitutional if it allowed deductions for the cost of goods sold in business income calculations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided.

I want to protect my assets from creditors. If I put my personal assets into my business, will they be protected? From what I understand, Wyoming and some other states are business friendly in their incorporation laws. But if I am doing business in another state and residing in another state, will the credit dispute be covered under the laws of the state of incorporation, or my state of residency, because that changes things significantly. For example, that may mean that I would be better off forming the LLC in my resident state rather than in another state if the other state's laws do not apply in a special case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It sounds like what you are discussing is a personal liability unrelated to the business which you want to protect from your personal creditors by contributing to an LLC.\n\nThis is not the usual way that an LLC is used to limit liability. Normally, the idea is that you put business assets into the LLC and that creditors of the LLC arising out of contracts that the LLC enters into and out of legal wrongs committed by the LLC in which you did not have personal involvement (which would give rise to personal liability on your part) are limited to collecting from the assets that have been put in the LLC, thereby protecting your personal assets.\n\nThe reverse is not true. As a general rule, ownership interests in an entity are not exempt from the claims of a general creditor of the owner of the entity. What practical rights this gives a creditor, however, in the case of a closely held unincorporated entity (like an LLC with a small number of members) is a bit involved.\n\nSo, while sometimes, the ownership of an asset in the LLC form may provide, as an accidental consequence of the procedures involved in enforcing a judgment, some degree of asset protection, this has no policy justifications or intentional legislative intent to provide asset protection to support it, so courts feel more free to find artificial solutions to the artificial problems created by this kind of tactic.\n\nSo, suppose that you do have personal assets that you do put into an LLC and a personal creditor tries to satisfy a judgment out of those assets.\n\nThere are basically six avenues available to your personal creditor (you can quibble with my lumping and grouping of remedies to get a different number and I'm sure there are one or two I have omitted):\n\n1. Impose a \"charging order\" upon the LLC or garnish amounts that the LLC owes to you. (A 'charging order\" includes future amounts that will come due, a garnishment pertains to amounts that are currently enforceable debts that you are owed from the LLC.) Basically this involves tapping your income stream from the LLC much as you might garnish wages. Typically 100% of the amount distributed from the LLC would be subject to diversion to the creditor. This remedy is almost always available to a creditor of an LLC owner.\n2. Execute upon and seize your membership interest in the LLC much as you would on shares of stock in a large publicly held company. The creditor gets your ownership interest in the LLC as property for payment of the debt, and that LLC interest then, in turn, can be used potentially to either access the assets that the LLC owns or to force the dissolution of the LLC and related distribution of its assets to the owners (one of whom would be your personal creditor). Often the law regarding the availability of this remedy is undeveloped and unclear. The Court could also order you to turn over your membership interest in the LLC to the creditor, or to exercise your voting rights in the membership interest to take particular actions that you have a right to take.\n3. Attack the transfer of personal assets to the LLC as a fraudulent transfer made with an intent to conceal assets from present or future creditors, or to hinder collection of present or future debts. This remedy is almost always available. This remedy is also particularly likely to be utilized if the debt was in existence at the time of the transfer, if the assets transferred do not generate income, and if the assets transferred are used for personal benefit by the person transferring them to the LLC.\n4. Attack the LLC's very existence as an alter ego of you that should be ignored entirely. I am aware of bankruptcy court cases that do this in the case of single member LLCs. This is harder to argue in the case of multiple member LLCs where the other owners are distinct from you and not obligated on your personal debt. This is sometimes called \"reverse veil piercing\" and is expressly authorized by case law in most states that have considered the issue at all.\n5. The court in which the judgment was entered could issue an order directing you, if you controlled the entity, to turn over the asset owned by the LLC to the creditor as an equitable remedy and injunction punishable by contempt of court if not honored (this is particularly common in child support and alimony judgment cases). This is generally not possible, however, in the case of an LLC in which you do not have a controlling interest and are instead a minority interest owner.\n6. The creditor could force you into an involuntary bankruptcy in which your membership interest in the LLC is distributed to creditors as an asset of the bankruptcy estate, in which case federal bankruptcy law would govern.\n\nAll of these remedies would ordinarily be pursued in the court where the money judgment against you was obtained by your personal creditor. This would as a default apply the law of the jurisdiction where the court is located.\n\nBut, it is plausible and maybe even likely that the court where the judgment was entered would consider the law of the state of formation of the LLC with respect to the first two remedies (LLC's are \"formed\" or \"organized\" in a jurisdiction, never \"incorporated\").\n\nMy language regarding choice of law is equivocal because modern choice of law rules are very vague and wishy washy and subject to manipulation. In the 19th century and early 20th century, choice of law rules were typically clear, bright line rules that left no doubt regarding which jurisdiction's law applied to a dispute. But, in the late 20th century, the law evolved and is now extremely vague in most cases, for example, stating that \"the law with the most significant relationship\" to a legal issue should be applied."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A debtor transfers personal assets to a single-member LLC formed in Wyoming, while residing and conducting business in California.

While the LLC is formed in Wyoming, the creditor would likely pursue remedies in the California court where the judgment was obtained. The court has several potential avenues to reach the assets, including charging orders, fraudulent transfer claims, alter ego arguments (especially for single-member LLCs), and equitable remedies. While the court may consider Wyoming law for some LLC-specific issues (like charging orders), it's not limited to Wyoming remedies. The creditor is not restricted to only a charging order (A), nor is veil-piercing automatically easy (B). The assets are not fully protected simply by using a Wyoming LLC (C).

However, this doesn't mean countries can avoid accountability for treaty obligations simply by delaying incorporation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because in dualist systems, signing a treaty doesn't automatically make it part of domestic law.\n\nOption B is partially true in that countries can delay incorporation, but it's misleading because countries can still be held accountable internationally for treaty obligations even if they haven't incorporated them domestically.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, as the passage states, \"In general, no country is a pure dualist.\" There's always some interaction between international and domestic law.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the complexity of dualist systems, where countries may be bound by international obligations even before they've fully incorporated them into domestic law, as seen in the example of Australia and human rights treaties."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17675/transfer-of-ownership-of-a-trademarked-domain-name", "docs_id": 17675, "title": "Transfer of Ownership of a Trademarked Domain Name", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Building upon the question \"[What is the relation between Trademarks and Domains?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17519/what-is-the-relation-between-trademarks-and-domains)\":\n\n> ...if I register a domain when no trademark exists, but then someone\n>  registers the trademark...\n> \n> \n> Can that person sue me and take out the domain, which I bought before\n>  she acquired the trademark?\n\nAnd assuming that the [slightly more popular answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/17579/11177) (at the time of this writing) that interprets [WIPO's overview](http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/overview2.0/#31) and asserts the following:\n\n> ...if the domain was originally registered in good faith, it will not be transferred even if a trademark is registered later...\n\n**Does this mean that the *current owner* of the trademarked domain, purchased in \"good faith\", must either use, sit on, or let the domain expire, but cannot sell/transfer this domain to a *third\\-party*?** *(Presumably because the third\\-party will be purchasing a trademarked domain \\-\\- possibly in \"bad faith\")*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No.\n\nFirst, there is nothing to prevent a current registrant selling a domain to someone acting in bad faith. The only remedies that the UDRP provides are transfer and cancellation, neither of which can affect a party which has already sold the domain.\n\nFor the new owner, the three\\-prong test at UDRP para 4(a) still applies. A complaint will be upheld if\n\n> (i) your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and\n> \n> \n> (ii) you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and\n> \n> \n> (iii) your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\n\nIn this case, the \"you\" now refers to the (possibly bad faith) purchaser of a domain from the original (good faith) registrant.\n\nIf the new owner has purchased the domain solely for cybersquatting, this clearly satisfies all three prongs (and therefore would likely be transferred). This is the situation regardless of whether it was purchased from a current registrant or registered anew. But if the new owner has legitimate rights in the domain (and therefore does not satisfy prong (ii)), the complaint would not be upheld.\n\n**Hypothetical example**\n\nBy way of hypothetical example, there was the very famous (but settled well before the UDRP) dispute between Apple (the Beatles' music company) and Apple (the computer company). Both parties owned a trademark for \"APPLE\" (albeit in different fields).\n\nOne day Apple (Music) buys the domain apple.com from a small\\-town fruit vendor (the original good faith registrant), with a view to preventing Apple (Computer) from having it. This is identical to a trademark in which Apple (Computer) has (and so prong (i) is satisfied). This was done in bad faith to affect Apple (Computer) (and so prong (iii) is satisfied). But Apple (Music) has legitimate interests in the domain, in that they have a business and trademarks of their own by that name. So prong (ii) is not satisfied, and so a complaint would not be upheld. Nor would a complaint be possible against the small\\-town fruit vendor (since they don't own the domain, so there is no possible remedy against them)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner registers the domain \"innovativetech.com\" for their local computer repair shop. Years later, a large tech company called Innovative Technologies Inc. obtains a trademark for \"Innovative Tech\".

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential outcomes of this situation?\n\nA) The original small business owner could be held liable for cybersquatting, even though they registered the domain before the trademark existed.\n\nB) Innovative Technologies Inc. has no recourse against the domain investor because the domain was originally registered in good faith.\n\nC) The domain investor is automatically protected from any UDRP complaints because they purchased the domain from a good faith registrant.\n\nD) Innovative Technologies Inc. could potentially win a UDRP complaint against the domain investor if all three prongs of the UDRP test are satisfied.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because the UDRP complaint would be evaluated based on the current owner's (the domain investor's) use of the domain, not the original registrant's good faith registration. If Innovative Technologies Inc. can prove that (i) the domain is identical or confusingly similar to their trademark, (ii) the domain investor has no rights or legitimate interests in the domain, and (iii) the domain is being used in bad faith (e.g., to profit from the trademark's reputation), they could potentially win the complaint. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the original owner's good faith registration protects them from liability. Option B is incorrect because the good faith of the original registrant doesn't automatically protect subsequent owners.

Should I show the part in smaller size, I mean in screen\\-split form or picture\\-in\\-picture form?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A review is a classic occasion for fair use under US law, for fair dealing under UK law, and for other exceptions to copyright under the laws of a number of other countries, including many of the EU countries. However, such exceptions usually require that no more of the copyrighted work is used than is needed to demonstrate and support the reviewer's points.\n\nIt is usual in a review of a film or video to show only very brief clips, usually a few seconds or a minute or so at a time. There is no specific limit on how long an excerpt may be used in a review without the review constituting copyright infringement, this is judged on a case\\-by\\-case basis. But if the reviewer actually includes a full fifteen\\-minute clip, that might be held to be too much.\n\nNote that the reviewer can, and often will, **discuss** the entire film. But it is not usual to \"show\" the entire film. Just a a book review normally quotes only a few paragraphs, even as it discusses the entire book, a film review normally includes only short clips of scenes significant to whatever points the reviewer makes.\n\nIn US law, a significant issue is whether the review can \"function as a substitute for the original\" (17 USC 107\\). That is, whether people are likely to watch the review and come away feeling as if they had seen the entire film, and so need not watch the original. If sop, it is more likely to be considered an infringement.\n\nI can only speak to what might be an infringement of copyright under the law of various countries. I cannot speak to YouTube policies or how such policies might be applied. But my understanding is that YouTube only applies \"demonetization\" to things that it considers clearly copyright infringements, although sometimes it is overly cautions in such decisions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A YouTube content creator wants to review a 15-minute segment of a movie, offering psychological and philosophical interpretations.

The documentation emphasizes that reviews typically use \"very brief clips, usually a few seconds or a minute or so at a time\" to support the reviewer's points. This approach is least likely to substitute for the original work and most likely to fall under fair use protection.\n\nOption A uses too much of the original content without interspersion of commentary, which could be seen as a substitute for the original.\n\nOption B, while reducing the visual impact, still shows the entire 15-minute segment, which may be considered excessive for fair use.\n\nOption D, like B, shows the entire segment and could potentially function as a substitute for the original, even if commentary is provided simultaneously.\n\nThe correct approach (C) allows the reviewer to discuss the entire film while only showing short, relevant clips to support their analysis, which aligns with typical fair use practices for reviews."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79558/is-it-possible-to-send-an-additional-email-to-people-who-didnt-confirm-their-su", "docs_id": 79558, "title": "Is it possible to send an additional email to people who didn&#39;t confirm their subscription?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We are wondering if we can send another email to people who subscribed to our newsletter but never clicked on the confirmation link sent afterwards.

Sending an email is a form of processing the data that is the email address, whch is surely personal data (PD) and thus requires a lawful basis under GDPR Article 6\\.\n\nAs the comment by user PMF points out, confirmation of an email is normally requested because it is possible for someone to register someone else's email. If the confirmation is not completed, a data controller (DC) should consider the possibility that the initial subscription was in fact by someone other than the owner of the email address provided. There is no specific rule in the GDPR on how many times one may request confirmation in such circumstances. I would think it poor practice to overdo this. It might be good practice for any confirmation email to provide a link or address or means by which the person can communicate the concept \"I did not subscribe\". But nothing in the GDPR requires this, although a data erasure request would have much the same effect.\n\nIt might also be well in any confirmation request to remind the DS of his or her rights to request access, modification, or deletion of any PD held by the DC about the DS.

The GDPR does not specifically regulate the number of confirmation emails that can be sent. However, it's considered good practice to be cautious with follow-up emails because the initial subscription might have been made by someone other than the email address owner. While sending a follow-up is not explicitly prohibited, companies should be mindful of this possibility and not overdo confirmation requests.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the GDPR doesn't prohibit follow-up emails entirely. Option B is too permissive and doesn't consider the potential issues with repeated contact.

Calling someone \"murderer\" or \"pedophile\" might cross the line into libel, which is unprotected, or it might be punished as \"fighting words\" if it could be expected to provoke the subject to violence.\n\nAnother qualification is that the government has a bit more leeway to regulate speech when it is acting as an employer rather than as the government.

It is the controller's job to decide which measures are appropriate, taking into account possible risks.\n\nFor an employment context, I'd think the important part is that anyone accessing this data is bound to discretion regarding the data they will see. Whether this is ensured by an employment contract or another legal mechanism is not important.\n\nThere is one subtlety though: employees of the controller act on behalf of the controller, and aren't a third party. In contrast, non\\-employees are third parties. They are either controllers of their own, or they are processors that serve the controller. If a controller takes on a processor, this requires a contract with certain items.\n\nSo while I think that an data controller can decide to give an employee access to some data under whatever circumstances the controller deems appropriate, they cannot give a not\\-yet employee such access.

And, under U.S. tax law, a partnership must allocate all of its taxable income and all of its expenditures with U.S. income tax effects to some partner in the partnership in a manner consistent with U.S. partnership tax laws and regulations (which basically means that the allocation must have \"substantial economic effect\").\n\nNotwithstanding this fact, [for purposes of federal employment taxes and certain federal excise taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/llc-filing-as-a-corporation-or-partnership), an LLC with an employee subject to U.S. employment taxes, or that owes federal excise taxes (e.g. because it has a U.S. firearm dealer's license in force upon which an annual excise tax is due even if it has no firearm sales in a given year) must still file the tax returns associated with these federal taxes.\n\nWhether it has to file a state tax return is a question of Wyoming tax law. Wyoming does not have a generally applicable state income tax, but it does have other state taxes and fees that could conceivable apply in some circumstances, such as its annual LLC registration fee.\n\nIf the LLC had instead been organized under the law of a foreign country, for example, as a GmbH under German law, which is an \"eligible entity\" that can elect to be taxed as a partnership under U.S. income tax law, it would instead be a foreign partnership and [subject to the following filing requirements](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1065#en_US_2021_publink11392vd0e545):\n\n> Generally, a foreign partnership that has gross income effectively\n> connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United\n> States (ECI) or has gross income derived from sources in the United\n> States (U.S. source income) must file Form 1065, even if its principal\n> place of business is outside the United States or all its members are\n> foreign persons.

According to the IRS instructions for Form 1065, a domestic partnership (which includes a U.S. LLC taxed as a partnership) is only required to file Form 1065 if it receives income or incurs expenditures treated as deductions or credits for federal income tax purposes. In this case, the Wyoming LLC has no U.S. source income and no expenditures that would give rise to U.S. tax deductions or credits. Therefore, it is not required to file Form 1065 or any other U.S. tax forms for 2023.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the LLC has no U.S. tax filing requirement in this scenario.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect for the same reason as A; additionally, if Form 1065 were required, Schedule K-1s would also be necessary regardless of the members' nationalities.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because a U.S. LLC does not need to file Form 8832 to be taxed as a partnership; this is its default classification.

The landlord's breach of contract by conducting an early inspection does not negate the tenant's responsibilities under the lease.

According to Article 13(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC, which is still applicable under GDPR as per Article 95, the use of electronic mail for direct marketing purposes is only allowed for subscribers who have given their prior consent. The recruiter did not have explicit consent to contact the individual, making their actions illegal. \n\nOption A is incorrect because deducing an email address from public information does not constitute consent. \n\nOption B is incorrect because providing an opt-out option after the fact does not replace the need for prior consent in this case. \n\nOption D is incorrect because knowing the email syntax and having contacted others at the company previously does not grant permission to contact new individuals without their consent."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26189/can-i-use-nodejs-logo-as-part-of-my-course-cover", "docs_id": 26189, "title": "Can I use nodejs logo as part of my course cover?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm starting a course about building website backends with NodeJS and I was wondering is it legal to use the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) logo as **part** of my course cover?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is creating an online course about building website backends with Node.js.

There is a \"uniform law\", [Uniform Guardianship, Conservatorship and Other Protective Arrangements Act](https://www.guardianship.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/UGCOPPAAct_UGPPAct.pdf) which would limit a guardian's power to limit visits, but this has not been enacted by Kansas, and the Kansas does not have any [such laws](https://codes.findlaw.com/ks/chapter-59-probate-code/#!tid=NB322A8E01F8811DE9E59BEA71169014E) (art 30\\), so it is a power of the conservator to restrict visitors."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Kansas, a legal guardian of an adult with autism wants to prevent the ward from communicating with family friends due to concerns about potential abuse.

Additionally, Kansas does not have specific laws limiting a guardian's authority in this regard. Therefore, under Kansas law, it falls within the powers of the conservator (guardian) to restrict visitors and communication. This makes option C the most accurate statement.

They aren't in a position to perform criminal investigations.\n\nYou might first consider telling your husband that you are calling the police. After all, the downsides for him of having a criminal record, and whatever criminal punishment there is, will far outweigh $462\\.\n\nHowever there is no guarantee that the police can prove anything.

This action is unlikely to resolve the issue.\n\nB) Contacting the bank that cashed the check is not the best first step. Banks typically rely on the signatures present on checks and are not equipped to conduct criminal investigations.\n\nC) While small claims court is an option, it's not the most appropriate initial action, especially given the criminal nature of forgery. Additionally, the legal fees and effort might not be worth it for half of $924.\n\nD) Reporting the forgery to the police is the correct first step. Forgery is a criminal offense, and law enforcement is equipped to handle such cases. This action also creates an official record of the incident, which could be useful if further legal action is necessary. The police can investigate the matter and potentially pressure the ex-husband to return the money to avoid criminal charges."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/23982/how-should-i-prepare-in-terms-of-dress-and-language-to-testify-at-a-bail-hearing", "docs_id": 23982, "title": "How should I prepare in terms of dress and language to testify at a bail hearing?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So there's this situation, where a relative of mine has been arrested and caged up with charges of a white collar crime.

Roughly what things should I say to convince the judge to let him/her go?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What are the things that I should prepare for this session, in terms\n>  of order of dress, language, content?\n\n**Dress**\n\nIn an actual court room, suit and tie is preferred for men and formal dress for women for lawyers and professionals.\n\nYour \"Sunday best\" or what you would wear to work on a typical day would be appropriate if you don't have a suit and tie or the equivalent.\n\nAvoid nightclub looks, any garment or ornament with a message, or more than minimal jewelry or accessories. For a video testimony, solids come across better than complex patterns if the video resolution turns out to be low. Your clothing should not be a message other than that you are a respectful reputable member of the community.\n\n**Language and Content**\n\nYou should avoid colloquialism or profanity (except in a quotation from someone else about what they said out of court), but should not try to affect an accent or dialect that you cannot speak naturally. If you grew up in rural West Virginia, don't try to pretend you grew up on the Harvard University campus. \n\nIf you need an interpreter, you should let someone know in advance as this can be arranged.\n\nGenerally, you should only speak in response to question, and should leave a \"beat\" between being asked and answering any question in case someone says \"I object\" before you start to answer.\n\nYou should listen to the question you are asked, truthfully answer the question you were actually asked (not necessarily the one that was intended to be asked), and stop when you have answered it. (This is harder than it seems.) If asked an open ended question, take whatever time it takes to answer it completely.\n\nIt is appropriate to instead ask for clarification of a question if you couldn't hear it properly or if you don't understand it because it uses a word you don't understand.\n\nIf the question assumes something that isn't true, correct that wrong assumption. For example: \"what did you see the defendant doing at the football game on Sunday?\" \"I didn't see the defendant doing anything at the football game on Sunday because he was having dinner with me after the baseball game on Sunday.\"\n\nDon't rush. Most people talk fast when they are nervous or try to over summarize. Everyone has gathered at this moment, in part, to hear what you have to say. Take the time necessary to say what you need to say to tell the whole story in response to the questions you are asked without summarizing the facts.\n\nA little emotion can be appropriate in your tone, but stay civil and don't blow your top. As a rule of thumb the person who seems most reasonable usually wins.\n\nThe judge can be referred to as \"your honor\". Lawyers can be referred to as \"sir\" or \"ma'm\".\n\nIn content, you will be normally asked to provide your opinion on things like \"is there any reason he would be a flight risk\" (ideally answering with not just a \"no\" but a \"he owns a home and has deep ties to the community and would never flee.\"), \"is he a threat to the public?\", \"does he have a good reputation in the community?\" (\"Yes, I'd trust him with my money and my children.\").\n\nDon't make things up, but focus on facts that reasonably demonstrate that he is unlikely to flee because he has too much to lose, firm ties, and no place to go."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When testifying at a bail hearing via video conference, which of the following is NOT an appropriate approach?\n\nA) Wear solid colors rather than complex patterns to ensure clarity on video\nB) Speak only in response to questions and pause briefly before answering\nC) Use colloquialisms and informal language to appear more relatable\nD) Provide detailed answers that demonstrate the defendant's ties to the community\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct as the documentation advises wearing solids for better video quality. \nB is appropriate, as the advice suggests leaving a \"beat\" between questions and answers. \nC is incorrect, as the guidance explicitly states to avoid colloquialisms. \nD is correct, as providing detailed answers about the defendant's community ties is recommended.\n\nThe correct answer is C because using colloquialisms and informal language is specifically advised against.

Formal, respectful language is more appropriate for a court setting, even in a video conference."}}
