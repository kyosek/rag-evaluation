ABC Inc.'s competitor, DEF Corp., discovers this and wants to leverage the situation. Which of the following actions would be most legally problematic for DEF Corp. to pursue?\n\nA) Creating a parody version of ABC Inc.'s campaign using the same Creative Commons images\nB) Using the exact same Creative Commons images in their own, entirely different marketing campaign\nC) Replicating ABC Inc.'s entire campaign layout and design, replacing only the company name and logo\nD) Publicly criticizing ABC Inc. for using Creative Commons images without proper attribution\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of copyright law and the distinction between individual elements and the overall creative work. The correct answer is C because replicating ABC Inc.'s entire campaign layout and design would likely infringe on the copyright of the campaign as a whole.\n\nOption A is legally permissible as parody is considered fair use under copyright law, even if it uses the same Creative Commons images. Option B is also legally acceptable because the Creative Commons images themselves can be freely used by anyone, including competitors, as long as they adhere to the specific license terms. Option D, while potentially damaging to ABC Inc.'s reputation, is not a legal issue related to copyright and falls under free speech.\n\nThe key concept here is that while the individual images used in the campaign may be freely available under Creative Commons licenses, the entire campaign as a creative work is protected by copyright. This protection extends to the particular arrangement and presentation of elements, even if some or all of those elements are individually not copyrightable. Therefore, replicating the entire campaign design would infringe on this copyright, making it the most legally problematic action for DEF Corp. to take.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply copyright principles to a complex real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the given information and an understanding of how copyright applies to derivative works and compilations."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35672/if-you-need-a-dba-doing-business-as-if-your-company-is-legally-named-foo-bar", "docs_id": 35672, "title": "If you need a DBA (doing business as) if your company is legally named &quot;Foo Bar Inc&quot; but you want to be branded as &quot;Foo&quot;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Say you have a company legally named one of these:\n\n* Acme Investments Inc.\n* Acme Working Group Inc.\n* Acme Bank Inc.\n* Acme Technologies Inc.\n* Acme Company Inc.\n* Acme Inc.\n\nIn all these cases, you just want to brand yourself as \"Acme\", rather than having to put the whole name like \"Acme Working Group Inc.\".

The correct answer is D for the following reasons:\n\n1. Harassment is likely to be charged because the action was specifically targeted to annoy a particular individual, even without direct contact.\n\n2. Littering is applicable as the prankster put up fliers on public property (telephone poles, bulletin boards) and did not remove them.\n\n3. Conspiracy to commit trespass is relevant because the prankster's actions directly led to at least one person entering the property without permission, even if the prankster didn't physically trespass themselves.\n\nOption A is incorrect because mail fraud isn't applicable; the scenario specifically mentions only using fliers, not the postal system.\n\nOption B is partially correct but overstates the case. Vandalism isn't mentioned in the scenario (putting up fliers isn't typically considered vandalism), and conspiracy to commit larceny would be a stretch without evidence that the prankster intended for items to be stolen.\n\nOption C is plausible but less likely.

This strategy aligns with the top answer's recommendation of the \"stronger\" option available to Mary.\n\nFiling for divorce immediately allows Mary to initiate legal proceedings that can protect her interests in the marital assets. By requesting an emergency injunction, she can potentially prevent Bob from dissipating or wasting marital assets before they can be fairly divided. As mentioned in the documentation, in some states, such an injunction takes effect as soon as divorce papers are served on the spouse.\n\nOption A (filing a civil lawsuit for fraud) is less appropriate because the scenario doesn't necessarily indicate fraud, and such a lawsuit might be premature before the divorce proceedings.\n\nOption C (contacting the 401K provider) is not legally viable, as Mary doesn't have the authority to block Bob's account access without a court order.\n\nOption D (waiting until after the divorce) is the least effective approach, as it allows Bob to potentially spend the money, making it much more difficult to recover later.\n\nWhile the \"weaker\" option of asking the divorce judge to allocate the value of imprudently spent funds to Bob during asset division is also mentioned in the documentation, it's not as immediate or preventative as the injunction approach.

The economics of the arrangement are different, but outside counsel is not more or less objective and neutral, in theory at least, than in house counsel.\n\nOutside counsel and in house counsel owe essentially the same duties in the context of a lawyer\\-client relationship to the client (in this case, the union), although, in practice, outside counsel with evaluate those duties and that relationship in the context of a single one off assignment, while in house counsel will evaluate those duties with a much richer understanding of the underlying facts of a matter and the larger context in which it is playing out.\n\nA lawyer's duty is to advance the objectives of the client, and those objective are largely within the province of the client and not the lawyer, although a lawyer has greater latitude in exercise discretion regarding the means by which this objective is achieved.\n\nFor example, a client could legitimately say that it wants to bring a lawsuit arising out of an incident it was involved in, but the lawyer would usually decide which court it was filed in, what specific legal claims were asserted, and so on.\n\n> \\[If] the lawyers didn't think they had a good chance to win, must the\n> lawyers still work to accomplish this?\n\nThere are a few boundary lines, short of resigning or withdrawing from representation when not legally or ethically required to do so, because the lawyer simply doesn't want to do it.\n\nFirst, the lawyer isn't allowed to bring groundless, frivolous, or vexatious litigation, or otherwise engage in unethical conduct (e.g. fraud), even if the client wants to do so.\n\nSecond, if a lawyer with an organization as a client (like a union) believes that someone within the organization, possibly with some authority, is about to engage in illegal activity that will hurt the organization, the lawyer has a duty to speak up (internally) about this conduct and urge the client representative not to break the law, if necessary, going up as high in the management or governance of the company as necessary (e.g. up to the highest governing board or CEO) to blow the whistle on this conduct internally within the organization, and to resign if the lawyer can't otherwise avoid being involved in illegal conduct by representatives of the organization.\n\nThird, the lawyer must counsel the client representative in a manner sufficient to make the client's decision to pursue a court of action that is unlikely to win, but is not groundless, frivolous, vexatious, or illegal, an informed decision.\n\nBut, if the client decides to go forward with a course of action or objective after making an informed decision to do so with information provided by the lawyer, the lawyer has to do his or her best to carry out the decision of the client even if it would not have been the decision that the lawyer would have made. The lawyer is still an agent of the client, carrying out the client's wishes, not an entirely independent free actor.\n\n> A member had hired a lawyer with an opposing view to the union's\n> lawyers. Would this other lawyer necessarily have to agree with this\n> view or believe there is a chance at success (e.g. proving it's\n> illegal discrimination to have a COVID policy in the workplace)?\n\nAgain, no. Lawyers don't have to agree personally with the positions that they take on behalf of their clients, so long as those positions are not groundless, frivolous, or vexatious litigation, and the lawyer's work does not otherwise engage in unethical conduct (e.g. fraud), it isn't improper for the lawyer to do that.\n\nTo provide some context for why these rules are the case, keep in mind that lawyers are in the business, primarily, of dealing with situations in which there are potential ambiguities or uncertainties in the law. Lawyers, judges, and courts recognize that the law and language are pliable and subject to interpretation and application to a set of facts and that it is very frequently (although not always) possible to make legitimate arguments for different interpretations of it. And, it is hard, in advance, to know which of multiple different interpretations will wind up being found to be correct (with many legal issues in a case often never having those ambiguities resolved in that case because some other factor ends up making the ambiguous issues irrelevant).\n\nLawyers exist to make sure that every legitimate interpretation that benefits a represented party involved in an interaction to which the law applies is given fair consideration, with someone else generally making the final decision about what to do.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that integrates multiple concepts and tests critical thinking:\n\nQuestion: A union member disagrees with the union's stance on COVID-19 workplace policies and hires their own lawyer to challenge these policies.

The key to removing the bicycle is that\n\n> In the event that a derelict bicycle is affixed to public property, a\n> notice shall be affixed to the derelict bicycle advising the owner\n> that such derelict bicycle must be removed within seven days from the\n> date of the notice. This notice shall also state that the failure to\n> remove such derelict bicycle within the designated time period will\n> result in the removal and disposal of the derelict bicycle by the\n> department of sanitation.\n\nThis ordinance is specifically addressed at the sanitation department. It does include a quasi\\-exception for ordinary citizens\n\n> Nothing in this section shall preclude the immediate removal of any\n> bicycle, including, but not limited to, a derelict bicycle or ghost\n> bike, or the taking of any other action by any city agency if the\n> presence of such bicycle which creates a dangerous condition by\n> restricting vehicular or pedestrian traffic, or otherwise violates the\n> law.\n\nWhat you should take away from the ordinances is that you are not legally authorized to remove a non\\-dangerous derelict bicycle.\n\nSupposing that you do take the law into your own hands, [this page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/services/vehicles-property/property-clerk.page) would be useful to you, because you have to turn in any abandoned property to the proper authorities. The \"have to\" part comes from [this state law](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/personal-property-law/pep-sect-252.html): please note that non\\-compliance is a crime. There is a $20 threshold for the requirement to turn in the property. An abandoned bike may be lost property under the [statutory definition of lost property](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/personal-property-law/pep-sect-251.html):\n\n> Abandoned property, waifs and treasure trove, and other property which\n> is found, shall be presumed to be lost property and such presumption\n> shall be conclusive unless it is established in an action or\n> proceeding commenced within six months after the date of the finding\n> that the property is not lost property\n\nIt is thus legally risky to not turn an abandoned bike in to the police. The police would have the discretion to arrest you for theft for vigilante bike\\-cleanup, although I suspect they have other priorities. [Larceny](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-155-05.html) is defined thus:\n\n> A person steals property and commits larceny when, with intent to\n> deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or\n> to a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such\n> property from an owner thereof.\n\nThis specifically includes \"acquiring lost property\".

That would be a startling reading of the opinion, since it would mean that the National Firearms Act\u2019s restrictions on machineguns (not challenged in Miller) might be unconstitutional, machineguns being useful in warfare in 1939\\. We think that Miller\u2019s \u201cordinary military equipment\u201d language must be read in tandem with what comes after: \u201c\\[O]rdinarily when called for \\[militia] service \\[able\\-bodied] men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\u201d 307 U.

From Blackstone through the 19th\\-century cases, commentators and courts rou\u00adtinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. \u2026Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws impos\u00ading conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n> \n> \n> We also recognize another important limitation on the\n> right to keep and carry arms.

But as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large. Indeed, it may be true that no amount of small arms could be useful against modern\\-day bombers and tanks. But the fact that modern developments have lim\u00adited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right.\n\n\u201cNobody would say machine guns have no military uses\u201d \\- indubitably.

Often transition provisions are omitted entirely from a bill.\n\nEven if the draft bill says one thing now, it is unlikely that it will be enacted in precisely that form with respect to the transition provisions (if any).\n\nWhen transition rules are omitted entirely, the agency charged with implementing the new law, the Justice Department, and the judiciary have to figure out what to do. Under a legal case called *[Chevron](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1983/82-1005)* an agency that administers a law has considerable discretion in how that law is implemented, to which the courts will defer, so long as the implementation is not contrary to any clear statutory direction.\n\n### General Concepts\n\nA core issue is whether someone has a vested right that cannot be taken from them without due process and compensation, or merely an expectancy that does not amount to a vested right. This distinction is rooted mostly in the 5th Amendment right under the U.S. Constitution to due process and to not have property taken without justice compensation, and, even though it is not directly applicable by its terms to Congress, in the contracts clause in Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution which provides that:\n\n> **No State shall** enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of\n> Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of\n> Debts; **pass any** Bill of Attainder, **ex post facto Law, or Law\n> impairing the Obligation of Contracts,** or grant any Title of\n> Nobility.\n\nThe 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states in the pertinent part:\n\n> No person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property,\n> without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for\n> public use, without just compensation.\n\nTypically, someone who had a current visa in force might have some sort of vested right, while someone who merely had an application for a visa (or which what is colloquially called a \"green card\" is one type of many) that was pending would not. Even a visa in force, however, would not always include a right to convert that visa into citizenship.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A family-based green card application for a U.S. citizen's sister has been pending for 10 years.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The RAISE Act, as described, would \"remove pathways for siblings and adult children of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to apply for permanent lawful residency status.\"\n\n2. The documentation states that \"people with pending green card applications that are not authorized under the new law, like siblings and adult children of citizens and green card holders, will probably have their applications summarily denied.\"\n\n3. The question specifies that there are no transition provisions, which eliminates the possibility of grandfathering (option A) or special accommodation (options B and D).\n\n4.

Even though Person C is a legitimate business and Person D purchased the car in good faith at an auction, this doesn't fall under the entrustment exception because Person A never voluntarily entrusted the car to Person B or C.\n\nThe entrustment doctrine doesn't apply here because the initial transfer from A to B was fraudulent, not a voluntary entrustment. If A had voluntarily given the car to B for some purpose (like restoration), and B had then sold it through C to D, the outcome might be different.\n\nIn this case, Person A retains the right to recover their property from whoever currently possesses it, which is Person D. This demonstrates the principle that one cannot pass better title than they have, even through multiple transactions.\n\nPerson D, as a good-faith purchaser who is now out of pocket, would have the right to seek compensation from Person C (the dealer who sold them the car).

Thus it begs the question why is this copyrightable material acceptable and this one is not?\n\nTo clarify the issue, the MLB logo in particular is for the Philadelphia Phillies. As a team, they've had a variety of logos over the years and based on the answers provided thus far, it seems some may be subject to copyright and others would be subject to trademark depending upon the complexity of the art. In this specific case, it's this version of their logo:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4zhH5.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4zhH5.png)\n\nAs this is more than just stylized lettering, it seems this would presumably be subject to copyright.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From the mention of a MLB shirt, I am going to assume the OP is located in the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\").\n\nLogos are (in general) copyrightable\n------------------------------------\n\nAnything with a modicum of creative input is by default copyrighted. This includes both film shots from movies and logos of sports organizations.\n\n\"Modicum of creative input\" is known as the [threshold of originality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality). That legal doctrine is in force in the US, but not in other jurisdictions \\- for instance, the UK uses \"[sweat of the brow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_of_the_brow)\" where creativity is not needed to obtain copyright protection.\n\nA still shot from a film set almost surely passes the threshold of originality. However, some logos do not.\n\nFor instance, the Pittsburgh Pirates logo is a two\\-dimensional letter P \\- somewhat stylized, but not that much. It is arguably below the threshold of copyright protection. On the other hand, the Red Socks logos (which is, well, two red socks) is almost surely copyrighted.\n\nLet us assume that the logo or imagery present on the OP's photo shirt was indeed copyrighted. Does that make the photo a copyright violation?\n\nIncidental use\n--------------\n\nIt *might* be the case that having the artwork on the shirt as an incidental part of the photograph makes it OK. In the US, such incidental use could be covered by fair use, but as always, it\u2019s a delicate balancing act. A professional photograph taken for political advertisement is going to be held to a higher standard than a blurry photo from your aunt\u2019s Facebook gallery.\n\nDmitry Grigoryev says in comments that walking around with a Star Wars shirt could be construed as distributing (via public display) a copyrighted work. However, \"putting it on and walking around\" is an essential function of a shirt. Absent terms to the contrary, whoever sells a shirt with a copyrighted design grants an implied license to the shirt\\-wearer to move about with that shirt. \\[EDIT: see Mayken\u2019s comment, that\u2019s a statutory exception to copyright.] The scope of such implied licenses can be unclear, though, and it could arguably not extend to promotional photographs for political advertisements.\n\nNote [a recent case in Germany](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/urheberrechtsverletzung-durch-aufnahmen-von-hotelzimmern-mit-fototapete) [(link to judgement, in German)](https://www.justiz.nrw.de/nrwe/lgs/koeln/lg_koeln/j2022/14_O_350_21_Urteil_20220818.html) where it was held that a hotel posting online pictures of its rooms, including a wallpaper design, violated the copyright of the designer. I am not familiar enough with German copyright law to determine if an appeal of that lower\\-court decision would have any chance of success, but I think that ruling is reasonable within the general principles of EU copyright law. (Whether it is *morally* acceptable is of course another thing entirely.)\n\nNon\\-legal explanations\n-----------------------\n\nIt is also possible that the photographer or another PR staff member would rather have the politician associated with baseball than with Star Wars for image reasons, and copyright is only a pretext for that.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Simple, stylized logos may not meet the \"threshold of originality\" required for copyright protection. The documentation mentions that some logos, like a stylized letter P, might be below this threshold.\n\n2.

The key factors to consider are:\n\n1. Originality and authorship: As established in the Feist Publications case, copyright requires \"independent creation plus a modicum of creativity.\" The photographer's creative input in choosing the location, setting up the equipment, and designing the capture process meets this threshold.\n\n2.

Yet, pseudonymization is suggested as an safety measure in various places, so that pseudonymization should be implemented wherever appropriate.\n\nThe most useful guidance the GDPR gives is by contrasting pseudonymization with anonymization, where it says that pseudonymized data is still personal data because the data subjects can be identified using additional information (see [Recital 26 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-26/)). In contrast, re\\-identification is not reasonably likely for truly anonymized data.\n\nA common technique for pseudonymization is to replace identifying information with a pseudonym, for example replacing a name with a random numeric ID. However, this can only be considered pseudonymous if the mapping between the ID and the real value is not available to whoever uses this data.\n\nReplacing individual fields in a data set might not be sufficient for pseudonymization because apparently non\\-sensitive fields could still enable indirect identification. This requires careful analysis taking into account the entire context of the data, so it isn't possible to say whether merely removing names \\+ email addresses achieves pseudonymization or anonymization.\n\nWhat you are doing is redacting *parts* of sensitive data. I think this is a pretty weak pseudonymization method since it still leaks partial information about the true value, and leaks information about the length of the redacted value. It is possible to argue that this is OK (e.g. if you can show that you have multiple similar redactions so that you achieve a level of k\\-anonymity). But by default, such partial redactions are likely to be unsafe. Completely removing the sensitive data is much safer.\n\nThe \u201cArticle 29 Working Party\u201d, a pre\\-GDPR EU body, has published an [opinion on anonymization techniques in 2014 (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp216_en.pdf). It does not account for the GDPR's specific phrasing, but provides an overview of pseudonymization and anonymization techniques and puts them into context of European data protection law. It considers how such guarantees guard against attacks such as singling out data subjects, linking multiple records of the same individual, and making inferences about the data subject.\n\nIn this guidance, pseudonymization techniques that are suggested include encrypting or hashing the sensitive data. However, the guidance warns that such techniques do not provide strong protection against singling out or linking records of the data subject.\n\nA bit earlier, the [UK ICO had published guidance on personal data, including on the matter of anonymization and pseudonymization (PDF)](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1061/anonymisation-code.pdf) with some good examples. For determining whether a data set has been successfully anonymized (or pseudonymized), they suggest a motivated intruder test: could someone without specialist knowledge or skills re\\-identify the data subject? In your example, such a person should not be able to infer that a record about `Stxxx Axxdxrxn` is about a `Steve Anderson`. In my opinion, your pseudonymization approach would fail the motivated intruder test unless you have multiple records that could all be about Steve Anderson (compare k\\-anonymity).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about GDPR and pseudonymization, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A startup is developing a data analytics platform that processes customer information from various e-commerce websites.

Option A is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. It replaces identifying information (name and email) with a pseudonym (hash), which is a recommended technique mentioned in the documentation.\n2. The hash-to-identity mapping is kept separate, fulfilling the GDPR requirement that pseudonymized data should only be identifiable with additional information.\n3. It allows for data utility in analytics while protecting individual identities.\n4.

If you don't distribute those copies, though, it could be quite difficult for the copyright holder to know anything about it. Whether you acquired the original work legally or illegally has no bearing on the legality of making copies and derivatives.\n\nFan art is generally [*prima facie*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/prima_facie) copyright infringement, since it creates a derivative work without permission from the copyright holder. However, it may be permissible under fair use \\-\\- but remember that \"permissible under fair use\" means that when you *are being sued*, you may be able to convince a judge that your use is fair, despite being *prima facie* copyright infringement. It is possible that a particular fan work could be sufficiently transformative and well\\-aligned with the [four fair use factors](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/) to qualify as fair use, but there's no way to know until it is the subject of legal action and a judge assesses the case. \n\nYou see fan art everywhere, despite its unfavorable legal status, because in general, it is not worth the trouble for artists, authors, and corporations to pursue legal action. They will probably see no tangible benefit to justify their legal expenses, since, unlike verbatim copying of their works, fan art does not typically impact their profits. Furthermore it could be harmful to their reputation to be aggressively litigious against their own fans.\n\nTrademark is only relevant if you are using the mark in commerce to identify the source of goods or services.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Creating derivative works based on copyrighted material without permission is generally considered prima facie copyright infringement, even if the original work was legally obtained.\n\n2. However, fan art and other transformative works may potentially be defended under the fair use doctrine. This defense is not guaranteed and would need to be evaluated by a judge based on the four fair use factors if legal action were taken.\n\n3. The significant modifications, new scenes, and storylines mentioned could potentially support a fair use argument by demonstrating transformative use.\n\n4. Option A is incorrect because owning legitimate copies of the games does not grant the right to create and distribute derivative works.\n\n5. Option B is too absolute, as fair use possibilities exist even when using copyrighted material without permission.\n\n6. Option D is incorrect because the legality of fan art does not solely depend on profit or trademark use.

Can you forbid companies or people to take their games out of your game or platform and make their own game using their own platform or someone's else platform, or take ownership of the intellectual property? I am thinking such an abusive user agreement would not be upheld in a court of law, but I could be wrong. Let's assume this is in the United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, *you* cannot seize anything. The courts can, and you can ask the courts to do so for you. So the logic of this is that you operate a website that hosts software that creates something for a user. You could just unconditionally let people use it, you could require a subscription, or you could be like SE and put up a TOS with some conditions, like \"you grant us a perpetual license to use your stuff\". Users then have to agree to this in order to get access to your software.\n\nSo the answer to your question depends on whether you can write a legally\\-enforceable contract where you provide something of value in exchange for a user giving you something of value. Then if you hold up your end of the deal and the customer does not, you sue them in court for damages. The main questions are, is such a contract enforceable, and what would be the remedy that the court might order?\n\nYour description of your scheme is a bit sketchy, so I'll fill in some details. The user must submit a functioning software package, which your service plugs into some slot on a platform and makes accessible to others. That's it. In exchange, the customer transfers copyright to your company. This is unenforceable (in the US), because a copyright transfer is governed by [17 USC 204](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/204), which required a written instrument of conveyance signed by the rights owner. This precludes Human Centipad trick\\-transfers \u2013 the rights holder has to actually know and agree.\n\nNext pass, your TOS requires the rights holder to grant a perpetual, unpaid exclusive license to use the stuff. That means you still hold copyright, but you can't do much with it. There's a [revocation window](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/203) open for 5 years, 35 years later, a bit late in the software game. Well, the courts [treat this as a copyright transfer](https://casetext.com/case/fathers-daughters-nev-llc-v-lingfu-zhang). The similarity between your (modified) idea and Fathers \\& Daughters is that the original copyright owner is not a \"beneficial owner\" because they do not receive royalties. Again, I take it your goal is to sneak in the effect of a copyright transfer without alerting the user.\n\nFinally, you include a royalties clause: we've got a contract. But now we've strayed from the notion of \"seizing\". Perpetual licenses are legal, exclusive licenses are legal. You would have to sue the copyright owner for damages if you grant a perpetual exclusive license (for money) and then they grant someone else a license to use. You as platform operator be awarded whatever you had arguable lost from their breach of contract.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Option A is not legally enforceable in the US, as copyright transfers require a written instrument signed by the rights owner (17 USC 204).\n\n2. Option B, while closer to being enforceable, would likely be treated as a copyright transfer by courts due to the lack of royalties, making it similar to option A in its unenforceability.\n\n3. Option C is the most legally sound approach. By implementing a royalty-based system, the company creates a valid contract where both parties exchange something of value. Users retain their copyright (avoiding the issues with transfers) while granting extensive rights to the company. This approach is enforceable and gives the company significant control without overstepping legal boundaries.\n\n4.

The person ultimately appointed must be the object of his preference, though perhaps not in the first degree. **It is also not very probable that his nomination would often be overruled.** The Senate could not be tempted, by the preference they might feel to another, to reject the one proposed; because they could not assure themselves, that the person they might wish would be brought forward by a second or by any subsequent nomination. They could not even be certain, that a future nomination would present a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them; and as their dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the individual rejected, and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the judgment of the chief magistrate, it is not likely that their sanction would often be refused, where there were not special and strong reasons for the refusal.\n\nand in [No 78](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed78.asp):\n\n> It equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive.

They have violated the patient's privacy right when consent was expressly withdrawn, and they discovered that they cannot easily comply and therefore did not comply.\n\nThe fact that they have made it expensive for themselves to comply with their legal obligations going forward does not imply that they lacked implied consent at the outset, so they should have no liability for the time period from when the training materials started to be used until the time when implied consent ended. They are only responsible going forward for their failure to honor the patient's wishes.\n\nIt is not at all exceptional for a legal obligation to turn out to be more difficult to comply with when it arises than was anticipated when the systems that make the legal obligation difficult to comply with were implemented. \n\nHealth care companies aren't expected to be prophets who can foresee the complex confluence of factors that has painted them in a corner, particularly when a situation has never come up before the current one. It is likely that no one person was ever even simultaneously aware of all the facts necessary to know that this could happen.

The LHD's inability to honor a future express refusal does not retroactively invalidate their prior claim of implied consent. This eliminates option A.\n\n2. The LHD becomes responsible for violating the patient's privacy rights only after receiving the express refusal and failing to honor it. This supports option B.\n\n3. Technical limitations do not provide a legal exemption from honoring patient rights, making option C incorrect. The LHD could have taken alternative actions (e.g., cancelling training, using other facilities) to comply with the refusal.\n\n4.

But whether the charge gets dropped before trial isn't the important question \\-\\- after all, people sometimes do get charged wrongly \\-\\- rather, the question is, if it goes to trial, whether you will win.\n\nSince this question is about California, all traffic tickets in California, including red light camera tickets, are criminal cases (that's why the case will be named \"People of the State of California v. \\[your name]\" in court documents). The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the standard of evidence is \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". There is no provision in California law to fine or otherwise punish the owner of a vehicle for a moving violation, except through a conviction as the driver who committed the violation.\n\nIf you plead not guilty and it goes to trial, the burden will be on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the driver was you. If the driver in the picture does not look like you, there is no way they can meet that burden, and the court must find you not guilty. (In most cases the prosecution will immediately drop the case when they discover that the picture does not look like you.) Note that you have an absolute right to not testify in your own criminal trial where you are the defendant, so there is no way they can force you to testify at the trial about who the driver was if it was not you (which would be irrelevant to the case against you anyhow).\n\nIf you do not say who the driver was, and the police department fail to guess who it was (e.g. by searching for drivers whose licenses share the same address as you for someone who looks like the one in the picture), then nobody gets fined or punished for the violation.

There is some danger in having untrained people writing up agreements (they don't know the distinction between \"what the law says\" versus \"what we had in mind\"). The agreement is binding, but their interpretation of the contract language does not automatically prevail.\n\nThe statement \"ALL TUTORS ARE PAID 8 HOURS, unless told otherwise\" is slightly problematic since it is not true (you can't pay time, you pay money *for* time spend). With no other statements about time and payment, and just looking at the words, this says that an employee will be paid for 8 hours work, period. Unless they say something different. That could mean \"even if you work 20 hours, you only get paid for 8\" (illegal under various labor laws), or it could be \"even if you only work 2 hours, you get paid for 8\" (the most reasonable interpretation). The interpretation \"You are limited to 8 hours of work per pay period / contract\" is not a reasonable interpretation: that isn't what the clause says. Such a limit could be clearly expressed (\"can work up to 8 hours\" is a clear way to state the limit), and since they didn't say anything like that, that is not how the courts will read the clause. They can, however, inform you otherwise, e.g. say \"your minimum automatic pay is now 2 hours\", or \"we will only guarantee 2 hours work\", and at that point that's what the number is. Since this is (presumably) a take\\-it or leave it contract which they wrote up and you didn't actually negotiate, any unclarities are legally interpreted in your favor.\n\nIf you have worked more than 8 hours and they are using the contract language to argue that you won't be paid for the overage, that is not at all likely to hold up in court. Under terms of the contract (interpreted as stating a minimum guarantee of hours), they *can* inform you that your new minimum is 0 hours. Also, unless there is some kind of tenure clause, they can terminate the contract at will, and maybe they'll hire you under a different contract.\n\nWhat the terms of employment were for you in the past does not matter, what matters is what the current terms are. If you did not pay attention to the fact that they changed the terms of the agreement as of this quarter, that is not their problem. If they decided to change to \"actual hours worked\" after the current contract was formed, and they informed you of that fact later, then thereafter that is what the agreement is. Until you are notified of that change, the guaranteed minimum is what it says in the contract.\n\nIn case their argument is \"The university sets this policy, the department made a mistake in not informing you\", the university has to take responsibility for the errors of their inferiors.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A university student signs a tutoring contract stating \"ALL TUTORS ARE PAID 8 HOURS, unless told otherwise.\" Two weeks later, the department informs the student via email that they will now be paid for exact hours worked.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The documentation states that an agreement doesn't need to be verbose or written by a lawyer to be binding, addressing the misconception in option A.\n\n2. Option B is incorrect because while the contract was initially binding for 8 hours, the \"unless told otherwise\" clause allows for modification.\n\n3.

The answer specifies that \"witnesses will need to enter the stand once more,\" even if the procedural error only involved one witness.\n5. The documentation emphasizes that both new evidence and evidence from the old trial will be scrutinized equally.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests the understanding of legal procedures in retrials. It also challenges common misconceptions, such as the idea that only the problematic parts of a trial need to be redone (options A and D) or that the judge has discretion in a retrial to selectively re-admit evidence (option B). The question targets higher cognitive levels by requiring analysis of the implications of a retrial order, rather than simple recall of facts."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/76859/panel-of-judges-in-supreme-court-odd-number", "docs_id": 76859, "title": "Panel of Judges in Supreme Court - Odd number?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Supreme Court, the panel of judges will always be a odd number? 3,5,7,9 so the decision in terms of votes count verdict will always outcome a result and not a tie?![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3nbdF.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The UK Supreme Court (as you tagged in the question) uses an odd number for this exact reason. A recent case, [*Attorney General v Crosland* \\[2021] UKSC 58](https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2021-0160-judgment.pdf), further explains:\n\n> it is a very common feature of appeals in the UK generally that the\n> appellate court consists of a larger panel than the court appealed from. It not\n> infrequently happens that a party to an appeal to the Supreme Court wishes the court\n> to depart from an earlier decision of the Supreme Court or of the House of Lords. In\n> such a case the practice is for the appeal to be heard by an enlarged panel of seven or\n> more justices, precisely to clothe it with that greater authority\n\nThe statute establishing this Court [provides](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/4/section/42):\n\n> The Supreme Court is duly constituted in any proceedings only if all of the following conditions are met\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) the Court consists of an uneven number of judges;  \n> \n> (b) the Court consists of at least three judges;  \n> \n> (c) more than half of those judges are permanent judges.\n\n(with the possibility of some deviation in special circumstances). This practice was previously followed in the House of Lords, before being made statutory when the Supreme Court was formed. The UK court does not sit *en banc*, partly because there are twelve permanent judges and that is an even number, and partly because the legal tradition hasn't held it to be worthwhile. An exceptional case was [*R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union* \\[2017] UKSC 5](https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0196-judgment.pdf), heard by eleven judges \\- a record! \\- which happened to be the entire Supreme Court at the time, since there was one vacancy. A panel of nine was used in [*Attorney General's Reference (No. 2 of 2001\\)* \\[2003] UKHL 68](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/68.html), for the first time since *R v Ball* \\[1911] AC 47\\. Smaller numbers are more typical, such as five.\n\nFor the Supreme Court of the United States, there are nine judges but they do not use panels. It is fairly common for some judges to recuse themselves because they had been involved with proceedings at a lower stage, or if there is a vacancy, and so there are cases where there are an even number of judges actually involved. The US court also has a practice of fairly complex patterns of concurring and dissenting opinions, with justices potentially joining more than one opinion, so it can be subtle to identify where the majority position really lies. It is therefore possible for there to be a tie. If there is a tie on appeal, then the lower court's decision stands, without precedential effect. For matters within the *original jurisdiction* of the Supreme Court, there is [no consensus](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40389434) on what is meant to happen \\- see [What happens if the US Supreme Court ties 4\\-4?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7126/what-happens-if-the-us-supreme-court-ties-4-4) for more.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Supreme Court practices, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A landmark case challenging a controversial government policy is set to be heard by the UK Supreme Court. Given the significance of the case and its potential implications, what is the most likely composition of the court panel, and why?\n\nA) A panel of 3 judges, to ensure a swift decision on this urgent matter\nB) A panel of 12 judges, to involve all permanent judges for maximum authority\nC) A panel of 7 or 9 judges, to provide greater authority while maintaining an odd number\nD) A panel of 5 judges, as this is the standard size for all UK Supreme Court cases\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate answer is C, a panel of 7 or 9 judges. This conclusion is based on several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. The UK Supreme Court always uses an odd number of judges to avoid ties, as stated in the Constitutional Reform Act 2005.\n\n2. While the minimum number of judges is 3, the documentation mentions that for cases of great significance or those requiring departure from previous decisions, \"the practice is for the appeal to be heard by an enlarged panel of seven or more justices, precisely to clothe it with that greater authority.\"\n\n3. The case described is a \"landmark case challenging a controversial government policy,\" which suggests it's of high importance and may require reconsidering existing precedents.\n\n4. While 11 judges were used in an exceptional case (Miller v Secretary of State), this is extremely rare. The documentation notes that smaller numbers, such as five, are more typical.\n\n5. Option B (12 judges) is incorrect because the court must have an odd number of judges, and 12 is explicitly mentioned as being problematic for this reason.\n\n6. Option A (3 judges) is too small for a landmark case, and option D (5 judges) is described as typical but not necessarily used for cases of great significance.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, application to a real-world scenario, and analysis of the court's practices beyond simple recall.

In this case, the bank tends to take a loss and chargeback rights are not exercised.  \n\nIn other cases, the bank will require the merchant to prove that the authorised cardholder did in fact authorise the transaction. The level of proof is governed by the way in which the transaction was conducted and verified at the time of purchase \\- whether the CVV2 code was verified, whether address verification was completed, whether 3D verification was completed.

The correct answer is C because it represents a situation where the merchant failed to fully comply with scheme guidelines for transaction verification.\n\nAccording to the documentation, \"The level of proof is governed by the way in which the transaction was conducted and verified at the time of purchase - whether the CVV2 code was verified, whether address verification was completed, whether 3D verification was completed.\" In this case, while the merchant implemented 3D Secure (which is a strong form of verification), they failed to properly validate the CVV2 code. This partial implementation of security measures would likely make it difficult for the merchant to prove that the transaction was properly authorized according to scheme guidelines.\n\nOption A, while a security issue, doesn't directly relate to transaction verification at the time of purchase. Option B implies the fraud occurred due to the consumer's compromised system, which would not be the merchant's responsibility.

The content of the email is always related to specific legal changes that have occurred. The users are not being \"sold\" anything from the content of the email, it contains factual information only.\n\nThe application is subscription based, i.e. you have to pay for an account and using it is a choice. Any email addresses for accounts we hold are active users and we do not harvest this data from anywhere. So all email addresses we have are for real users who actively use the software.\n\nWe are designing a setup wizard which allows users to set preferences on what information they receive.\n\nOne of the settings is **yes or no** as to whether the application should send notifications via email. This raised debate as to what the default setting should be.\n\nThe argument for \"no\" was that users should explicitly give their permission to receive automated emails and therefore this was the correct default.\n\nThe argument for \"yes\" was that the users have implied consent because they are using an application whose sole purpose is to inform them about changes, and email delivery is the primary way of doing this.\n\nThe application is still usable if the user doesn't receive emails because the data which is present in the emails is visible inside a web\\-based interface. The disadvantage of using the application in this way is that \\- unless the user logs in \\- they will not necessarily be aware of any updates. Therefore defaulting email opt\\-in is preferable.\n\nThe pre\\-sale marketing material for the application makes it clear that email delivery is the main delivery method for the information and getting it directly to your inbox is an advantage of using the system.\n\nThe application allows the user to change their settings at any time. So if they opt\\-in to receive emails today, they can opt\\-out tomorrow, and vice versa. They can change their preferences at any time.\n\nWhat are people's thoughts on this? We are based in the UK but deal with customers worldwide. Is this covered or referred to by GDPR?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: GDPR does not require consent. It requires a legal basis. Consent is only one legal basis among many. Some other legal bases are:\n\n* legitimate interest (implying an opt out solution)\n* necessity for performance of a contract\n\nIf your customers pay you to deliver email updates, that contract is the legal basis for sending email updates. The only wrinkle is that as you describe your service, the emails aren't an essential part of the service.\n\nAlternatively, you might assert that there's a legitimate interest to deliver updates via email so that updates aren't missed. In that case you must allow the users to object, e.g. via ab unsubscribe link in the email and via their account settings. Because a prior business relationship exists, there's a strong case for legitimate interest \u2013 even if this were marketing emails (!). Legitimate interest requires you to balance the legitimate interest with the data subject's rights and freedoms though.\n\nYour updates are most likely not marketing, so any advice you might read relating to marketing emailings is irrelevant.\n\nGDPR applies because you are established in the EU. The regulation applies in relation to all your users, not just EU users. If and when Brexit happens you will still be covered by the Data Protection Act, which transcribes the GDPR's requirements into UK law.

One of these defences, is the defence of [Diminished Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_responsibility_in_English_law).\n\n> The defence is set out in s.2 of the Homicide Act 1957, and it\n>  provides that a Defendant is not guilty of murder if, during the\n>  murder, he suffered from an abnormality in mental functioning, where:\n> \n> \n> 1. The defendant must, at the relevant time, have been suffering from a recognised medical condition\n> 2. This condition must provided an explanation for the Defendant's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing.\n> 3. This condition substantially impaired the Defendant's ability to do one or more of the following:\n> \n> \n> a) To understand the nature of the Defendant's conduct\n> \n> \n> b) To form a rational judgment\n> \n> \n> c) To exercise self control\n\nThe reason why this may be applicable in the context of revenge or retribution, is in the principle case of [R v Ahluwalia](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1992/1.html)\n\nIn summary, a woman murdered her husband, by pouring petrol on him in his sleep, and setting him afire. \n\nShe was held to be not guilty of murder because of this defence. Specifically, the court held that she suffered \"battered woman syndrome\" as the result of 10\\+ years of emotional abuse and beatings by her husband, .\n\nThe reason why this is relevant to the question is because when giving her reasons for killing her husband, she stated:\n\n> \"She wrote to her mother\\-in\\-law from prison saying, amongst other things, that the deceased had committed so many sins, \"so I gave him a fire bath to wash away his sins\". However, in the course of interview she repeated a number of times that she did not intend to kill the deceased, but only to give him pain.\"\n\nIt is certainly arguable that her actions fall within the meaning of retribution.\n\nOf course, not just any kind of provocation will raise this defense, you need to be suffering a mental condition, but it is clear that this condition may arise directly from the actions of the victim. I highly recommend reading the full judgment, as the court goes in depth through the law on provocation (since here, on the day of the killing, the husband told the Defendant that he would beat her the following day), and whether the pre\\-meditated nature of the killing (she bought the ingredients for the fire beforehand, having already decided to set the victim on fire) meant that the defence could not apply.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A woman has endured severe emotional and physical abuse from her husband for over a decade.

In the UK legal system, which of the following is the most accurate assessment of her potential defense?\n\nA) She can claim full immunity from prosecution due to the long-term abuse she suffered\nB) She has no valid defense as her actions were premeditated and not in immediate self-defense\nC) She may have a partial defense of diminished responsibility if she can prove \"battered woman syndrome\"\nD) Her actions would be considered justified under UK law as a form of permissible retribution\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the application of UK law regarding diminished responsibility in a complex scenario involving long-term abuse and premeditated action. The correct answer is C, as it most accurately reflects the legal principle demonstrated in the case of R v Ahluwalia.\n\nOption A is incorrect because UK law does not provide full immunity for such actions, even in cases of long-term abuse. The law recognizes potential partial defenses, not complete exemption from prosecution.\n\nOption B, while seemingly logical given the premeditation, fails to account for the nuanced approach of UK law in cases of long-term abuse and its potential psychological effects.\n\nOption C is correct because it aligns with the precedent set in R v Ahluwalia. The defense of diminished responsibility under s.2 of the Homicide Act 1957 can apply if the defendant suffered from an abnormality in mental functioning due to a recognized medical condition (in this case, potentially \"battered woman syndrome\") that substantially impaired her ability to form rational judgment or exercise self-control.\n\nOption D is incorrect because UK law does not generally recognize retribution as a justification for murder. While the concept of retribution was mentioned in the Ahluwalia case, it was in the context of the defendant's statements, not as a legal justification.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple legal concepts, application to a real-world scenario, and understanding of the nuances in UK law regarding diminished responsibility in cases of long-term abuse."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37025/is-it-legal-to-unlock-artificially-limited-hardware-yourself", "docs_id": 37025, "title": "Is it legal to unlock artificially limited hardware yourself?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Some companies sell hardware that is limited by some means, so that they can charge for upgrades.\n\nFor example some Tesla cars have batteries with some capacity unavailable to the user unless they pay for an upgrade, which involves sending a command to the car.

So, the manufacturer can sue you for money damages probably equal to the difference in value between the limited and unlimited hardware in the marketplace. The manufacturer might also be able to obtain an injunction against this practice, which could result in the incarceration of someone who knowingly violated this court order for contempt of court, once an injunction is secured from a court to enforce the contract.\n\nThere is also an anti\\-hacking statute in the United States, whose plain language appears to prohibit taking actions that override a digital system's security features. Unlocking these hardware features would appear to violate this statute. This is part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and is codified at United States Code Title 17, Section 1201\\.

There have also been efforts to characterize this kind of business practice as an anti\\-trust violation. But, none of that legislation has passed in the United States, to the best of my knowledge and belief.\n\nBut, I am not aware of any high profile legal precedent that has addressed this point but I wouldn't rule out the possibility that there is one.

(TLDR\\-skip to bold)\n\nI am a clerk at a retail establishment that sales cigarettes, as well as food and home products. My main job duty is cashier. In between customers I also stock and do other retail related tasks.\n\nThe cigarettes are in a cabinet that requires a key to open. When I first started working there a few months ago the key for the cabinet was on a set of keys which had other keys for retail displays like cell phones as well. Since then there has been a change in management. And one of the changes was that only key\\-holders and managers can open the cigarette cabinet.\n\nThis change has been very inconvenient for customers and the store has lost many sales over people not wanting to wait for a key holder to come open the cabinet. It's very frustrating for me to stand there and wait for them to come up especially since customers generally ask for cigarettes after I have scanned the items so it's all wait time. I have to page them on the in store phone and wait for them to finish what they are doing in the back of the store and come up and then the customer has to repeat what they wanted again. \n\nI've continually complained about the change to the assistant manager and lead key holder but they always kind of change the subject. I asked the assistant manager one day if the change was because of missing cigarettes and he said that wasn't it and alluded to knowing what it was but wouldn't say. At that point I began to realize it was probably because I am a cigarette smoker. I wasn't sure though. Then a few days later talking to another employee and I found out that he and I are the only regular clerks without any key\\-holder status and he also smokes and came to the same conclusion as me independently.\n\nI've never stolen cigarettes or had any mishaps with cigarettes or lost any cigarettes or anything at this job or any other. Now unless the other guy has had some shadiness with the cigarettes or something in his past and they are just using this general rule to keep him from using it but it's affecting me then I could kind of understand but nobody has told me anything along the lines that it's because of the other employee. I think I need to talk to that guy a little bit more.\n\n**Is it discrimination if they have revoked me of a responsibility because I smoke?**\n\nIf that is the reason for the change it doesn't make any sense to me. They sell all kinds of things that I use. I'm more addicted to food than cigarettes. Why do they let me stock food?\n\nI'm nearly 30, I'm an adult, I'm a serious man. Why would they regard me as a thief. I've never felt so demoralized and I was previously a dishwasher. What's odd about this whole situation is I rarely interact with the manager that has been making these changes.

The answer explains that smoking status is typically not included in the list of protected characteristics (such as race, color, sex, age, disability, etc.) in most jurisdictions. This policy change, while potentially unfair or demoralizing to the employee, likely does not constitute illegal discrimination from a legal standpoint. \n\nOption A is incorrect because smoking status is not typically a protected characteristic.

A private office building needs be heated to at least 19 degrees but can be heated to higher temperatures if they want to.\n\nThe latter part seems very strange because it would imply that private companies are not allowed to save as much energy as they want to or feel able to which seems in direct contradiction to the stated goals of the law. Is that what this regulation means?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Employers \u2013 whether public or private \u2013 have a duty of care. They must provide a safe working environment that does not endanger the health of employees, which includes appropriate heating/cooling. Too low temperatures must be prevented to protect the health of employees. Therefore, existing regulations in form of ASR A 3\\.5 require minimum temperatures:\n\n| how strenuous \u2192 | light | medium | heavy |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| seated | \\+20\u00b0C | \\+19\u00b0C | \\- |\n| standing, walking | \\+19\u00b0C | \\+17\u00b0C | \\+12\u00b0C |\n\nEnSikuMaV reduces these minimum temperatures for light and medium work by 1\u00b0C:\n\n| how strenuous \u2192 | light | medium | heavy |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| seated | \\+19\u00b0C | \\+18\u00b0C | \\- |\n| standing, walking | \\+18\u00b0C | \\+16\u00b0C | \\+12\u00b0C |\n\nThe EnSikuMaV wants to ensure that the public sector serves as a role model, and therefore requires that public buildings are heated to exactly the minimum allowed levels (these levels are maximums per \u00a7 6 but also minimums per \u00a7 12\\). Public sector employers can nevertheless keep higher temperatures in individual cases if they consider this necessary for their duty of care. See explanations on page 22 of the document.\n\nThe private sector is not *forced* to reduce heating, but now has legally safe grounds to reduce heating somewhat, if they so wish. This Verordnung does not *introduce* minimum heating levels, but *lowers* existing temperature requirements. Reducing heating reduces costs, and will therefore generally be in the interest of (profit\\-maximizing) private industry.

What is the most appropriate course of action for the company?\n\nA) Implement the 17\u00b0C policy immediately, as private companies have full discretion over their heating policies\nB) Maintain the current office temperature of 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F) as it's the minimum required by law for private companies\nC) Lower the temperature to 19\u00b0C (66.2\u00b0F), which is now the new minimum temperature allowed for this type of work\nD) Consult with legal counsel to determine if they can apply for an exemption to set lower temperatures\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the EnSikuMaV ordinance in the context of existing labor regulations and the distinction between public and private sector requirements. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The EnSikuMaV lowered the minimum temperature requirements for light, seated work from 20\u00b0C to 19\u00b0C for both public and private sectors.\n2. While public sector buildings are required to heat exactly to this new minimum (as a maximum), private companies are allowed to heat to this new minimum or higher temperatures.\n3. The ordinance does not force private companies to reduce heating, but it provides them with a legal basis to lower temperatures if they choose to do so, down to the new minimum of 19\u00b0C for this type of work.\n4. The company cannot implement a 17\u00b0C policy (option A) as it violates the minimum temperature requirements for worker health and safety.\n5.

This is a typo right? This ought be C.\n2. I don't understand the emboldened phrase. Unquestionably this is a contract?\n\nD's promise (grant of a lease) is consideration for C's promise to renovate, and C's promise is consideration for D's promise. \n\nThis example is readying the reader for this case in the bottom para. ibid. \n\n> This view was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in *Price v Strange* \\[\\[1977] 3 W.L.R. 943].

The trial court said no, reasoning that if they did so, then they should **also** enforce specific performance against C, i.e. ordering C to perform the renovations himself \\- and they won't do that because that is a personal obligation.\n\n(It seems to be a standard tenet of law that specific performance is generally not used when \"performance consists of a personal service\". [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_performance) confirms this, though without explanation. I don't know exactly why this is the practice; maybe it would be a good separate question. I might speculate that courts feel that to order a person to perform a particular service would be a little too much like involuntary servitude.)\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeals said that there was no need to order C to perform the renovations, because C had already done some of them and agreed to pay for the rest. Therefore the trial court's reasoning did not apply, and there was no problem with enforcing specific performance only against D, i.e. ordering D to grant the lease.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A real estate developer, Emma, enters into a contract with a renowned architect, Alex, for the design and personal oversight of a luxury apartment complex. The contract stipulates that Alex will provide unique architectural designs and personally supervise the construction process. Emma now seeks specific performance of the contract. Given the principle of mutuality in specific performance and the Court of Appeal's decision in Price v Strange, what is the most likely outcome?\n\nA) The court will grant specific performance, ordering Alex to complete the designs and oversee construction, as the contract is clearly defined.\n\nB) The court will deny specific performance due to lack of mutuality, as Alex's obligations involve personal services that cannot be specifically enforced.\n\nC) The court will grant specific performance only if Alex has already completed a substantial portion of the work and agrees to monetary compensation for any uncompleted tasks.\n\nD) The court will automatically grant specific performance to Emma, as she is the party seeking to enforce the contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the mutuality doctrine in specific performance and its evolution through case law. The correct answer is C, based on the Court of Appeal's decision in Price v Strange, which modified the traditional view of mutuality.\n\nInitially, following Fry's approach, courts required mutuality to be present from the outset of the contract. This would suggest answer B, as Alex's obligations involve personal services that typically cannot be specifically enforced.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal in Price v Strange reversed this rigid approach. They granted specific performance of an agreement to grant an underlease, even though the claimant's obligation to repair and decorate (a personal service) couldn't be specifically enforced. The key factors were that the claimant had already done some work and agreed to pay for completing the rest.\n\nApplying this principle to Emma and Alex's situation, the court would likely grant specific performance if:\n1. Alex has already completed a substantial portion of the architectural work.\n2. Alex agrees to monetary compensation for any uncompleted aspects of personal supervision.\n\nThis approach ensures that Emma isn't left \"high and dry\" after complying with a court order, addressing the core concern behind the mutuality doctrine.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the personal nature of Alex's services and the mutuality issue. Option D is wrong as it oversimplifies the legal principle, ignoring the complexities introduced by the nature of the obligations and the Price v Strange precedent. Option B, while reflecting the traditional view, doesn't account for the modern approach established in Price v Strange.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to apply legal principles to a real-world scenario, integrate multiple concepts (mutuality, specific performance, personal services), and understand the nuanced evolution of legal doctrine through case law."}, "67": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79955/the-burden-of-proof-in-uk-civil-trials", "docs_id": 79955, "title": "The burden of proof in UK civil trials", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In UK civil trials, it is said that\n\n1. The burden of proof is on the claimant.\n2. The case will be decided \u2018on the balance of probabilities\u2019.\n\nAre these assertions consistent? Based on the second statement, one might think that the outcome of a case will depend on whether it is more likely than not (\\>50%) or less likely than not (\\<50%) that the claimant\u2019s allegation is correct (based on the relevant evidence). But if that is true, I don\u2019t see how the claimant has any special \u2018burden\u2019 that they need to discharge. Sure, in order for the claimant to win, the relevant decision maker (let\u2019s say it is a judge) needs to think that it is more likely than not that the claimant is right. But equally, in order for the defendant to win, the judge needs to think that it is more likely than not that they (the defendant) are right. So the situation is entirely symmetric!\n\nUpdate: as some have commented, the claimant may lose if the judge thinks that the probability is *exactly* 50%. If you think, for example, that the judge\u2019s assessments should be restricted to integer percentages (0%, 1%, 2%, etc.), this means that the claimant wins if the probability is 51% or higher, and loses if the probability is 50% or lower. This situation is very slightly asymmetric; but only very slightly! And if the judge can make more nuanced judgments (no longer restricted to integers), the asymmetry shrinks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, law is not mathematics and it is futile to try to assign an \"exact\" statistical percentage or apply Bayes' theorem in any specific case unless the facts of the case are particular enough. In the end, judges or juries (most often) do not apply a statistical model to their cases, what matters is if the evidences (by both parties) presented on one claim convince them that the claim is more likely to be true than not, that is, what they \"feel\" or \"think\" about the probability.\n\nMore probable than not means \\> 50%; if the fact finder finds scenarios leading to different outcomes equally likely, the claim is not proven and the party bearing the burden of proof fails.\n\nIf you want to analyze it mathematically, the burden of proof does not necessarily means that the probability of a claim favourable to the burdened party to be true in the absence of evidence is zero. Since only two values are possible as an outcome on any particular claim (as far as the burden of proof is concerned), a step function must be used to convert the probability to a judgement. The burden of proof represents the choice of that *unsymmetric* step function.\n\nThe burden of proof also represents the **legal** (not necessarily \"factual\" or statistical) assumption (an *imposed*, unquantifiable prior \"probability\").\n\nHere I use the word \"claim\" generally, for a case to succeed there can be multiple elements or claims that all need to be proven to be more likely than not to be true, e.g. if you want to sue someone for medical bills because they crashed into you and you have a broken leg, you need to prove both that they were responsible for the crash and that the medical bills are for the broken leg, and the broken leg is a result of that crash.\n\nThe burden of proof means that if you do not provide any evidence that the leg was broken as a result of that crash, or if your evidence is very weak, or if your evidence is not stronger than the other party's counter\\-evidence, your case must fail; the defendant does not have to prove that the crash did not cause your broken feet.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A civil lawsuit is filed in the UK where the claimant alleges that the defendant's negligence caused significant property damage. The judge finds the evidence presented by both parties to be equally compelling, making it difficult to determine which party's account is more likely to be true. Given this scenario, what is the most appropriate legal outcome and why?\n\nA) The case should be decided in favor of the claimant, as they have met the \"balance of probabilities\" standard.\nB) The case should be decided in favor of the defendant, as the claimant has failed to discharge their burden of proof.\nC) The judge should order a retrial to gather more evidence, as the current situation is inconclusive.\nD) The judge should split the damages equally between both parties, as neither side has a clear advantage.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of the burden of proof and the \"balance of probabilities\" standard in UK civil trials, requiring analysis and application of these concepts to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The burden of proof in civil trials rests with the claimant. This means the claimant must provide sufficient evidence to convince the judge that their claim is more likely than not to be true.\n\n2. The \"balance of probabilities\" standard requires that the claimant's case be proven to be more likely true than not (i.e., exceeding 50% probability).\n\n3. In this scenario, the judge finds the evidence from both parties equally compelling. This suggests that the probability of the claimant's allegation being true is exactly 50%, which does not exceed the required threshold.\n\n4. When the probabilities are exactly balanced (50-50), the party with the burden of proof (the claimant) fails to meet their obligation. This creates a slight asymmetry in favor of the defendant.\n\n5. The burden of proof serves as a tiebreaker in such situations. The defendant does not need to prove their innocence; they only need to cast sufficient doubt on the claimant's case.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they either misinterpret the burden of proof, suggest actions not typically taken in civil trials, or propose outcomes that don't align with the legal principles described in the documentation.

Which of the following modifications would most effectively satisfy the \"enclosed\" land requirement under Massachusetts trespassing law?\n\nA) Erect \"No Trespassing\" signs at regular intervals along the property boundaries\nB) Install a locked gate at the main entrance to the property\nC) Construct a bridge over the stream to complete a continuous physical barrier\nD) Obtain a formal survey and register the exact property boundaries with the local authorities\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the Massachusetts trespassing law concept of \"enclosed\" land. The correct answer is B, installing a locked gate at the main entrance to the property.\n\nThe explanation draws from several key points in the documentation:\n\n1. The law recognizes \"a great variety of cases and circumstances\" for satisfying the enclosure requirement.\n2. Courts have accepted various structures as sufficient enclosures, including fences, walls, gates, and natural features like rivers.\n3. The primary purpose of the enclosure is to \"prevent someone from just walking in.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the property already has significant natural and man-made boundaries (stone walls, hedgerows, and a stream) on all sides. However, these features alone may not fully satisfy the \"enclosed\" requirement, as they might still allow easy access.\n\nOption B, installing a locked gate at the main entrance, directly addresses the core purpose of the enclosure requirement by preventing easy access. This aligns with the court's acceptance of \"a locked gate\" as a sufficient enclosure in the case of Com. v. Juvenile.\n\nOption A (signs) doesn't create a physical barrier and likely wouldn't satisfy the enclosure requirement.\nOption C (bridge) is unnecessary and doesn't address the main point of preventing access.\nOption D (survey and registration) is a legal formality that doesn't create a physical enclosure.\n\nThis question tests the applicant's ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario, and critically analyze which solution best meets the legal requirements."}, "73": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45378/what-happens-to-somebody-returning-from-isis-who-did-not-commit-crimes-inside-i", "docs_id": 45378, "title": "What happens to somebody returning from ISIS, who did not commit crimes inside ISIS?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Individual people from American or European countries have joined ISIS over time.\n\nSuch a person may decide to returns home. \n\n* If it was never recognized that the person had the intention to join ISIS, he/she is basically just a person returning from traveling.\n* If the person is known to be an ISIS fighter, he will be detained at arrival and probably indicted for some felony.\n* If it is known the person was member of ISIS, but nothing else is known, and there is no indication that he was an active fighter: What happens in this case?\n\nThere is a good example for the third case happening in Germany.

The correct answer is B because, despite the girl's young age and apparent non-combatant role, she likely committed the crime of providing material support for terrorism. \n\nAs explained in the top answer, laws like 18 U.S. Code 2339A and 2339B in the United States define \"material support\" very broadly. Even maintaining the household of an ISIS fighter can fall under this definition. Most countries, including Germany, have similar laws.\n\nOption A is incorrect because age and non-combatant status do not automatically exempt someone from charges related to terrorist involvement. Option C, while a potential part of her treatment, is unlikely to be the sole response given the serious nature of ISIS involvement. Option D is incorrect because direct participation in violence is not necessary for charges under material support laws.\n\nThis case presents a complex ethical and legal scenario, challenging students to consider the broad reach of anti-terrorism laws, the treatment of minors in such cases, and the balance between punishment and rehabilitation.

Prohibiting an assembly because of viewpoint is illegal. Banning a group is illegal (regardless of the reason for such a ban). A group cannot be banned because they don't have a permit (this too is a First Amendment issue): however, an *assembly* can be prohibited if there is no permit. An event can be disbanded if it causes violence or unreasonable disruption, but if others engage in violence in response to a demonstration, that does not invalidate your First Amendment rights (\"The police must permit the speech and control the crowd; there is no heckler\u2019s veto\", [Cox v. Louisiana](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/379/536/) 379 U.S. 536\\). Even if a past event by the organization has resulted in violence, a subsequent event cannot be prohibited ([U.S. v. Baugh](https://openjurist.org/187/f3d/1037/united-states-of-america-v-pamela-baugh), 187 F.3d 1037\\). The constitutional right to assembly is an individual right, not a collective right: an individual cannot lose his First Amendment rights, so a city cannot ban particular individuals.\n\nThere is a huge difference between what the city may do with respect to public property and private property. Compelled speech is also unconstitutional. When an individual unlawfully take possession of the property of another in order to express himself, that is trespassing. The government cannot compel an individual to involuntarily support a viewpoint, thus a protester does not have a constitutional right to protest on my private property. They *do* have that right with respect to public places. (Not absolutely *all* places, e.g. not on a military base).\n\nAny limits on time and place have to be narrowly constructed and clearly stated in the law, and arbitrarily limiting an assembly to some location miles from the intended audience is illegal ([Bay Area Peace Navy v. U.S](https://openjurist.org/914/f2d/1224/bay-area-peace-navy-v-united-states), 914 F.2d 1224\\). Limitations have to be reasonably and narrowly related to safety and disruption concerns, or to regulate competing uses ([Forsyth County, Ga. v. Nat\u2019list Movement](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/123/), 505 U.S. 123\\).

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Option A is unconstitutional as it violates the First Amendment by prohibiting an assembly based on viewpoint, which is explicitly stated as illegal in the documentation.\n\n2. Option B, while seemingly justified, is also unconstitutional. The documentation cites U.S. v. Baugh, which establishes that even if a past event resulted in violence, a subsequent event cannot be prohibited on that basis alone.\n\n3. Option C is the most likely to withstand constitutional scrutiny. The documentation mentions that limitations on time and place are permissible if they are narrowly constructed, clearly stated, and related to safety and disruption concerns or to regulate competing uses (Forsyth County, Ga. v. Nat'list Movement). These restrictions must be content-neutral and apply to all assemblies equally.\n\n4. Option D is unconstitutional because, as stated in the documentation, the right to assembly is an individual right, and a city cannot ban particular individuals from exercising their First Amendment rights.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a realistic scenario, and identify the option that best balances public safety concerns with constitutional rights.

Assume that the police officer punches/kicks/grabs first, and you are not guilty of any crime before the attack. To what extend can you do so?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **The General Rule**\n\nIn practice, the only time when self\\-defense against a police officer is legal is when you do not know and have no reasonable way that you could have known that the person attacking you is a police officer. (And arguably, a police officer acting in an official capacity in furtherance of his or her duties, rather than in a personal capacity as an individual.)\n\nFor example, if the police do a no knock raid in the dark of night, and don't announce themselves, and you shoot police officers reasonably believing them to be home invasion burglars, you would not have criminal or civil liability for doing so.\n\nA similar valid self\\-defense claim might arise when someone has an objectively reasonable reason to think that someone claiming to be a police officer is really just a criminal impersonating a police officer, even if that belief is, in fact, mistaken.\n\nIn almost all other circumstances, you need to submit to the officers, and you are pretty much required by law to bear the risk that excessive force by the officer will harm you. If you don't, you will probably be guilty of the crime of resisting arrest and will not be entitled to a self\\-defense defense.\n\nThe fact that you are not actually guilty of a crime is irrelevant. This is often the case and police officers are not omniscient. If the officer lacked probable cause for an arrest (which there is often no way that the person being arrested or attacked can know at the time), the remedy is a civil rights suit after the fact, not self\\-defense.\n\nIn theory, there might be other isolated circumstances where self\\-defense against a police officer is legal, but they involve fact patterns so quirky that they would almost never happen in real life, or would almost never be possible to prove in a manner that the courts would believe.\n\n**Officer Liability For Harming Someone Legitimately Acting In Self Defense**\n\nWhether the officers had civil liability to you if you were harmed by the officers while exercising your right to self\\-defense would depend upon their state of mind, even if you were rightfully using self\\-defense. \n\nFor example, a U.S. Supreme Court case decided in January of 2017 ([*White v. Pauly*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-67_2c8f.pdf)) involved this fact pattern. In *White v. Pauly* an officer arrived late on the scene and had no reason to believe that the officers who arrived there before him and were being shot at by citizens in a house that they were approaching, lacked probable cause, or had not announced themselves. The court held that as a result, he had no civil liability to a citizen he shot, even if the person who the late arriving officer shot while that citizen was shooting back at the police officers on the scene was actually engaging in good faith self\\-defense.\n\nThe citizen's self\\-defense in the case had a valid defense to criminal or civil liability for firing on the officers, because the citizen shooting back didn't actually know that the people approaching his house were police officers. But, because the late arriving officer reasonably believed under the circumstances that the citizen had no right to engage in self\\-defense, because he thought that the early arriving officers had probable cause and had announced themselves, the late arriving officer had no civil liability to the citizens he shot.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: During a late-night incident, an individual is suddenly attacked by someone who doesn't identify themselves as law enforcement.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) The individual is automatically guilty of assaulting a police officer, regardless of the circumstances.\nB) The individual has a valid self-defense claim, but the officer may also be protected from civil liability.\nC) The individual has no legal right to self-defense against a police officer under any circumstances.\nD) The officer is solely liable for damages, as they failed to identify themselves before initiating force.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario touches on several complex aspects of self-defense against law enforcement. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The individual has a potentially valid self-defense claim. As stated in the documentation, \"the only time when self-defense against a police officer is legal is when you do not know and have no reasonable way that you could have known that the person attacking you is a police officer.\" In this case, the attacker didn't identify themselves, and it was late at night, making it reasonable for the individual to believe they were being assaulted by a criminal.\n\n2. However, the officer may also be protected from civil liability. The documentation cites the U.S. Supreme Court case White v. Pauly, which established that an officer can be protected from civil liability if they reasonably believed their actions were justified, even if the citizen was actually engaging in good faith self-defense.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because guilt is not automatic, especially when the officer's identity was unknown.\n\n4. Option C is too absolute and contradicts the documented exceptions for self-defense against officers.\n\n5. Option D oversimplifies the situation and doesn't account for the nuanced legal protections officers may have, as illustrated in the White v.

The correct answer, C, best balances the license requirements with practical considerations:\n\n1. Section 4(b) of the license requires attribution, including the original author's name, the work's title, and the URI if specified. Option C allows for complete inclusion of this information.\n\n2.

It was\n>  determined that the attorney for the trust I had hired had given me\n>  poor advice, bordering on malpractise.\n\nFor this advice to be actionable, it would be necessary to show that you wouldn't have been removed and surcharged, but for the malpractice of your attorney. But, the attorney might plausibly argue that given the fact that the case was clearly prejudged, that the advice he gave you wouldn't have made a difference in any case.\n\n> My current trial attorney had, unfortunately, neglected to enter the\n>  exhibit that supported this conclusion as evidence.

He probably could have made a motion to reconsider that could have remedied this failure to introduce evidence, or an appeal that might have been successful. On the other hand, he can argue that but for the first attorneys' malpractice, this wouldn't have been an issue, so liability should at least be shared if not entirely transferred to the first attorney, and that subsequent uncertain litigation options not exercised shouldn't count against you (or him).\n\n> my current trial attorney , the one who neglected to admit the\n>  exhibit, wants to go after the original attorney for those fees on a\n>  contingency basis, his fee to be 50% of the recovered money. That\n>  would leave me with nothing except still owing the trust the other\n>  half of those fees.\n\nIt is often the case in life that you can't be made whole from someone else's wrongs. Attorney malpractice cases are almost always of this variety, since you generally can't recover your attorneys' fees in an attorney malpractice case, only your damages. Someone, whether the current attorney or a third attorney, is going to charge a fee to sue someone for malpractice.\n\nThe benefit of going with the current attorney is that he is up to speed and is willing to take the case on a contingency basis, albeit a steep one. The downside is that the current attorney will not sue himself and may have liability as well, that the current attorney has made a key mistake once and could do so again, and that the current attorney may be conflicted out of the case as a potentially responsible party and as a potential witness at some point. \n\nSo, if you could find someone other than your current attorney to bring a malpractice case on a contingent basis, that would probably be better for you. Suing two attorneys instead of one also increases the likelihood that you can collect whatever judgments you secure. But, it may be hard to find someone to represent you in a case like that since the amount of time involved in a case like this for a plaintiff's attorney is very substantial and also requires considerable outlays for expert witness fees.\n\nAll of this said, however, attorney malpractice cases are very difficult to prevail in since you must prove not only malpractice but also a \"case within a case\" to show that you would have gotten a different and better result but for the malpractice. \n\nMost of the time, you will end up settling for only a portion of your damages prior to trial to avoid the cost of litigation and the risk of a defense verdict. So with a 33% to 50% contingent fee, your net recovery might realistically often be in the 1/4 to 1/3 of your losses in a decent settlement equal to half of your actual losses.\n\nA settlement like this is better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, but no attorney malpractice case is going to make you whole.

Option C is the most strategic course of action for several reasons:\n\n1. Pursuing a malpractice claim against only the original attorney (Option A) is limited in scope and potentially conflicted. The current trial attorney, who made a critical error by not entering key evidence, has a conflict of interest in this case. They cannot sue themselves and may not pursue all available avenues of recovery.\n\n2. Filing a complaint against the first judge (Option B) is not viable. As mentioned in the documentation, judges have absolute immunity from legal liability for their judicial actions.\n\n3. Option C addresses multiple issues:\n   - It allows for pursuit of claims against both the original attorney (for potentially altering the trust's intent) and the current attorney (for the evidentiary error).\n   - A new attorney would not have the conflicts of interest present in the current attorney.\n   - This approach increases the potential for recovery by targeting multiple parties.\n   - It avoids the ethical concerns of having an attorney with a potential conflict of interest represent you.\n\n4.

(3\\) shall be designated in a writing signed by the voter under\n> penalty of perjury; and\n> \n> \n> (4\\) shall execute an affidavit under penalty of perjury that the\n> ballot was:\n> \n> \n> (i) delivered to the voter who submitted the application;\n> \n> \n> (ii) marked and placed in an envelope by the voter, or with assistance\n> as allowed by regulation, in the agent's presence;\n> \n> \n> (iii) returned to the local board by the agent.\n\nA person asked to deliver a ballot would be such an \"agent\". An agent who failed to make the required affidavit would be in violation of section 9\\-307\\. One who made the affidavit and saying that the ballot was properly delivered but did so falsely would be guilty of perjury. Similar laws exist in all US states, as I understand things.\n\nIn addition this may be mail theft under [18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1708](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1708) or under another provision or under USPS regulation, I am not sure.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A registered voter asks you to mail their sealed absentee ballot for an upcoming presidential election. On the way to the post office, you decide not to mail it because you disagree with their voting choice.

Firstly, state election laws, such as Maryland's Section 9-307, typically require designated agents to execute an affidavit confirming proper handling and delivery of absentee ballots. By failing to deliver the ballot as promised, you would be in violation of these state laws. If you had signed such an affidavit and then intentionally failed to deliver the ballot, you could also be charged with perjury.\n\nSecondly, the act of intentionally \"losing\" or destroying a ballot that was entrusted to you for mailing likely constitutes mail theft under federal law, specifically 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1708. This statute covers the theft or destruction of mail, including ballots.\n\nOption A is incorrect because federal laws do indeed apply to this situation. Option B overlooks the state-level violations. Option D is incorrect because intentionally interfering with someone else's right to vote is not protected speech under the First Amendment.\n\nThis question requires analysis of both state and federal laws, integration of multiple legal concepts, and application to a real-world scenario, testing critical thinking about the intersection of election law and mail fraud."}, "94": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4465/company-advertising-something-100-cheaper-than-it-is", "docs_id": 4465, "title": "Company advertising something $100 cheaper than it is", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A company is advertising a product on Google for $44\\.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The certificate of title represents ownership of the vehicle, which is necessary regardless of whether the car is being driven or not. As the new owner, the enthusiast needs to obtain this document to prove legal ownership.\n\n2. Registration is typically required for operating a vehicle on public roads. However, the documentation mentions that it's possible to not register a vehicle if it's not being used, using California's \"certificate of non-operation\" as an example.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because while registration might not be necessary, simply having a title without any form of registration or non-operational declaration could be problematic in many states.\n\n4. Option B is incorrect because the title should be obtained immediately upon purchase to establish ownership, regardless of the vehicle's operational status.\n\n5.

However in the United Kingdom there is another interesting system with its own traditions, procedures, terminology \u2013 Scots Law (Scottish Law).\n\nI wonder if there is any significant influence of Scots Law anywhere outside Scotland itself, particularly in the US? Are there any elements in any US legal system, or parts of it, that can be traced to Scots Law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nI really can't think of any influences of Scots Law on U.S. law. In all of the areas where I know Scots law to be distinctive vis\\-a\\-vis English common law, the U.S. has not followed the Scots law model, and I have never seen a Scottish precedent cited in a court opinion in the U.S. while I have seen many English ones cited (with one narrow exception noted below).\n\nFor example, while the Scots Law concept of a criminal trial verdict of \"not proven\" rather than \"not guilty\" has been discussed by academics and policymakers, to the best of my knowledge, no U.S. jurisdiction has adopted a \"not proven\" verdict option.\n\nTwo U.S. states experimented with non\\-unanimous verdicts, something that U.S. law has since disavowed, but so far as I know, this decision was not borrowed from Scottish practice. In Louisiana, it was a calculated strategy to make it easier to convict black defendants after slavery was abolished.\n\nNo U.S. jurisdiction has ever had petite juries of 15 in any kind of case.\n\nScotland and the U.S. are now aligned in being jurisdictions that have [jury trials of ordinary personal injury cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_jury_in_Scotland), something that very few countries do, but in the U.S. case, the right to a jury trial in personal injury cases flows from English law practice that England later modified while the U.S. did not, rather than from copying Scots law.\n\nScotland still has many [common law crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_criminal_law), which U.S. jurisdictions are in the final stages of completely abolishing (most have done so, but there are a few partial stragglers). Similarly, U.S. criminal law, unlike Scots Law, has never required corroboration for a criminal conviction, although, of course, it is desirable to have it if possible.\n\nThe [Scottish Court system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_Scotland) has much more specialization of court jurisdiction than almost all U.S. jurisdictions do, although U.S. jurisdictions vary in the extent to which they have specialized courts, and of course, no U.S. jurisdiction has had religious courts since the early 1800s before the church was disestablished in New England.\n\nWhile the U.S. merged law and equity for the most part, as did most common law jurisdictions, the distinction still has a significant residual effect that differs from [Scots law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law) which never fully separated the two. Equity is still taught as a distinct elective class in many U.S. law schools to this day.\n\nPerhaps the only area I can think of where there has arguably been some borrowing from Scots Law has been in the jurisdiction and choice of law analysis applied to marriage and divorce questions. It used to be easier to get married in Scotland than in England, and in cases of parental or religious opposition, couples sometimes went to Scotland to get married and left courts to sort out whether that was legitimate after the fact. This is an area where U.S. case law sometimes referred to how those issues were resolved in the cases of disputes over whether English or Scottish laws related to marriage formation and marriage dissolution should apply.\n\nI don't know the law of mineral rights well enough to describe the provenance of some of its doctrines accurately, but there are some similarities between the Scottish concepts applicable to the structure of mineral rights, when they are reserved in a patent from the sovereign of the surface rights to property (as many key mineral rights in Scotland were starting in the early modern period), that may have some Scots Law influence.\n\nThe lack of Scots Law impact on U.S. law despite significant Scottish immigration to the U.S. is to some extent a function of U.S. immigration history.\n\nScottish immigration that was early enough to have an impact on the legal system's larger outlines was mostly \"Scotch\\-Irish\" (i.e. Protestants from the Scottish borderlands, often traditionally herders or subsistence farmers, who were ancestral to the current Irish Protestants of Northern Ireland), who were lower to middle class, who engaged mostly in rural subsistence farming in Appalachia and the rural American South, and were not prominent in commerce and were subordinate to an English elite (the Episcopal Church of English origins has always a higher socioeconomic status church in the U.S. than the Presbyterian Church which has Scottish roots).\n\nBy the time middle class Scottish people engaged in commerce and inclined to participate in formal law and politics arrived in the U.S., a wave of migration reflected in the American West mostly from the mid\\-1800s as part of the gold rush and homesteading movements, the die was largely already cast with respect to major framework level issues in the U.S. legal system. The map below partially obscures this history to some extent, however, because [many people with Scotch\\-Irish ancestry now identify for census purposes as \"American.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch-Irish_Americans)\n\nMany anthropologists attribute the \"[culture of honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_honor_(Southern_United_States))\" of the American South and Appalachia to a Scotch\\-Irish ancestral source, and this culture of honor surely did influence the character of various U.S. legal doctrines and legislative developments in the U.S., but it did not involve direct borrowings from Scots Law, and indeed, it can be seen as deriving from a subculture of people for whom formal legal institutions in Scotland were sufficiently weak in practical application that they had little impact on their lives.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cKhrL.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cKhrL.jpg)\n\nHonestly, if I had to hazard a guess, I would say that there have been more borrowings from Australian legal innovations (especially in probate and real property), and from civil law systems (for example, the law of good faith and fair dealing, and the law of unjust enrichment), than there have been from Scots law.\n\nI would be happy to be corrected if someone is aware of a counterexample, however.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A legal historian is researching the influence of various legal systems on the United States.

Is this something that happens / could happen in the UK, US, Europe?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The legal situation is that these tests can give you a hint who the suspect might be, and in previous applications of the technique, existing voluntarily\\-provided genetic information from relatives sufficed to point to the actual suspect. You cannot arrest or convict based on a hint. A hint plus other facts can result in a warrant, which can result in a conviction. This is the case of the Golden State Killer. The details of the case are not generally known, but [see this paper](https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1136717) for a bit more information. Basically, they used public genetic databases to arrive at a tree of about 1,000 persons related to the suspect, and used other investigative techniques to narrow it down further. Here is the heavily redacted warrant affidavit that will give you some clue what else went into the search warrant leading to his arrest. Simply knowing \"the suspect was of Northern European ancestory\" is of insufficient specificity to support a search of all full\\-blooded and partial\\-blooded Scotsmen.\n\nThis \"can\" happen in the US, but the real question is, how effective is the technique. This is 99% a non\\-legal question about sufficiently extensive genetic databases. GEDMatch attempted to limit how their database could be used to catch criminals, but [had mixed success](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDmatch#Data_policy). There have been attempts to limit police access to genetic databases at the state level, and no laws have been passed. The Dept. of Justice has limited restrictions on the use of forensic genetic data in cases that it is involved with in certain ways, [see here](https://www.justice.gov/olp/page/file/1204386/download). Basically, what they say is\n\n> A suspect shall not be arrested based solely on a genetic association\n> generated by a GG service. If a suspect is identified after a genetic\n> association has occurred, STR DNA typing must be performed, and the\n> suspect\u2019s STR DNA profile must be directly compared to the forensic\n> profile previously uploaded to CODIS. This comparison is necessary to\n> confirm that the forensic sample could have originated from the\n> suspect\n\n[That paper](https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1136717) which I mentioned above has detected in SCOTUS some retreat the position that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in information willingly given to a third party, starting with [US v. Jones](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/565/400/), 565 U.S. 400\\. Conceivably, such testing could fall within the scope of 4th Amendment privacy constraints, given a suitable ruling (or argument that results in such ruling). At present, there is no legal impediment to that kind of testing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A detective is investigating a murder case where the only physical evidence is DNA found under the victim's fingernails. The detective wants to use genetic genealogy techniques to narrow down potential suspects. Which of the following approaches would be most appropriate and legally sound?\n\nA) Obtain a warrant to search all individuals of Scottish descent in the area based on the DNA analysis results\nB) Use the DNA to determine broad racial characteristics and focus the investigation on that specific racial group\nC) Upload the DNA profile to a public genetic database and use family tree mapping to identify potential relatives of the suspect\nD) Arrest the closest genetic match found in the database as the primary suspect\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation, targeting higher cognitive levels. The correct answer, C, aligns with the legal and investigative approach described in the Golden State Killer case. This method involves using public genetic databases to create a family tree of potential relatives, which is then combined with other investigative techniques to narrow down suspects. \n\nOption A is incorrect and potentially illegal, as the documentation states that simply knowing a suspect's broad genetic origin is insufficient to support searching all individuals of that descent. \n\nOption B is ethically questionable and could lead to racial profiling, which the documentation suggests would be problematic.\n\nOption D violates the Department of Justice guidelines mentioned, which state that \"A suspect shall not be arrested based solely on a genetic association generated by a GG service.\"\n\nThis approach respects legal boundaries while still utilizing advanced genetic techniques in criminal investigations. It also highlights the importance of combining genetic evidence with traditional investigative methods, rather than relying solely on DNA analysis. The question tests critical thinking about the ethical and legal implications of using genetic information in law enforcement, reflecting real-world applications and scenarios."}}
