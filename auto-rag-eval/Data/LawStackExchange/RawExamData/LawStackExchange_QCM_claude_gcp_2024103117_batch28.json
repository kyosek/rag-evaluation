Carrots are only subject to ordinary food safety regulations in the US, and the outcome would not change by substituting broccoli, mustard, filet mignon, or \"lots of water\". Drugs that are introduced on the market have to be approved by the FDA, but legacy foods do not. We are in the realm that requires no FDA approval of carrots. The line, for product\\-purveyors, is drawn by [21 USC 321(g)(1\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/321), and [here](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/santhigram-kerala-ayurvedic-co-us-inc-625892-05192022) is an FDA warning letter to an Ayurvedic medical treatment maker / seller.\n\nThere are ample law concerning \"practice of medicine\", and there is the First Amendment which erects a strong barrier against laws which aim to prohibit people from disseminating an officially\\-unapproved viewpoint (to simplify matters, I presume \u2013 contrary to fact \u2013 that no medical authority has endorsed the specific efficacy of carrots). The government cannot punish you for taking approach A or B.\n\nIf you have a license to practice medicine (of the relevant kind), you may be subject to state licensing\\-board sanctions for making unapproved claims (one of the factors that overrides the First Amendment). If you have no license, then the question is whether your activity falls within the realm of \"practicing medicine\" in the state. In Washington, the line is drawn via [RCW 18\\.71\\.011](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=18.71.011)\n\n> A person is practicing medicine if he or she does one or more of the\n> following: (1\\) Offers or undertakes to diagnose, cure, advise, or\n> prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity,\n> deformity, pain or other condition, physical or mental, real or\n> imaginary, by any means or instrumentality...\n\nTechnically, you cannot advise a person to take an aspirin if they have a headache. However, this law is within the scope of business regulations, so part of the line not directly encoded in that definition (related to the requirement to have a license) is that you are doing this as a business.\n\nA person must have a state license in Washington to be a \"common school\" (K\\-12\\) teacher. Your gym teacher can tell you to eat carrots to cure your depression or whatever, and there is some (miniscule) chance that the teacher will get punished for giving such advice. A person does not have to have a license to be a university professor, therefore telling a student to eat carrots will lead to no government sanctions, though the employer may fire or reassign you, depending on circumstances. The crucial question is not whether you are advocating eating carrots, but what business you are engaged in, whereby in the course of that business you give advice. A person with a medical degree and license who is a greeter at Walmart is not subject to government sanctions for advising \"Eat carrots to cure your tumor / depression\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following scenarios is most likely to be considered legal under both federal and state laws?\n\nA) A licensed physician in California advises a patient in Oregon via video call to eat carrots to cure their brain tumor, charging $100 for the consultation.\n\nB) An unlicensed individual with no medical training meets in person with someone who has depression, advises them to eat carrots as a cure, and charges $100 for the session.\n\nC) A person with a medical degree from a foreign country, licensed to practice there but not in the U.S., advises a U.S. resident online to eat carrots to cure their brain tumor, charging $100 for the consultation.\n\nD) An author publishes a book titled \"Cure Your Depression with Carrots!\", clearly stating at the beginning that they have no psychological training.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is most likely to be legal due to First Amendment protections. Publishing a book with alternative health advice, even if scientifically unsound, is generally protected as free speech as long as it doesn't make fraudulent claims and includes a disclaimer about the author's lack of credentials. \n\nOption A could be illegal as it involves practicing medicine across state lines without proper licensing in the patient's state. \n\nOption B likely violates laws against practicing medicine (or psychology) without a license, especially since money is exchanged for health advice. \n\nOption C is problematic as it involves practicing medicine without a U.S. license, even if done remotely from another country.\n\nThe key factors here are the practice of medicine without a license, cross-state medical practice, and the distinction between publishing general information (protected speech) and providing personalized medical advice for a fee (regulated activity)."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27386/why-do-lease-agreements-commonly-prohibit-animals-and-also-specifically-prohibit", "docs_id": 27386, "title": "Why do lease agreements commonly prohibit animals and also specifically prohibit reptiles?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was reading over my lease agreement and noticed the following clause:\n\n> No animals or reptiles of any kind may be kept in or about the leased premises.\n\nI thought it odd that the language seems to single out reptiles as though such creatures were somehow not included under the \"animals\" umbrella. I did a search of the phrase to see if it is common, and it seems that [many lease agreements](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS784US784&biw=1536&bih=759&ei=tZXFWui-LImTzwL8tqPACg&q=lease%20%22No%20animals%20or%20reptiles%22&oq=lease%20%22No%20animals%20or%20reptiles%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3...141384.152587.0.153160.46.40.6.0.0.0.129.3077.31j5.37.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..3.41.3106.6..0j35i39k1j0i67k1j0i131k1j0i131i67k1j0i20i263k1j0i131i46k1j46i131k1j0i22i30k1j33i22i29i30k1j33i21k1j33i160k1.150.WV71bSNbSMQ) use this phrase. Why do these documents, which are otherwise quite precise and carefully worded, make such an odd distinction?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Because [animal](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/animal) has several definitions, specifically:\n\n> **2 b** : Mammal\n\nWhile you are probably thinking of:\n\n> **1** : any of a kingdom (Animalia) of living things including many\\-celled organisms and often many of the single\\-celled ones (such as protozoans) that typically differ from plants in having cells without cellulose walls, in lacking chlorophyll and the capacity for photosynthesis, in requiring more complex food materials (such as proteins), in being organized to a greater degree of complexity, and in having the capacity for spontaneous movement and rapid motor responses to stimulation\n\nWhile reptiles are captured by **1**, they aren't by **2 b**.

The phrase \"or reptiles\" is included to avoid potential disputes arising from different definitions of the word \"animal\". As explained in the documentation, the word \"animal\" can have multiple definitions. While in biological terms (and in common usage) reptiles are indeed classified as animals, some definitions of \"animal\" specifically refer to mammals. By explicitly mentioning reptiles, the lease agreement eliminates any potential ambiguity or argument about whether reptiles are included in the prohibition. This precise language helps prevent disputes that could arise if a tenant were to argue that reptiles are not covered by a ban on \"animals\" alone.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it may be true that the clause prohibits exotic pets, this is not the primary reason for the specific mention of reptiles.\n\nOption B is incorrect because reptiles are legally considered animals; the issue is with potential varying definitions, not legal classification.\n\nOption D is plausible but not the best answer.

Therefore it is not possible to give an absolute yes/no as to whether masking text with asterisks is or is not lawful.\n\nWe can gain a deeper insight by looking at the GDPR itself. Firstly, the definition of **processing** (Art. 4 lit. 2\\):\n\n> any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction\n\nAs [mentioned by amon](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46652/hiding-order-invoice-information-gdpr#comment89702_46652), the principles relating to processing of personal data (Art. 5\\) are highly relevant, insofar as the activity constitutes processing. In particular, **purpose limitation**:\n\n> \\[Personal data shall be] collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes\n\n...and **data minimisation**:\n\n> \\[Personal data shall be] adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed\n\nI would argue that **making available** the personal data on an invoice is processing. There are two separate operations:\n\n1. Making the data available to authenticated users; and\n2. Making the data available to non\\-authenticated users\n\nThe purpose of making it available to authenticated users may be different to the purpose of making it available to non\\-authenticated users. Again acknowledging [amon](http://amon), the necessity of making the data available to non\\-authenticated users must be examined, as too must the means by which a non\\-authenticated user gains access to an invoice: are they using a URL that contains a token of some kind? Is this unique in some way? It could be that the presentation of a token itself constitutes authentication and thus authorisation to view the entire invoice, in which case further redaction may not be necessary if there is a clear necessity to disclose the entire contents to such a user. Whether the token expires or is limited to a certain referrer would be part of complying with the **integrity and confidentiality** principle and Art. 32 (Security of processing) by implementation of technical measures.\n\nWhen considering pseudonymisation and anonymisation, you will note that the redaction of name and address data from a certain view of the invoice, while nevertheless displaying the invoice number, constitutes pseudonymisation, since it would be possible with unfettered access to the remaining data, to determine the name and address from the invoice number, but not for the non\\-authenticated user whose view is redacted. In such a case, I fail to see how or why the replacement of a string with the same number of asterisks, or starting with the real character is secure or even practical, when the entire field could simply be replaced with a fixed\\-width string of asterisks or other filler, thus providing the user with no right or necessity to view the personal data with no further insight into what the personal data may or may not be.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the GDPR information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to GDPR principles, which of the following approaches would be most appropriate for displaying invoice information to non-authenticated users while protecting personal data?\n\nA) Replace each character of the name and address with an asterisk, maintaining the exact length of the original data\nB) Show the first letter of each field followed by asterisks matching the remaining character count\nC) Replace entire sensitive fields with a fixed-width string of asterisks, regardless of the original data length\nD) Display the full invoice information, but require users to agree to a privacy policy before viewing\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate approach according to GDPR principles. It aligns with the data minimization principle by limiting the information displayed to what is necessary for non-authenticated users. It also avoids potential security risks associated with options A and B, which could reveal information about the data's structure or length. Option C provides the least amount of insight into the personal data while still indicating that protected information exists.\n\nOption A is problematic because it reveals the exact length of the sensitive data, which could be used to infer information or assist in potential data reconstruction attempts. \n\nOption B, while slightly better than A, still provides more information than necessary by revealing the first letter of each field, which goes against the principle of data minimization.\n\nOption D violates the purpose limitation and data minimization principles by unnecessarily disclosing full personal data to non-authenticated users, regardless of the privacy policy agreement.\n\nThe correct approach (C) best balances the need to indicate the presence of information with the requirement to protect personal data, adhering to GDPR's principles of data protection and minimization."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/10775/in-english-law-who-or-what-body-starts-the-process-of-creating-a-new-statute", "docs_id": 10775, "title": "In English law, who or what body starts the process of creating a new statute?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Statutes are legislation from the UK Parliament and devolved parliaments.

The documentation clearly states that any member of parliament can move a bill, including both government ministers and backbenchers (through private member's bills).

You can check if this idea *has* been patented because if it has then it is a matter of public record.\n\nConfidential Information\n------------------------\n\nHowever, there is another method of protecting ideas; keeping them secret. It is highly likely that the information that you gained as an employee is confidential. You say you signed a non\\-disclosure agreement; you will be bound by whatever that says. Even if you hadn't, **confidentiality is an implied term of any employment contract**; an explicit term can reduce its coverage or make explicit what is and is not confidential.\n\nFor breach of confidence to be established:\n\n1. The information must be confidential (it probably is);\n2. The circumstances of the disclosure to you are such that you know or should know it is confidential (they probably were);\n3.

Employment contracts typically imply confidentiality, and NDAs further reinforce this obligation. The safest approach is to seek authorization from the former employer before pursuing the idea. This avoids potential legal issues related to breach of confidence, which can result in injunctions or financial penalties.

Further they can be appealed, however, the grounds for appeal are restricted to those enumerated in the Act or agreed by the parties.\n\nIn general, this is the case for all jurisdictions including England, however, the specific Acts that makes arbitration legal are different in each jurisdiction.\n\nSection 69 of the UK Arbitration Act 1996 enumerates the rights of appeal and which may and may not be excluded. That said, appeals from arbitrations are rarely initiated and exen more rarely upheld. A recent decision, *NYK Bulkship (Atlantic) NV v Cargill International SA \\[2016] UKSC 20* has clarified this section:\n\n> The only two grounds to challenge an award which cannot be waived in an English\\-seated arbitration are those of substantive jurisdiction or serious irregularity.

They are restricted in employment contracts where the employee has a statutory right to appeal to an employment tribunal in that they cannot be the sole remedy and they are prohibited in insolvency proceedings and criminal matters.\n\nOther than impartiality, there are no requirements under the Arbitration Act relating to the qualifications and characteristics of arbitrators. It is not necessary for an arbitrator to be a national of, or licensed to practice in, England.\n\nWhile not strictly relevant to English law [recent decisions](http://uk.practicallaw.com/1-519-4506?source=relatedcontent#) in the USA and Canada on the unconscionably of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts (where one party can offer a \"take\\-it\\-or\\-leave\\-it\" contract to the other) have come to diametrically opposed conclusions.

Without such a license, if an infringement claim were to be raised, your actions might be seen to be infringing. You might be vindicated in the end, or not.\n\nI would recommend getting permission in writing or, failing in that, I would develop your schema independently with an eye to general interoperability in the future.

Where does it get the name?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Letters patent are instruments issued by the monarch to publicly grant some specific rights to some person(s) with the backing of the royal power. It is also where the word *patent* (in its intellectual property sense) comes from, since the monopoly of invention was only granted by the authority of the monarch via a letter patent.\n\nAnother use of the letters patent is to constituting certain offices, particular those exercising the royal power, for example, [the Governor General of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_Patent,_1947).\n\nUnder the British system, the courts are thought to be [the monarch exercising their power over the bench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Bench).\n\nMany High Courts of India were constituted by the British monarch during the colonial rul. The British Parliament allows the monarch to issue letters patent for such purposes in the [1861 High Courts Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_High_Courts_Act_1861). Their jurisdictions were specified by letters patent.\n\nOne of such jurisdiction is the power for a High Court to hear appeals from the decisions of one of its justices.\n\nFor example, in [the letters patent establishing the High Court in Calcutta](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979dd64a93263ca60b74d6):\n\n> 14.

(For what it is worth, in German, all nouns are capitalized.)\n\n*Petitioner* should be capitalized because it is being used as a proper noun in lieu of someone's name. \n\n*Court* should be capitalized here because the rule is that the word Court is capitalized when you are talking about the court that you are in, but in lower case when you are talking about another court's rulings. \n\n*Enter* was improperly capitalized. \n\n*Petitions* is improperly capitalized.\n\n(In general, probably as a residual of the fact that English is a Germanic language, verbs are almost never capitalized unless they are defined terms or are the first word in a sentence.) \n\n*Order* is capitalized when it refers to a particular order that already exists, but should be in lower case here when it is referring to an order that is being requested in the future.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In legal writing for state court system Circuit Courts in the US handling Domestic Relations, which of the following statements is correct regarding the use of formal language and capitalization?\n\nA) The phrase \"NOW COMES\" is considered modern and preferred in the first sentence of legal documents.\nB) Capitalizing every word that seems important is proper English grammar in legal writing.\nC) The word \"Court\" should always be capitalized, regardless of whether it refers to the current court or another court's rulings.\nD) \"Petitioner\" should be capitalized when used as a proper noun in place of someone's name, while \"Enter\" and \"Petitions\" should not be capitalized unless they start a sentence.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the proper use of capitalization in legal writing as described in the source material. \"Petitioner\" is capitalized when used as a proper noun, while verbs like \"Enter\" and \"Petitions\" should not be capitalized unless they are the first word in a sentence.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"NOW COMES\" is described as traditional and formal, not modern or preferred in current legal writing.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the source explicitly states that capitalizing every important word is not proper English grammar.\n\nOption C is incorrect because \"Court\" should only be capitalized when referring to the court currently being addressed, not when mentioning other courts' rulings."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8382/is-magsafe-patented-such-that-no-one-else-can-make-magnetic-power-supplies", "docs_id": 8382, "title": "Is MagSafe patented such that no one else can make magnetic power supplies?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm talking about [MagSafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe), the connector used on some Apple power adapters that pops out of the socket easily, and snaps into place using a magnet, so that both the cable and the socket are unlikely to be damaged in the event of an unexpected disconnection.\n\n[![MagSafe generation 1](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KAAL3.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KAAL3.jpg)\n\nIs this patented in such a way that only Apple can legally make a similar connector?

It contains 57 claims which define what is protected, and [35 USC 116](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/112) spells out the logic of claims (which, in a nutshell, says \"this can get really complicated\"). The set of claims defines what it patented, and infringement is defined in [35 USC 271](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271) as\n\n> whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any\n>  patented invention, within the United States or imports into the\n>  United States any patented invention during the term of the patent\n>  therefor, infringes the patent\n\nthat is, there isn't anything statutorily more specific about how similar similar is. Since the claims define what is protected, this generally is taken to refer to things that are the same w.r.t. to all of the claims. \"Generally\" means that there is a [doctrine of equivalents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_of_equivalents), exemplified by [Warner\\-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co. 520 U.S. 17](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/17/case.html), whereby a court may find infringement when there is an insubstantial difference between the allegedly infringing thing and the protected invention.\n\nThe Apple patent does not specify a specific number of millimeters between the contacts, so making a connector that is exactly the same as the Apple device (as marketed) but with different spacing on the connectors would be an infringement, because that spacing is not specified in a claim.

Using a different method to secure the connection (like chewing gum instead of magnets) would likely be considered a substantial change.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the spacing between contacts is not specified in Apple's patent claims, so changing this alone would still be considered an infringement.\n\nOption B is too broad and incorrect.

They didn't have either. I then reached out again last month (after 14 months had passed) with no response, and then a few days ago (after 15 months) where they said the same thing as before.\n\nFOIA requires agencies to stick to the basic timelines of 20 working days. But if a request is judged to be complex (more accurately: in certain \"unusual circumstances\" like needing to search field facilities), FOIA also permits agencies to negotiate an extended timeline or narrowed scope with the requester (described in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6\\)(B)).

Upon attempting to set up water service, he was informed of an outstanding water bill from 2001. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's legal obligations?\n\nA) John is not responsible for the bill because it predates his ownership and Florida has a 7-year statute of limitations on debt collection.\n\nB) John is responsible for the bill because water bills are always tied to the property, regardless of ownership changes or time passed.\n\nC) John may be responsible for the bill, but he should first verify if the debt was properly filed as a lien and if it was incurred by a previous owner rather than a renter.\n\nD) John is automatically exempt from the bill because more than 20 years have passed since it was incurred.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it most accurately reflects the complexities of the situation. While water bills generally go with the property, there are several factors to consider:\n\n1. The bill's age (21 years) exceeds Florida's 7-year statute of limitations on debt collection, which could potentially invalidate the claim.\n2. The bill needs to have been properly filed as a lien to remain enforceable against subsequent property owners.\n3. If the debt was incurred by a renter who had a direct agreement with the utility, it cannot be placed as a lien on the property under Florida law.\n4. A title search should have revealed any valid liens, so John should investigate whether a proper search was conducted during his purchase.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the 7-year limitation is mentioned, it doesn't account for the possibility of a properly filed lien. Answer B is too absolute, not considering the exceptions and limitations. Answer D is incorrect because there's no automatic 20-year exemption for such debts in Florida law."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/23475/subcontractor-being-refused-payment", "docs_id": 23475, "title": "Subcontractor being refused payment", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I\u2019m a IT contractor based in the United Kingdom, I have my own limited company.

I learnt of it the hard way, by being denied boarding on a Pegasus flight from Istanbul to Bergamo (despite calling the border police in Bergamo, who sent a clearance message to Pegasus).\n\nI then e\\-mailed my IATA contact and asked him to ask their Italian government sources to re\\-confirm this restriction. It was found not to exist whereby Timatic was corrected.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You've asked a two part question.\n\n> \\[Is this a violation of] the international policy that a country should never refuse entry to verified citizens of their own?\n\nIn considering that question, the US example may be illuminative. The US requires US citizens to have a \"passport book\" when flying into the US, even though the US issues \"passport cards\" that serve as proof of nationality. If you can get to the border and prove your US nationality (by passport card or otherwise), they'll let you in, but airlines won't board you unless you have a passport book. If you don't have a passport book, you're supposed to get to the nearest consulate and apply for a passport before flying to the US.\n\nBut note that the US obligation to admit its own citizens is principally a feature of US law. CBP does not waive [8 USC 1185](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1185) because of some international body; there is no body that enforces international \"policies\" of this nature. Rather, they do so because they know that the federal courts would require them to admit US citizens based on the right of free movement implicit in US law.\n\nIf someone were unable to get into their country of citizenship and unable to gain legal residence elsewhere then unless they could remain on the run for the rest of their life they would eventually end up as the subject of negotiation between whatever country is trying to deport them and their country of citizenship. In other words, in the worst case, such people become a bilateral diplomatic matter between two countries. Therefore, any challenge to the restriction would have to go through the Italian or EU legal system.\n\n> Is this a violation of the EU freedom of movement directive, whereby a verified EU/EFTA national cannot normally be refused entry to any EU/EFTA state?\n\nIt certainly seems to be, but without a decision from an EU court, we can't be certain. From Article 5 of the freedom of movement directive ([2004/38/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02004L0038-20110616)):\n\n> Article 5\n> \n> \n> Right of entry\n> \n> \n> 1\\.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to the provisions on travel documents applicable to national border controls, Member States shall grant Union citizens leave to enter their territory with a valid identity card or passport and shall grant family members who are not nationals of a Member State leave to enter their territory with a valid passport.\n> \n> \n> No entry visa or equivalent formality may be imposed on Union citizens.\n\nThis doesn't say anything about allowing EU citizens to *board aircraft* from non\\-EU destinations without their EU passports. So if Italy makes a rule that EU citizens need a passport to board a flight to Italy from outside the EU and Schengen area, that doesn't seem to violate Article 5 except by implication. It would be for a court to decide whether that implication is in fact present.\n\nBecause Article 5 doesn't say anything about where the passenger has flown from, we can also consider the case of a dual citizen of an EU member state and a \"third country,\" who might fly to Italy using the third\\-country passport, and then present a national ID card at the immigration counter. If such a traveler were denied entry, that would appear to violate Article 5\\. If that traveler's other nationality were one that required a visa in the non\\-EU passport, the traveler might have a stronger case that Italy's rule infringes on the right of free movement.\n\nEU or EFTA citizens could also challenge the restriction more generally as an infringement on the right of free movement that is established in the [Treaty on European Union](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12012M/TXT) (TEU), even if the directive itself does not prohibit the restriction. For example, one might argue that free movement is restricted because there are countries *to* which EU citizens can travel with only an ID card, but *from* which they cannot return to Italy with only that card.\n\nIn addition, non\\-Italian EU or EFTA citizens could challenge the more restrictive regime applied to them on the argument that it violates the principle of non\\-discrimination articulated in Article 9 of the TEU:\n\n> Article 9\n> \n> \n> In all its activities, the Union shall observe the principle of the equality of its citizens, who shall receive equal attention from its institutions, bodies, offices and agencies....\n\nFurthermore, non\\-Italians *residing in Italy* could challenge the more restrictive regime on the basis of Article 24 of the directive:\n\n> Article 24\n> \n> \n> Equal treatment\n> \n> \n> 1\\.\u00a0\u00a0Subject to such specific provisions as are expressly provided for in the Treaty and secondary law, all Union citizens residing on the basis of this Directive in the territory of the host Member State shall enjoy equal treatment with the nationals of that Member State within the scope of the Treaty.

A number of them are listed [here](http://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/treatise-finders/intellectualproperty).\n\nChisum on Patents is the leading treatise in the field and should usually be your first destination. It will mention most of the relevant primary source authority in the subject area you are researching.\n\n**Priority of Authorities**\n\nThe CFR is superior to the MPEP but inferior to Title 35\\. \n\nTreaties are co\\-equal with Title 35 with conflicts resolved by the date of enactment. \n\nCase law of the U.S. Supreme Court trumps everything (even, in practice, the language of the United States Constitution).\n\nCase law from the U.S. Court of Appeals from the Federal Circuit trumps everything except the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the very long string of recent reversals of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit by the U.S. Supreme Court (almost one or two a year for the last decade or so), however, every Federal Circuit case should be analyzed to determine if it has been implicitly overturned or limited by the applicable U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence.\n\nThe United States Constitution trumps everything except U.S. Supreme Court cases and cases from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (these cases impliedly provide definitive interpretations of the United States Constitution). \n\nCase law from a U.S. District Court is not binding on anyone but the parties to the case, but is highly persuasive and in practice is about on a par with the MPEP, but subordinate to the CFR and administrative case law of PTO bodies.\n\nOne complicated aspect of case law is that it is only binding when it resolves a question of law necessary to resolve to decide the case before it. Sometimes opinions go off on tangents which discuss other questions of law not before the court and that is called \"dicta\" which is persuasive on that point of law, but not binding and not as authoritative. It is not always obvious what constitutes the binding portion of a court decision and what constitutes dicta.\n\nAnother complexity in case law involves concurring or dissenting opinions in cases. Dissenting opinions, obviously, are not binding on anyone but sometimes clarify the scope of the majority opinion. If there is a plurality opinion and a concurring opinion in a case, they have equal weight and neither opinion's rule is definitive except to the extent that they agree. Generally speaking a majority opinion will be binding relative to a concurring opinion in the same case, but that status isn't really definitive and a concurring opinion should be considered even when it accompanies a majority opinion even though the concurring opinion shouldn't be considered binding in that situation.\n\nOf course, all case law (and for that matter all other authority) can be made obsolete by subsequent amendments to Title 35 or by the adoption of new treaties.\n\nA treatise isn't binding on anyone, but a well reasoned passage from a leading treatise like Chisum will, in practice, be given weight a little below a U.S. Court for the Federal Circuit case, but often greater than any lesser source of authority on a topic. A well reasoned passage in a lesser treatise is typically given a weight comparable to a U.S. District Court case that is on point.\n\n**Loose Ends**\n\nOne of the important sources for prior art is the compendium of all patents ever issued by the United States (the vast majority of which have expired and entered the public domain). You can get them all for a very reasonable cost in electronic form. The compendium of patents which have not expired is obviously relevant when attempting to determine if a potential patent or technique or process of a client infringes on any existing patent.\n\nThere are also some patent issues (e.g. jurisdiction and venue in patent disputes) which depend upon other Titles of the United States Code and have the same priority as Title 35 of the United States Code.\n\nThere are circumstances in which the procedural rules of various courts which issue relevant case law are relevant. Each type of court has its own rules of procedure, and each particular court has its own local rules. (This is not hypothetical, I've had a case involving patent law in which three\\-quarters of the motion practice in the heavily litigated case depended upon the local rules of practice in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.)\n\nPrecedents of U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, and precedents from U.S. Court of Appeal for Circuits other than the Federal Circuit, are sometimes relevant as well (e.g. interpreting procedural court rules, rules of evidence, or very general principles of law that aren't restricted to patent law such as the *ex post facto* clause of the U.S. Constitution). But, for the most part, patent case law arises in U.S. District Courts, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court and the administrative tribunals of the PTO.\n\nIssues related to the relationship between an attorney and a client in patent law cases (e.g. attorney malpractice law in patent cases) is a question of state law rather than federal law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the hierarchy of patent law authorities, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) takes precedence over the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in patent law interpretation.\n\nB) U.S. Supreme Court decisions on patent law can effectively override the explicit language of the United States Constitution.\n\nC) Treatises like Chisum on Patents are considered primary sources of patent law and carry more weight than Federal Circuit court decisions.\n\nD) The United States Code Title 35 always takes precedence over international treaties related to patent law.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the complex hierarchy of patent law authorities.

Searching someone based solely on their name is obviously illegal as per the 4th amendment, but I assume bigotry exists so I learned to deal with it. However, what follows is a special case.\n\nLet us say I wanted to go from airport A to airport C, and I need to transfer flights along this journey at airport B. Airport B decided to do an advanced search, causing me to miss my flight to airport C since the advanced search had taken too much time.\n\nIs this a breach of the 4th amendment? Since the advanced search would be considered unreasonable in this scenario as it caused me to miss a flight, and the only justification that airport security could provide for the search was my name which is already illegal. Surely in this case airport security would be obligated to skip an advanced search on me since I have another flight shortly, but they decided not to; the only confounding variable that could have caused this was my *name*.\n\n*This is specific to the United States.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The 4th amendment is irrelevant because you [consented](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/US_Criminal_Law/Search_and_seizure/Without_a_warrant) to being searched as a condition of passing through security \\- you don\u2019t *have* to fly. You cannot revoke that consent once x\\-ray screening or metal detection has commenced i.e. once your bags are checked, your hand luggage is in the scanner or you have entered the metal detector.\n\nThe relevant issue is whether there has been a violation of the 14th amendment requiring equal treatment. If the ethnicity of your name is the *sole* reason you were selected for advanced screening then that is clearly a violation of this. However, if it is only one factor among several then it isn\u2019t.\n\nHowever, the problem is that TSA agents are not required to articulate their reasons for selecting you (or anyone else) and indeed, they do not have to have a reason. Therefore it is almost impossible to prove that this has happened. Several cases in the wider \u201cpolicing\u201d regime have suggested that even if statistically certain groups are disproportionately targeted then that is not evidence of such targeting in a particular case.\n\nFurther it is not clear if you would even have standing to sue \\- to prevent this kind of discrimination you have to show that you *personally* at risk of harm in the future.\n\nClearly this state of affairs is problematical \\- there is little doubt that airport screening, not just in the USA but worldwide is tainted by this sort of bias. The data shows it as well as plenty of anecdotal evidence \\- I\u2019m 1st generation Australian with UK and Australian parents, my son\u2019s girlfriend is 2nd generation but her grandparents were Thai: she gets stopped way more than I do.\n\nThis is bad not just because it\u2019s antithetical to human rights but also because it is demonstrably less effective than purely random screening \\- where there is bias, that bias can be gamed. [This](https://thepointsguy.com/2015/06/does-tsa-screening-really-work/) article from a TSA employee states \"Behavior Detection Officers (the guys who walk around and watch to see if you look creepy) are useless, and there are widespread rumors within TSA that the BDO program won\u2019t be around for much longer.\" \"The guys\" are people and, like all of us, are subject to overt and subconscious bias in deciding what \"look\\[s] creepy\".\n\nNotwithstanding, security is never \u201cobliged\u201d to \u201cskip\u201d a search even if the reason for that search is arguably illegitimate.

However, there may be 14th Amendment equal treatment concerns if the selection for advanced screening is based solely on the ethnicity of the person's name. Option A is incorrect because the 4th Amendment doesn't apply here.

Now, particular statutes may be phrased as requiring certain actions but, if you read them the \u201ccommon law way\u201d to coin a phrase, they are really imposing sanctions for doing the prohibited thing that falls outside those parameters.\n\nSince there is no legal prohibition on using multiple names (simultaneously or sequentially) you are free to do so.\n\nNow, there are common law prohibitions of, for example, fraud or tax evasion. So, if you use different names *for the purpose* of doing those prohibited things, then that is illegal but it is the specific criminality that is sanctioned, not the use of the alias in perpetrating it.\n\nThe UK has a law that makes it a crime to not register the birth of a child. It also imposes some (and by most country\u2019s standards, very few) restrictions on the name a child can be registered under. But there is no legal obligation on the child or their parents to use the registered name in any particular circumstances. There may be difficulties (amounting to impossibility in some cases) in obtaining a passport, opening a bank account, or claiming social security under a non\\-registered name but that is due to the necessity to *identify* the individual for which the name serves as a proxy.\n\nHowever, outside the requirements of specific statutes or administrative procedures, the common law position is that your name is what people call you and you identify as your name. The second part is important \\- I have been called dickhead on many occasions but I do not consider it to be my name.\n\nThe UK has a patronymic tradition for surnames so, usually, on marriage, the female adopts the surname of the male and that, through the marriage certificate, becomes her registered name. However, it is extremely common for women to continue to use their original (and now not registered) name in their professional life and her new name in her private life. This can be problematic.

The legal landscape regarding animals filing lawsuits in their own name is complex and not fully settled, but the trend leans against recognizing animal standing. While there have been some cases where animals were named as plaintiffs (like Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land & Natural Resources), these instances have generally been dismissed as non-binding dicta by higher courts. The Cetacean Community v. Bush case acknowledged that Article III of the Constitution doesn't explicitly prevent animal plaintiffs, but also ruled that animals do not have statutory standing under various environmental protection acts. More recent cases like Naruto v. Slater have further reinforced the difficulty of establishing animal standing. While the door isn't completely closed on the possibility, current precedent generally does not recognize independent animal standing to sue.\n\nOption A is incorrect because animals have not consistently been granted standing.
