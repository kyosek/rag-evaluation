Apparently there's an exemption from the 1\\.5x pay for certain engineering positions, which I was told this was. I was (and am) happy with the pay we agreed on.\n\nSo the contracting firm sent me a copy of the standard contract to read and sign. But the contract said I was to be paid 1\\.5x the amount of my normal rate for overtime. \n\nBefore signing, I sent them a message saying, \"I think this is a mistake.\" And they came back and said, \"You're right, it's supposed to be 1x for overtime.\" They sent me another copy, but it had the same mistake in it. At that point, I signed it since we were on the same page regarding the terms even though it was still wrong. My thinking was that it was just a piece of (digital) paper that was wrong, and in my favor anyway. The actual contract (the intangible agreement between the two parties) was correct and mutually agreed upon.\n\nMy question is, **with the contract as it stands, is there any risk that I am taking by not fixing it?** I'm getting paid the amount I expect (1x for overtime) and have no intentions to pull more out of them just because the written contract is wrong. I don't want to be in a bad situation, but I don't want to go through the hassle of changing something that doesn't matter either.\n\nNote: I live/work in New York state\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Clearly in this case the writing does not reflect your actual agreement. If you were to bill for 1\\.5x your normal rate for hours over 40/week, relying on the writing, and it came to court, you might win, based on the general rule that matters explicitly covered in the written agreement are treated as final, and evidence of contradictory oral agreements are often not accepted to contradict the contract document. This is known as the *parole evidence* rule. \n\nBut you don't plan to issue such a bill, so that won't come up. I don't see that you are at any legal risk. But you could send the client a letter saying that you signed the contract document so as not to hold the job up, but you think there is a mistake in it (pointing out exactly where and what the error is). This would help establish your ethics and good faith, so that if somehow there was a problem over this later (although that seems unlikely) you can't be accused of any improper actions. Keep a copy of any such letter.\n\nBy the way, if you are an independent contractor, the governmental standard for overtime does not normally apply (in the US). If you are an **employee** of a consulting company, it may or may not, depending on your salary level and the kind of work you do. An independent contractor **can** contract for a higher rate for overtime hours, if the client is willing to agree.

Note, this does not mean self\\-defense is acceptable against an unlawful arrest.\n\nSo, can this still be used as precedent today? Because what I learned from my Criminal Justice education was that a person can only act in self defense if they did not know the officer was an officer or if the officer turned out to be someone impersonating an officer. Unlawful arrest or even misuse of force can only be legally remedied by civil suits not self\\-defense.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It appears that [*Plummer v. State*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plummer_v._State) is still valid, but only in a very limited fact pattern. It is often quoted on the internet to justify the idea that a person may resist any unlawful arrest with force. That may have been true when *Plummer* was decided, and it was the clear holding of [*Bad Elk v. United States*, 177 U.S. 529 (1900\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Elk_v._United_States) \n\nBut *Bad Elk* is bad law today \\-\\- the wide adoption of the Model Penal Code starting in 1962 removed the right to resist a merely unlawful arrest. The right to use self\\-defense against excessive force by an officer remains, but is narrowly limited, and courts rarely find such resistance justified.\n\nIn [*State v. Mulvihill* 57 N.J. 151 (1970\\)](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/1970/57-n-j-151-0.html) The Supreme Court of New Jersey held: \n\n> If, in effectuating the arrest or the temporary detention, the officer employs excessive and unnecessary force, the citizen may respond or counter with the use of reasonable force to protect himself, and if in so doing the officer is injured no criminal offense has been committed.\n\nHowever, the *Mulvihill* court cautioned:\n\n> State v. Koonce, 89 N.J. Super. 169 (App. Div. 1965\\) held that \"a private citizen may not use force to resist arrest by one he knows or has good reason to believe is an authorized police officer engaged in the performance of his duties, whether or not the arrest is illegal under the circumstances obtaining.\" (89 N.J. Super. at 184\\.) The opinion put to rest the notion that the common law rule existing in some jurisdictions, which permits a citizen to resist, even with reasonable force, an unlawful arrest by a police officer, was applicable in New Jersey. ... Accordingly, in our State when an officer makes an arrest, legal or illegal, it is the duty of the citizen to submit and, in the event the seizure is illegal, to seek recourse in the courts for the invasion of his right of freedom.\n\nThe *Mulvihill* court explained the difference in the two csase by saying:\n\n> Despite his duty to submit quietly without physical resistance to an arrest made by an officer acting in the course of his duty, even though the arrest is illegal, his right to freedom from unreasonable seizure and confinement can be protected, restored and vindicated through legal processes. However, the rule permitting reasonable resistance to excessive force of the officer, whether the arrest is lawful or unlawful, is designed to protect a person's bodily integrity and health and so permits resort to self\\-defense. Simply stated, the law recognizes that liberty can be restored through legal processes but life or limb cannot be repaired in a courtroom. And so it holds that the reason for outlawing resistance to an unlawful arrest and requiring disputes over its legality to be resolved in the courts has no controlling application on the right to resist an officer's excessive force. *People v. Curtis*, 70 Cal. 2d 347, 74 Cal. Rptr. at 719\\.\n\nThe *Mulvihill* court further warned that:\n\n> \\[A citizen] cannot use greater force in protecting himself against the officer's unlawful force than reasonably appears to be necessary. If he employs such greater force, then he becomes the aggressor and forfeits the right to claim self\\-defense ... Furthermore, if he knows that if he desists from his physically defensive measures and submits to arrest the officer's unlawfully excessive force would cease, the arrestee must desist or lose his privilege of self\\-defense.\n\nThe court said that the duty to desist and submit if that would stop the excessive force is analogous to the duty to retreat rather than use force in self defense when this is feasible.\n\nThe Nolo Press page [\"Resisting Arrest When Police Use Excessive Force\"](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/resisting-arrest-when-police-use-excessive-force.html) says:\n\n> It\u2019s rare that someone being placed under arrest has the right to forcefully resist. But in most states, if the arresting officer uses excessive force that could cause \u201cgreat bodily harm,\u201d the arrestee has the right to defend him or herself. That\u2019s because most states hold that an officer\u2019s use of excessive force amounts to assault or battery, which a victim has a right to defend against.\n\n...\n\n> An officer\u2019s use of force is \u201cexcessive\u201d if it is likely to result in unjustifiable great bodily harm (serious injury). Most states consider whether a \u201creasonable person\u201d under the circumstances would have believed that the officer\u2019s use of force was likely to cause great physical harm (including death). If the answer is \u201cyes\u201d\u2014if a reasonable person would have felt it necessary to resist in self\\-defense, and if that person used a reasonable degree of force when resisting, then the resistance is typically justified. But this is a very high standard to meet, such that courts hardly ever find that an arrestee\u2019s forceful resistance was defensible.\n\n[This article from policeone.com](https://www.policeone.com/legal/articles/372596006-Civilian-self-defense-vs-police-excessive-force-Its-not-that-simple/) citing California law, says that forceful resistance to an arrest is almost never justified. It does agree that resistance to excessive force can be used;\n\n> Section 693 requires that even if the officer were committing a public offense (crime), only that \"self\\-defense\" force that is sufficient to prevent the offense may be used. In other words, the subject may only use force to simply stop the assault/battery under color of authority and never any more than that.\n\nand says that:\n\n> It is a rare circumstance when this assault/battery under color of authority actually occurs and an officer is charged, not because of some great law enforcement driven conspiracy but because it rarely happens.\n\nIn short, *Plummer* is still valid, but limited to the fact pattern when the person being arrested is actually being subjected to excessive force likely to cause great bodily harm, or death, and only justifies sufficient force to prevent such harm. The lawfulness of the arrest does not matter, it the the danger caused by the excess force that justifies possible resistance. As a practical matter, if resistance is likely to escalate rather than prevent harm, it is highly unwise. \n\nWhen *Plummer* is cited, often with *Bad Elk*, to justify resistance to an **unlawful** arrest **because** of its unlawfulness, that is no longer valid law and has not been for decades.\n\nNote that is a person who is not a law enforcement officer (LEO) but who is pretending to be one, tries to make an \"arrest\" this would not be an arrest at all, but an assault or an attempted abduction, and the victim would be justified in using reasonable force in self\\-defense, although not excessive force. This is not the *Plummer* rule, but the normal law of self\\-defense. However any arrestee should be careful. Claiming that the arresters are impersonators when they are in fact plainclothes LEOs will not go well. If a reasonable person should have known that they were LEOs, there is no right to resist unless excessive force is used.\n\nNote further that if non\\-LEOs attempt to make a \"citizen's arrest\", not impersonating officers, the right to self\\-defence only applies if excessive force is used, or there is a reasonable fear of excessive force likely to cause great bodily harm or death. Basically the *Plummer* rule still applies.\n\nAlso, all of this is a matter of state law, and while *Plummer* should be good law in most if not all states, the exact rule may vary by state. In 2012 a few US states retained the common\\-law rule that any unlawful arrest justified resistance, according to the Nolo page linked above. That may have changed, or may change when a case arises.

Modern law generally does not allow resistance to merely unlawful arrests (eliminating option A). The right to self-defense is not limited only to cases of impersonation or mistaken identity (ruling out option B). Option D is incorrect because the right to self-defense against excessive force still exists, albeit in very limited circumstances. The correct answer, C, reflects the current legal stance that a person may use reasonable force to protect themselves against a police officer's use of excessive force that could cause great bodily harm, even if the arrest itself is lawful.

Can the Supreme Court be wrong, or are their rulings infallible, a bit like the Pope making Ex Cathedra statements?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Supreme Court is infallible only in that their rulings are unchallengable, at least through any judicial process. Dissents often explain how the dissenter thinks a decision is not only wrong, but horribly misguided. Law review articles and other publications often criticize Court decisions, and sometimes influence later results.\n\nIt is far from unheard of for a dissent to later be followed in an opinion overruling the previous decision. [John Marshal Harlan I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan) was known as the \"Great Dissenter\", but many of his dissents were later adopted as governing law, including his famous dissent in [*Plessy v. Ferguson*, 163 U.S. 537 (1896\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson), the case that created the \"separate but equal\" doctrine overturned more than 50 years later in [*Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka*, 347 U.S. 483 (1954\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education).\n\n(The Justice is known as \"John Marshal Harlan I\" because his grandson, also named \"John Marshal Harlan\", was a Justice during the mid 20th century. The grandson is known as \"John Marshal Harlan II' or just as \"Harlan II\". Harlan II was significantly more conservative than his grandfather.)\n\nSupreme court decisions may be overruled because there has been a change in the constitution. An example is [*Barron v. Baltimore*, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243 (1833\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron_v._Baltimore) which was undone by the ratification of the 14th amendment. This reason is rare, but particularly important.\n\nDecisions interpreting statutes can be altered or reversed if Congress or a state legislature changes the statute. Indeed sometimes a Court decision explicitly invites a legislative change. Not infrequently, however, such invitations are ignored by Congress.\n\nSupreme court decisions may be overturned when a later majority decides that the previous decision was simply wrong. A special case was [*Dred Scott v. Sandford*, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford). That decision held that blacks could never be citizens of the US, and was effectively overruled by the outcome of the US Civil War, and formally by the 13th and 14th amendments to the Constitution.\n\nA more usual example is the case of [*West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette*, 319 U.S. 624 (1943\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_State_Board_of_Education_v._Barnette) the case that held that a state could not make the flag salute and Pledge of Allegiance mandatory for school children. This overruled [*Minersville School District v. Gobitis*, 310 U.S. 586 (1940\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minersville_School_District_v._Gobitis), decided only three years before. In this case the opinion included what was in effect a point\\-by\\-point refutation of the *Gobitis* opinion, although it was not described as such. This angered Justice Frankfurter (author of the *Gobitis* opinion), who issued a dissenting opinion from the *Barnette* decision. Many prominent lawyers and legal scholars had challenged the *Gobitis* decision, and *Gobitis* had led to increased persecution of members of the **Jehovah's Witnesses**, the group whose members refused to say the pledge, considering that it was a form of idolatry. These facts influenced the rapid reversal of the *Gobitis* decision.\n\nOften an earlier decision is not directly overruled, but is ***distinguished***. That is, the earlier opinion is said to still hold for its particular facts, but a new and different ruling applies to the different circumstances of a later case. When a number of yet later decisions follow the later case, the original can become effectively overruled, as there are no longer any circumstances in which it will be applied.\n\nCourt opinions will often go into considerable detail on the legal reasoning which supports a decision that overrules a previous case. They do not commonly discuss the philosophy of the reasons for change.\n\nSome legal scholars and some Justices have used the [Living Constitution theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Constitution) to support change on the ground that what was constitutional many years or decades ago is no longer permissible as the constitution \"evolves and adapts to new circumstances even if the document is not formally amended\". Others, particularly \"textualists\" and \"originalists\" strongly disapprove of this theory.\n\nThis theory was expressed by Justice Holmes in the case of [*Missouri v. Holland* 252 U.S. 416 (1920\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_v._Holland) with the words:\n\n> With regard to that we may add that when we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. The case before us must be considered in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago. The treaty in question does not contravene any prohibitory words to be found in the Constitution. The only question is whether it is forbidden by some invisible radiation from the general terms of the Tenth Amendment. We must consider what this country has become in deciding what that amendment has reserved.\n\nIn the Death Penalty cases the citation of \"evolving standards of decency\" from [*Trop v. Dulles*, 356 U.S. 86 (1958\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trop_v._Dulles) in [*Furman v. Georgia*, 408 U.S. 238 (1972\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_v._Georgia) was a version of Living Constitution theory. But it was not followed in later cases on he subject.\n\nUS Supreme Court rulings are not strictly binding on future Supreme Court majorities if they truly believe the previous decision was wrong for whatever reason. This has happened many times. Some Justices believe fairly strongly in *stare decisis*, the principle that settled rules of law should not be changed, but even so they will vote to overturn a precedent when it seems clearly and seriously wrong. Prior cases are overturned with significant frequency.\n\nJustices routinely do their own research, and decide cases on grounds not urged by the lawyers who argue the case. Moreover, for significant cases, there are almost always *amicus curiae* (friend of the court) briefs from major organizations. These are very likely to point out precedents or lines of reasoning that the parties have missed. The chance of a modern SC case being wrongly decided because of poor advocacy (as a comment suggests) seems slight to me. Poor judging, yes, that does happen. The *Barnette* decision. was an example. There have also been changes of judicial philosophy. The death of \"substantive due process\" and \"freedom of contract\" in the 1930s is an example of that.\n\nBut when consequences or legal theories are raised that were not previously considered, that can also be a reason to reverse a prior Supreme Court decision.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the philosophical and practical implications of the Supreme Court overturning its own previous rulings?\n\nA) The Supreme Court is infallible, and any overturning of previous decisions is merely a clarification of the original intent.\n\nB) Supreme Court decisions are final and can only be changed through constitutional amendments or new legislation.\n\nC) The Supreme Court can acknowledge past errors and overturn previous rulings based on new interpretations, societal changes, or recognition of flawed reasoning.\n\nD) The Living Constitution theory is the only accepted justification for the Supreme Court to overturn its previous decisions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C.

That is why I have started a bounty here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Wikipedia, at least the English\\-language edition of Wikipedia, takes the position that what applies to it is US copyright law. Under that law, anything published in 1924 is now in the public domain, and anything published first in the US, or simultaneously in the US and another country with no copyright notice prior to 1978 (the effective date of the 1976 Copyright Act) was **never** protected by copyright, but was in the public domain from the date of publication.

Congress can remove (\"abrogate\") this immunity by law in some circumstances. They tried to do so for copyright infringement cases with the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act of 1990\\. However, in the present case of *Allen v. Cooper*, the Supreme Court held that this part of the CRCA is unconstitutional. \n\nThe idea is that under the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress can abrogate state immunity when it's necessary to ensure people's right to due process, but only in a \"congruent and proportional\" way. Now if a state unintentionally or negligently infringes someone's copyright, that does not violate the person's right to due process, but an intentional infringement might. At the time the CRCA was passed, when Congress went looking for instances where states infringed on copyrights, they found several cases of unintentional or negligent infringement, and just a couple where they may have infringed intentionally. SCOTUS argued that to respond to this by *completely* abrogating state immunity in *all* copyright cases was disproportionate, and therefore unconstitutional.\n\nBut the Court suggests in the opinion that Congress could pass a different law to abrogate immunity in copyright cases, if it were narrower. For instance, a law that only stripped immunity in cases of intentional infringement would likely be constitutional, especially if there were evidence that intentional infringement was happening enough to be a significant problem.\n\nSo I think the answer is that as of right now, a state could deliberately infringe someone's copyright (e.g. by pirating software) and be immune from suit. However, Congress has the power to \"fix\" this, and most likely will, especially if there seems to be egregious abuse.\n\n(By the way, the decision contains an impressive quantity of pirate jokes. I guess since it's not only about copyright infringement (aka \"piracy\"), but actually alleges infringement of a video about a sunken pirate ship, the justices just couldn't resist.)\n\n---\n\nYour \"eminent domain\" idea is separate from this. Seizing copies of the software wouldn't give the state the right to use them, as the software itself would still be copyrighted. The state would have to seize the copyright, and I don't know whether that is possible \\- it's not necessarily property in that sense. But if they did so, then they wouldn't be infringing the copyright at all (since the state itself would now own the copyright) and this case would be irrelevant. \n\nOn the other hand, when a state uses eminent domain to seize property, they must as you say pay fair market value for it, and that means the market value *before* they seized it. So the value of the copyright in such a case wouldn't be \"nothing\" \\- it would be more like the amount a competitor would have had to pay the software maker to buy all the rights to that product. Likewise, if the state seizes your lovely house and bulldozes it to build a toxic waste dump, they owe you what someone would have paid for the house, not the value of a dump that nobody wants.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Supreme Court decision in Allen v.

So my questions are\n\n1. Am I right in thinking that a developer has a fiduciary duty to the user?\n2. If so, what does this mean for a lot of software development organisations with business models that depend on software that does not entirely respect the interests of its users. For instance, would the developer of an ad\\-blocker who takes money from advertisers for allowing their adverts to bypass his block be considered in breach of this duty?\n\nThe rest of this post will explain my reasoning that this fiduciary relationship exists. Suppose that Alice writes some software and sells it to Bob to use. I happen to live in the UK, but from what I have read the same legal framework exists in many countries.\n\nThe Wex legal dicationary [says](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty):\n\n> Fiduciary duty is imposed whenever confidence is reposed on one side\n>  in a contractual relationship, so as to allow that side to exert\n>  influence and dominance over the other.\n\nBob is clearly reposing confidence in Alice here. Alice could have included hidden functionality in the program which would work to Bob's detriment. Bob has no practical way of finding out if Alice has done so. In effect Alice has been given control of a part of Bob's computer. In addition to the physical resources, Alice also has indirect access to information stored on the computer that Bob may wish to keep confidential. Alice has \"influence and dominance\" over those parts of the computer that her program can access.\n\nThe Free Dictionary [says](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fiduciary+duty):\n\n> Courts have neither defined the particular circumstances of fiduciary\n>  relationships nor set any limitations on circumstances from which such\n>  an alliance may arise. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> A fiduciary relationship extends to every possible case in which one\n>  side places confidence in the other and such confidence is accepted;\n>  this causes dependence by the one individual and influence by the\n>  other.\n\nI've seen lists of fiduciary relationships, but it is plain that all of these are illustrative rather than complete. It may be that a court has never found that a software developer has a fiduciary duty (Google hasn't turned up any), but there doesn't seem to be an obstacle to such a finding.\n\nLooking at the second paragraph, it is clear that Bob has placed confidence in Alice. It is not necessarily clear that Alice has accepted such a relationship with Bob in particular, but it seems to me that\n\n1. By offering her program for sale, Alice has accepted a duty to her customers, and\n2. That this duty is a fiduciary one by the nature of the trust placed in her by her customers.\n\nWhen Alice wrote the program she was unaware that Bob in particular was going to run it, so it would not be possible for Alice to know exactly what the interests of Bob are under all circumstances. However she will still have a clear understanding of the general interests of her users as a class, and she has a duty to act in those interests rather than her own.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You could certainly run the argument: it is unlikely to succeed.\n\nFiduciary duties are either specifically legislated (e.g. company directors) or involve a relationship of *confidence* (the obligation to keep secrets) as well as trust (e.g. lawyer, doctor). \n\nEngineers (including software engineers) do not have this and AFAIK a fiduciary duty between an engineer and their client has never been found, even where the work is a one\\-on\\-one commission.

Engineers, including software engineers, generally do not have this type of relationship with their clients or users. The answer emphasizes that the relationship between a software developer and users \"lacks the intimacy required to create\" a fiduciary duty, especially for mass-market commercial products.

In Australia this law is national, from my limited understanding incorporation of companies in the US is a state matter. This legislation will dictate what companies can and can't do.\n\nTypically, such laws require a company to have a constitution which is essentially a contract between all the shareholders with each other and with the company. The law will say what must, may and must not be addressed in the constitution. It is here that such things as issuing new shares and options and transferring existing shares will be addressed.\n\nYou say \"It has not issued any shares or stock options yet.\" This cannot be true; in order for there to *be* a company there *must be* at least one shareholder.\n\nSpecifics\n---------\n\nIssuing stock options or shares *may* be a power granted by the constitution to the CEO but is *usually* reserved to the board or *more rarely* to the members (shareholders). So Alison must determine if she, in fact, has the power to bind the company to such an agreement with Carol or if she needs board (or membership) authorisation.\n\nAs an aside, if Alison *does not* have the power and signs the agreement anyway, then Carol would probably have the legal right to force the Company to honour it; this is because third\\-parties are entitled to the presumption that an officer of the company does have the power.

Note that the regulation in UE (mainly GDPR) is quite different than that found in USA, itself different than that on many other countries on the American continent.\n\nThat said, when talking about privacy, we generally refer to Personally Identifying Information (PII). As such, your conversion of an IP address like 151\\.101\\.1\\.69 to a country, and storing only that, would generally anonymize the personal information (the IP address), what the GDPR calls pseudonymisation.\n\nDo note that this depends on the rest of information you store and the size of the population in which that user gets mixed.

The key factor here is that Mary's consent is required to waive her rights to the benefits. If Mary hasn't signed a waiver on the beneficiary designation form, she can claim her community property interest, which is typically half of the proceeds.

For example, if a covert agent were murdered due to a wrongful disclosure of information, usually official disclosure of the fact of being a covert agent would be required to prove the case, and that evidence would be barred by the state secrets privilege, effectively barring the lawsuit entirely.\n\nConstitutional claims of privacy violations under the 4th Amendment generally relate to the wrongful acquisition of information and not its wrongful disclosure.

It doesn\u2019t matter where this ends up.\n\n> Is distributing a resume in the context of professional networking considered as implicit consent to allow sharing with anyone under the US legal system?\n\nNo. It\u2019s explicit consent because those networking sites have Terms and Conditions that explicitly deal with copyright.

As an example, New York continues to consider an individual to be domiciled in NY until and unless that individual establishes a permanent domicile elsewhere.\n\nAnd (with few exceptions) if New York considers you to be domiciled in NY, you are considered a resident and must pay state tax on your worldwide income. This is distinct from individuals who have to pay state tax on NY source income.\n\nBottom line: if New York considers you a resident, you must pay state taxes on worldwide income, even if you did not set foot in NY or in any way have a connection to NY during the tax year.\n\nExample: John Q. Smith lives in NY and pays taxes for five years. For all of 2015 he is outside of NY and couch surfs around the US without establishing a permanent domicile. He does not return to NY after 2015\\. New York considers him to still be domiciled in NY for 2015 and therefore he must pay NY state tax on all of his worldwide income for 2015\\.\n\nSmith objects and faces off with New York in court. The first question would be what court(s) would have jurisdiction. New York would love it to be heard in state court and just cite their state tax law as their authority to tax Smith. And Smith wants it to be heard in federal court, but can't sue the state due to the Eleventh Amendment. So is that it, end of ballgame for Smith? The case is heard in NY, New York state law is the authority cited, Smith gets a state judgement against him and he has no way to appeal it outside of the state's jurisdiction?\n\nAnd the second question, assuming somehow the case gets to federal court or another state's court: Smith argues he had no connection to New York during 2015 and shouldn't have to pay New York state taxes. New York state counters his argument with: \"We have the authority to tax John Q. Smith under the legal theory \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\".

If it is successful, it doesn't matter what the state law says. Even if the state court just says, \"Suck it; you're in New York so you pay according to New York law,\" he of course still has the opportunity to appeal that judgment to the U.S. Supreme Court once he's exhausted his appeals in state court.\n\nOn the second question, the basic idea is that you can't be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of one of those states (or D.C., Puerto Rico, etc.). We determine which state you're a citizen of based on domicile, so until a New York citizen sets up somewhere other than New York, he's stuck with New York citizenship. This concept is fundamental to a lot of different areas of law, and New York's approach is not at all unique.\n\nI don't have a case to cite to at the moment, but this has definitely been tested in court.

To more clearly define the issue I have been collecting data from calibrated decibel loggers placed outside and inside homes along different neighborhood streets. I also launched a survey (peer\\-reviewed to ensure that it is unbiased) on SurveyMonkey. This was launched two weeks ago and to\\-date it has received 500 responses. An invitation to local Home Owners Associations to have members take the brief survey will go out next week.\n\nOur community of 15 square miles is allocated one officer from the County Sheriff's Department. Noise complaints made to the Sheriff's Office are pretty much ignored. \n\n**Noise Levels from Custom Exhaust Systems**\n\nIf the same noise events due to custom exhaust systems on some streets occurred at a work place, this would literally raise red flags with OSHA. For example, on a regular basis, noise levels registering 120 dB or higher are measured at distances of 140 feet or more for periods of 15 minutes or more. \n\n**Retaliatory Behavior**\n\nWarnings issued by apartment managers to drivers of loud vehicles often trigger retaliatory drive byes against the apartment complex. These typically start within one hour of the warning. Over the next five the seven days, the count of noise measurements higher than three sigma decibels higher than the average background noise for the street, more than doubles. (Typically 99\\.7% of all noise measurements for a given street will fall below the average plus three sigma decibels. The measure being used is the count of noise readings higher than 99\\.7% of typical noise measurements for a given street.)\n\n**Survey Results (thus far)**\n\nAfter approximately two weeks there have been 500 responses to the survey. Barking dogs are the number 1 source of noise with vehicles with custom exhaust systems and stereos as number 2\\. (Dogs were number 1 in surveys performed by the US EPA in the 70s and 80s). The top noise sources as of today are:\n\n1 Animals (barking dogs, cockerel)\n\n2 **Vehicular noise (custom exhausts, stereos)**\n\n3 Highway noise\n\n4 Aircraft\n\n5 DIY (power tools, hammering)\n\n6 Household activities (stereos, parties)\n\n7 Commercial/Utility/Emergency Vehicles\n\n8 Trains\n\nVehicular exhaust and custom stereo noise was lower in similar polls conducted by US EPA in the 70s and 80s (prior to the de\\-funding of ONAC).\n\n**Impact on Property Values and Ability to Sell Real\\-estate**\n\nAs one realtor put it, noise is a raw real\\-estate nerve. Data from sources such as Zillow\\-Research show that a single family home in a noisy neighborhood will take 3 to 4 months longer to sell than an equivalent home in a quiet neighborhood. Homes in noisy neighborhoods will typically sell for 10% to 15% less than homes in quiet neighborhoods. The same results have been reported by studies conducted by Booz\\-Allen\\-Hamiltor in the United States (1994 \\- homes near airports) and the Swedish Government. Recorded noise levels in some neighborhoods match noise levels reported near large airports. \n\n**Absence of Legal Recourse**\n\nOur County Law Director insists that probable cause can only be established by a law enforcement officer. I proposed that citizens should be able to submit actionable complaints using three forms: (1\\) A screening form that is scored to determine if the complaint is legitimate or not (2\\) The same form filled out by law enforcement officers and (3\\) a notarized form that acknowledges the consequences of filing a false report. This was rejected due to concerns on workload.\n\nNeighborhoods that have genuine noise concerns essentially have no effective legal recourse. Fines imposed by a General Sessions court will only encourage retaliation.\n\n**Retaliation by Law Enforcement**\n\nOn more than one occasion, reports made to local law enforcement and local government have been met with retaliatory drive\\-byes by officers on motorcycles. This typically occurs between 1:30 AM and 2:30 AM following a complaint. The pattern (and this in on video) is an officer pulls close to the home and revs his bike as loud as he can under the nearest window of the person who filed the complaint. The officer then makes a very loud and high speed pass through the neighborhood, returns the spot under the window and revs his bike as loud as he can. This is typically repeated three or more times. Complaints and videos sent to our county law director generate no response what\\-so\\-ever.\n\nWho does one talk to when a law enforcement officer is the problem? Who does one talk to when local government does not respond to complaints about a law enforcement officer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You need is a legal basis for a (legal) complaint. OSHA regulations are set by the federal government, which gets its regulatory power via an interaction between politics, Congress, and the Commerce Clause: OSHA regulations don't apply to your neighborhood. There are often local noise ordinances that restrict noise. I can look up the numbers for my county, which are in a 4x4 table (source vs. destination, 4 zoning classes), and the ordinance describes the required sampling details in engineering\\-grade detail. (Best to read the whole ordinance to be sure there aren't specific exceptions, such as the bell exception \\-\\- bells are apparently unregulated). The ordinance will probably say something about enforcement, e.g.\n\n> The sheriff may administer and enforce this chapter and any rules and\n>  regulations adopted or authorized by this chapter in accordance with\n>  state law. The director may enforce this chapter and any rules and\n>  regulations adopted or authorized by this chapter in accordance with\n>  K.C.C. Title 23 and state law. Upon request by the sheriff or\n>  director, any other county departments and divisions may assist in\n>  enforcing this chapter.\n\nI note that this says \"may\", not \"shall\". Assuming that you have such ordinances, that the noise unquestionably violates the ordinances, and the enforcer refuses to enforce, then you would need to either (a) vote the sheriff out of office or (b) file a suit to compel enforcement of the ordinance. You could sue seeking a writ of mandamus. At this point you would be hiring an attorney, where questions would arise such as whether you have the legal right to compel action, is the sheriff obligated to enforce the ordinance, and so on (can you show that? I don't mean, is there a good reason, I mean in a technical legal sense). The answers reside in your state's case law and ordinances.\n\nIt is possible that your state Attorney General would pursue the sheriff, since what you describe seems like a blatant violation of the law (retaliations especially).

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the member's legal position?\n\nA) The member can immediately claim minimum damages for the HOA's willful failure to comply with the records request.\nB) The member has no recourse because email does not constitute a valid written request under Florida law.\nC) The member has a strong case for willful non-compliance by the HOA, as the 10-day deadline was missed following a written request.\nD) The member should resend the request via certified mail, return receipt requested, to create a rebuttable presumption of willful non-compliance if not fulfilled within 10 business days.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While an email technically constitutes a written request, Florida law provides stronger protections for requests made by certified mail, return receipt requested. If such a request is not fulfilled within 10 business days, it creates a rebuttable presumption of willful non-compliance, which can lead to damages. The original email request, even with confirmation of receipt, does not carry the same legal weight.

Trespassing laws are state\\-specific, for example in Washington the law is [RCW 9A.52\\.080](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.52.080), and if you violate the law, it is a misdemeanor.

There are other indications, such as being behind a fence \u2013 also, being told that you are trespassing. If you reasonably believe that you have been told by the owner or person authorized by the owner, then the reasonable belief defense is not available. So the question is whether you have a reason to think that the person telling you this has authority.\n\nYou may be able to determine who owns the property by checking the assessor's office for the address, which may reveal a name and mailing address of the owner. You might inquire at the office, if there is an office. If the person in the office tells you not to trespass, they you would reasonably conclude that you have officially been put on notice.\n\nThere are at least 49 other versions of this scenario.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Washington state, which of the following scenarios would most likely provide a valid defense against a trespassing charge if you were accused of trespassing on a sidewalk adjacent to an apartment complex?\n\nA) You were verbally told by someone who appeared to be a resident that the sidewalk was private property, but there were no visible signs indicating it was not public.\n\nB) There was a \"No Trespassing\" sign posted, but you believed it only applied to the apartment buildings and not the sidewalk.\n\nC) You had walked on the sidewalk many times before without issue, and there were no physical barriers like fences separating it from the public street.\n\nD) You were informed by the apartment complex's office staff that the sidewalk was private property, but you continued to use it because it looked like a public sidewalk.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Washington state law RCW 9A.52.090, a valid defense against trespassing includes when \"The actor reasonably believed that the owner of the premises, or other person empowered to license access thereto, would have licensed him or her to enter or remain.\" In this case, option C provides the strongest argument for a reasonable belief that the sidewalk was public and accessible. The lack of physical barriers, absence of signs, and history of unrestricted use all contribute to a reasonable belief that one is permitted to use the sidewalk. \n\nOption A introduces doubt with the verbal warning, even if from an unverified source. Option B involves ignoring a clear \"No Trespassing\" sign, which would be difficult to defend.

In particular, has any court ruled on the question?**\n\nI have not found any other part of the executive order that could be read as barring green card holders from entering the US, but I may have overlooked something. **Is there another part of the order that is relevant to the entry of permanent residents?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [The order](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html) refers in sec. 3(c) to \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12\\) of the INA, [8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1187)\". That section specifically names Iraq and Syria, plus \"points to\" potential areas of concern, as identified by the Sec'y of State and Sec'y of Homeland Security. The full list extends to Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, and is set forth at [81 FR 39680](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-17/pdf/2016-14422.pdf). \n\nThe cited authority is [8 USC 1182(f)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182), a section about inadmissible aliens, which says\n\n> Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any\n>  class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the\n>  interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such\n>  period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or\n>  any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the\n>  entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\n\nThus he has authority to exclude permanent residents from re\\-entry (they are aliens, and re\\-entry is a subcase of entry), and has done so for 90 days. In the case of Syrian nationals, under sec 5(c) of the order, they are excluded until the order is changed. Sec. 5(c) of the order specifically declares\n\n> Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby\n>  proclaim that **the entry of nationals of Syria** as refugees is\n>  detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any\n>  such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient\n>  changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian\n>  refugees is consistent with the national interest.\n\nThe long\\-term ban on Syrians also specifies \"as refugees\", so \"such entry\" might not be interpreted to refer to entry of refugee or non\\-refugee Syrian nationals who are permanent residents. The 90\\-day ban in 3(c) (\"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens\") does not include any further restrictors, apart from the various government\\-official visas that are exempted, so there would be no basis in the order for excluding permanent residents. Whether this will be strictly enforced is a separate question, though in the period when the order was active (a day), it was applied to permanent residents. Sec. 3(g) allows exceptions \"on a case\\-by\\-case basis, and when in the national interest\". A recent (Saturday the 28th) [White House briefing](http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/legal-residents-with-green-cards-warned-not-to-leave-u-s/) says that green card holders \"will need a case by case waiver to return to the United States\".\n\nThe ban includes immigrants and non\\-immigrants, so it doesn't particularly matter how \"immigrant\" is defined \u2013 what matters is what an alien is. Still, \"immigrant\" is defined in [8 USC 1101 (15\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101) as any alien, except a bunch of categories such as diplomats, tourists, business visitors, people in transit, students, and fashion models and similar, working temporarily here. Any permanent resident has an immigrant visa (but at any rate is an alien, and is either an immigrant or a non\\-immigrant).\n\nReturning to the words of the order, neither 3(c) nor 5(3\\) limit the ban to issuance of visas, it refers to entry. Not all entry by foreign national requires a visa. The word \"visa\" is mentioned, so it is possible to construe that mention as contextually restricting the ban to visas, however 3(a) which is entitled \"Suspension of Issuance of Visas and **Other Immigration Benefits** to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern\" orders the review \"to adjudicate any visa, **admission,** or other benefit under the INA\" which indicates that there is no such limitation.\n\n[8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(C)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101) does say that a permanent resident is not \"regarded as *seeking* an admission into the United States\". Admission itself is defined in 8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(A), when applied to an alien, as \"the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer\".

The executive order does not explicitly exempt permanent residents from the entry restrictions. While permanent residents are not considered to be \"seeking admission\" under 8 USC 1101(a)(13)(C), the order's broad language referring to \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry\" could be interpreted to include them.

Mactavish wrote at the end\n\n> \\[60] **NSERC has not sought its costs of this application \\[embolding mine]**, and Dr. Luk\u00e1cs has not persuaded me that this case raises an important new principle regarding the Access to Information Act such that he should be entitled to his costs, notwithstanding the result. Consequently, no order will be made as to costs.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Caveat: This analysis discusses typically and obvious reasons that there might be an agreement as to costs. But, we have know way of knowing the actual reason in particular cases.\n\nIn *Vancouver (City) v. Ward*, 2010 SCC 27, there were three claims in the underlying lawsuit. One was an award of $5,000 for wrongful imprisonment that was undisputed. One was an award of $5,000 for a wrongful strip search which was appealed but ultimately was affirmed. One was an award of $100 for claims related to seizure of a car, which was reversed on appeal.\n\nThe appeal decided by the Canadian Supreme Court was an appeal from a direct appeal to an intermediate appellate court. So, no further legal record had to be prepared at that stage of the litigation (with potentially expensive transcription fees), so the only issue as to costs that was outstanding were the costs for the final appeal, which would have been modest out of pocket, although, of course, attorneys were involved. And, even the legal arguments had already been made once by both sides in intermediate appellate court briefing.\n\nEven if the trial court plaintiff had lost both parts of the appeal brought by the government, he would have been a prevailing party in the litigation as a whole based upon his wrongful imprisonment damage award.\n\nBut, when you have several claims, some of which go for one party and some of which go for another, there is room for debate over who really prevailed.\n\nUnder the circumstances, given the comparatively small amount of dollars at stake, the parties may have simply agreed on a costs resolution (which probably awarded the trial court plaintiff all or most of his costs) to avoid spending more on litigation over how costs are awarded (and equally important, to avoid spending precious words in an Canadian Supreme Court appellate brief arguing that small dollar side issue).\n\nI've entered into similar agreements in appeals of complicated cases in the U.S. for the same reasons.\n\nI don't know if Canadian practice is to file a stipulation of record regarding costs in the trial court, or to simply note in the trial court record or an appellate brief that there is an agreement that has been reached, with a signed copy sitting in each side's files.\n\nAnother possibility is that at the outset of the case, or after an initial mediation, there was an agreement reached about costs (perhaps with both sides waiving a claim to costs) as part of a global agreement regarding procedural matters like limiting the scope of the claims to be pursued, dismissing secondary parties from the suit, or stipulating to key facts and/or to the admissibility of key documents to streamline a trial.\n\nVancouver may well have been motivated in part by appearances. Also, at least in U.S. practice, court filing fees are waived for governmental entities, and neither the lawyers nor the police witnesses give rise to any meaningful marginal cost particular to this lawsuit since the government lawyers and police are both salaried employees of the government, even though the legal fees of the government lawyers are probably recoverable in the proper case. So, waiving a right to collect costs may have been a very minor economic concession to it.\n\nVancouver also has a great strategic interest in having the case resolved in a precedent making case that can guide its future policies and practices going forward in a situation like is likely to recur, so they have some interest in having the trial court Plaintiff go the distance all of the way to the Canadian Supreme Court to resolve the legal issue the case presented. So, there are all sorts of reasons that Vancouver, in a case involving a recurring type issue presented to a governmental entity might want to reach an agreement on costs and would not merely be focused on maximizing its outcome in the particular case.\n\nAlso, while we don't know for sure, it is doubtful that the trial court Plaintiff was personally paying out of pocket to litigate to the Canadian Supreme Court over a $5,100 damages award. Probably some NGO or lawyer with a strategic interest in establishing the precedent financed most of the costs in practice. So, neither side economically felt much of the costs in this case making it an easier issue to negotiate.\n\nBut, in *Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Luk\u00e1cs*, 2018 SCC 2, and *Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi* (Rev 3\\) \\[2015] UKSC 67, which don't involve governmental entities, concerns about public image or a paramount desire to make precedents to guide future transactions of one of the parties are not nearly so great.\n\nIn those cases, a cost\\-benefit analysis in the individual case about the amount of costs at issue v. the amount of money that could be spent fighting over costs is probably more likely to be the main factor, particularly if the cases are complex enough that the amount of work necessary to fully litigate the costs issue could be significant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the Canadian Supreme Court case Vancouver (City) v.

This conclusion is supported by several factors mentioned in the passage:\n\n1. The case involved multiple claims with mixed results, making it difficult to determine a clear prevailing party.\n2. The amount in dispute was relatively small ($5,100 in total damages).\n3. The costs for the final appeal would have been modest.\n4.

One concern would be assuring that the service didn't just become a way to get free music. Whether or not you could find an agency willing to create such a license is, well, not a legal question.\n\nApart from the problem of making the works available online, there is also the matter of copyright and your lesson plans. It is not clear what the content of such lesson plans is, but if you would be inserting substantial excerpts from the lyrics into your text, you need permission (a license) to do that. You can certainly talk about Taylor Swift's \"mean\" in your book and can quote brief passages (under the \"fair use\" doctrine), but you can't just copy the lyrics without permission.

The other countries of the E.U. (as of 1984\\) had rules similar to those of Britain's loser pays rule, although there was significant variation in detail from country to country that made this less of an omnibus statement than it might seem. See Werner Pfenningstorf, \"[The European Experience With Fee Shifting](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3749&context=lcp)\", 47(1\\) Law and Contemporary Problems 37 (1984\\).\n\nMost countries with civil law systems (i.e. those systems based upon the civil code tradition of Continental Europe rather than the common law tradition of England or something else entirely) outside of Europe in Africa and Asia are derived from the French Civil Code (most of West, Northwest and Central Africa, for example), or the German Civil Code (Korea and Japan, for example), and probably have followed in the footsteps on their parent legal traditions on this issue. This is also true of most formerly Communist Eastern European countries.\n\nMost countries in Spanish speaking Latin America, however, have legal systems derived from the Spanish legal tradition (and national constitutions modeled on that of the U.S.), so other countries besides the U.S. and Spain without automatic fee shifting to a prevailing party are probably located in Latin America. Some of these Latin American countries, however. probably adopted fee shifting rules of their own, and many of these countries declared independence from Spain before Spain adopted its civil code, so the extent to which those countries follow the Spanish model may not be as complete as in countries that gained independence later on.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, however, in most civil law countries, the fees that an attorney can charge are usually significantly more highly regulated than in the United States, so the possibility of extremely high litigation fees is lower. Furthermore, civil litigation, in general, involves lower attorney fees on average in civil law countries (and in Islamic law and Chinese style Communist countries) than in the United States, in litigated cases, because the process is less attorney resource intensive due to civil procedure differences.\n\nSo far as I know, fee shifting is also not used in Islamic law countries, where the basic assumption is that the parties are often pro se (i.e. without lawyers) and the institution of a professional legal class post\\-dates the establishment of the relevant legal rules.\n\nI do not know what the situation is in the People's Republic of China or similar legal systems.\n\n**The American Rule**\n\nIt also bears noting that there are many exceptions to the \"American rule\" in U.S. law.\n\nWhile the American rule does not shift attorney fees, fees for out of pocket litigation expenses such as filing fees, copying charges, and expert witness fees are shifted as a matter of course to the prevailing party.\n\nMost professionally drafted written agreements have fee shifting provisions.\n\nMany specific statutes (e.g. civil rights actions and many labor law and consumer rights enforcement cases) also have fee shifting provisions (sometimes one sided, sometimes two sides).\n\nFees can also be awarded in certain kinds of breach of fiduciary duty litigation contexts and in cases involving a dispute over a \"common fund\".\n\nIn divorce cases, litigation costs of both sides are often (really usually) allocated by the court in proportion to ability to pay, as \"winning\" and \"losing\" are ill defined.\n\nThe biggest areas where fees shifting would be unusual in the U.S. would be in common law tort lawsuits, such as negligence cases (e.g. automobile accidents and slip and fall cases), strict liability products liability cases, defamation cases, intentional harm cases, and fraud actions. The American rule also applies in cases of oral contracts or contracts drafted by inexpert non\\-lawyers. Even in those cases various kinds of litigation misconduct can result in fee shifting.\n\nIn U.S. tort cases, defendants usually have their attorney fees paid for by their insurance company, and plaintiffs often have an attorney paid on a contingent fee basis. Furthermore, awards by juries for non\\-economic damages and/or punitive damages often makes it possible for a prevailing plaintiff to receive full or nearly full economic loss compensation in such lawsuits, with the non\\-economic and/or punitive damages awards effectively providing resources to pay the attorney for the plaintiff on top of economic loss compensation for the plaintiff.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about fee-shifting in legal systems around the world is most accurate?\n\nA) All European Union countries follow the British \"loser pays\" rule without exception.\nB) The United States is the only country in the world that does not have automatic fee-shifting to the prevailing party.\nC) Most civil law countries have highly regulated attorney fees, which generally results in lower litigation costs compared to the United States.\nD) Islamic law countries typically employ fee-shifting as a standard practice in their legal proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) is incorrect because while many EU countries follow a \"loser pays\" rule similar to Britain's, there is significant variation in detail from country to country, and Spain (as of 1984) had rules similar to the American rule.\n\nB) is incorrect because the text mentions that Spain and potentially some Latin American countries also do not have automatic fee-shifting to the prevailing party.\n\nC) is correct.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of their window tint in New York?\n\nA) The driver cannot be ticketed because their car complies with their home state's laws.\nB) The driver can only be ticketed for the rear window tint, as the front windows comply with New York law.\nC) The driver can be ticketed for all windows, as New York requires 70% VLT on all windows.\nD) The driver is exempt from New York tinting laws due to interstate commerce regulations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, states have the authority to enforce their own window tinting laws on all vehicles driven within their borders, regardless of where the vehicle is registered. New York requires 70% VLT on all windows, including rear windows. Therefore, even though the California driver's car is legal in their home state, they can be ticketed for non-compliance with New York's stricter tinting laws on both front and rear windows. While officers may sometimes be lenient with out-of-state vehicles, they have the legal right to enforce local laws on all vehicles operating within their jurisdiction."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24382/open-source-idea-closely-related-to-product-at-work", "docs_id": 24382, "title": "Open source idea closely related to product at work", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For a while I have had an idea for an open source project.

While the employee has the right to pursue personal projects, there may be conflicts of interest or intellectual property concerns when the project is similar to work done for an employer. The best course of action is to review the employment contract for any clauses related to side projects or non-compete agreements, and to have an open discussion with the employer about the intended open-source project.

Last year, the US state of Georgia [tried to criminalize such travel for abortion](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/hb481-georgia-abortion-ban-criminal-brian-kemp-horrific.html).\n\n1. In which jurisdictions is this *currently illegal*? (Assume that the person is an adult and they are travelling of their own free will.)\n2. In which jurisdictions was it illegal at some point in the past? When were such laws repealed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is probably illegal in all of the jurisdictions in the US where a fetus is legally declared to be a person and where the murder statutes are written to not explicitly exclude abortion: that is, in **no** jurisdictions.\n\nNo law existing or proposed for Georgia specifically addresses \"travel for the purpose of getting an abortion\". The underlying theory behind the claim (advocated by some Georgia attorneys) is that a person may be open to a\nconspiracy charge for taking a woman to another state to get an abortion, which would be a crime if committed in Georgia. If a conspiracy exists in Georgia to do something illegal (in Georgia), that is a violation of OCGA [16\\-4\\-8](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2018/title-16/chapter-4/section-16-4-8/) (\"when he together with one or more persons conspires to commit any crime and any one or more of such persons does any overt act to effect the object of the conspiracy\"). The substantially same law exists in [Washington](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.28.040), and most if not all other states. The theory is apparently that \"conspire to commit a crime\" means something like \"conspire to perform an act which would be a crime if performed in in this jurisdiction\", e.g. \"purchase marijuana, or take a job at certain payday loan companies\". No state has successfully claimed [extraterritorial jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritorial_jurisdiction#United_States), where a Georgia resident can be prosecuted in Georgia for a legal act carried out in another state, so this theory is a bit of a stretch.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the current legal status of traveling across state lines for an abortion in the United States?\n\nA) It is explicitly illegal in Georgia and several other states that have recently passed strict abortion laws.\n\nB) It is currently legal in all U.S. states, but some states are actively pursuing legislation to criminalize it.\n\nC) It is theoretically prosecutable under conspiracy laws in some states, but no successful prosecutions have occurred due to issues of extraterritorial jurisdiction.\n\nD) It is explicitly protected by federal law, superseding any state attempts to restrict such travel.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While no state explicitly criminalizes traveling for an abortion, some legal theories suggest it could potentially be prosecuted under conspiracy laws in states where abortion is illegal. However, this approach faces significant legal challenges, particularly regarding extraterritorial jurisdiction. States cannot typically prosecute actions that are legal in the jurisdiction where they occur. Option A is incorrect because no state, including Georgia, has successfully implemented a law explicitly criminalizing such travel. Option B is partially true but overstates the current legislative landscape. Option D is incorrect as there is no explicit federal protection for such travel, although constitutional arguments could be made for such protection."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52432/in-a-public-university-can-the-head-of-department-forbid-a-specific-student-to", "docs_id": 52432, "title": "In a public university, can the head of department forbid a specific student to enter the department without stating a law or policy?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are two situations to consider:\n\nIn the first situation, the student has not done anything wrong. If it was a private establishment, as in [Can the manager of a commercial establishment forbid someone to enter?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52427/can-the-manager-of-a-commercial-establishment-forbid-someone-to-enter), a manager could forbid someone to enter at his own will. But I believe this case is different.\n\nIn the second situation, the student did something wrong that, in principle, could support the decision. But the student is not informed of this reason. He is simply banned from entering the building.\n\n(I am primarily interested in the case the university is in Canada, but I would be interested in how it works in different jurisdictions.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, the primary question is the nature of the premise that the person enters. If the premise is open to the public, restricting access is harder to justify. If the premise is restricted, access can be restricted pretty arbitrarily, apart from infringing on a person's property interest in the facility. A laboratory, for example, may restrict access to a specific list of people, or to a describable class of people. \"A department\" is a pretty big thing and generally does not describe a concrete location, but perhaps you mean \"may not enter the department office\" or \"may not enter any of the following offices\". Hallways in buildings are generally public places, unless there is a particular wing of the building where all access is restricted. \n\nIf there is good reason, a university official may prohibit a person, including a student, from entering a premise, and they can tell a specific person that they may not enter the department office. It is more a matter of university policy and not statutory law to determine who that person is that can issue a stay\\-out order, so it may not be the department chair \u2013 more likely, the dean or higher authority carries the real clout, on the chair's recommendation. Although in all one case that I am familiar with the person was told why, that is not a legal requirement (though the university would be forced to say why, if the person sues). A counter\\-consideration would be that the student has a legitimate interest in entering the premise, for example has to take an exam that takes place in a department building, has to do something in that office for job\\-related reasons.\n\nIt would be legally problematic to exclude a person from a public place if there is no reason (that is, the decision is completely arbitrary), because everyone enjoys equal legal protection of the right to access the public place (remember, it's a *public* place).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A university student in the US is told by a department chair that they are banned from entering the department building, without being given a reason. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The department chair's decision is legally binding and cannot be challenged, regardless of the student's need to access the building.\n\nB) The ban is only enforceable if the student is provided with a specific reason for the exclusion.\n\nC) The ban is likely unenforceable if the building contains public spaces like hallways, unless a higher authority like a dean issues the order.\n\nD) The student has an absolute right to enter all areas of the department building due to their status as a enrolled student.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided indicates that hallways in university buildings are generally considered public places, and arbitrarily restricting access to public spaces can be legally problematic. Additionally, the department chair may not have the authority to issue such a ban - this power typically resides with higher authorities like deans. The ban would be more enforceable if issued by a higher authority and if it doesn't prevent the student from accessing necessary public spaces or fulfilling academic requirements. Answer A is incorrect because the chair's decision isn't automatically binding and can be challenged. B is incorrect because while providing a reason is good practice, it's not a legal requirement for the ban to be enforceable. D is incorrect because students don't have an absolute right to enter all areas, especially restricted spaces within the department."}}
