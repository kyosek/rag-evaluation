Which of the following legal principles is most relevant in determining the employee's rights in this situation?\n\nA) Promissory estoppel\nB) Statute of frauds\nC) At-will employment doctrine\nD) Unjust enrichment\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The most relevant legal principle in this scenario is promissory estoppel. This concept applies when one party relies on a promise made by another party to their detriment. In this case, the employee relied on the company's promise of backdated pay, moving to Austria and working for three months without formal compensation.\n\nThe scenario involves multiple complex elements:\n1. International employment law (UK citizen working in Austria)\n2. Verbal and written agreements (email from HR)\n3. Conditional employment based on degree completion\n4. Reliance on a promise of future compensation\n\nPromissory estoppel is the most appropriate principle because:\n\n1. There was a clear promise made by the employer (backdated pay upon degree confirmation)\n2. The employee reasonably relied on this promise (by working without immediate pay)\n3.

It is more attractive in the U.S.\n\n### Long Answer\n\n**England and Wales v. U.S. Analysis Compared**\n\nThe big factor that distinguishes England and Wales (and most but not all other Commonwealth countries) from the U.S., is that England and Wales has a system of title registration, in which certificates of title (possibly virtual these days rather than on a dead tree, I don't know, New Zealand recently made that transition), while almost all U.S. land records are maintained in one of three thousand or so separate county race\\-notice recording statute systems (which differ in fine details from state to state). The U.S. system is more flexible but also more prone to cases of title defects. The title registration system virtually eliminates the need for title insurance in commercial real estate transactions (i.e. as opposed to donative transfers of real estate, not as opposed to residential real estate).\n\n**In England and Wales**\n\nIt is possible to achieve this goal and the approach suggested would rarely be the optimal solution.\n\nThe most straightforward way to do it would be to vest title not equally, but as an unequal tenancy in common with percentages stated on the face of the deed. But this might be a problem if the amount of contribution to the mortgage and capital improvements in the premises weren't known in advance when the parties took title.\n\nAnother solution which would achieve this end would be to vest title in an entity (including a possible general partnership or trust) which has provisions governing these matters. Entity ownership of some sort would also generally eliminate the partition rights of the co\\-owners, although a covenant to eliminate the right of partition could also be recorded in connection with the registered title without ending its 50\\-50 ownership character of record.\n\nIf the co\\-owners are married, title is a somewhat secondary matter and a premarital agreement (a.k.a. a [prenuptial agreement](https://www.netlawman.co.uk/dl/pre-nuptial-agreements)) could probably achieve this end, at least in cases involving divorce or inheritance, although the marital rights established by the prenuptial or postnuptial agreement might be inchoate rather than vested and currently in force as a present interest.\n\nWith unmarried co\\-owners you could have a co\\-tenancy agreement (also called a [tenants\\-in\\-common agreement](https://www.netlawman.co.uk/d/tenants-in-common-agreement) and closely related to a [joint ownership agreement](https://www.netlawman.co.uk/d/residential-property-joint-ownership-agreement)) (or a domestic partnership agreement (also called a [cohabitation agreement](https://www.netlawman.co.uk/d/cohabitation-agreement)) which typically has a broader scope), but if that agreement were contractual, rather than reflected in the land registration as a percentage tenancy in common or as a covenant (which would be problematic in this case where the deed and the covenant contradict each other), the remedies would probably be limited if not in the land registry. Vis\\-a\\-vis the world, for example, in eminent domain proceedings or a probate proceeding at the death of one of the two co\\-owners, the co\\-owners would be treated as 50\\-50 owners.\n\nA tenancy\\-in\\-common agreement included in the land registry would typically not dictate how the co\\-owners would manage the property, and instead would merely state their ownership rights. The other agreements would often contain management provisions for the co\\-owned property.\n\nThe contract would not create *in rem* rights in the property, unless it is recorded in the land registry (which a tenancy\\-in\\-common agreement often would be, effectively amending the 50\\-50 deed, but which the other forms of agreement generally would not be). But the parties would have a legal obligation to settle up between themselves following a liquidation event such as an eminent domain award or a sale of the property or a foreclosure, with *in personam* litigation between the co\\-owners, if necessary. In most circumstances, this would be equivalent, albeit a bit different procedurally. But, if a co\\-owner having an obligation under the contract to the other co\\-owner, were, for example, insolvent and there were other creditors of the insolvent co\\-owner with a higher priority for payment than the solvent co\\-owner of the property, the solvent co\\-owner of the property would lose out.\n\nAny such agreement would have to be in a signed writing and not oral, as it would concern an interest in property.\n\nI don't know how such a conflict between a 50\\-50 deed and a side contract would play out under the laws of England and Wales, for example, for purposes of taxes owed upon the sale of the property at a profit or a loss, or for purposes of determining someone's net worth for some financial accounting report in connection, for example, with a loan application in which the borrower is a limited liability entity and a co\\-owner is a guarantor of a loan.\n\n**In the U.S.**\n\nIn the U.S., any document signed and notarized by the owners of the property or the affected parties, that is recorded in the real estate records of the county where the real estate is located, that adequately describes the property in question with a legal description, is given legal effect as a vested property right superseding any previous recorded document. Even if it isn't notarized, the document could also be supported by an affidavit or acknowledgement separate from the primary recorded document itself.\n\nSo, if there was a 50\\-50 tenancy in common deed of record, and then the co\\-owners recorded a subsequent tenancy\\-in\\-common or domestic partnership or premarital agreement, the recorded agreement would as a matter of property rights, modify the original deed. And, in most jurisdictions which have a \"race\\-notice\" recording rule, even if the agreement were not recorded, it would be effective to create a property right and would not simply be a side contractual agreement that is *in personam* only, as to anyone who had actual notice of the existence and terms of the agreement. So, this kind of solution is more attractive in the U.S. than in England and Wales or most other commonwealth jurisdictions.\n\nOf course, an uneven tenancy\\-in\\-common deed, or an entity ownership would still be solutions that are available, and these options (possibly with a waiver of a right to partition) might be desirable in some circumstances.\n\nIn the U.S., some of the main downsides to entity ownership (all dependent upon both state and federal law) would be the loss of favorable capital gains tax rates, if the entity is a C corporation, the loss of the exclusion of gain on the sale of an owner occupied residence for capital gains tax purposes, the loss of a right to a homestead exemption from creditors, the loss of qualification for favorable mortgage program only available for owner occupied residences, the loss of favorable property tax treatment for owner occupied residences, and the loss of favorable treatment in determining eligibility for means tested government programs such as the Medicaid Long Term Care (i.e. nursing home) benefit.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation states that in England and Wales, the most straightforward way to achieve unequal ownership is through an \"unequal tenancy in common with percentages stated on the face of the deed.\"\n\n2. A tenancy-in-common agreement can be included in the land registry, effectively amending the original 50-50 deed.

This approach maintains flexibility for future changes, as the agreement can be updated and re-registered if their contributions change over time.\n\nOption A (a side contract) is less effective because it would not create in rem rights and might not be recognized in all legal situations.

The [manual](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Rules_Web.pdf) states that: \n\n> The filing fee must be paid before a matter is considered properly\n>  filed .

Could a dispute over a small amount be considered frivolous?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What does this mean in practice, it seems there are two options? Does\n>  it mean the consumer should pay the fee, and will somehow be\n>  reimbursed at some point?\n\nThe clause about the filing fee being submitted with the Demand is largely inconsequential.\n\nIf the filer pays out of pocket and prevails in the proceedings, he is entitled to reimbursement. Or it could also occur as you outline: The client could ask the business to pay upfront (although the latter may deny the request, leaving the client no option but to cover the filing fee if he wishes to initiate proceedings).\n\n> what is a frivolous claim or relief?\n\nThe term *frivolous claim* refers to accusations where the alleged \"misconduct\" does not merit the pursuit of proceedings (in this case, arbitration). An example of frivolous claim would be a client's complaint that the Uber driver's saying of the F\\-word hurt the client's feelings and caused him or her severe emotional distress.\n\nBy the same token, *frivolous relief* generally refers to the pursuit of compensation that is unreasonable or vastly disproportionate for the misconduct at issue. An example of frivolous relief would be a client's grievance that \"*the Uber driver was late and I missed my flight to Disneyland, so I want an indemnification of $400,000,000, and that the driver's license be revoked*\".\n\nAlthough common sense dictates that proceedings should be brought only for meritorious causes, some ignorant people and many lawyers boasting their so\\-called \"good standing\" are incredibly fond of making frivolous claims/allegations. Uber's clause is a gentle reminder to both sorts of individuals.\n\n> Could a dispute over a small amount be considered frivolous?\n\nIf the entire grievance is about a very small amount and nothing else, the dispute might be considered frivolous from the standpoint of the disproportionate waste of (quasi\\-)judicial resources needed to address it.\n\nThe context helps determining whether a small amount leads to the conclusion that a claim is frivolous. An Uber client's complaint that the change given to him was a nickel instead of a dime would be frivolous, whereas the nature of Uber's business makes it reasonable that grievances may stem from allegedly improper surcharges of \\-\\-say\\-\\- $20\\.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about consumer arbitration with AAA, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A consumer is initiating arbitration against Uber for a dispute involving $50,000 in damages.

Which of the following approaches is most likely to result in a successful initiation of the arbitration process?\n\nA) The consumer should pay the filing fee upfront and seek reimbursement from Uber later, as this is always required by AAA.\n\nB) The consumer should file the demand for arbitration without paying any fees, expecting AAA to bill Uber directly.\n\nC) The consumer should contact Uber before filing, requesting they pay the fee directly to AAA, and if refused, pay the fee themselves when filing.\n\nD) The consumer should file a lawsuit in small claims court instead, as the arbitration clause is likely unenforceable for this amount.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct approach (C) integrates the AAA rules with Uber's specific arbitration clause. \n\nWhile AAA generally requires the filing fee to be paid upfront, Uber's terms state they will pay all fees for claims under $75,000. However, the AAA manual allows for \"other such arrangements\" to be made for fee payment. Therefore, the most prudent approach is to contact Uber first, requesting they pay the fee directly to AAA. This respects both AAA's need for the fee to be paid and Uber's commitment to cover it.\n\nIf Uber refuses, the consumer should then pay the fee themselves when filing to ensure the arbitration is \"properly filed\" according to AAA rules. This approach minimizes the risk of delays or rejection of the filing while still preserving the consumer's right to seek reimbursement later.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores Uber's commitment to pay the fees upfront. Option B is risky as it might result in the demand not being \"properly filed\" according to AAA rules.

The applicable Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code has been adopted in every U.S. jurisdiction and is identical in this respect, although a few states would have consumer protection laws that impose special responsibilities in sales of used motor vehicles in particular that are not present under the Uniform Commercial Code that could apply in this case.\n\nThere might be common law liability for fraudulent concealment if the defect not disclosed is something that a seller in good conscience under accepted commercial practice in such sales would have been obligated to disclose (as determined by the judge and jury after the fact). The defect would also have to be a latent defect not visible upon casual inspection, to give rise to liability. Such a claim would also depend upon a determination of whether Bob actually relied on Alice's non\\-disclosure of the defect, and whether it was reasonable under the circumstances for him to do so in light of the fact that the car was already 20 years old. And, Bob would have to prove that Alice knew about the defect and its seriousness at the time of the sale, which would be hard to prove if she didn't affirmatively disclose this fact to him. These basic principles of liability are quite similar between U.S. states, although they aren't entirely uniform (in particular, some states would have a common law sale of used goods exclusion from fraudulent concealment liability).\n\nEven then, whether or not the fraud liability would extend to the reduced value of the car without the disclosure, or would also extend to the personal injuries and property damage caused by the non\\-disclosure, could be a close issue upon which the law in different U.S. states would not be uniform.\n\nIt isn't impossible that the fraud claim would prevail, but both in pretrial motion practice, and on the merits at trial, this would be an uphill battle for Bob that he would be much more likely to lose than to win, even if he managed to overcome the procedural hurdles prior to trial to get the case in front of a jury.\n\nFurthermore, most states would evaluate the case under a comparative fault regime, so some of the fault, and some of the damages, would be allocated to third\\-parties involved in the accident (if any) and to Bob's comparative fault in not being sufficiently careful by failing to have the car professionally inspected. In all likelihood, even if Bob won, he would not recover 100% of his damages.\n\nAlso, while Alice's insurance company would probably defend her in this lawsuit (on the theory that she was innocent of the claims), if Bob prevailed, Alice's insurance policies wouldn't pay anything that was owed on the claim. This is because the claim is based upon fraud, and since insurance is not allowed to cover successful claims that the insured made fraudulent statements as a matter of public policy under the law in every U.S. jurisdiction. So, Bob would be limited to collecting from Alice's income and assets that are not exempt from creditors.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A small used car dealership owner, Dave, is selling a 15-year-old sports car.

The correct answer is B, the parol evidence rule, which generally gives precedence to written agreements over verbal ones. This principle is implied in the top answer's statement: \"if you signed a lease that supports the owner's position over your understanding with the agent, the written document generally take precedence.\"\n\nOption A (estoppel) could be relevant if the tenant had acted in reliance on the manager's representations, but the question doesn't provide enough information to support this.\n\nOption C (apparent authority) is a plausible distractor, as it relates to the manager's role as an agent, but the documentation suggests that written agreements typically override verbal ones made by agents.\n\nOption D (statute of frauds) is another plausible distractor, as it deals with the validity of certain agreements not in writing, but it's less directly applicable to this specific situation where a written lease exists.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of legal concepts with the specific details of the scenario, going beyond mere memorization of legal terms. It also reflects the complexity and nuance of real-world legal situations, where multiple principles may seem applicable but one takes precedence."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35933/is-it-acceptable-to-send-flowers-to-a-judge-after-a-routine-administrative-proce", "docs_id": 35933, "title": "Is it acceptable to send flowers to a judge after a routine administrative proceeding?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently filed a petition in my county court.

Flowers are pretty much intended for presentation; according to two examples from the [Cornell Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/2635.203), even though some items might have a \"market value\" that could trigger restrictions, since they are primarily intended for presentation, they are acceptable, and\n2.

At the federal level, a law known as ESIGN provides that electronic signatures are valid, and preempts state laws unless the state has adopted UETA or has its own electronic signature law compatible with ESIGN. \n\nOne requirement of UETA is that both parties have to agree to use electronic signatures. It can't be forced on a party. If you send me a contract electronically and I electronically sign it, the question is whether I meant \"I agree to be bound\" or something else (like \"I read it, this looks fine, send over a paper copy to sign\"). By putting in the agreement \"I agree to use an e\\-signature,\" it's hard to argue that you didn't mean to accept the contract.

The correct answer is D because the client's level of technical expertise with computer systems is the least relevant factor in determining the validity of the electronic signature.\n\nThe key issues here are intent and consent, as highlighted in the documentation. The presence of the explicit consent clause (option B) is highly relevant, as it directly addresses the UETA requirement that both parties agree to use electronic signatures. Previous use of electronic signatures (A) and subsequent communications about the contract (C) are also relevant as they provide context about the client's intent and understanding.\n\nThe client's technical expertise (D) is less relevant because electronic signature laws focus on the intent to be bound rather than technical proficiency.

The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the nuanced legal position described in the documentation.\n\nAccording to the majority rule in U.S. law, a good faith belief in one's right to be present on a property can protect against criminal trespass charges. This is because criminal trespass typically requires intent, which may be negated by a genuine belief in one's right to be there.\n\nHowever, the answer also acknowledges that civil liability for trespass often operates under strict liability rules, meaning that even without intent, a person could still be held civilly liable for trespass. This distinction between criminal and civil liability is crucial and reflects the complexity of trespass law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the protection offered by good faith entry. While good faith may protect against criminal charges, it doesn't give carte blanche to ignore requests to leave.\n\nOption B is too absolute and doesn't account for the nuances of intent in criminal trespass law.\n\nOption D is incorrect because verbally contesting authority doesn't automatically shift the burden of proof or protect against trespass claims.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts, application to a real-world scenario, and understanding of the distinctions between criminal and civil liability, thus targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85126/is-anyone-who-develops-websites-or-webapps-for-clients-legally-responsible-for-w", "docs_id": 85126, "title": "Is anyone who develops websites or webapps for clients legally responsible for what they are creating and all the gdpr obligations?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose the case of a european (italian) web developer who, at the request of a client, creates a web platform for him from scratch (also with database, saving user\u2019s data, ecc.).

No US copyright infringement suit can be brought until the copyright has been registered. The registration process includes a formal declaration as to who the author is (or authors are). (I believe this statement is made under penalty of perjury.) Once the registration issues, the certificate of registration is admissible evidence of the facts stated in it in a us court. Indeed [17 USC 410 (c)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#410) provides that:\n\n> (c) In any judicial proceedings the certificate of a registration made before or within five years after first publication of the work shall constitute *prima facie* evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate. The evidentiary weight to be accorded the certificate of a registration made thereafter shall be within the discretion of the court.\n\nIn other countries, the testimony of the plaintiff in a copyright infringement suit is itself evidence that the work was created as stated.\n\nIn either case, it is possible for the defendant to challenge the assertion and claim that s/he is the actual author. Showing when and where the work was first published can usefully corroborate the plaintiff's testimony. Having included a copyright notice in the initial publication may be of value, but if the notice only lists the pen name, it is not of much value. Records of the platform on which a work has been published may help in verifying the identity of the author. So may the testimony of others who saw or read the work, or who were told about it by the author. An author's own copies may be of value, if they carry a timestamp, as computer files generally do. But computer timestamps are not usually secure. Timestamps on email generally are reasonably secure, and could establish that the content existed and had been transmitted on a specified date by a specified person.\n\nBut none of this will matter unless the defendant claims that the plaintiff is lying in claiming authorship.

The reputational damage is what would derive from it, and that is a crime in both country A and B, however, the company of country B has no presence in country A.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So one such breech of law in this situation would be a defamation suit (a civil rather than criminal matter) which, especially in Common Law nations, are usually heard in the court of the plaintiff's jurisdiction as the most severe damage to reputation would be local. However, as this is not a crime (usually, there are some rarely used defamation crime statutes in the U.S. at least) the actual defendant may not need to actually sit in court during the trial and making appearances through lawyers only is not an indicator of guilt.\n\nIn defimation specific cases, the U.S. will refuse to enforce any payment to a victorious plaintiff unless the defamation case could be upheld in U.S. law (the U.S. has some rather high burdens of proof in defimation that other nations (including Canada and England, which are very close in legal system's structures) and as such, a ruling of guilt in an English court might be innocence in the U.S. This would only go to enforcing orders on relief as it pertains to the U.S. and corporations in the U.S. (if the guilty defendant has all his money American Banks, then the U.S. won't compel the banks to hand over assests from his accounts... However, they can't do anything about English courts seizing that man's Scottish real estate to sell for the damages.\n\nWith respect to criminal matters, it largely depends on the nature of the extradition treaty between Nations A and B. Typically, where those treaties exist, Nation A will only extradite the accused for crimes that Nation A and B both agree are crimes and both agree that similar punishments will be given if convicted. Additionally, they typically agree to only try the accused for crimes Nation A is extraditing the accused for. The punishment angle can be overcome during the negotiating between nations (One common example is that the U.S. and Canada do have an extradition treaty, Canada will refuse to extradite someone for a capital offense because they abolished the death penalty. However, because Canada has an interest in not being a haven for U.S. murders, they will often compromise with the prosecutor in charge of the case and extradite with the promise that the prosecutor will not seek death penalty. Just to show it isn't just the U.S. on the losing side, there was an actual case where a U.S. citizen was arrested in Italy for murder, was tried and aquitted. Upon her release, she returned to the U.S. only for Italian officials to learn of another witness and begin petitioning for a second trial. The U.S. refused to extradite, citing the constitutional protection against double jeopardy i.e. a second trial on the same event).\n\nOther nations, like Germany and Russia, have laws that bar the country from extraditing citizens. These protections aren't granted to resident aliens or tourists, visa holders, or illegal immigrants, so any treaties with them may have the other nation stipulate the same restriction despite it not being a law in that nation.\n\nShould Nations A and B not have extradition treaty, Nation B can ask really really politely, but at the end of the day, Nation A isn't bound to honor the request... but they aren't bound to refuse it either. Some nations might honor the request to curry favor with Nation B... while others might refuse because of a host of matters. Often nations without extradition treaties aren't the friendliest to each other, so they could refuse out of spite... but will play their refusal on a moral ground.\n\nIf in the above situation, the accused leaves Nation A for Nation C, Nation B can request C to affect the extradition (They might invoke if they have an extradition treaty with C).

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. In the U.S., copyright owners can elect to recover statutory damages instead of actual damages and profits, even if the work was freely distributed (addressing the misconception in option A).\n2.

There is arguably some legal ambiguity whether federal laws are included in the \"other crimes\" portion of the relevant New York state law.\n\n1. Could DA Bragg have only charged Trump with 34 misdemeanor counts, without elevating the charges to felonies? I believe that had he done so, he would not have needed to empanel a grand jury, since misdemeanor\\-only charges do not require a grand jury vote to indict.

But would anything else stop him from doing so?\n2. Am I correct that if Trump's defense team argues that the law that elevates the misdemeanor charges to felony charges does not apply in this case, because the elevation option does not include federal laws, then since this is a matter of law and not a matter of fact, Judge Mercan (rather than the jury) will decide whether or not to dismiss the felony charges? Does Judge Mercan have the option of dismissing the felony enhancement but allowing the misdemeanor charges to proceed, or would Mercan have to dismiss all charges against Trump?\n3.

There is law regarding how this decision is made but I personally don't know that area of law well.\n\nOne of the reason that I am unfamiliar with it is that it is exceedingly rare for a judge to conclude that the prosecutor's charges are not supported by the law.\n\nI would be very surprised if that judge reached that conclusion in this case, in particular, because both federal election law violations and state and federal tax law violations are implicated by the indictment. The DA no doubt legally researched this issue exhaustively before presenting the charges to the grand jury and has made out a prima facie case for a felony under the applicable New York State law.\n\n> If Trump is brought to trial, then would it be possible for a jury to\n> return a verdict that Trump was guilty of the misdemeanor offenses of\n> falsifying business records but innocent of doing so with an intent to\n> commit another crime?

The body of law involved in how this decision is handled on a case by case basis is quite involved.\n\nMost of the case law involves homicide cases, assault cases, and property crime cases where there are charges with are identical except for aggravating factors for the most serious charges. But, lesser charges generally aren't presented if based upon the evidence presented at trial, either the more serious charge is established or no charge is proven.\n\nFor example, if the defendant presents an alibi defense, and a witness whose credibility is disputed places the defendant at the scene intentionally committing a crime, a lesser included offense charge would not be appropriate.\n\nBut, if the defendant admits hitting a pedestrian and causing the pedestrian's death, but claims that the pedestrian was at fault in the accident for jay walking, while the prosecution alleges that the pedestrian was intentionally struck as part of a mafia hit, multiple lesser included offenses would probably be charged involving different levels of intent of premeditated intent/aggravated circumstances killing (first degree murder), to a knowing killing (second degree murder), to a reckless killing (manslaughter), to a criminally negligent homicide or vehicular homicide charge.\n\nTypically, the decision on this point would not be made until all evidence was received and the judge in a hearing away from the jury but in the presence of the prosecutors and defense counsel crafted jury instructions based upon the evidence presented at trial and the arguments raised by counsel at trial.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: The Manhattan DA's indictment of former President Trump for falsifying business records has raised legal controversies.

This means the player has a form of ownership over the in-game currency.\n\n2. The documentation states that contracts forbidding resale are \"not illegal per se,\" but the bar for enforcing such restrictions is high. There is no specific law banning the resale of in-game items, similar to how concert ticket vendors cannot ban resale through Terms of Service alone.\n\n3. However, the game company still has the right to enforce its Terms of Service within the scope of the service they provide. This means they can terminate the player's account for violating the ToS, as this is part of their service agreement.\n\n4.

It's just I am new to studying law and want to get the vocabulary right. I am mostly a science and math orientated person and I am not good at English language / English litrature, which may be part of the reason I struggle with vocabulary.\n\nIs the word \"enact\" only used for laws passed by Parliament i.e. an Act of Parliament?\nCan you use the word enact for delegated legislation?\n\nAnd are consolidating statutes Acts of Parliament or Acts of Parliament and delegated legislation? I was thinking they may be delegated legislation as sometimes consolidating statutes are just amendments, corrections and minor improvements, which is what statutory instruments often are. It does not seem logical that you should go through the long rigorous law passing procedure of passing multiple readings in the House of Commons and the House of Lords just for amendments, corrections and minor improvements.\n\nAlso I have no professor to ask and the internet is not clear. I cannot seem to find the words *enact* and *delegated legislation* in the same sentence on the net.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **What Does Enact Mean?**\n\n\"Enact\" means that a legislative body has finally passed a proposed law (a.k.a. a \"bill\") or proposed ordinance in a legislative capacity, causing it to become a law (a.k.a. an \"act\") or ordinance, rather than merely a proposal to pass a law or ordinance.\n\nYour local council could enact an ordinance that was proposed to it to raise your rubbish collection fees, or parliament could enact a bill to reinstate the death penalty, or parliament could enact a bill to make an existing law gender neutral in its terminology.\n\nIn the U.S. when a regulation is brought into force to provide an executive branch department's interpretation or specification of something delegated to it in legislature an enactment, it would be customary to say that the regulation is \"adopted\" or \"made\" or \"ordered\" rather than \"enacted\".\n\nBut no one would be confused if you said that it was \"enacted\", in context, and British usage on this fine point might be different or evolving. The fact that your searches don't find \"enacted\" and \"delegated legislation\" in the same sentence, however, suggests that British usage hasn't evolved that far.\n\n**Minor Legislation**\n\n> It does not seem logical that you should go thought the long righorous\n> law passing proceedure of passing multiple reading in the House of\n> commons and the house of lords, for just amendments, corrections and\n> minor improvements.\n\nLogical or not, this is generally what is done. Indeed, the House of Lords largely justifies its existence by finding minor flaws in legislation passed by the House of Commons and sending it back to the House of Commons with amendments, corrections, and minor improvements to pass again.\n\nBut it usually isn't hard to get political support for these kinds of housekeeping amendments and nobody talks about them during Question Time, or makes long floor speeches about them in other floor debates.\n\nThe \"Bill To Correct Typos and Grammatical Errors In The Tax Revision Bill of 2020\" is offered up for consideration on the merits when its turn comes up, and in the absence of objection, it is adopted by unanimous consent, and boom, the Tax Revision Bill of 2020 isn't ugly and doesn't look like it was written by someone who skipped primary school anymore. This makes everybody in parliament look better.\n\nThe logic of this is an \"equal dignities\" idea. It should be as hard to change something enacted by parliament as it was to enact it in the first place. Unilateral executive branch officials shouldn't be able to override a decision voted upon by the entire House of Commons and the House of Lords by himself or herself.\n\n**Delegated Legislation Distinguished**\n\n[Delegated legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegated_legislation_in_the_United_Kingdom) is (mostly, at least) what we in the U.S. would call regulatory authority.\n\nDelegated legislation is not delegated because it is unimportant. It is delegated because MPs lack the capacity to articulate what it should say as well as executive branch officials.\n\nA typical example would be in the environmental protection area. MPs know that pollution that is dangerous to people is bad, but they delegate the authority to the agency to decide what that translates to in terms of parts per billion kilojoules of energy produced of lead or particulate matter or CO2\\. These amounts are determined by agency scientists helping the minsters and their underlings in the agency determine the right amount based upon lengthy reports that most MPs wouldn't understand because they did PolySci instead of chemistry in college.\n\nA radically different example that gets across the same idea would be that the parliament might delegate to the Defense Minister responsibility for establishing terms of engagement for British soldiers stationed in Afghanistan (i.e. rules for when they're allowed to shoot people), because the Minster's up to date knowledge of the situation and familiarity with military protocols, further informed by advice from the Ministry's generals and admirals, would allow the Minister to provide a rule that is more appropriate to the situation, that is more understandable from a soldier's perspective, than the House of Commons made up mostly of people who haven't served in the military and aren't familiar with what is going on in Afghanistan lately, would.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly!

Delegated legislation refers to regulatory authority given by Parliament to executive agencies, not to local council ordinances.\n\n4. The multiple readings process in both Houses of Parliament is specific to Acts of Parliament, not local ordinances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because local ordinances are not typically referred to as \"delegated legislation.\" Option B is incorrect because local ordinances do not need to be passed by Parliament.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Article 37 explicitly states that DPSP are not enforceable by courts, so option A is incorrect. The court cannot declare a law unconstitutional solely based on violation of DPSP.\n\n2.

Unless those items are in the public domain, or are exempted via fair\\-use doctrine (see below).\n\n### Devices, Code, Expression...\n\nReverse engineering software is not by itself copyright infringement, though there are some cases relating to \"look and feel\" that might apply to certain features of software or a page but look \\& feel case law seems to get weaker every year. In general software is a \"device/process\" which is more likely to be covered by a patent, not copyright. \n\nCertainly the *specific code* for software *as written* falls under copyright protection. That is, a specific app as purchased, not your \"version\" of it if you wrote it from scratch.\n\nFor a website, copyright applies to the expressive *content*, and likely applies to *some* of the the *actual* code as written for a page (such as a CSS style sheet, and perhaps some specific HTML, classes, scripts). But there is a lot of \"common\" code that is the same for many sites, and is not expressive nor unique, and thus is not protected by copyright.\n\n### f\u2122\n\nThe Facebook logo is covered by *trademark*, not copyright. Trademark is for items used in commerce, just as a logo or slogan. The rules regarding trademarks are a little different than copyright. For instance you can not copyright a title or a name, but you can use trademark protection if it is used in commerce. \n\nFor instance, the title \"STAR WARS\u00ae\" is protected by trademark, not copyright.\n\n### Unique or Eunuch\n\nThe overall design of a facebook page is not particularly unique \u2014 compare the functional elements to the page here at StackExchange. Top sticky bar, left column, right column, center content... That kind of common general layout is not subject to copyright protection. \n\nFB can't say, for instance, that they have the exclusive right to make their sticky bar 43px high and \\#4267B2\\. However, the color can be part of their trademark which features other design elements that make it unique. \n\nSo, **except for the images you pirated**, you could build a page that looks the same using all your own code without infringing copyright, but if you copy a \"functional element\" that is covered by a patent, that might infringe a patent claim. \n\nAlso if you *copy and paste code*, that could be an infringement, just as if you download and use images and sprite sheets will typically be infringement (unless they are PD or under fair use).\n\nFair Use Sets You Free\n======================\n\n**Nevertheless, for your intended purpose of instruction/demonstration, you are pretty much falling under the umbrella of fair\\-use.** And provided you don't actually distribute the images you downloaded, fair use should allow them to be used for example/demonstration for educational reasons.\n\nNevertheless, instead of using the facebook LOGOs, I suggest using parodies of them (you know, like **FACEBLOK** or **FARCEBOOK** or **FA$ETOOK**.)\n\nHere is an analogy using a science fiction story:\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nA young man is on a desert planet, and finds himself battling a galactic evil empire.

Rules for those institutions are often quite different from elementary school and from each other.\n\nI have no way to evaluate what the school regulations on such subjects might be, but it is probably safer to leave your empty casing at home, although no rule you have quoted or that I can find online would prohibit it.\n\nAn expended cartridge or casing is not a \"gun, rifle, pistol, or other firearm of any kind\" and so this provision of NC 14\\-269\\.2 would not apply, even in North Carolina.\n\nAn expended cartridge is not likely to be defined as a \"weapon\" either, and so the second quotes passage should not apply, although it is possible that the school regulations define \"weapon\" differently so that an expended cartridge is included.\n\nI have no way to know what other provisions the school regulations might include that would be relevant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A high school student in South Carolina receives a spent 30-08 Springfield casing as a gift from a friend who is a hunter.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. State law: The documentation mentions that the quoted statute is actually from North Carolina, not South Carolina. The corresponding South Carolina law (SECTION 23-31-215) is different and does not explicitly prohibit spent casings on school property. Therefore, the student is likely not violating state law.\n\n2. School policy: The school handbook prohibits \"Possessions, uses, or transfer of anything deemed as a weapon.\" While a spent casing is not typically considered a weapon, school policies can be more restrictive than state laws.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. According to the Employment Standards Act of British Columbia, employers are only required to provide meal breaks, not dedicated break areas.

See Washington Ethical Society v. District of Columbia, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 371, 249 F.2d 127; Fellowship of Humanity v.

The US Supreme court held that this violated the man's rights under the First Amendment's establishment clause, which had been incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth. The man was not, as far as I can tell, himself a Secular Humanist, and Secular Humanism was mentioned in the footnote merely as an example of a belief system that did not include a belief in God. Why Justice Black used the term \"religion\" to refer to it, I cannot say, some of the other groups listed in the footnote are clearly religions, and others are belief systems that for First Amendment purposes are often treated similarly to religions. \n\nWhat might better describe the Court's rulings here than the linked site does is that believers in Secular Humanism, Ethical Culture, and other similar belief systems will have their beliefs protected in just the same way that believers in any religion will. Freedom of Religion includes the right not to have a religion.\nBy the way, the passage from *Everson v. Board of Education*, 330 US 1 which is quoted in *Torcaso v. Watkins* and to which the linked web site probably refers is:\n\n> The 'establishment of religion' clause of the First Amendment means at least this: neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or nonattendance. No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups, and vice versa. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect 'a wall of separation between church and State.'\n\nBy the way, any site which proclaims that [Hugo Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Black) was a \"Marxist agent\" has lost much credibility in my opinion.

But, this behavioral claim is not a universal one, it is a function of particular sets of institutional and political cultures.\n\nThe legislative check also has more bite in the Netherlands because it is more of a \"deliberative democracy\" in terms of its political culture (i.e. decision\\-making relies more heavily on the substantive merits of legislation rather than ethic or partisan identity and seeks wide input) (the Netherlands ranks \\#9, the U.S. ranks \\#94\\).

You see the same thing in the U.K. parliament which historically was not subject to any form of judicial review.\n\nThe Council of State and its institutional norms, in particular, are a known quantity, because the [Dutch Council of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_State_(Netherlands)) has operated continuously since 1531 CE making it one of the oldest continuously functioning state institutions in the world.\n\nLikewise, Dutch judges, when applying the laws and treaties currently in force, are independent, and are arguably less partisan than U.S. courts.

The correct answer is D, to omit the copyright notice entirely. This is based on several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. A copyright notice, if used, must have the specific form \"Copyright <year> <owner>\". None of the proposed formats in options A, B, or C fully comply with this requirement.\n\n2.

If a particular lie is perjury (thus a violation of law, which defines perjury differently in some different jurisdictions) when uttered to the government, then uttering that lie to an attorney who is an officer of a court of the same government is perjury. This would not be limited to attorneys acting for a government such as prosecutors or private attorneys general. It would not matter whether the lawyer is representing the person who thus lied, under consideration to provide representation, or neither. It probably would not matter whether the lie is being told in the jurisdiction where the lawyer is an officer of a court, the lawyer was admitted pro hac vice, i.e., for purposes limited to one case, the lawyer does not have an active practice, the lawyer only advises other lawyers and does not represent anyone (such as by performing legal research without a confidentiality privilege), the lawyer is retired (but not diisbarred), the lie involves fraud, or the lawyer tells anyone else the content of the statement that is a lie without the lawyer personally intending to lie (as in \"my client said . . .\"). It probably matters whether the person who is lying knew or should have known that the person to be lied to is an attorney admitted to practice somewhere, or at least is an attorney.\n\nI don't think it's possible to distinguish between lying to the government and lying to an individual who is part of that government, because there is no other way to lie to the government. Even if the lie were told in a letter addressed only to \"Government, State of . . ., \\[capital city, state, and Zip code]\" and a machine opened the letter, scanned it into a computer, and used artificial intelligence to parse it with the AI having been written as free open\\-source software by a nongovernment programmer, if a human being on behalf of the government acts on the letter (including by deciding not to act on it), the lie is to a human who programmed the parsing system and/or to a human who acted on the parsed letter.\n\nUnless there's a law specifically exempting the liar from liability (criminal and civil) when lying to a lawyer (and it would be interesting to theorize about the rationale for such a law), how is it not illegal (unlawful) to lie to a lawyer under the above circumstances?\n\nI have no case involving this possibility. I'm thinking of writing about this, and I've seen various discussions that it's not illegal except for fraud (fraud has at least one additional element that makes it harder to prove than perjury), but none of the discussions I saw cited a source in the law. On the other hand, while I don't follow developments in the law with a practicing lawyer's diligence, I haven't heard of, say, a case against a client for having lied to their lawyer (viz., \"I didn't go to the bank\" while confessing to the police about robbing it in person without recanting the confession), and I imagine a few lawyers would gladly sue people for perjury to them. On the other hand, and this is just my speculation, maybe most lawyers don't think there's much of a problem and that letting the courts decide would create more problems than it's worth.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **No**\n------\n\nA lawyer is considered an \"officer of the court\" in the sense that certain duties to the court are imposed on the lawyer. That does not give the lawyer authority as if the lawyer was part of the court staff, nor a law enforcement officer.\n\nA statement can be prosecuted as perjury only if it is made under oath (or affirmation) in court, or if it is made \"under penalty of perjury\". This is generally done by a statement in a document signed, something like \"I declare under penalty of perjury that all statements in the above document are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.\" It can also be done verbally, with the person making the statement agreeing that it is true and that this is subject to perjury prosecution if it is false. The exact wording will vary, but it must be clear and explicit.\n\nAside from that, false statements to a lawyer are not generally subject to prosecution for perjury, nor otherwise illegal. In some cases a lie in a business transaction may be **fraud**, which is actionable, and possibly criminal. But that will not have anything to do with whether the person lied to is or is not a lawyer.\n\n[This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury) says:\n\n> Perjury is the intentional act of swearing a false oath or falsifying an affirmation to tell the truth, whether spoken or in writing, concerning matters material to an official proceeding.\n\n...\n\n> The rules for perjury also apply when a person has made a statement under penalty of perjury even if the person has not been sworn or affirmed as a witness before an appropriate official. An example is the US income tax return, which, by law, must be signed as true and correct under penalty of perjury\n\nThe US Federal law on perjury, [18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1621](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621) says:\n\n> (1\\) having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true; or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;\n> \n> \n> is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

During a private consultation, the client admits to the attorney that they lied on their tax returns but insists they didn't commit the fraud they're accused of. Later, in court, the client testifies under oath that they have never lied on any official documents. What are the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The attorney must immediately report the client's perjury to the court\nB) The client can be prosecuted for perjury, but the attorney cannot be held liable\nC) The attorney-client privilege protects both the client and attorney from any legal consequences\nD) The attorney may face ethical dilemmas but is not legally obligated to disclose the client's lie\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This situation highlights several complex legal and ethical issues:\n\n1. Perjury: The client's statement in court, made under oath, contradicts what they told their attorney privately. This could constitute perjury, as it's a false statement made under oath in an official proceeding.\n\n2. Attorney-client privilege: The conversation between the client and attorney about the tax returns is protected by attorney-client privilege. The attorney cannot disclose this information without the client's consent.\n\n3. Lawyer's ethical obligations: While attorneys have a duty to the court as \"officers of the court,\" this doesn't override attorney-client privilege or require them to report their clients' crimes.\n\n4. Lying to a lawyer: As per the documentation, lying to a lawyer (outside of court and not under oath) is generally not illegal or considered perjury. The client's admission about lying on tax returns, while potentially a crime itself, is not perjury when told to the lawyer in private.\n\n5. Ethical dilemma: The attorney now knows their client has committed perjury in court but is bound by confidentiality. This creates an ethical dilemma, as they cannot actively participate in or further the perjury, but also cannot disclose privileged information.\n\nThe correct answer is D because:\n- The attorney is not legally obligated to disclose the client's lie due to attorney-client privilege.\n- The attorney faces ethical challenges in continuing representation without participating in the perjury.\n- The situation doesn't meet the legal definition of perjury for the private conversation with the lawyer.\n- While the client may face perjury charges for their in-court testimony, the attorney's knowledge of this doesn't create a legal obligation to report it.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts, application to a real-world scenario, and understanding of the nuances in legal and ethical obligations of attorneys."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32559/if-i-dont-patent-my-invention-how-closely-can-a-competitor-copy-my-product", "docs_id": 32559, "title": "If I don&#39;t patent my invention, how closely can a competitor copy my product?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Introduction:\n-------------\n\nI had an idea for how to make a certain product much better.

If you publish your findings, anyone can use them.\n\nIt is possible to patent the specific design of your chassis. Design patents, which cover the specific aesthetic design of something, can be less expensive than utility patents, which cover functional aspects. Although your chassis is designed with functionality in mind, it will also embody an aesthetic design.\n\nThat said, enforcement of patent rights (or any other rights you might hope protect your chassis) is orders of magnitude more expensive (typically millions of dollars) than merely obtaining a patent.

While \"googly\" is indeed a real term (like \"apple\" in the example), the key difference here is that the proposed company name would be used in the same industry as Google (computer software/analytics), unlike the \"AppleMoving\" example which was in a different industry from Apple Computers.\n\n3.

The industry overlap and similarity to Google's products make this case more problematic than examples like \"Gogglebox\" or \"Apple Security,\" which operate in distinctly different areas from the trademark holders.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they oversimplify the issue, focusing on single aspects (the cricket term or spelling) rather than the overall context and likelihood of confusion.

In which case, my question would be, why are some things that are wrong involving the government considered to be part of civil or criminal law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Civil litigation involves general causes of action that are available to anyone, including both private parties and the government. Civil courts are designed primarily to provide restitution to the injured party.\n\nCriminal courts exist for governments to exercise their police powers: specific, limited authority held only by the government. The principal purposes of criminal law are...well, they're debated, but broadly speaking, it's to punish and/or rehabilitate the criminal and deter future criminals.\n\nBecause criminal conviction can result in jail time and even the death penalty, there are more stringent procedural protections accorded to criminal defendants than there are to civil defendants. So when the government's goal is to recover damages, it's easier for them to use the less burdensoome civil procedures, just the same as anyone else would.\n\nLet me give you an example. Someone steals your identity and runs up $100,000 on your credit card.\n\nYou call the police, and they find someone they think is the guy. To convict him, the police must convince an entire jury panel that he did it, beyond a reasonable doubt\\-\\-a high standard. He pleads the fifth, and without his testimony, the police may not succeed. If they do, he will be sent to jail, and he may also be ordered to give part or all of your money back. If the case is weak, however, the police may not want to spend their limited time on it\\-\\-and that's their call, not yours. (This also applies to government agencies; only law enforcement can bring a criminal case, not any government agency.)\n\nHowever, you can also file a civil lawsuit. In that lawsuit, depending on the jurisdiction, you may only need to convince some of the jury\\-\\-civil verdicts don't always have to be unanimous. You may even just face a judge, with no jury. And the legal standard is a \"preponderance of the evidence,\" which in layman's terms just means \"more likely than not\"\\-\\-a much easier thing to prove. Because the Fifth Amendment doesn't apply to civil litigation, you may even be able to argue before the jury that the defendant's refusal to testify suggests he's guilty.\n\nIn summary: civil lawsuits use different rules and procedures, which may make it easier to recover money (or get other civil relief, such as an injunction) in cases where that's the goal. These courts are open to anyone, including the government. But if the government wants to use its special police powers to put someone in jail or get other criminal relief, they have to use the stricter criminal rules and procedures.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A federal agency discovers that a large corporation has been systematically overcharging for services provided under a government contract.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. Civil lawsuits are more appropriate for recovering damages, which is a primary goal in this scenario. As the documentation states, \"Civil courts are designed primarily to provide restitution to the injured party.\"\n\n2. The burden of proof in civil cases (\"preponderance of evidence\") is lower than in criminal cases (\"beyond reasonable doubt\"), making it easier for the government to prove its case and recover funds.\n\n3.

The tribunal itself has this authority. If Bob declines to answer a question, even if he believes it's irrelevant, there can be consequences. These consequences may include negative inferences being drawn against him or his testimony, if it's reasonable to do so. Additionally, while not explicitly stated for tribunals, the documentation mentions that in courts and parliamentary committees, witnesses can be sanctioned (even jailed) for refusing to answer questions. Although tribunals may need to refer to a court for such severe sanctions, the principle of potential consequences for non-cooperation applies. The question also tests the candidate's ability to understand the limits of a witness's rights in legal proceedings and the potential ramifications of refusing to participate fully, even when the witness believes a question is irrelevant.

That would be someone who follows someone around to looks after their legal safety like a conventional bodyguard looks after their physical safety?\n\nI suspect the people and cases where it would be worth the expense to never be cought without legal counsel would be few and far between, but I suspect they do exist.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There isn't a distinct word for this role in modern English, mostly because there aren't meaningful numbers of persons in this role.\n\nFor example, in the [TV series Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)), there are lawyers who act in such a role (accompanying a leading character on his yacht while on vacation, for example) and those people are simply called **lawyers** (a term that emphasizes their legal knowledge and expertise) or **attorneys** (a term that emphasizes their authority to take action on behalf of their clients as agents of their clients in legal matters).\n\nThe concept also has some similarity to the 17th and early 18th century role of a [**factor**](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/factor) (see definition number 2 at the link) before the legal profession became a regulated one, and the term attorney is an outgrowth of this sort of conception of the role.\n\n[Model Rule of Professional Conduct 2\\.1](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_2_1_advisor/), the template for the ethical rules for lawyers in all U.S. jurisdictions, refers to a lawyer acting in that role as an **advisor** or **counselor**. A lawyer acting in such a role in U.S. practice is not limited to providing legal advice and can consider the client's needs more generally.\n\nMany organizations (for profit, non\\-profit, and governmental), however, have a **general counsel** or **corporate counsel** or **chief legal officer** or **county attorney** or **city attorney**, who works full time for the organization who is commonly described as [**in house counsel**](https://www.acc.com/sites/default/files/resources/vl/membersonly/InfoPAK/19654_2.pdf) and serves a similar role for the organization. Sometimes this is a full time position, sometimes, it is a part\\-time position.\n\nGoing back even further in history, this also has similarities to a [**courtier**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtier). @NateEldredge's reference to a **[consigliere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hagen)** in the modern sense of an advisor to an organized crime boss (who might be, but isn't necessarily, a lawyer) also isn't far off and traces back to the more legitimate feudal role of a particular sort of courtier. In modern politics, and less savory \"gray area\" activities corporate and criminal alike, a person who does something similar to this, who is sometimes, but not always, a lawyer, is sometimes also called a **[fixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person))**. @grovkin also suggests in a comment, the title of **handler** which heavily overlaps with the notion of a fixer.\n\nIn federal and state government, such a person would often be a **chief of staff** or a member of a President or Governor's \"kitchen cabinet\", although a **personal lawyer** in addition to the **Attorney General** and attorneys in the Office of Legal Counsel who also serve those roles exist formally as well.\n\nIn the military, sometimes a **staff officer** fills a role similar to this one, especially if that staff officer is a member of the Judge\\-Advocate General's (JAG) corps.\n\nA couple more points not precisely responsive to the question.\n\nFirst, in some science fiction works, including [Kate Elliot's \"The Novels of the Jaran\"](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00GH2G8BA), the future equivalent of pretty much this precise role is called a **Protocol Officer**, effectively envisioning a merger of law, etiquette, and diplomacy in a more civilized world that is not balkanized and instead has only a single universal political system. (See also, e.g., C3PO, a Protocol Droid carrying out a similar role in the Star Wars saga.)\n\nI believe that similar roles (with job titles that have only Chinese or Japanese or Korean language terminology) were present in some of the heavily Confucian influenced monarchies of East Asia, in roles perhaps most analogous to military staff officers for feudal aristocrats and high officials.\n\nSecond, in most civil law countries (in contrast to common law legal system countries), there are lots of people who earn an undergraduate bachelor's level degree in law without seeking to enter a licensed or regulated profession to become a true practicing lawyer in the common law country sense. Instead, these individuals typically seek managerial professional positions in businesses in much the way that a business major with a specialization in marketing or finance or management might. So, unlike, common law countries, in most civil law countries that is a significant population of people with formal legal training who are not lawyers or paralegals in the common law country sense.\n\nI honestly have no idea what kind of job titles people on that career track typically hold, or just how they use their legal training in the course of their careers. It might be that someone like this would sometimes take on the role described in the question, but I don't know enough to know if that is really the case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A high-profile CEO of a multinational corporation is facing potential legal challenges across multiple jurisdictions.

When can you renounce citizenship? Einstein famously renounced German citizenship in 1896 when he was still a minor.**\n\n---\n\nOne of the comments had an example that is spot on \\-\\-The Lord Haw\\-Haw case after the 2nd WW. An American who became a Naturalized German, was tried for and convicted of treason as a British citizen because the British declared that he was one. The moral justification for this does not concern me here. Just, that that was the legal ruling. He got the death penalty. So that pretty much covers the spectrum here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can be extradited from Country A to Country B even if you are a citizen of neither. What matters is whether B can convince A to do it, which is typically on the basis of a treaty between them as well as provisions of both country's domestic criminal law.\n\nIf you committed a crime in B, then fled to A, your nationality is relevant to the extent that:\n\n* A might not extradite its own citizens, if you are a citizen of A\n* A might have an agreement with C, if you are a citizen of C, that C should have the chance to proscute you instead of B. (This is the *Petruhhin* doctrine in the case where A and C are EU countries and B is not.)\n\nBut you do not have to be a national of B in order for it to have jurisdiction over you in B's domestic criminal law \\- just as if you were *still in B*, they could arrest you in the normal way. They are thus entitled to request A's authorities to arrest you in A, and transfer you to B.\n\nIf your alleged crime was *not* in B, then their claim over you has to be on the basis that their domestic criminal law allows prosecution extraterritorially. This was the case when B was Spain, A was the United Kingdom, and the criminal was former Chilean leader [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet); while his status as a former head of state was relevant, as was whether the crimes were extraterritorial offences in the UK as well, his lack of Spanish nationality was not. A more topical example is B being the United States, A the United Kingdom, and the arrestee being [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange), an Australian who is alleged to have committed various crimes under U.S. law (while not necessarily having been present in the U.S. at the time).\n\nWhile all extradition relationships are different, a common thread of the criminal law *in general* is that what matters is the circumstances at the time of the alleged acts. Retroactively making you a citizen of B may not be satisfactory to A, to the extent that A's criminal law disallows making anything illegal retroactively. The supposed nationality grant by B might trigger provision's of A's domestic extradition law concerning requirements of due process, lack of political interference, and so on, and block the action.\n\nBut equally, renouncing your citizenship of B does not extinguish B's claim over you for acts you did *while* you were a citizen of B.

The correct answer is B because the documentation clearly states that extradition can occur between countries even if the individual is not a citizen of either country. What matters most is the treaty between the countries and their respective domestic criminal laws.\n\nThe key points supporting this are:\n1. Extradition is possible between countries A and B even if the person is a citizen of neither.\n2. The circumstances at the time of the alleged acts are what matter in criminal law, not current citizenship status.\n3. Renouncing citizenship does not extinguish a country's claim over acts committed while the person was a citizen.\n\nOption A is incorrect because renouncing citizenship doesn't invalidate crimes committed while a citizen. Option C is incorrect because while country A might have some say (e.g., the Petruhhin doctrine in the EU), it's not the determining factor in all cases.

This way I don't even know what I would be disputing in counter\\-notice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first question is, would you have any basis for legal action against a service provider in case they arbitrarily delete your contributions: you might, or you might not (read the terms of service, ask your lawyer). Let's assume that there is a legal reason why the provider should leave your material alone. If you are infringing copyright, the provider *might* also get sued for contributing to the infringement, so there is a law DMCA: [17 USC 512](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512)) that says when they are immune to such a suit. The first part of this is that a supposed copyright owner can file a take down notice with the provider, claiming that they are hosting infringing material. But under thatlaw, they must \"take\\[] reasonable steps promptly to notify the subscriber that it has removed or disabled access to the material\". Presumably they did that and inform you about the counter\\-notice provision (although your wording is not clear on this: saying verbatim what they notified you of would be useful).\n\nThat counter\\-notice requires you to identify yourself, etc. and provide\n\n> A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good\n>  faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of\n>  mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or\n>  disabled.\n\nThere is no point in the law requiring the provider to reveal anything about the alleged rights\\-holder, just the fact that the material has been taken down. The law does allow the copyright owner to subpoena requesting information identifying the alleged infringer. There is no provision whereby an alleged infringer can subpoena information about the person filing the original notice. That is because the copyright owner has to file a lawsuit against the infringer (if the infringer files a counter\\-notice and the owner does not file lawsuit, the material must be restored). When you get sued, you will know at that point who is suing you.\n\nYou do not need to know who the rights holder is to file a counter\\-notice. The law says that you have to include\n\n> A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good\n>  faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of\n>  mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or\n>  disabled.\n\nSuppose for example that you illegally copied and pasted the source code for Windows 10\\. You can't seriously believe that you have the right to post that material, so to avoid perjury charges, you would not make such a false statement. Suppose that you copied two lines of protected source code, as examples of some technical point \u2013 then that would be fair use and not infringement. In such a case, the initial take down notice might be found to be abusive and knowingly false. There could be an intermediate situation, where you post a book that you've written and as it happens there is a graphic contained therein which is beyond the scope of fair use \u2013 but you have no idea that this is what they are talking about (maybe you think the graphic is not protected). Then perhaps you can, in good faith, state that the claim \"this work infringes\" is mistaken.

This book is not banned in my country. I understand that if I go to his country to deliver it, I may get arrested, because I'm breaking the law of possessing the book. What happens if I just send the book by mail? Bob would break the law for possession of the banned book, but would I be doing something illegal? What are the possible consequences?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a general rule, most countries have what's called Bi\\-Lateral extradition treaties, which means that Country A (Cedricstan) will only extradite to Country B (Bobtopia) for crimes that were committed in Bobtopia AND are crimes in Cedricstan.\n\nSo, in this scenario, you, a Cedricstan citizen purchase the book \"The Big Book of Banned Things in Bobtopia\" and send it to Bobtopian Bob by international mail. Bobtopian Ministry of Banned Stuff police (BMBS) find Bob in possession of the book and through creative interrogation (cause all countries that ban books are surprisingly creative in interrogation techniques) figure out that you sent it to him. The would file an extradition petition with the Cedricstan Embassy, who then call up the Cedricstan Ministry of Justice (CMJ) and discuss the charges (if there's no extradition treaty, the process is basically the embassy staffer politely taking the note and giving it to the Ambassador, who tries not to laugh too much as he dumps it to the bin. If there isn't even diplomatic relationships, this is the same process, but now it's the Swiss Ambassador laughing instead of a Cedricstan Ambassador).\n\nAnyway, assuming Cedricstan and Bobtopia have an extradition treaty with each other, it's going to be Bi\\-Lateral, meaning Cedricstan will only extradite you for crimes committed in Bobtopia that are also crimes in Cedricstan. So, first off, you did not possess the book while in Bobtopia, so the crime didn't happen in Bobtopia and they have jurisdiction over the crime. The legal ramifications are that of Cedricstan, not Bobtopia, so they apply here. Given you bought the book in Cedricstan, you're likely to not face any legal ramifications (well... more on this in a moment).\n\nSuppose then, we some how get to the point where you are proven to have been in Bobtopia and possessing the book of very naughty knowledge, Bobtopia Ed. In this case, Cedricstan would have to consider if it is a crime here (kinda... more on this as well). Since Cedricstan has Constitutionally protected Freedom of Speech and Press, there is no equivalent crime for possessing Forbidden Knowledge II: Bobtopia Boogaloo, which not only is legal to own, but a Cedricstan Times Best Seller for the 104th week running. So in this case, Cedricstan laughs in Free Speech and refuse to extradite you. There are again, no legal ramifications (well... more on this in a moment... which would be next paragraph).\n\nSo, of course, this assumes you're not going to go to any country ever in the future. Obviously, Bobtopia agents from the BMBS will happily greet you if you ever go to Bobtopia... creatively of course... But you should probably review the diplomatic relationships of other nations with Bobtopia and their laws on banned literature... it could be that their extradition treaties will allow an agent of the third nation to arrest you and extradite you to Bobtopia... if you realize this is about to happen, your best bet is to find a Cedricstan Embassy or Consulate and high tail it there. But otherwise there shoudln't be any issues.\n\nThe other problem here is that nations may have additional rules. For example, the United States does not allow for libel tourism... which is using another nation to sue an American for defamation that doesn't rise to the Defamation under U.S. Law (which is notoriously stricter than most similar nations. Historically, close relations between United States and UK would mean that defamation of a UK person said in the United States could be tried in the UK and the U.S. speaker would be under their jurisdiction... The ban here prevents that by saying the United States would not enforce decisions unless their own courts found the case in a similar way.\n\nOn the other end, Canada will not extradite murderers to the United States, if said Murderer is eligible for the Death Penalty... but a Prosecutor promising to not seek the Death Penalty in sentencing if guilt is found is good enough for Canada to extradite the murderer back.\n\nTL;DR: As long as you stay in your country, you should not be extradited for crimes that are not mutually recognized... be careful when you leave though.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An activist in Country A wants to send a banned book to a friend in Country B, where the book is prohibited.

Which of the following strategies would most effectively reduce the activist's legal exposure while still attempting to deliver the book?\n\nA) Mail the book directly from Country A to the friend in Country B, using a fake return address\nB) Travel to a third country with looser extradition laws, then mail the book to Country B from there\nC) Digitize the book's content and send it electronically through an encrypted channel\nD) Arrange for the book to be printed and bound within Country B, using locally sourced materials\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the legal concepts presented in the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer, C, offers the best strategy to minimize legal exposure for the following reasons:\n\n1. By digitizing and sending the content electronically, the activist avoids physically possessing or transporting the banned book, which is a key element in many countries' laws regarding prohibited materials.\n\n2. Using an encrypted channel adds an extra layer of security, making it more difficult for authorities to intercept or prove the transmission of the banned content.\n\n3. This method doesn't involve crossing physical borders with the banned material, reducing the risk of detection and prosecution under international laws.\n\n4. Digital transmission is less likely to be subject to postal inspections or customs checks that physical books might undergo.\n\nOption A is risky because it directly violates the laws of Country B and could potentially be traced back to the sender, even with a fake return address. Option B, while attempting to exploit differences in extradition laws, still involves physical possession and international shipping of the banned book, which carries significant legal risks. Option D attempts to circumvent importation laws but still involves the production of illegal material within Country B, which could lead to legal consequences for both the activist and their friend.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, including extradition treaties, jurisdictional issues, and the importance of physical possession in determining legal culpability.

But I would not be surprised to find them roaming my yard. (This is the kind of city that measures your lawn with a ruler to enforce the landscaping code.) It feels very invasive and kind of pushy. \n\nMy question is: **does a city have any legal basis for entering a property for housing code inspections**? Does the 4th Amendment apply here? I imagine that it would be considered trespassing if I told them to leave, and they refused. I also understand that this will likely cause me more headaches than if I simply let them do their thing. But it feels wrong.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The 4th Amendment applies to administrative inspections. Per [Camara v. Municipal Court](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/387/523/case.html) 387 U.S. 523 (1967\\), there are some exceptions for tightly regulated industries, but you don't seem to be describing such a situation.\n\nIf you object to a warrantless inspection, the inspectors would need to get a warrant to do those parts of the inspection that require getting on the curtilage of your property. Curtilage is the part of your property that is so intimately connected with the home that it treated the same for 4th Amendment purposes. Per [United States v. Dunn](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/480/294/case.html) 480 U.S. 294 (1987\\), a fence doesn't mean everything inside the fence is curtilage (but for a small, city dwelling, the fence is probably going to be considered the curtilage boundary). Not having a fence doesn't mean nothing is curtilage.\n\nAs you say, even if you object to the warrantless inspection, they can probably do a lot of the inspection from outside your curtilage and avoid infringing your 4th Amendment rights.\n\nThe inspectors may choose to return with an inspection warrant. An example statute describing an inspection warrant is [California Code 1822\\.50](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CCP&sectionNum=1822.50):\n\n> An inspection warrant is an order, in writing, in the name of the people, signed by a judge of a court of record, directed to a state or local official, commanding him to conduct any inspection required or authorized by state or local law or regulation relating to building, fire, safety, plumbing, electrical, health, labor, or zoning.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A city government is conducting routine housing inspections, and an inspector attempts to enter a homeowner's backyard without prior permission or a warrant.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation cites Camara v. Municipal Court, which establishes that the Fourth Amendment applies to administrative inspections like housing inspections.\n\n2. The concept of curtilage is introduced, defined as the area so intimately connected with the home that it's treated the same for Fourth Amendment purposes.\n\n3.

The inspector attempting to enter the backyard without permission or a warrant would likely be violating the homeowner's Fourth Amendment rights if the backyard is considered curtilage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that the Fourth Amendment applies to administrative inspections. Option B is a misinterpretation of the curtilage concept, as the lack of a fence doesn't automatically exclude an area from being curtilage.

Trespassing is generally defined as entering on property against the expressed will of the owner or lawful occupant, **without lawful authority**. A firefighter is not trespassing when responding to a fire, even if the owner orders the firefighter to leave. A building inspector is not tresspassing while making an inspection (if local law grants an inspector access). Neither is a police officer with a warrant for entry, or a person with a court order to recover property.\n\nIn some cases such lawful authority must be communicated to the owner, in others it need not be, this depends on the nature of the authority and the exact provisions of the governing law.\n\nWhether such a person entering with authority may be armed depends very much on the local law, and the nature of the authority. In some cases and some places such a person is free to be armed, in others this would be illegal.\n\nIf one is lawfully present somewhere and is attacked, one is entitled to defend oneself (or another), although there may be a duty to avoid a confrontation by retreating if this is reasonably possible when not in one's own home in some jurisdictions (such as California).

However, you may only use the degree of force reasonably necessary under the circumstances.\n\nThe page [\"California Self Defense Laws\"](https://www.findlaw.com/state/california-law/california-self-defense-laws.html) from Findlaw reads:\n\n> The right to use force \\-\\- even deadly force if necessary \\-\\- to defend oneself is a broadly accepted principle of the criminal justice system. But while all states allow defendants to claim self defense if they can back up such claims, states differ on the scope of what may be considered appropriate use of force and when it may be applied. ... As a general rule of thumb, any force used against an intruder must be proportionate to the harm reasonably feared.\n\nIn [*People v. King* {Crim. No. 20380\\. Supreme Court of California. August 29, 1978\\.}](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/22/12.html) The California Supreme Court held that self\\-defense was a possible defense to a charge of possession of a handgun by a felon, and wrote about the right of self\\-defense in CA law. The opinion reads:\n\n> \\[I]t is apparent that the conviction cannot stand if the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury regarding the right of self\\-defense as it related to the section 12021 charge. ...\n> \n> \n> When enacting section 12021 and its predecessor statute, the Legislature is presumed to have been aware of the several existing statutes giving any person the right to use force, including deadly force in appropriate circumstances, in defense of self or others. This right has been included in provisions of the Penal Code since its enactment in 1872\\. Section 692 provides:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Lawful resistance to the commission of a public offense may be made:\n> > \n> > \n> > 1. By the party about to be injured;\n> > 2. By other parties.\"\n> \n> \n> Section 693 provides:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Resistance sufficient to prevent the offense may be made by the party about to be injured:\n> > \n> > \n> > 1. To prevent an offense against his person, or his family, or some member thereof.\n> > 2. To prevent an illegal attempt by force to take or injure property in his lawful possession.\n> \n> \n> Section 694 extends the right to defend others, providing:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Any other person, in aid or defense of the person about to be injured, may make resistance sufficient to prevent the offense.\n> \n> \n> Although the extent of these rights has been defined and circumscribed by judicial decision (see, e.g., *People v. Ceballos*, supra, 12 Cal.3d 470\\) none of these sections has been amended to restrict the rights affirmed therein since its adoption over a century ago.\n> \n> \n> Civil Code section 50, affirms the same rights, providing:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Any necessary force may be used to protect from wrongful injury the person or property of oneself, or of a wife, husband, child, parent, or other relative, or member of one's family, or of a ward, servant, master, or guest.\n> > It, too, was adopted in 1872, and it was amended in 1874 to expand the right of defense first declared to encompass guests. Similarly the provisions of sections 197 and 198 governing the circumstances in which homicide is justifiable were included in the Penal Code of 1872, and are traceable to the Statutes of 1850\\.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Use of a concealable firearm in self\\-defense is neither a crime nor an unlawful purpose. ... We conclude, therefore, that the prohibition of section 12021 was not intended to affect a felon's right to use a concealable firearm in self\\-defense, but was intended only to prohibit members of the affected classes from arming themselves with concealable firearms or having such weapons in their custody or control in circumstances other than those in which the right to use deadly force in self\\-defense exists or reasonably appears to exist. Thus, when a member of one of the affected classes is in imminent peril of great bodily harm or reasonably believes himself or others to be in such danger, and without preconceived design on his part a firearm is made available to him, his temporary possession of that weapon for a period no longer than that in which the necessity or apparent necessity to use it in self\\-defense continues, does not violate section 12021\\. As in all cases in which deadly force is used or threatened in self\\-defense, however, the use of the firearm must be reasonable under the circumstances and may be resorted to only if no other alternative means of avoiding the danger are available. In the case of a felon defending himself alone, such alternatives may include retreat where other persons would not be required to do so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A private investigator has been granted a court order to retrieve specific documents from a property. Upon arrival, the property owner becomes hostile and threatens violence. The investigator is legally armed. In this scenario, what is the most appropriate course of action for the investigator under California law?\n\nA) Use the firearm immediately to intimidate the property owner and ensure compliance with the court order\nB) Retreat from the property and return with law enforcement assistance\nC) Attempt to de-escalate the situation, but be prepared to use reasonable force if faced with imminent danger of great bodily harm\nD) Proceed to search for the documents, disregarding the property owner's threats as they have no legal right to interfere\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario requires analysis of multiple legal concepts from California law regarding self-defense, lawful presence, and use of force. The correct answer is C for the following reasons:\n\n1. Lawful presence: The investigator is not trespassing due to the court order, which provides lawful authority to enter the property.\n\n2. Right to self-defense: California law (Penal Code sections 692-694) allows for self-defense, even for those lawfully present on another's property.\n\n3. Reasonable belief and proportional response: The Judicial Council of California Criminal Jury Instruction #505 states that self-defense is justified when there's a reasonable belief of imminent danger and the force used is proportional.\n\n4. Duty to retreat: While California doesn't have a strict \"duty to retreat\" law, the case People v. King suggests that in self-defense situations, alternatives to force should be considered if available.\n\n5. De-escalation: Given the potential for violence, attempting to de-escalate is a prudent first step that aligns with the legal principle of using force only when necessary.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it involves disproportionate and preemptive use of force. Option B, while potentially safe, may not be necessary if de-escalation is possible and could impede the execution of the court order. Option D ignores the real threat of violence, which the investigator has a right to defend against.\n\nThe correct approach (C) balances the investigator's right to be on the property, the legal right to self-defense if necessary, and the obligation to use force only as a last resort when faced with imminent danger of great bodily harm. This approach requires critical thinking and application of multiple legal concepts to a real-world scenario."}, "72": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15139/what-would-it-take-to-replace-the-electoral-college-system", "docs_id": 15139, "title": "What would it take to replace the electoral college system?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It seems electoral college debate comes back every election these days.

Sections 2\\-3 of the 14th Amendment would probably have to be rewritten, since they also refer to there being \"electors\". A single constitutional amendment would suffice (and nothing less than an amendment would): the wording would of course depend on what system you wanted to replace it with. In doing this, it should be decided how to deal with the fact that electors cannot vote for both a president and vice\\-president from the elector's state (per the 12th Amendment): that *might* indicate an intent to prevent the president and vice\\-president from being from the same state, or it might mean that the intent was that if that happens, then that state's electors can't vote for their two favorite sons. In repealing the 12th, you can decide what you want now.\n\nThere is a proposal to effectively nullify the Electoral College, the [Popular Vote Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact), which has been enacted in a few states. The basic idea is to make it a statutory requirement at the state level that all electors must vote for the winner of the popular vote at the national level, regardless of the outcome in the particular state. The idea is that when enough states agree to the scheme such that they hold a majority of electors (which can change over time, so to be stable you need more than a simple majority), then they vow to vote for the winner of the national election. However, this also needs to be backed up with more compulsory faithful voting of electors, since compact or no compact, only 1 state seems to be able to actually prevent an elector from voting however he wants.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A group of states is considering implementing the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact to effectively nullify the Electoral College without a constitutional amendment.

The most significant legal challenge comes from option B, where an elector votes against the compact's instructions. The documentation states that \"only 1 state seems to be able to actually prevent an elector from voting however he wants.\" This highlights a critical weakness in the compact's enforceability.\n\nOption A is less challenging because state legislatures have the constitutional authority to determine how electors are chosen. A gubernatorial veto could be overridden or challenged in court.\n\nOption C, while potentially problematic, is less severe because the compact is designed to work within the existing constitutional framework, making a successful constitutional challenge less likely.\n\nOption D presents a political rather than a legal challenge. While it could undermine the compact's effectiveness, it doesn't pose the same immediate legal threat as an elector voting against instructions.\n\nThe correct answer tests the integration of knowledge about elector behavior, state laws, and the practical implementation of the compact, requiring higher-order thinking about the real-world application of this alternative to a constitutional amendment."}, "73": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26745/did-ready-player-one-have-to-get-licenses-for-the-usage-of-all-its-video-game-ch", "docs_id": 26745, "title": "Did Ready Player One have to get licenses for the usage of all its video game characters?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: *Ready Player One* is a recent book and upcoming movie that makes heavy usage of famous (and less famous) characters from video games (also movies and shows).

The correct answer, D, is the safest strategy to avoid legal issues. \n\nThe explanation from the documentation indicates that while the book might have gotten away with mentioning characters under fair use, the movie almost certainly had to obtain licenses for visual representations.

When I was supported by a social agency in Germany every time I wanted them (the agency) to reimburse my travel expanses, I had to hand in a written statement of the company that interviewed me, that they are not reimbursing any expanses I had. If they were legally required to, this whole process would be a farce. The only reason why most company's do it anyways, is cause they can hand in this reimbursement for their taxes. But they don't have to. \u2013 Zaibis\n\n> @Zaibis \u00a7670 BGB clearly states that they are required to if they invite you for an interview, even if you do not get or accept any job offer \u2013 Nacorid\n\n> Unless they clearly communicated, in writing for their safety, before the interview took place, that they are not going to reimburse travelexpenses \u2013 Nacorid\n\n> @Nacorid: But can we actually consider an job interview being a contract?

That would mean, I got last year by at least 5 company's a written statement in which they confirmed, they don't respect German law. That sounds weird to me. \u2013 Zaibis\n\n> @Zaibis That is because it is perfectly legal to declare beforehand that there will be no reimbursement and there might also be legal intricacies about \u201cArbeitslose\u201d which I am not aware of \u2013 Nacorid\n\n> @Nacorid I didnt say it was beforehand: The process was in at least 5 cases as following: I got an invite for an interview after applying (no mentioning of travel expanses) I accepted, informed the agency about the invite by forwarding the email. I had the interview, asked the agency for reimbursment and they asked me to provide a written statement by the company that they are not gonna reimburse me.

I am gonna ask about this tomorrow on lawSE :) \u2013 Zaibis\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What \u00a7670 BGB basically says is that the default is that companies have to reimburse you for expenses that you incurred for interviewing with them. If they don't want to reimburse you, they have to tell you so in writing before you incur any costs. That way it's your decision if you still want to go if you have to pay for expenses yourself.\n\nIt does *not* mean your expenses have to be paid, it means you should *know beforehand* whether they *will* be paid.\n\nSo what I take from your story is that you never actually asked the company for reimbursement, expecting the Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit to pay that for you. Well, no company is going to pay your expenses *if you don't ask for it*. And that's not a crime. You also never *told* the Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit that you were not informed beforehand that your expenses would not be paid. They asked for proof, you delivered proof. It's not their job to find out how or when you got handed this written statement and if that constitutes a violation of \u00a7670\\. \n\nAnd as a little reality check: paying your expenses (probably something along the lines of a cab fare or bus ticket?) is way more cost effective for the AA than suing a small company for the same amount.

This may or may not be copyright infringement. This is important to YouTube channel operators because the [YouTube TOS](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms) states:\n\n> ... the Content you submit must not include third\\-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) **unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so**. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.\n\nYoutube \\[Copyright Policy]([https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/copyright/]](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/copyright/%5D) states:\n\n> Creators should only upload videos that they have made or that they're authorized to use. That means they should not upload videos they didn't make, or use content in their videos that someone else owns the copyright to, such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programs, or videos made by other users, without necessary authorizations.\n\nYoutubne's [Fair Use policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9783148?hl=en) states:\n\n> Different countries have different rules about when it\u2019s OK to use material without the copyright owner\u2019s permission. For example, in the United States, works of commentary, criticism, research, teaching, or news reporting may be considered fair use. Some other countries have a similar concept called fair dealing that may work differently.\n> \n> \n> Courts look over potential fair use cases according to the facts of each specific case. **You\u2019ll probably want to get legal advice from an expert before uploading videos that contain copyright\\-protected material.**\n\nThere are several possibilities.\n\n1. All the other videos (source videos) have been released under a permissive license whch permits reuse, and the new video complies with any conditions specified in the license or licenses. (Such conditions probably include giving attribution, that is proper credit, to the source videos. This usually means displaying the author and title, as well as providign a link to the source.)\n\nIf this is true, the use is not copyright infringement. If this is true of only **some** source vids, the new vid will not be an infringement of those vids.\n2. If all the source videos are in the public domain. This is somewhat unlikely, but possible if they are copies of films from sufficiently long ago that their copyrights expired. Also, works created by an officer or employee of the US Federal Government in the course of that person's official duties are generally in the public domain (although not if the work was created by a contractor rather than an employee. For example, many NASA vids are in the public domain.\n\nIf **this** is true, the use is not copyright infringement. Again, if this is true of only **some** source vids, the new vid will not be an infringement of those vids. No attribution is legally required for public domain vids.\n3. If the creator of the new vid has asked for and received permission from the copyright owners of all source videos, and has complied with any conditions of those permissions. This may involve paying a fee to the source owners, and is very likely to involve proper attribution, but each owner can set whatever conditions that owner pleases.\n\nIf **this** is true, the use is not copyright infringement. Again, if this is true of only **some** source vids, the new vid will not be an infringement of those vids. However, all conditions must be carefully com,plied with.\n4. If the creator of the new video is located in or under the jurisdiction of the US (or the copyright owner of the source is under US jurisdiction), and the creator asserts that the use is a ***Fair Use***. Fair use is an intentionally vagus concept, and it is always decided on a case\\-by\\-case basis. Whether a use is a fair use is highly fact\\-based, that is the specific facts of the individual case matter a lot. Often important is whether the use will harm the market for the sourer, and whether the use is **transformative**. A Use is \"transformative\" if it is used for a significantly different purpose than the original was. Transformative uses are more likely to be considered fair uses. See [Is this copyright infringement? Is it fair use? What if I don't make any money off it?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o) and other threads tagged [fair\\-use](/questions/tagged/fair-use \"show questions tagged 'fair-use'\") on this site for more details on fair use.\n\nA fair use is not an infringement of copyright. But the only way to be **sure** that a ise is a fair use is to be sued in US Federal Court, raise a fair use defense, and win. A copyright lawyer can often give a reasonable opinion on whether a particular use will be considered a fair use.\n\nA compilation video, using only short snippets of each source, might well be considered to be a fair use, but that cannot be guaranteed in general.\n\nYouTube follows its own policies on copyright issues, including demonatization.

Fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the purpose of use, amount used, and effect on the market for the original work.\n2. Using short clips (30 seconds) suggests a limited use of copyrighted material, which is more favorable for fair use claims.\n3.

Legal consideration is a valuable asset that is exchanged between two parties to a contract at the time of a promise or agreement.\n> \n> \n> Ordinarily, some form of consideration, either an exchange of money or a promise to refrain from some action, is required for a contract to be legally enforceable. However, in attempting to ensure justice or fairness, a court may enforce a promise even in the absence of any consideration, provided that the promise was reasonably relied on and that reliance on the promise resulted in a detriment to the promisee.\n\nIt seems pretty obvious to me that not getting back the money lent is \"a detriment to the promisee\".\n\nAre there quantitative or (lacking those) qualitative (e.g. comparative case) studies whether a zero\\-interest loan is a true disadvantage in the US court system, regarding repayment, ceteris paribus (i.e. assuming otherwise the same basic conditions are met, e.g. evidence \\[like witnesses and/or a written note] to prove that the promise to repay was made on a certain date/event or schedule)? Or is the lack of interest \\[demanded] rather irrelevant in practice, as far as trial outcomes? I'd prefer we limit the discussion to the US, but if clear\\-enough evidence (one way or the other) is only available from other common\\-law jurisdictions, I'd accept an answer based on a proxy jurisdiction.\n\nI'm not sure if this self\\-answers my Q (I would like more evidence) but LII Wex [says](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/promissory_estoppel#:%7E:text=Within%20contract%20law%2C%20promissory%20estoppel,detrimentally%20relied%20on%20the%20promise.) in broad terms that:\n\n> An agreement made by promissory estoppel will typically have the same binding effects on parties that a valid contract would.\n\n(N.B.

So I guess evidence has to be after that year...)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I've never seen that principle invoked in U.S. law. There are tax reasons not to make zero interest loans to related parties (unpaid interest at a low market rate is deemed income to the lender for income tax purposes, followed by a gift from the lender to the borrower for gift tax purposes), but no substantive contact law ones in U.S. jurisprudence.\n\nConsideration is a greatly degraded doctrine, but normally, the consideration in this transaction in a suit by a lender to enforce the contract would be obvious. The loan is made for the consideration that it must be repaid later.\n\nA promise to make an interest free loan in the future might face more consideration problems as a barrier to enforcement by someone seeking to now receive a zero rate interest loan from the person who promised to make one without getting anything in return for that promise.\n\nIndeed, there are standard commercial terms for such arrangements that are used routinely, such as \"thirty days net\" which means paid for with an interest free loan due thirty days after the day of the invoice. Similarly, there are examples of zero interest government bonds.\n\nThis said, promissory estoppel remains good law and is often pleaded in the alternative with breach of contract in any remotely atypical basically contractual transaction. Promissory estoppel is almost identical to breach of contract but substitutes detrimental reliance on a promise for consideration.\n\n**Footnote:**\n\n> (N.B.

The First Restatement relied on prior caselaw to make its points, so the statement isn't truly accurate (and the Restatements aren't binding sources of law, there is nothing \"formal\" about it unlike the adoption of a statute or a precedent setting case decision, the Restatements are just a persuasive source of common law principles), but the First Restatement of Contracts certainly made Promissory Estoppel much more widely known and accepted in U.S. law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner, Sarah, verbally agrees to lend her friend John $10,000 for his startup, with no interest specified and no formal contract signed.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Contrary to the initial premise in the documentation, the lack of a specified interest rate does not inherently invalidate the loan as a contract in U.S. law. As stated in the top answer, \"Consideration is a greatly degraded doctrine, but normally, the consideration in this transaction in a suit by a lender to enforce the contract would be obvious.

The agreement between Sarah and John, even though verbal, contains the essential elements of a contract: offer, acceptance, and consideration (the loan itself and the promise to repay).\n\n3. While promissory estoppel is a valid legal concept, it's not the only or primary basis for Sarah's case. As mentioned in the answer, \"promissory estoppel remains good law and is often pleaded in the alternative with breach of contract in any remotely atypical basically contractual transaction.\"\n\n4. Option C is the most comprehensive and accurate approach. It recognizes that Sarah can pursue a breach of contract claim as her primary argument, with promissory estoppel as a backup strategy. This aligns with the common legal practice of pleading alternative theories in case one fails.\n\n5.

It seems like the TOS is a contract, and it would specifically need to say in the contract that enforcement is at the company's discretion. Does Facebook have such a clause? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, and yes\n-----------\n\n**The No part**\n\nA right is not an obligation: having the right to free speech does not mean that you have to speak freely for example.\n\nA contract (including ToS) grants rights and obligations on each party. In general these are complementary, one party's right is the other party's obligation: the citizen's right to not be unlawfully detained imposes an obligation on the state not to unlawfully detain its citizens, for example.\n\nEnforcement of a contract (either through internal processes like moderation of content, or externally through courts and tribunals) implies that there is a breach of an obligation by one party and a consequent infringement of a right belonging to the other. The choice to seek enforcement is *entirely* at the discretion of the person whose right was violated \\- if they choose not to enforce their right then this is a [waiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiver).\n\n**The No part**\n\nWaivers happen all the time because contracts are breached in immaterial or inconsequential ways and people just move on. \n\nMany contracts contain a clause to the effect that a waiver does not amount to a permanent waiver and that they reserve their rights on future breaches. This is important because a contract is more than the written agreement; it involves the entire conduct of the parties. Without such a clause in say a lease contract, a lessor who has waived their right to terminate the lease for late payment of the rent in the past may be barred from executing that right in the future.\n\nSimilarly, where a company has the same contract with many parties: their behaviour in dealing with the same breach by Party A, B, C \\& D may be relevant in how they deal with that breach by Party E. If they are not consistent, and the inconsistency is arbitrary, malicious or unlawfully discriminatory, then they can be in trouble.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that companies can have inconsistent enforcement if there's \"a reasonable use of discretion.\"\n2. SocialConnect's behavior shows they are enforcing major violations (racial slurs) while possibly exercising discretion on more subtle cases.\n3. The key is that the inconsistency must not be \"arbitrary, malicious or unlawfully discriminatory.\"\n4. If SocialConnect can provide a reasonable explanation for their moderation choices (e.g., prioritizing more severe violations), they are likely to prevail.\n\nOption A is incorrect because having the right to enforce doesn't create an obligation to enforce in every instance. Option B goes too far by suggesting \"complete discretion,\" which isn't supported by the documentation.

However, any simple contract may potentially have ambiguities that would make it difficult or impossible to decide if the contract is being fulfilled. For example, if I make a contract for someone to fix my car, I should actually specify what exactly needs fixing and what would constitute being fixed. Otherwise the person could just top off the oil and call it a day.\n\nPresumably at some point, common sense is exercised to decide if some unexpected development follows this spirit and intent of the contract or not. After all, it's difficult if not impossible to state anything with perfect disambiguity. But [some contract authors still try](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement#Criticism). Since EULAs are probably written by some pretty good lawyers, does that mean that such overly detailed documents can be considered the standard of a very good contract? What *is* a reasonable standard for how much a contract should specify, and how much should be left to \"well, let's just hope we can all come to some agreement if and when that weird freak case happens\".\n\nWhen contract lawyers write a contract, how do they decide when it's \"detailed enough\"? Are there rules of thumb that a lay person could use?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary ideology in legal writing is \"use what has worked\". This is a millenium\\-old practice in the common law tradition (predating the development of what is known as \"the common law\"). This explains the substantial similarity between legal documents, and is responsible for the rise of \"legalese\" \u2013 legal writers do not start from scratch. If a given contract form works for one case, it's reasonable to expect that it will work for analogous cases (where \"works\" means \"has the expected outcome in case of legal dispute\"). Rental agreements are exemplars of recycling of contracts which has worked before.\n\nA recycled contract can fail for two main (and related) reasons. First, the legislature may change the law \u2013 for some political reason, it may be decided to forbid a certain condition in a tenancy agreement. Second, appeals courts may \"discover\" that a condition really has a different effect that was assumed (e.g. which words does \"knowingly\" refer to). This can motivate post hoc or preemptive rewriting of contract templates (where the lawyer sees a risk in using the old language but where the courts have not definitively handed down a ruling).\n\nThere are various [principles of legal interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation) which influence legal writing, generally summarized in a Latin expression such as Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius, meaning \"the mention of one thing is the exclusion of others\". The practical effect of that canon of interpretation is, the more explicit your list, the less likely a novel situation will be already covered. For instance, if your present a contract that forbids passengers from \"possessing weapons\" on the boat, you haven't defined \"weapon\", so that is left to common sense. If you define \"weapon\" as \"pistol, rifle, shotgun, explosive, poison gas, knife, flame thrower, sword, bayonet, brass knuckles, nunchuck\", you run a risk that your list failed to include death\\-ray (a new technology). The risk is that in adjudicating the contract, the court will decide (invoking *contra proferentem*) that as the author of the contract you did not intend to exclude the death ray, because you could have included it in your list but did not. (It's not guaranteed that the court will exclude a death ray, but there is a risk). In other words, too much explicitness can work against you, in case there is some slightly different scenario that you did not anticipate.\n\nThere is a distinction between an actual ambiguity which is a property of language, and vagueness. A clause that says \"drive a car or truck owned by a competitor\" can be interpreted by the rule of English as meaning \"drive a car owned by a competitor or a truck owned by a competitor\", or \"drive any car, or else a truck which is owned by a competitor\" \u2013 this is a linguistic ambiguity.

Which approach is most likely to provide the best balance between protecting the company's interests and maintaining legal enforceability?\n\nA) Include an exhaustive list of all possible uses and misuses of the software to cover every conceivable scenario\nB) Use broad, general terms to describe prohibited actions, relying on common sense interpretation\nC) Combine specific examples of prohibited actions with broader catch-all clauses, while avoiding overly restrictive language\nD) Focus primarily on technical specifications and performance guarantees, leaving user behavior largely unaddressed\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation, addressing the challenge of balancing specificity and flexibility in contract writing. The correct answer, C, reflects the best practice described in the documentation.\n\nOption A, while seemingly thorough, could actually weaken the contract's enforceability due to the principle of \"Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius.\" As explained in the documentation, an overly explicit list risks excluding unforeseen scenarios, potentially limiting the contract's scope.\n\nOption B goes too far in the opposite direction. While it avoids the pitfalls of over-specification, it may leave too much open to interpretation, potentially creating ambiguities that could be exploited.\n\nOption D fails to address a key aspect of EULAs, which is regulating user behavior and protecting the company's interests beyond mere technical specifications.\n\nThe correct approach, C, balances specificity with flexibility. By combining specific examples with broader clauses, it provides clear guidance on prohibited actions while maintaining the flexibility to cover unforeseen scenarios. This approach aligns with the documentation's advice on avoiding linguistic ambiguity while not over-defining terms to the point of exclusion. It also reflects the legal writing principle of \"use what has worked,\" allowing for the incorporation of established, effective contract language alongside more specific clauses tailored to the software product.\n\nThis approach requires critical thinking about potential scenarios and misconceptions, integrating multiple concepts from contract law, and applying them to a real-world situation in software licensing."}, "97": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33809/can-you-text-a-business-sole-trader-promotional-material-if-they-put-their-numbe", "docs_id": 33809, "title": "Can you text a business/sole trader promotional material if they put their number online?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: eg.

Additionally, the initial email doesn't establish a sale or negotiations for a sale, which is necessary for the soft opt-in exception.\n\nOption D is correct because it satisfies the conditions for the soft opt-in exception: the company has obtained contact details through a previous sale, they are marketing their own similar products, and the customers haven't opted out of marketing communications.

While most states define a knife as a weapon by edge length, I can not find any legal definition of what constitutes an edge or what constitutes a knife as a weapon in regards to school zones.\n\nMany things that some people may call a knife are not weapons at all such as palette knives, butter knives, oyster knives, etc. Palette knives are even required school supplies for many schools that have an art program.\n\nThen there are things that look like knives, like nail files, letter openers, etc., which are not called knives, have no cutting edge, but which I've heard of people getting in trouble for purely on the grounds that they \"look like knives\".\n\nThere are also many tools that have an edge sharp enough to potentially cut or stab but not things that people would call a knife, like keys, chisels, box openers, saws, screwdrivers, etc. Many of these tools are allowed on school property by maintenance personnel and are required class materials in certain courses like wood\\-working, and keys are literally carried by everyone who drives into or through a school zone.\n\nThen there are also \"blunted weapons\". \"Wall\\-hangers\" are decorative swords, daggers, etc. that look like they could be real weapons, but are blunted for safety, and so have no effective cutting or stabbing edges. Similarly, a fencing rapier also looks like a full length sword, but has been blunted and is required equipment on school campuses that have fencing teams.\n\nOn top of all of this, a handful of states, such as Louisiana, don't even have edge length restrictions that differentiate a short\\-bladed \"tool\" from a long bladed \"weapon\".\n\nSo the question is: with all the ambiguity and exceptions, are there any rulings in place that would allow a reasonable person of at least average intelligence to determine what constitutes the crime, and if not, could knife restrictions in school zones be considered [void for vagueness](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=2228) under the 14th Amendment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: School administrators have the right to try to express the law in seemingly simpler language, but they do not have the right to enforce their misstatements of the law. [The law of Louisiana](https://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=78741) does not refer to knives at all\n\n> Carrying a firearm, or dangerous weapon as defined in [R.S. 14:2](https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78337),\n> by a student or nonstudent on school property, at a school sponsored\n> function, or in a firearm\\-free zone is unlawful...\n\n\"Dangerous weapon\" is defined so that it \"includes any gas, liquid or other substance or instrumentality, which, in the manner used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm\". The law does not exhaustively list the things that count as firearms or dangerous weapons, so every individual is held responsible for knowing what the courts have held to constitute \"dangerous weapons\". A novice interpretation (not relying on case law) might lead to the conclusion that a speargun is not a \"dangerous weapon\" (perhaps on the theory that it is used underwater to spear fish), but a reasonable interpretation of \"dangerous weapon\" suggests that it is a dangerous weapon because it can be used to kill a person. The same is true of a pencil, as well as a dog.\n\nYou can turn to [this article](https://www.animallaw.info/article/jaws-bite-claws-snatch) for an example of the dangerous weapon status of a dog, a propos [Louisiana v. Michels](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-michels-1), where defendant was \"armed with a dangerous weapon\". That court recited previous case law to the effect that\n\n> \"the dangerousness of the instrumentality because of its use is a\n> factual question for the jury\" State v. Munoz, 575 So.2d 848, 850\n\nRX 14:3 also states that\n\n> The articles of this Code cannot be extended by analogy so as to\n> create crimes not provided for herein; however, in order to promote\n> justice and to effect the objects of the law, all of its provisions\n> shall be given a genuine construction, according to the fair import of\n> their words, taken in their usual sense, in connection with the\n> context, and with reference to the purpose of the provision\n\nwhich means that if faced with a novel application (dog, pencil, or speargun), the jury can decide based on \"context and purpose\", not just narrow words. The article points to a law review article by a lawyer involved in the 1942 codification of Louisiana criminal law that \"the code was to be read as a civilian document, not a mere compilation of common law rules\", thus the code is shorter and uses plain language.\n\nThe article then reviews a number of previous rulings on the scope of \"dangerous weapon\", starting with [Louisiana v. Calvin](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-calvin-4) where it was ruled that teeth and fists are not dangerous weapons, even though you can kill a person with your fists. It therefore turns out that a \"dangerous weapon\" must be an inanimate object, under Louisiana law.\n\nA knife *can* be found to be a dangerous weapon, as reported in [this opinion](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/12/12-41425-CR0.pdf) (deportation dependent on a prior criminal conviction for felony aggravated battery, specifically referring to R.S. 14\\.2(3\\) and deeming a knife to be a dangerous weapon). Since that conviction is no being appealed at the state level, details of the knife\\-usage are omitted, so all we know is that a knife was used.\n\nInsofar as box cutters were the essential weapons that brought about the airplane hijackings on 9/11, it is not unreasonable to at least consider that they are within the scope of \"dangerous weapon\" (I would not, but that's a matter for the jury). A butter knife or especially a pencil cannot reasonably be deemed to be \"dangerous weapons\". But there doesn't seem to be any case law specifically addressing these objects. If a pencil were actually used as a weapon, perhaps the jury might find that a pencil (so used) was a dangerous weapon. However, the question is about a law forbidding the mere possession of a dangerous weapon, eliminating how it was actually used from the calculation.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that I would get arrested for driving past a school with a screwdriver in my car.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A high school student is charged with possessing a \"dangerous weapon\" in a school zone after bringing a decorative wall-hanging sword to school for a history presentation.

Given the information provided about Louisiana law and related case precedents, what is the most likely legal outcome if this case goes to trial?\n\nA) The student will be automatically convicted because any blade-like object is considered a dangerous weapon in a school zone.\nB) The case will likely be dismissed as void for vagueness, as the law doesn't specifically define what constitutes a dangerous weapon.\nC) The jury will determine if the blunted sword qualifies as a dangerous weapon based on how it could potentially be used in context.\nD) The student will be acquitted because decorative, blunted objects are explicitly exempted from dangerous weapon classifications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the provided documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Louisiana law (R.S. 14:2) defines a dangerous weapon broadly as any instrumentality which, \"in the manner used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm.\"\n\n2. The law doesn't exhaustively list what constitutes a dangerous weapon, leaving interpretation to the courts and juries.\n\n3. As stated in State v.

While the sword is blunted, its potential use and context (in a school zone) would be considered by the jury.\n\n6. The jury would need to determine if a blunted decorative sword could reasonably be \"calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm\" in the given context.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law doesn't automatically classify all blade-like objects as dangerous weapons. Option B is unlikely because the law provides guidelines for interpretation, even if not exhaustively defined.
