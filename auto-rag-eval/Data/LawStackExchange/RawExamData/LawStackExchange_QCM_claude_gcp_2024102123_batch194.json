            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can a landlord legally spy on their tentants?\nOr Have Neighbors constantly spy for landlord\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This hinges on what you mean by \"spy\".\n\nGenerally, a landlord cannot enter a leased or rented property\\* without the tenant's consent, nor can their agents. (They can arrive and ask to enter, as can your neighbors whether or not you own your home, but you are not required to acquiesce in either case).\n\nA landlord can view the publicly viewable portions of the property at their leisure, as can their agents, or any member of the public for that matter. \n\nA landlord could possibly be notified of a tenant's actions in a number of ways: such as viewing the public portions of the property, being notified (or billed) by utilities or public agencies, or receiving complaints from the neighbors.\n\nA neighbor has no more, and no less, legal ability to spy on you if you owned your home vs if you rent your home. So, they would have no more right to, say, spy at your house with a telescope than if you owned the property yourself, but no less right to complain if you have a loud (or audible) party or a large number of guests; the only difference being they can complain to someone who could potentially do much more than they could if you owned the property yourself.\n\nThus, the answer to your question depends on what is meant by \"spying\".\n\n\\*This assumes that this is a separate property; a landlord who rents out a room in their own home often has far greater rights.",

Which of the following actions would be legally permissible for the landlord to take?\n\nA) Install hidden cameras inside the tenant's apartment without their knowledge\nB) Enter the tenant's apartment without notice while they are away to search for evidence\nC) Ask neighbors to report any suspicious activities they observe from outside the apartment\nD) Use a telescope to look into the tenant's windows from a nearby building\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) Installing hidden cameras inside a tenant's apartment without their knowledge is a severe violation of privacy and illegal.\n\nB) Entering a tenant's apartment without notice or consent is generally illegal, except in specific emergency situations outlined in the lease or local laws.\n\nC) This is the correct answer. Landlords can receive complaints or reports from neighbors about publicly observable activities. Neighbors have the same right to report issues whether the property is rented or owned.\n\nD) Using a telescope to look into someone's windows, regardless of whether they're a tenant or homeowner, is an invasion of privacy and likely illegal.\n\nThe key principle is that landlords cannot infringe on a tenant's right to privacy within their rented space, but they can act on information that is publicly observable or voluntarily reported by others."

When talking about where individuals can stay during quarantine, [it says](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/03/quarantine_guidance_0.pdf):\n\n> Separate quarters with separate bathroom facilities for each individual or family group. Access to a sink with soap and water, and paper towels is needed.\n\nHow is \"family\" defined in this situation?

Or can you share quarters with anyone who is part of your actual family?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no definition, and no legal basis for assuming a particular interpretation. Therefore, the term has its \"ordinary meaning\". A family group is what an ordinary reasonable person would consider to be a family group.

According to the information provided, there is no specific legal definition for \"family group\" in the context of New York's quarantine requirements. In the absence of a clear definition, the term would be interpreted based on its \"ordinary meaning\" - what a reasonable person would consider to be a family group. This leaves room for interpretation and could potentially include extended family members, depending on the specific circumstances.

The rental agreement states that \"Termination is permitted no later than the third working day of a calendar month following the end of the month after next.\" If the student wishes to move out on June 30th, by which date must they inform the landlord at the latest?\n\nA) March 3rd\nB) April 3rd\nC) May 3rd\nD) June 3rd\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"the third working day of a calendar month following the end of the month after next\" means that the notice must be given approximately three months in advance. To move out at the end of June, the student needs to give notice in April. Specifically:\n\n- The \"month after next\" from June is April\n- The notice must be given by the third working day of the month following April, which is May\n- Therefore, the latest date to give notice would be the third working day of May, which is typically May 3rd (assuming it's not a weekend or holiday)\n\nHowever, the question asks for the latest date by which the student must inform the landlord. To ensure compliance with the contract terms, the student should give notice by April 3rd, which is option B. This provides a full three-month notice period and meets the requirement of informing the landlord before the third working day of May."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am looking to get into the business of dropservicing \\- finding a white label provider of certain services and then re\\-selling those services to retail customers. For myself, I'm sticking to traditional IT services and digital marketing. However, I was talking to a friend and he's not at all into technology (that's why I'm asking this question for him here, aside from my own curiosity). After I told him what I was doing, he was thinking of doing a similar business with bookkeeping and general legal services. We found some white label providers of these services (US\\-based), but he was concerned about legal issues since those are regulated industries.\n\nMy question is: is this sort of arbitrage legal for those kinds of industries?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Both law and accounting are subject to state regulation, so, at a minimum, work done remotely by non\\-licensed persons must be reviewed substantively and blessed by a local admitted professional before being shared with a client, and there are limits on what contacts with the client the back office can have.\n\nIn a legal context, the back office is limited to what a paralegal can do, and that varies considerably from one U.S. state to another, especially with respect to real property matters.\n\nMere \"book keeping\" as opposed to accounting is rarely a regulated profession under state law, but as in the case of legal services, the distinction between accounting that requires a license and activities that do not require a license varies from state to state (although less dramatically).\n\nThe notion of selling \"forms\" is well recognized, but what crosses over the line from selling a \"form\" to selling legal or accounting advice varies and can be treacherous.\n\nI don't know off hand if this is true for accountants in most states, but in most U.S. states non\\-lawyers are prohibited from having an equity or profits based interest in a law firm, and referral fee compensation is also subject to significant professional ethics regulation. Non\\-competition clauses involving lawyers are also subject to heavy professional ethics regulations not common to non\\-legal professional activities.\n\nWithout a more concrete example of what the dropservicing business model would entail, it is impossible to do a very definitive analysis. Your model seems to be based upon obtaining services from a third\\-party and re\\-selling those services. For the most part, that isn't a workable business model from a regulatory perspective in the U.S. Instead, you need licensed \"white label\" providers as the face of the business and you may potentially provide services behind them in the back office.\n\nThere are some services along this line currently in existence with varied business models involving somewhat similar concepts:\n\n* Legal forms companies like the recently succeeded [Bradford Publishing](https://cle.cobar.org/BradfordPublishingRelease).\n* [Hyatt Legal Services Plans](https://www.bbb.org/us/oh/cleveland/profile/legal-services/hyatt-legal-plans-0312-16002631/complaints)\n* Private legal services insurance such as [Legal Shield](https://www.legalshield.com/business-plan/get-legal-help-now?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=G_LS_US_SMB_Search_Non-Brand&utm_term=contract%20attorney&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6575BRCQARIsAMp-ksONPbKuZwehsd-XOD4b_pgPSB1Vk3gW05it6IgWJLAT4fki6Xbybx8aAqQYEALw_wcB).\n* [H\\&R Block](https://www.hrblock.com/) and also tax services.\n* The legal services provided by the [JAG Corps](https://www.goarmy.com/jag.html) to military service members.\n* [Nolo.com](https://www.nolo.com/)\n* Union sponsored legal services plans such as [Union Plus](https://www.unionplus.org/benefits/home/legal-help).\n* Title insurance companies such as [First American Title](https://www.firstam.com/) and related transaction execution companies.\n* The legal defense provided incident to a liability insurance policy by companies such as [Allstate](https://www.allstate.com/landingpages/lsp/auto-brand-general-desktop.html?CMP=KNC-T1-NA-DSK-GG-AU-MISC-B-070805-200515:allstate&TFN=&CAMPAIGN=444490000070805&affcode=p10430065301&ds_rl=1261774&s_kwcid=AL!9024!3!101473088408!e!!g!!allstate&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6575BRCQARIsAMp-ksMop9TAgLl19b9qP07uHnq4zVzjs2uDavRsOVi4d_khHyVl6qdq90kaAsZUEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).\n* Governmental shared risk pools such as [CIRSA](https://www.cirsa.org/).\n* Donation driven non\\-profits such as [the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/give/fund-every-fight-ahead?cid=7014A000001Zs9uQAC&initms_aff=nat&initms_chan=sem&utm_medium=sem&initms=200114_evergreenun_sem-402136072447-85034109043-aclu%20national-b_segmenta_ggl&utm_source=ggl&utm_campaign=evergreenun&utm_content=200114_sem-402136072447-85034109043-aclu%20national-b_segmenta&ms_aff=nat&ms_chan=sem&ms=200114_evergreenun_sem-402136072447-85034109043-aclu%20national-b_segmenta_ggl&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6575BRCQARIsAMp-ksOAvU4sb4pLf_ZYFsLxpkOUKCIEWJ-5DlUwiy2ThfgtWJfDdtbDDccaAqsEEALw_wcB&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6575BRCQARIsAMp-ksOAvU4sb4pLf_ZYFsLxpkOUKCIEWJ-5DlUwiy2ThfgtWJfDdtbDDccaAqsEEALw_wcB).\n* The [Ann Arbor Tenants Union](https://www.facebook.com/a2tenantsunion/).\n* Temp agencies providing paralegals to companies such as [this one](https://national.hireanesquire.com/freelance-paralegals/?kw=%2Btemp%20%2Bparalegal&cpn=1938616217&utm_term=%2Btemp%20%2Bparalegal&utm_campaign=Freelance%20paralegal&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_tgt=kwd-535810181190&hsa_grp=70181947909&hsa_src=g&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_mt=b&hsa_ver=3&hsa_ad=414275841311&hsa_acc=7490703806&hsa_kw=%2Btemp%20%2Bparalegal&hsa_cam=1938616217&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6575BRCQARIsAMp-ksM1RFiSA3ilecmAa1MAEh0XbtVtKlX59HcNuPNjE7VA2LduHk7l5JYaAp-gEALw_wcB).

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It seems that the laws around the safekeeping of certain US government and national security information are described by President Obama's Executive Order 13526\\. These make clear that the ultimate power to declassify documents rests with the executive.\n\nTopically, President Trump appears to be referring to this fact to justify being in possession of \"documents with classification markings\"; that he had the authority to declassify such during his Presidency and hence the documents are hence no longer subject to the protections demanded of classified documents. This, to a layman, seems like a (nearly) bulletproof defence.\n\nThe one exception I can see is if a future President (e.g. President Biden) unilaterally reclassify the document at a higher level, now that President Trump no longer possesses his powers of classification under the Presidential office.\n\nThis leads to two related questions:\n\n1. If the classification level of a document has been reduced \\- so exposing this to a larger audience \\- can it later be reclassified to a higher level?\n2. Can the President or delegated power capriciously classify any document in the possession of a political rival, without him or her knowing, and cause the rival to be in breach of law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The DOJ has [a handy FAQ about declassification on their site](https://www.justice.gov/archives/open/declassification/declassification-faq). There are statutory and E.O. provisions for automatic declassification of information (I think the most common one in practice is \"historically important information after 25 years\"). Though this is subject to review and may be rejected in particular situations, dictated by much the same provisions. As for reclassifying automatically declassified information, the FAQ says:\n\n> CAN INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN AUTOMATICALLY DECLASSIFIED BE RECLASSIFIED?\n\n> Yes. Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the FOIA, Presidential Records Act, 44 USC 2204(c)(1\\), the Privacy Act of 1974, or the mandatory review provisions of E.O. 13526, only if such classification or reclassification meets the requirements of E.O. 13526, and is accomplished on a document\\-by\\-document basis with the personal participation or under the direction of the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official. Information may not be reclassified after declassification and release to the public under proper authority.\n\nSimilar provisions were detailed in [E.O. 12958](https://www.archives.gov/about/laws/appendix/12958.html).\n\nA \"proper authority\" would not include, say, leaks, like those due to Snowden. Note that, as for Trump's situation, while he most surely counted as a \"proper authority\" while President, there is no indication whatsoever that the information was also released to the public under his or any other proper authority.\n\n[A recent and somewhat controversial example of reclassification began in 1999 under the Clinton administration, as a result of aforementioned E.O. 12958, and lasted for several years after](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB179/index.htm).\n\n> To justify their reclassification program, officials at CIA and military agencies have argued that during the implementation of Executive Order 12958, President Clinton's program for bulk declassification of historical federal records, many sensitive intelligence\\-related documents that remained classified were inadvertently released at NARA, especially in State Department files. Even though researchers had been combing through and copying documents from those collections for years, CIA and other agencies compelled NARA to grant them access to the open files so they could reclassify documents.\n\nA separate article from the same link provides:\n\n> ...security officials at DOE had become concerned that the implementation of EO 12958 had led to the inadvertent release in State Department and other agency records at NARA of \"unmarked\" restricted and formerly restricted data on nuclear weapons. In the fall of 1998, Congress formally authorized the Department of Energy to remove from public document repositories any and all sensitive nuclear weapons design\\-related information pursuant to Section 3161 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, entitled \"Protection Against Inadvertent Release of Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data.\"\n\nThe argument the agencies seemed to advance for this reclassification is that prior declassifications had not undergone the proper equity considerations: meaning that agencies other than the ones who declassified them had an interest and say in their classification, which should not have been overlooked. While some complained about the reclassification of information that had entered the public domain\u2014the material had been on the public shelves for years, and some of it had even been published and a good deal more of it sifted through by various parties\u2014this did not seem to matter to the agencies. Much as classified information leaked by Snowden or anyone else remains classified, the information becoming common/public knowledge does not necessarily automatically affect its classification status, or ability to be (re)classified.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A customer purchases a downloadable file containing plans for a model from an Etsy seller. The seller hasn't specified any license terms or shop policies. What is the most accurate statement regarding the customer's rights to use these plans?\n\nA) The customer has unlimited rights to use, modify, and resell the plans since no license was specified.\n\nB) The customer can only use the plans for personal use and cannot resell or distribute them without the seller's permission.\n\nC) The customer can freely redistribute the plans as long as they provide attribution to the original Etsy seller.\n\nD) The customer has full ownership of the plans and can do anything they want with them, including selling products made from the plans.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Even if the seller hasn't explicitly stated license terms, copyright law still applies by default. The customer's purchase typically grants them a limited, implied license for personal use. Without explicit permission from the seller, the customer cannot assume they have rights to resell, redistribute, or commercially exploit the plans. The safest approach is to treat the purchase as for personal use only, unless otherwise stated by the seller. Options A, C, and D assume rights that aren't automatically granted and could potentially infringe on the seller's copyright."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Here in Florida there's been a migration in the way tenants of apartments are billed water, trash, sewer, and pest control. It used to be that the local municipality billed the tenant directly for their exact usage. Now, management companies are using 3rd party billers, of which there's a marked increase in the cost of utilities.\n\nThere are two popular methods of calculating these utility costs applied by most management companies. The first is to bill for exact usage. In this case the management company receives your metered bill, pays it, and then has the tenant billed by the 3rd party which is then added to the rent payment. The second is to use an algorithm to \"share\" the cost among tenants. In these cases the algorithm varies but in all cases the tenants who use less pay for the tenants who use more (this is always included in an addendum to the rental agreement).\n\nRegardless of the method, management companies refuse to show the original bill so that the tenant can independently verify that they're being charged the correct amount. Further, many will lie and claim they have nothing to do with the charges and that it's completely controlled by the 3rd party biller.\n\nDoes the tenant have a right to see the bill and verify that the required payment is correct? What remedies might be available to the tenant in Florida should the first question prove true (and the landlord or management company refuse to provide documentation)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My guess is the answer to this question is going to be in your lease. You likely signed a lease that agreed that you would pay accept this practice and spelled out what ever rights you have to challenge the billings. My guess is they are as limited as the courts will allow in Florida. And the only way to ensure access to those records would be to get the court to compel they provide you with the records. \n\nPerusal of the [Water codes in Florida](https://www.flrules.org/gateway/ChapterHome.asp?Chapter=25-30) does not appear to directly engage this practice(I could have missed it). However it appears that there is code regulating the management of electrical limits the billing to no more than the actual costs to the customer of record(probably your real estate management company.)\n\nAccording the the [NCSL](http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/utility-submetering.aspx) (This refers to electrical service. I am assuming there is similar language used elsewhere for plumbing, or that the intent of the law is uniformity of these codes in all utility billings.\n\n> Where individual metering is not required and master metering is used\n>  in lieu thereof, reasonable apportionment methods, including\n>  submetering may be used by the customer of record or the owner of such\n>  facility solely for the purpose of allocating the cost of the\n>  electricity billed by the utility. The term \u201ccost\u201d as used herein\n>  means only those charges specifically authorized by the electric\n>  utility's tariff, including but not limited to the customer, energy,\n>  demand, fuel, conservation, capacity and environmental charges made by\n>  the electric utility plus applicable taxes and fees to the customer of\n>  record responsible for the master meter payments. The term does not\n>  include late payment charges, returned check charges, the cost of the\n>  customer\\-owned distribution system behind the master meter, the\n>  customer of record's cost of billing the individual units, and other\n>  such costs. Any fees or charges collected by a customer of record for\n>  electricity billed to the customer's account by the utility, whether\n>  based on the use of submetering or any other allocation method, shall\n>  be determined in a manner which reimburses the customer of record for\n>  no more than the customer's actual cost of electricity. Each utility\n>  shall develop a standard policy governing the provisions of\n>  submetering as provided for herein. Such policy shall be filed by each\n>  utility as part of its tariffs. The policy shall have uniform\n>  application and shall be nondiscriminatory (Fla. Administrative Code \u00a725\\-6\\.049\\).\n\nNow here is where the 3rd party comes in. The 3rd party is the one levying fees for the management on your landlord. Granted if you follow the strings ill bet you find that the billing company is owned by the same company that owns your rental management firm. So your landlord can collect no more than what it costs to provide you with the service, but part of providing the service is employing this 3rd party utility management firm.",

        "answer": "Based on the provided information, here's a multi-form question for an exam:\n\nQuestion: In Florida, a tenant is concerned about the way they are being billed for utilities by their apartment complex using a third-party billing service. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenant's rights and the legality of this practice?\n\nA) Tenants have an absolute right to see the original utility bills from the municipality, regardless of what their lease states.\n\nB) The practice of using third-party billing services for utilities is illegal in Florida and can be immediately challenged in court.\n\nC) Management companies can charge any amount they want for utilities as long as they use a third-party billing service.\n\nD) The legality and specifics of the billing practice likely depend on the terms of the lease agreement and Florida regulations, which limit charges to the actual cost of providing the service plus allowed fees.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because the documentation indicates that the tenant's rights and the specifics of the billing practice would be primarily governed by the lease agreement they signed. Additionally, Florida regulations (as mentioned in the Florida Administrative Code) stipulate that any fees charged for electricity (and likely other utilities by extension) must be based on the actual cost to the customer of record (the management company) plus allowed fees and charges. The practice of using third-party billing is not inherently illegal, but there are limitations on what can be charged. Tenants don't automatically have the right to see original bills, and management companies can't charge arbitrary amounts. The situation is more nuanced and depends on both the lease terms and state regulations."

The DVD release of this series only credits the television company as owning all elements in the show. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The television company is in violation of copyright law by not crediting all original owners of the characters.\n\nB) The original owners of the characters can sue the television company for damages due to lack of attribution.\n\nC) The television company likely has licensing agreements with the original owners that don't require attribution.\n\nD) The television company must have purchased all rights to the characters, making them the sole owner.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As stated in the documentation, attribution is not a legal requirement. Companies can license their intellectual property (IP) to others under mutually agreed terms, which may or may not include attribution requirements. In this case, the television company likely has licensing agreements with the original owners of the characters that don't necessitate public attribution. This explains why they can claim ownership of all elements in the show without crediting other companies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because lack of attribution doesn't necessarily violate copyright law if proper licensing agreements are in place.\n\nOption B is wrong because if licensing agreements don't require attribution, the original owners cannot sue for damages based on lack of attribution alone.\n\nOption D is unlikely and overly broad. While the television company might have purchased some rights, it's improbable they've acquired full ownership of all characters from various companies."

The Subtenant will avoid the assessment of any late fees or penalties.\n\nWhat exactly does this entail?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If your business doesn't pay its sales taxes or certain kinds of excise taxes, like tobacco taxes, alcohol taxes, and gasoline taxes, of property taxes on moveable business property, that can result in a tax lien being imposed on the business or even conceivably, its leasehold. If taxes or utilities for which the tenant is responsible are paid late, late fees and penalties can be imposed.\n\nThis clause of the lease prohibits the tenant from not paying its taxes or paying bills late. \n\nThe main real concern is not that the landlord will be held responsible for these things but that a business that isn't paying its taxes or isn't paying its bills on time is on the verge of going under, and the landlord wants to be able to evict the tenant at the first sniff of financial insecurity due to a late fee or an unpaid tax bill, rather than having to wait until the tenant is unable to pay the rent and is unable to pay for damages to the premises that are the tenant's responsibility.",

The clause requires the subtenant to pay various taxes and avoid late fees or penalties. This requirement acts as an early warning system for the landlord. If the subtenant fails to pay taxes or incurs late fees, it may indicate financial troubles, potentially signaling that the business is struggling or on the verge of failing. This allows the landlord to take action, such as eviction, at the first sign of financial insecurity rather than waiting until the subtenant can't pay rent or cover damages.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the clause isn't primarily about shifting property tax responsibility, which would typically be the landlord's obligation unless specifically agreed otherwise.\n\nOption B, while partially true, is not the main purpose from the landlord's perspective. The landlord is less concerned with the subtenant's legal compliance and more with protecting their own interests.\n\nOption C is related but not the primary purpose. While unpaid taxes could potentially result in liens, the clause is more about detecting financial issues early rather than specifically protecting against liens."

While the similarity in names and content focus could potentially lead to confusion, several factors reduce the risk of successful trademark infringement claims. The lack of registered trademarks for the existing blog weakens its legal position. Additionally, the geographical difference (Europe vs. US) can play a role in trademark disputes, especially for small, localized businesses.

A company can protect its processes and information as trade secrets, even if some or all of the information is available in open literature or expired patents. The key is that the specific combination of processes and knowledge that gives the company a competitive advantage is kept secret.

This protection applies regardless of whether individual components of the process are publicly available, as long as the company takes reasonable measures to keep the combined knowledge secret.

Does the right outlast the life of the original\ngrantee/holder?\n\nLooking for a [*Restatement (Third)*](https://books.google.com/books?id=T_loAxRR0XUC&lpg=PT121&vq=profits&dq=american%20law%20institute%20restatement%20third%20servitudes&hl=fr&pg=PT118#v=onepage&q&f=false) compliant answer if it's based on U.S. common law. One can assume the deed is ambiguous and therefore all the presumptions come into play except for the fact it mentions the grantee has an **exclusive** right to fish, that his intent is **sport** fishing, and that there is **no dominant land** whatsoever involved. \n\n---\n\nExpanding on the first question, whether those fishing rights include any interest whatsoever in the river bed or whether it is seen as a charge/burden on the land owner's (A) radical title is of particular interest (registration considerations may be discussed if pertinent).3\n\n**II**. Since *Restatement (First's)*, I read *profits\\-a\\-prendre* are subsumed into *easements* in the U.S.. Therefore, I would also like to know which American states still have a *noncommercial easement in gross which is assignable*, based on past precedent i.e. states which have not yet integrated *Restatement (First's)* in that respect (i.e. in so many words still have *profits \u00e0 prendre* independent of the modern easement).\n\n---\n\n1 I'm revisiting a civil law decision through the eyes of the common law. The landmark decision is [*The Matamajaw Salmon Club* v. *Duchaine, since deceased*](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1921/1921_94.html), \\[1921] UKPC 94, \\[1921] 2 AC 426, with the opinion delivered by [Viscount Haldane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Haldane,_1st_Viscount_Haldane#Contribution_to_Canadian_Constitutional_Law) for the *Judicial Committee of the Privy Council*, at that time the court of last resort for the Empire, overturning a decision from the *Supreme Court of Canada*, [\\[1919] S.C.R. 223](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/9478/index.do), on appeal from [27 Que. K.B. 196](https://books.google.com/books?hl=fr&id=j081AQAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3Ax1kdf4OyzisC&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=matamajaw), concerning *fishing rights* bought by a famous Canadian character, [Lord Mount Stephen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephen,_1st_Baron_Mount_Stephen#Salmon_fishing), Bt., GCVO. What happened is that in the first instances of the case, reference was made by the Quebec justices to the common law concept of *profits\\-\u00e0\\-prendre*. So what you end up having is a very intricate discussion about the foundations of property law and implicit comparisons between the civil and common law traditions. Perusing this material is not required in order to provide an answer.\n\n2 It is not clear whether the economic balance in the exchange plays a role in qualifying of the right someone like (B) would hold. One justice [explains](http://citoyens.soquij.qc.ca/php/decision.php?ID=F7A9615607E83E62CE8D34BADFA97FB8&page=1) Viscount Haldane's inclination to see more than a personal right arising from the fishing right in the aforementioned case, is a *consideration* motivated analysis of the exchange. The right was granted in exchange of what is assumed to be valuable land, so it must be worth more than some trinket, and therefore justifies a self\\-contained title of some similar value. (*Mc Whirter c. Cochrane*, 2008 QCCS 5643, par. 17\\). For further background on *personal servitudes* and the impact of *Matamajaw* on Quebec civil law, see also [*Club Appalaches c. P.\\-G.

From my perspective, the fish in the river is closer conceptually to that very water, than it is to crops and fruits. It is *res nullius*, the *thing nobody owns*, and as such it is *appropriation* i.e. fishing, which creates property; it is not property before that, that I know of. So can a fee simple be based on that? Plus I read that in UK common law, a [profit a prendre](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/lexispsl/property/document/393788/55KG-P261-F18C-41F9-00000-00/Profits%20a%20prendre), as opposed to an easement, can only be registered if it's in respect of something which can be owned (I quote: *eg a right to take water from a spring or pump, or the right to water cattle at a pond may be an easement but cannot be a profit a prendre. Water, when taken, is not owned by anyone; nor is it part of the soil*).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an area of law that is in flux. For example, in Colorado, where I practice, the rule has changed over the last ten to thirty years. I'll provide a traditional and modern view of each.\n\nThe intermediate view and to a lesser extent the modern view, also give more weight to individualized evidence of the intent of the parties on a case by case basis, while the traditional view would be rather indifferent to the actual intent of the parties.\n\n> How do you qualify that fishing right? Is it an easement,\n>  profits\\-\u00e0\\-prendre; is that a full fledged fee simple or a mere\n>  interest arising out of a contract?\n\nThe traditional view would be that this would be a profits\\-\u00e0\\-prendre, also known as an \"easement in gross\" which is a property interest (since it is permanent or at least indefinite). The modern view would see it as having more similarities to an easement (or more precisely to a generic \"servitude\"). This assumes, of course, that it was not merely an expressly designated or orally created \"license\" as opposed to a property right.\n\n> Is it alienable/assignable?\n\nThe traditional view is that it is not alienable or assignable. The intermediate view is that it is alienable or assignable only if it expressly so provides. The modern view is that it is alienable or assignable unless the instrument creating it expressly provides otherwise.\n\n> Does the right outlast the life of the original grantee/holder?\n\nThe traditional view is that it does not. The intermediate view is that it only does so if it expressly so provides. The modern view is that it presumptively survives the life of the original grantee/holder.\n\nThe traditional view would also terminate the right upon the death of the grantor, at least if it does not expressly provide otherwise.\n\n> Can there be apportionment of the right?\n\nThe traditional view is no. The modern view is that the right can be apportioned only if this can be done without increasing the burden that the rights holder (the dominant estate) imposes on the river owner (the servient estate) and does not expand its scope. Depending upon the way that the right is formulated, this may or may not feasible.\n\nAn exclusive right for one person to fish and an exclusive right to fish exercised by thirty people impose a very different burden on the fishery, unless the thirty people are limited to the catch that one person exclusively fishing would have reasonably accomplished.\n\n> I would also like to know which American states still have a\n>  noncommercial easement in gross which is assignable, based on past\n>  precedent i.e. states which have not yet integrated Restatement\n>  (First's) in that respect (i.e. in so many words still have profits \u00e0\n>  prendre independent of the modern easement).\n\nShort of a full fledged law review article this is pretty much impossible to answer. Based on searches of similar kinds of legal issues that I've done in the past, I would guess that 40%\\-60% of states have no clear precedents on the issue one way or the other, and another 10\\-20% of the states have some precedents but those precedents are ambiguous or are so stale that it is not obvious that they would be applied if the issue was litigated today.\n\nThe remaining states would probably be split fairly evenly between the traditional and modern rules.",

Under this view:\n\n1. The right is presumptively alienable or assignable unless the instrument creating it expressly provides otherwise. This contradicts option A.\n\n2. The right presumptively survives the life of the original grantee/holder, contrary to option B.\n\n3. While the right can potentially be apportioned, it's not without restrictions. It can only be done if it doesn't increase the burden on the servient estate or expand the scope of the right. This makes option C incorrect.\n\n4. Option D correctly summarizes the modern view's stance on alienability and the right's survival beyond the original grantee's life.\n\nThis question tests understanding of how the modern view differs from traditional approaches in interpreting these property rights, particularly in terms of transferability and duration."

Personal contact with users(for example for surveying them)\n\nThank you in advance\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends. I know that's a cop\\-out, but it really does.\n\nFirst, let me challenge you on marketing emails requiring re\\-approval: that's not the case. Data processed for the purposes of direct marketing needs a way for the user to be able to object to it, in which case you must stop, but that's not the same as required to opt\\-in again.\n\nOn to your question. IANAL(and you should consult one within your company) but a lot of your question to me seems to fall on what are the lawful basis you are using to process the data, what your privacy notice is, etc.\n\nFor example, if you are relying on \"contract\", and it is implied your customers are paying you to provide and notify them of security notices, then asking consent for this would be silly (but there are other rights you would have to be aware of)\n\nIn practice, as long as you are honestly and clearly telling users what you are doing with their data when you collect it (or soon after), giving them access when appropriate and holding it securely, you probably won't go far wrong.\n\nRemember what the UK ico says:\n\n> The GDPR sets a high standard for consent.

This is all about the 'Lawful basis' you use for processing the data. Consent is only one of several available options, and should often be avoided where possible. \n\nThe UK ICO even has a couple of blog post about this:\n[https://iconewsblog.org.uk/2017/08/16/consent\\-is\\-not\\-the\\-silver\\-bullet\\-for\\-gdpr\\-compliance/](https://iconewsblog.org.uk/2017/08/16/consent-is-not-the-silver-bullet-for-gdpr-compliance/)\n\n[https://iconewsblog.org.uk/2018/05/09/raising\\-the\\-bar\\-consent\\-under\\-the\\-gdpr/](https://iconewsblog.org.uk/2018/05/09/raising-the-bar-consent-under-the-gdpr/)\n\nQuoting from the second link:\n\n> Myth \\#9 We have to get fresh consent from all our customers to comply\n>  with the GDPR.\n> \n> \n> You do not need to automatically refresh all existing consents in\n>  preparation for the new law.

The documentation emphasizes that consent is not always necessary and may not be the best option in many cases. Other lawful bases, such as \"contract,\" may be more appropriate for certain types of communications like security notices or service outages.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because not all types of emails necessarily require explicit consent, especially if they fall under other lawful bases for data processing.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it oversimplifies the situation. While marketing emails often require careful consideration of consent, other types of emails may also need specific approval depending on the circumstances and the chosen lawful basis.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because agreeing to terms and conditions alone is not sufficient for all types of email communication.

John can appeal the judgment on the grounds that it should have never been entered due to mootness, as this is a matter of law.

In this scenario, the court made an error of law by proceeding with the case and issuing a judgment when the issue had become moot due to John vacating the premises.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the case may be moot, that doesn't prevent John from appealing the judgment itself on the grounds that it shouldn't have been entered.\n\nOption B is partially correct but too limited.

This creates a situation where both parties may be responsible for indemnification depending on the circumstances, with an additional layer of protection for the consulting company during normal operations."

The meme about under 3\\.5 inches derives from the general statute pertaining to concealed weapons, where [CO Rev Stat \u00a7 18\\-12\\-101](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2016/title-18/article-12/part-1/section-18-12-101/) defines \"knife\" as being over 3\\.5 inches long (and it is a misdemeanor to carry a concealed knife). We'll come back to this.\n\nThe applicable part of the definition of \"deadly weapon\" in the school\\-specific law is\n\n> (II) A knife, bludgeon, or any other weapon, device, instrument,\n>  material, or substance, whether animate or inanimate, that, in the\n>  manner it is used or intended to be used, is capable of producing\n>  death or serious bodily injury.\n\nThis raising a question that I encourage you not to test, whether the school deadly weapon definition excludes knives that are longer that 3\\.5 inches. The definition section for Article 12 starts by saying\n\n> (1\\) As used in this article, *unless the context otherwise requires*\n\nso that means that \"knife\" is redefined in a special way (in terms of length), and that is for the entire article which includes the school weapon section. The actual definition of \"knife\" in the definitions section of Article 12 is\n\n> (f) \"Knife\" means any dagger, dirk, knife, or stiletto with a blade\n>  over three and one\\-half inches in length, *or any other dangerous\n>  instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing, or tearing wounds*,\n>  but does not include a hunting or fishing knife carried for sports\n>  use. The issue that a knife is a hunting or fishing knife must be\n>  raised as an affirmative defense.\n\nThe modifier \"with a blade over three and one\\-half inches in length\" might be thought to refer to all of the preceding terms, or just the last one \u2013 stiletto. These is a rule of legal interpretation that a modifier should be interpreted as referring to the *last* antecedent, meaning that the length limit pertains to stilettos. The punctuation (lack of comma) supports the interpretation \"stiletto with a blade over three and one\\-half inches in length\", meaning that a knife is a knife. Whether or not a literal knife with a blade under 3\\.5 inches long constitutes a redefined knife, it certainly constitutes a \"dangerous instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing, or tearing wounds\".\n\nIn the context of a specific law restricting the possession of weapons (concealed or not) in schools, the context requires that the definition explicitly mentioned in 18\\-1\\-901(3\\)(e), which is outside Article 12, is being referred to. The reason the law was explicitly written to refer to *that* definition was so that the general definition in article 12 would be overridden.\n\nMy point is that this is a not atypical example of the problem of legal definitions, which can get rather convoluted. If someone has told you that a knife under 3\\.5\" is legally not a knife, you probably now know why they would say that, but also you should know what that's simply not true when it comes to weapons in school.\n\nI omitted one complication, which in this instance is not applicable, namely the kirpan exception. In [Singh v. Thompson](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/36/1102/562950/), 36 F.3d 1102, it was ruled that a prohibition against knives (in school), in that instance, violates the Free Exercise clause (the kirpan must be worn at all times). On the other hand, [TSA does forbid](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/may-i-keep-head-coverings-and-other-religious-cultural-or) taking a kirpan into the secure zone, a matter which has so far not been litigated.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) It's legal as long as the knife blade is under 3.5 inches in length.\nB) It's illegal regardless of the knife's size, unless specifically authorized for the class project.\nC) It's legal if the student can prove it's a hunting or fishing knife.\nD) It's always legal due to the Free Exercise clause, as established in Singh v. Thompson.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because the 3.5-inch rule applies to concealed weapons in general, not specifically to schools. In schools, any knife can be considered a deadly weapon regardless of size.\nB) is correct. Colorado law prohibits bringing any deadly weapon to school, which includes knives of any size, unless there's specific authorization for educational purposes.\nC) is incorrect. While hunting and fishing knives have some exemptions in general concealed carry laws, this doesn't apply to schools.\nD) is incorrect. The Singh v. Thompson case created a narrow exception for Sikh kirpans, not a blanket allowance for all knives in schools based on religious grounds.\n\nThe key point is that schools have stricter regulations regarding weapons, and the general concealed carry rules don't apply in this context. Any knife, regardless of size, can be considered a deadly weapon in a school setting unless specifically authorized for educational purposes."

Soon I will hire a household employee to cook meals for me in my home. \n\nPer California OSHA law the employee must be given and read a kitchen safety manual.\n\nMust I pay the employee for the time spent reading the kitchen safety manual?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Executive Summary**\n\nYes, you must pay your employee (if the person is indeed an employee) to read the manual. \n\nThis is because, (1\\) as you note in your question, reading the manual is a state OSHA required part of the job, and (2\\) hourly employees must be paid at least minimum wage for all hours they work and there is no exception for time spent reading safety manuals. \n\nFurthermore, household cooks who are employees who are paid by the hour are not exempt from the minimum wage. There is no really plausible exception to the requirement to pay a minimum hourly wage that would apply to someone who is an employee in this position. For example, this person could not plausible be classified as a salaried employee or manager in this scenario for FLSA purposes.\n\nYou could, of course, set a reasonable expectation regarding how much time should be allocated to reading the manual, so long as the expectation you set is indeed reasonable \\- five minutes would be unreasonably short, but 20 hours to memorize it would be unreasonably long.\n\n**Is The \"Employee\" An Independent Contractor?**\n\nIt is conceivable that the person you describe as an employee is really an independent contractor, rather than a employee, and hence not subject to minimum wage laws. \n\nFor example, you do not have a duty to determine that a catering company that serves many customers and is its own business providing food for you on an irregular basis, or a third\\-party restaurant that delivers either itself or through a third\\-party delivery service, is paying minimum wage or complying with work safety laws like OSHA, because they are independent contractors. \n\nBut, there is nothing in your question that suggests that this is the case. (Note that if this person is an \"employee\" and not an \"independent contractor\" that it is also important that you obtain worker's compensation and pay withholding taxes for your domestic employee; often this is done via a third\\-party payroll service.)\n\n**Applicable Law**\n\nThe [Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 as amended](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, et seq., requires you to pay every hourly employee the federal minimum wage, plus overtime if applicable, from \"Portal to Portal\" (i.e. from showing up to work until leaving work, because commuting time is not counted as work for purposes of the FLSA).\n\nHours worked is defined as follows by the FLSA at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(o), contains no exception for time spent reading a safety manual:\n\n> In determining for the purposes of sections 206 and 207 of this title\n>  the hours for which an employee is employed, there shall be excluded\n>  any time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end\n>  of each workday which was excluded from measured working time during\n>  the week involved by the express terms of or by custom or practice\n>  under a bona fide collective\\-bargaining agreement applicable to the\n>  particular employee.\n\nThis states with respect to employees in domestic service at 209 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(f):\n\n> Any employee\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) who in any workweek is employed in domestic service in a household\n>  shall be paid wages at a rate not less than the wage rate in effect\n>  under subsection (b) of this section unless such employee\u2019s\n>  compensation for such service would not because of section 209(a)(6\\)\n>  of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 409(a)(6\\)](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title02/0209.htm)constitute wages\n>  for the purposes of title II of such Act \\[42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401 et seq.],\n>  or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) who in any workweek\u2014\n> \n> \n> (A) is employed in domestic service in one or more households, and\n> \n> \n> (B) is so employed for more than 8 hours in the aggregate, shall be\n>  paid wages for such employment in such workweek at a rate not less\n>  than the wage rate in effect under subsection (b) of this section.\n\nThe referenced Section 206(b) is the currently effective federal minimum wage (currently $7\\.25 per hour). The cross\\-reference to the Social Security Act states that employment taxes paid by the employer (such as the employer part of FICA taxes) do not count towards paying the minimum wage.\n\nCalifornia has a parallel [state minimum wage of $10 in 2017](https://www.govdocs.com/california-15-statewide-minimum-wage/) which is substantially similar except in amount.",

Hourly employees must be paid at least minimum wage for all hours they work, with no exception for time spent reading safety manuals.\n3. Household cooks who are employees paid by the hour are not exempt from minimum wage requirements.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the time spent reading the manual is considered work time and must be paid.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because there's no provision for paying only half the regular rate for reading safety manuals. It must be paid at the full regular rate or at least minimum wage.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because misclassifying an employee as an independent contractor to avoid wage obligations is illegal.

This understanding came to Party B partly because, according to Party B, that is how the agreement was presented by Party A, contrary to the letter of the agreement. This understanding comes also partly from previous clients of Party A, who also considered the fixed monthly payments as flat rates that do not need settlement. These clients used the service for years, stopped using it, and never received an overview for settlement according to art.14\\.\n\nFor more than 5 years, party A ignores their obligation regarding art.14\\. and never mentions it. Party B does not try to enforce art.14, because, in their mind, such an article was never part of the agreement.\n\nIn the second half of the 6th year, Party A tries to enforce art.14, by providing an overview for settlements over the previous 2 years going backwards from the moment of submitting the overview.\n\nConsidering that:\n\n1. Party A demonstrated a history of not fulfilling their obligations according to art. 14 in relation with Party B, but also in relation with other Parties with whom it had similar agreements.\n2. Party A never mentioned article 14 from the general terms and conditions at signing.\n3. Party B never objected to Party A not fulfilling their obligations.\n\nI would argue that there was an implied in fact agreement that the advance payments are fixed flat rates for service A, because both parties met in mind and abided by this agreement through their actions, i.e. Party A never submitted an overview, and Party B always paid the advance payments in time.\n\nThis implied in fact agreement of parties goes in conflict with art.14\\. Provided that the implied in fact agreement stands legal scrutiny, and considering that meeting of minds must have happened after the signing of the written agreement, the implied in fact agreement is newer, thus supersedes art.14 of the written agreement.\n\nFor what is worth, the situation stems from a rental agreement in the Netherlands, so EU/Dutch law applies to the original case. Nevertheless for the purpose of this question, I am interested in what principles of law apply, especially from civil law, but I am also curious of an interpretation according to common law.\n\nI am not a legal expert, but I am familiar with some principles of laws. The above is a working example, but my general question is whether a clause in a written contract is valid and enforceable, if all parties took regular actions contrary to the clause for a very long time without any dispute. An analogy to the above situation would be a written agreement of parties that monthly, 10$ would be exchanged for a selfie, for a period of 20 years. Then 19 years pass and nobody ever sent a selfie, or 10$ in exchange, or took any action with respect to that agreement, but one party starts sending selfies (many years later) and asks for their rightful 10$. In my mind, that's just crazy, but then again, I'm not a lawyer. What do the experts think?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Party A has breached the contract\n---------------------------------\n\nParty A had an obligation that it did not fulfil, providing the section\\-by\\-section overview of the costs.\n\nTo the extent that Party B suffered damage from each breach, for example, because Party A owes a refund, Party B can recover that plus interest subject to any statute of limitations on actions for contract breach. To the extent that Party A suffered damage, tough \\- they don\u2019t get to benefit from their own breach.\n\nParty A might wish to argue that Party B has [waived](https://sklawyers.com.au/dictionary/waiver/) their right to adjust the payment but this would be difficult to prove. It doesn\u2019t appear that there is an explicit waiver but neither is their an implied waiver: Party A would need to show that Party B was aware of and condoned the breach in some way.\n\nYou are right that a contract can be altered after it is entered into and that such a change can be implicit rather than explicit. But that would require showing some action rather than inaction by the parties to effect a different arrangement. In practice, where one party affirms the written contract, without clear and compelling evidence that the contract has subsequently been changed, the written contract will prevail.\n\nFor an example, Yale University periodically collects the interest due on a perpetual [bond](https://news.yale.edu/2015/09/22/living-artifact-dutch-golden-age-yale-s-367-year-old-water-bond-still-pays-interest) originally issued by the Dutch water board Lekdijk Bovendams on 15 May 1624\\. Originally issued with a principal of \"1000 silver Carolus gulders of 20 Stuivers a piece\", as of 2004 the yearly interest payment to the bondholder is set at \u20ac11\\.35 (15\u20ac as of 2018 \\= 16$). According to its original terms, the bond would pay 5% interest in perpetuity, although the interest rate was reduced to 3\\.5% and then 2\\.5% during the 18th century. Providing it is physically presented to the successors of the board (the Dutch Water Authority) interest must be paid even if it has been many decades since the last payment. Of course, practically, crossing the Atlantic to collect 15\u20ac every year is not commercially viable so they do it every decade or so when someone from Yale is going there anyway and then, only for the historical value. So long as the Netherlands continues to exist as a legal entity, this obligation will continue.",

So, the fact that the contract has expired, or is even void, is irrelevant \\- the arbitration agreement stands or falls on its own. For the arbitration agreement to have expired, the expiration clause would need to be explicit that it includes the arbitration clause.\n\nThe competence\\-competence principle is that the arbitrator has the authority (competence 1\\) to decide if they are allowed to be the arbitrator (competence 2\\). So, at first instance, it is the job of the arbitrator to decide whether there is or isn't a valid arbitration agreement and, therefore, whether they can continue with the arbitration. The parties are allowed to make submissions on this but only until the statement of defence is submitted. A decision by an arbitrator that they *do* have jurisdiction is one of the few things that a court can review, but only if referred to the court within 30 days.\n\nTherefore, unless the arbitration agreement is unenforcable on its face, the court will tell the parties to follow it.",

The severability principle holds that an arbitration agreement is separate from the main contract, so the expiration of the main contract doesn't necessarily invalidate the arbitration clause.

In emergency situations, countries typically cooperate to return passengers to their point of origin. \n\nOption A is incorrect because entering Canada without proper documentation is not permitted, even in emergency situations. \n\nOption B is unlikely, as detaining passengers indefinitely would create diplomatic issues and is not standard practice for emergency landings. \n\nOption C is partially correct but oversimplified. While passengers would likely be returned to the USA, there would be some form of processing and communication between Canadian and US authorities.\n\nOption D is the most accurate, as it acknowledges the likely return to the USA and the subsequent need for US authorities to verify the passengers' identities and status, especially given the lack of documentation."

However, he will not give his name and has no identification on his person, police cannot discover his identity through their systems (fingerprinting, etc), and no one comes forward who knows him.\n\nHow would the average court system handle this case?\n\nIf it is related, how would the defendants Fifth Amendment rights apply to their decision to refuse to identify themselves? Are they within their rights to do so throughout the entirety of the proceedings, or at some point are they at risk of being in contempt?\n\nLastly, would this hypothetical unnamed defendant carry a criminal record after they served their sentence if found guilty, and their identity never discovered, and how could that be possible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are cases out there like Unnamed Petitioners v. Connors, State v. Unnamed Defendant, Williams v. Unnamed Defendant; there have been indictments of John Doe who was only identified via a DNA profile. Not knowing the actual name of a person wouldn't pose a problem per se, and it seems that when the name is not known, John or Jane Doe is generally filled in. There was in instance a year ago in the UK where rioters who refused to identify themselves, and prosecution decided to drop the case.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States criminal justice system, how would a court typically proceed if a defendant refuses to identify themselves and cannot be identified through other means?\n\nA) The case would be immediately dismissed due to lack of identification.\nB) The court would assign a temporary name like \"John Doe\" and proceed with the case.\nC) The defendant would be held in contempt of court until they reveal their identity.\nD) The prosecution would be required to drop all charges against the unidentified individual.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Based on the information provided, courts in the United States have mechanisms to deal with unidentified defendants. They typically assign a temporary name such as \"John Doe\" or \"Jane Doe\" to the defendant and proceed with the case. This approach allows the legal process to continue even when a defendant's true identity is unknown or undisclosed. \n\nOption A is incorrect because cases are not automatically dismissed due to lack of identification. The legal system has ways to accommodate unidentified defendants.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while refusing to identify oneself might cause issues, it doesn't automatically result in being held in contempt of court throughout the entire proceedings.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the prosecution is not required to drop charges simply because a defendant's identity is unknown. As evidenced by cases like \"Unnamed Petitioners v. Connors\" and \"State v. Unnamed Defendant,\" the legal system can proceed with prosecution even without knowing the defendant's true identity."

This law is related to non\\-public servant middlemen who take money from people as a reward for causing corruption.\n\nHypothetically, under this definition, could a person extracting or extorting money after the act has been done be liable under this code?\n\nFor example, someone promises to give that person undue advantage if they cause corruption. If X causes a public servant to perform a duty in corrupt ways for Y but Y doesn't compensate X for causing the public servant to do that, so X extorts money from Y, would X be liable under Section 7A?\n\nKeep in mind that this is a special law, and in general, courts interpret a law to give it the full intent of the drafters.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Based on the language of Section 7A of the Prevention of Corruption Act of India, it appears that the focus is on the act of inducing a public servant to perform a public duty improperly or dishonestly through corrupt or illegal means, with the motive of obtaining an undue advantage. The section does not explicitly mention the extraction or extortion of money after the act has been done.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the act of extorting money from Y by X after causing the public servant to perform a duty improperly or dishonestly could be considered as an attempt to obtain an undue advantage by X through illegal means. The court's interpretation of the section will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case, and the intent of the drafters of the law.\n\nIt is important to note that the Prevention of Corruption Act is a special law that is intended to combat corruption and ensure the integrity of public servants. Therefore, the court is likely to interpret the law in a manner that upholds its objectives and prevents abuse of power. If the court finds that X's actions fall under the scope of Section 7A, then X could be held liable for the offense and face imprisonment and fine.",

Although the law doesn't explicitly mention extortion after the act, courts are likely to interpret the law broadly to fulfill its intent of combating corruption. The person's actions in causing the public servant to act improperly and then extorting money afterwards could be seen as an attempt to obtain an \"undue advantage\" through corrupt means.\n\nOption A is not correct because it involves legal means and a legitimate process.\nOption B, while closer to a violation, doesn't involve the actual corruption of a public servant's duties.\nOption D doesn't involve any attempt to influence a public servant's duties improperly.\n\nThe correct answer demonstrates the broadest interpretation of the law, which aligns with the notion that courts would likely interpret this special law to give it full effect in combating corruption."

A government could, for example, have been aware of the fraud in the license application but decided to ignore it because it was not a material misrepresentation under the circumstances.\n\nOn the the other hand, if the lease expressly requires that the tenant not engage in illegal conduct, or requires that the tenant have a particular kind of license, and the tenant does not, in fact, have such a license, but defrauds the landlord into thinking that the tenant has such a license using a fabricated document purporting to be a license, the landlord would usually have the right to evict the tenant as presenting a fabricated document to comply with a lease term would usually constitute a breach of the lease.",

Just hypothetically.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Saudi Arabia, the ISP ([CITC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_and_Information_Technology_Commission_(Saudi_Arabia))) blocks access to prohibited sites. If some website is deemed *haram*, you can't get to it. CITC is not omniscient, so it is possible that a site which could be forbidden, and eventually is forbidden, is not at some point forbidden.\n\nThere are [various laws](https://www.lw.com/presentations/Data-Protection-in-the-Kingdom-of-Saudi-Arabia) against hacking and requirements to safeguard information, and the [Telecommunications Act](http://www.citc.gov.sa/en/RulesandSystems/CITCSystem/Documents/LA%20_001_E_%20Telecom%20Act%20English.pdf) in Chapter 10 enumerates various forbidden acts (providing unlicensed internet access etc), and prohibits (18\\) \n\n> Other than in the course of duty, intentional disclosure of any\n>  information or contents of any message, which has been intercepted in\n>  the course of its transmission\n\nI will not attempt to interpret that: I believe that it means that it is illegal to intercept a message except if officially required to.

In other words, there is nothing that would prohibit the ISP from handing over \"who touched this site\" information to the mutawwi\\`. There is also, from what I can tell, no law requiring them to *retain* such information. CITC makes a lot of information available online [here](http://www.citc.gov.sa/en/Pages/default.aspx).

For instance, if you wanted it to make a doctor's appointment for you it would need to be able to call out and have the conversation with the receptionist that does scheduling. \n\nIn order to do that it would need to process the audio, transcribe it, and then store the response so that you could put it in your calendar. My question is does this break laws about recording phone conversations? \n\nThe fine details:\n\n* Audio is not stored\n* Phone numbers are not publicly listed\n* Contents of the conversation does not contain personal information or personally identifiable information from the recipient of the call\n* Transcriptions are not made public\n\nLet's just assume for a second that the technology was there so that Siri could make your doctor's appointments for you. Would the technical process behind it breach any laws?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Recording phone calls is generally governed by wiretapping law such as [18 USC 2511](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511). The law starts by addressing the proscribed act, which is if one (I'll get to \"one\" below, which is the crux of the matter)\n\n> intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any\n>  other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or\n>  electronic communication\n\nThe [definition of \"intercept\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2510) is\n\n> the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire,\n>  electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic,\n>  mechanical, or other device.\n\nA robo\\-call is send\\-only, so that action does not acquire anything. Then the question is whether Jarvis is a \"device\". There is a specific exemption from the definition of \"electronic, mechanical, or other device\":\n\n> (b) a hearing aid or similar device being used to correct subnormal\n>  hearing to not better than normal\n\nJarvis is not covered by (b). Part (a) exempts\n\n> any telephone or telegraph instrument...furnished to the\n>  subscriber...being used by the subscriber...in the ordinary course of\n>  its business... or (ii) being used by a provider of wire or electronic communication service\n\nwhich we can assume is not the case with Jarvis (the provider does not supply the device): Jarvis is a device, and Jarvis intercepts.\n\nOne way that such interception can legally be accomplished is via consent. At the federal level, it is sufficient that one party consents, though in some states, such as Washington, all parties must consent. Assume that only the federal law is relevant. The law regarding consent says\n\n> (d) It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for *a person* not\n>  acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic\n>  communication where such person is a party to the communication or\n>  where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent\n>  to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the\n>  purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the\n>  Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State.\n\nA program is not a person, so a program cannot consent. However, if we go to the very top of the law, the prohibition starts:\n\n> Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any *person*\n>  who...\n\nA program cannot violate the law (laws apply to people), at the moment.\n\nIf a program is deemed to be a legal person (either statutorily or by Supreme Court ruling), this all changes, but then Jarvis would have the capacity to consent (unless a program is deemed to be a person incapable of consent, but that would be silly because criminal law is predicated on the assumption that the actor \"consented\" to do the act). There is currently no statute which criminalizes creating and using Jarvis to make phone calls (imposes a limit on Jarvis's owner).",

The law states that \"any person who...\" intentionally intercepts communications may be in violation. However, as explained in the text, \"A program is not a person, so a program cannot consent\" and more importantly, \"A program cannot violate the law (laws apply to people), at the moment.\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because the AI itself cannot violate the law as it's not considered a person. \nOption B is incorrect because while the user may consent, the AI itself is not capable of obtaining or acting on consent under current law. \nOption D is incorrect because it assumes the AI needs to follow consent rules, which it currently doesn't as it's not a \"person\" under the law.\n\nOption C is correct because it accurately reflects the current legal status of AI and programs under wiretapping laws - they are not considered persons and therefore cannot violate these statutes."

Someone I know who IS a lawyer says that the maxim [\"Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius\"](http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/E/ExpressioUniusEstExclusioAlterius.aspx) governs conduct everywhere, even in non\\-legal settings. I asked if it governs the conduct of teenage boys trying to [date my teenage daughter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_Simple_Rules). He said that absolutely it does, and that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Frankly, I have no idea what he's talking about. What would it even mean for this maxim that he called a [\"canon of construction\"](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Canons+of+Construction) even to apply here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your lawyer friend is misguided\n-------------------------------\n\nCasual conversation and writing are not subject to *any* maxims of interpretation \\- the words mean what the speaker/writer says and what the listener/reader understands and these may be different things.\n\nIn a conversation about restaurants, there is no implication that the places not mentioned are not restaurants or don't exist. Even if I were to write a published magazine article called \"The 10 best restaurants in the world\", there is no implication that no other restaurant can possibly be better than those 10\\.\n\nThis applies even in business settings. For example, this is the Petbarn logo:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFnNm.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFnNm.png)\n\nIt has images of dogs, fish, cats, and birds. By your friend's argument, it would be unlawful for them to sell products for the care of pet snakes or lizards since they aren't on the sign? Or, for that matter, to operate from a building that is not a \"barn\"?\n\nFinally, your friend is wrong even in legal interpretation. There are many ways of contract and [legislative interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation) that are or have been in use in every jurisdiction.\n\n\"Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius\" is one maxim of interpretation but it may be in conflict with others. For example, if a regulation on aircraft listed various types of aircraft but didn't mention helicopters but nevertheless had an entire section devoted to rotor maintenance the \"Rule against surplusage\" would require that helicopters be included.\n\nIn any event, modern courts tend to take a more holistic view to interpretation and the use of individual maxims is optional.",

Since the whole point of a property right is to use and enjoy that property, it would seem that a restrictive covenant entirely denying access to a part of a property to the property owner would violate that fundamental right.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can a restrictive covenant deny a land owner the right to use a road\n> on their own property?\n\nYes.\n\nA restrictive covenant could impose such a limitation, although usually a court would disfavor that interpretation of a covenant unless no other reasonable interpretation is possible from the language of the covenant.\n\nThis is basically because it would be lawful (at common law anyway) to convey the land in its entirety to the covenant beneficiary, so it is lawful to convey a lesser interest to that person.\n\nIt isn't inherently unconscionable unless it makes the property subject to the covenant landlocked with no access to a public road, in which case some mandatory doctrines regarding a right of access would probably apply.\n\nOften this would be done to create a private drive across the \"front lot\" (which has direct access to a public road by other means) when the \"back lot\" of a parcel was conveyed by the owner of the combined lot to the new owner of the back lot.\n\nA covenant might be chosen instead of an outright conveyance of the dogleg of road because it retains mineral rights in the servient estate owner, because it clearly allocates property tax payment duties to the underlying owner as part of a larger economic deal, and/or because it could make a transaction possible that would otherwise be prohibited by subdivision requirements applicable in that locality. The restriction might also reduce the servient estate owner's liability for accidents arising from use of the covenant access easement, since it would ordinarily vest all maintenance and use regulation in the dominant estate owner.\n\nSome other common easements that deny the servient estate owner all use of land for a period of time are easements to allow staging of road construction activities, and easements incident to mineral rights in states where destruction of the surface is allowed if it is later restored when the minerals are extracted (such as Wyoming).",

According to the information provided, a restrictive covenant can indeed deny a landowner the right to use a road on their own property. However, courts generally disfavor such extreme interpretations unless the language of the covenant clearly indicates this intent and no other reasonable interpretation is possible. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while such a covenant does limit property rights, it's not automatically unenforceable. Option C introduces a condition not mentioned in the original text; while landlocking might affect enforceability, it's not a strict requirement for the covenant to be valid. Option D is incorrect because a restrictive covenant doesn't necessarily transfer ownership, even if it restricts use."

I am not sure if bullying is a crime or not. It seems that some violence is involved. I think we have a crime for that, called battery or something.\n\nYet, despite the complain of the mom, nothing was done.\n\nSo the mom collect evidences for bullying. \n\nAnd she got charged instead.\n\nTo me, the result is not \"intuitive\". To me, what should have happened is that the Mom shouldn't even bother doing the recording. She reports to school. School reports to cops. Cops do investigating and do the recording. We have evidence. The bully sent to jail. I think that \"should have been\" what happened. It's not.\n\nIt's as if the society as a whole \"approve\" and \"promote\" the bullying by making sure there is no way the bully faced justice. The cops don't get involved. And the only way to get evidence is criminalized.\n\nIf I were a DA, and say I want to get elected, I would throw the bully in jail. And if a bully is thrown in jail, then the \"recording\" event wouldn't have happened in the first place.\n\nI understand that DA does not have obligation to prosecute any crime. However, repeated battery seems like a reasonably obvious crime. If that's not crime, what is?\n\nNow, usually, if people have a few legal options, they pick the one that's the most profitable.\n\nWhat \"profit\" does DA have in prosecuting the mom instead of the bullies.\n\nAs someone beaten up when I was a kid, I am wondering about this for a long time. Why do society more interested in protecting something I perceive as more trivial, like recording, compared to something far more substantial, like beating.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This isn't about bullying at all, this is about Virginia being a \"one\\-party\" state. [Virginia Law 19\\.2\\-62](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title19.2/chapter6/section19.2-62/) outlines that:\n\n> B.2 It shall not be a criminal offense under this chapter for a person to intercept a wire, electronic or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication or one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception.\n\nHowever what is not said in the article is that the daughter didn't know that the recording device was in the backpack. This means that the mother did not get consent from either party being recorded (it isn't clear that a minor could give consent anyway), and is therefore in violation of 19\\.2\\-62\\.\n\nThe (US) law has been quite clear on \"two wrongs don't make a right\", the mother was not getting satisfaction through other channels, but that does not mean she is right in violating the law in pursuit of justice. \n\n---\n\nThis is still very much in the early stages of this particular case, but I'm willing to bet that the mother will see very little if any punishment in this matter.\n\nAs for why the DA doesn't prosecute the children (or their parents) for the bullying, this really depends on what kind of bullying is subject here. If the children are verbally bullying, this may not be a crime (yes, it is morally wrong, but may not be a crime). It isn't to say though that the children in this case haven't been reprimanded according to State law, at least the subject of the bullying has been moved to a different class as a result. Unless the bullying reaches a physical level, most State laws require the schools to deal with the bullying directly (through moving children to different classes, suspensions, expelling, etc), so the DA doesn't typically get involved until physical injury occurs.",

Virginia is a \"one-party consent\" state, meaning at least one party in the conversation must consent to the recording. Since neither the daughter nor the bullies knew about or consented to the recording, the mother's actions were illegal regardless of her intentions.\n\nThe bullies were not prosecuted because:\n1) The exact nature of the bullying is not specified. If it was verbal bullying, it might not constitute a criminal offense.\n2) Schools are often required to handle bullying internally through disciplinary measures before it reaches the level of criminal charges.\n3) The district attorney typically doesn't get involved in bullying cases unless there is physical injury.\n\nThis question highlights the complexities of legal issues surrounding bullying and electronic surveillance, as well as the principle that breaking one law (wiretapping) to expose another potential wrongdoing (bullying) is still considered illegal."

The two parties appear in court and the judge rules that the arbitration agreement is invalid.\n\nThe party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement appeals the decision to the Appellate Division. However, at the same time they are forced to act in a way that is inconsistent with the enforcement of the arbitration agreement. For example, suppose Party A sues Party B for a breach of contract for $50,000\\. Party B attempts to compel arbitration but the court denies the request. While the case is pending appeal, Party B counter sues Party A for $25,000 for breach of the same contract with the logic that until the higher courts reverse the decision of the lower courts, Party B wants the courts to get a full picture of their version of the story.\n\nCould it be argued that Party B now forfeited their right to appeal by filling a suit in court against Party A and not waiting until the appeal is either accepted or denied?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No... I forget the specific term but in court you can bring in multiple points of contradiction that are all contradictory to your other arguments, but would not be contradicting to your case, because they all contradict your legal adversaries case. The example as I heard it is A man is bitten by a neighbor's Pit Bull and the man takes takes his neighbor to court for damages. The neighbor mounts his defense by saying 1\\.) I don't own that dog. 2\\.) If I did own a dog, I wouldn't own that breed of dog. 3\\.) I always keep my dogs on a leash when I take them out of the house and would pull it away before it bit someone. 4\\.) On the day in question my dog was in the kennel.\n\nIn this case, the defense would be valid because the Plaintiff would have to disprove all 4 statements, any one of which would impact the case against the neighbor. In a criminal case, the defendant doesn't have to prove his story is true, he just has to prove that the Prosecution's story isn't. In a civil case, both sides merely have to prove their story is more likely to be true than the other side's. What's more, none of those statements is contradictory, they only seem so (Neighbor doesn't own that dog (he dog sits for his sister). If he did own a dog, it would be a different breed (He doesn't like Pitt Bulls). He never takes a dog out of his house without putting a leash on the dog and maintains control of the dog (Because that's what any dog owner would do). The dog was in the kennel on the day of the incident (because for his own reasons, he can't dog sit for his sister.)).\n\nIn effect, to avoid damage, the argument of \"That's not my dog\" is to argue that the neighbor isn't the responsible party for the dog's behavior. The second argument is that the neighbor would never own a pit bull even if he did own a dog, the third would demonstrate that even when there is a dog that the neighbor is caring for, he does so in a responsible way AND the dog being in the kennel shows that the dog couldn't possibly have been the one who bit the plaintiff.\n\nWhat's more, the defendant can counter sue his neighbor for harassment, who just plain hates Pit Bulls and has been shouting at defendant for daring to care for his sister's dog even on days where the dog is not on the man's property and instantly blamed the Defendant in court without considering the possibility that there could be another Pit Bull owner in the area and their Pit Bull got loose.\n\nIn OP's case, the filing of a countersuit is just \"Hope for the Best, prepare for the worst\". They could be filing because the appellant court's decision may not come out in the window of time they have before they lose the ability to file counter claims. In that case, if the appeal goes in their favor, the suit is dismissed as well as the countersuit and goes to arbitration. If it goes against them, they will be arguing their claim at the trial.",

But has the \"Corker bill\" (or anything else) changed that to make the Iran agreement have the effect of a treaty if it's passed by a simple majority?\n\nIf so, how was that accomplished given the constitutional requirement for a treaty and the constitutional requirement for amendments to the constitution?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, under US law, it is an \"**executive agreement**\", not a \"treaty\". The vast majority of US's international agreements are done as executive agreements, and not treaties; and the power of the executive branch to make executive agreements has been repeatedly upheld in the courts.\n\nSpecifically, there are two types of executive agreements:\n\n1. \"**Congressional\\-executive agreements**\". These are the ones that require changes to legislation to be implemented. Congress passes the needed legislation just like any other normal legislation, i.e. a majority of both houses of Congress. Most trade agreements are passed as congressional\\-executive agreements.\n2. \"**Sole executive agreements**\". These are the ones that do not require changes to legislation to be implemented. Congress is not involved at all.\n\nThis Iran nuclear agreement is a \"sole executive agreement\" because it does not require Congressional action to be implemented. (So it doesn't need to be passed by a simple majority by Congress.)\n\nThe President already has the legal authority to implement all of the US's obligations under the agreement, which are the relief of certain Iran sanctions. Some of those sanctions were implemented by the President, and which the President can remove by himself. Some of these sanctions were implemented by Acts of Congress, but those Acts specifically give the President the authority to waive them.\n\nThe Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (the \"Corker bill\"), passed by Congress in May 2015, also confirms that \"It is the sense of Congress that: \\[...] this Act does not require a vote by Congress for the agreement to commence;\"\n\n---\n\nAs to your question about whether something can \"have the effect of a treaty if it's passed by a simple majority\". The answer is yes (in the other way around). The Supreme Court ruled in the [Head Money Cases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_Money_Cases) that \"treaties\" (ratified by 2/3 of the Senate as specified in Article II) have the same legal effect in US law as regular legislation passed by Congress (by a simple majority of both houses), which means that Congress can modify or repeal (insofar as US law is concerned) any \"treaty\" that is ratified by the Senate, by passing a later law that contradicts it, just like it can with regular legislation. So, yes, any regular legislation passed by a simple majority (including for congressional\\-executive agreements) has the same legal effect as treaties.",

According to the documentation, if the rear-ending driver was deemed at fault for the accident, they are liable for the damages, regardless of the other driver's license status. The fact that the other driver did not have a valid license is a separate issue and does not affect the liability for the accident itself. The rear-ending driver's responsibility for damages is based on their fault in the collision, not on the other driver's unrelated legal violation. Options A and B are incorrect because they mistakenly link the license violation to accident liability. Option D is incorrect because insurance companies typically still cover damages in such situations, though the unlicensed driver may face separate issues with their own insurance."

Or does it refer to something else? In either case, has the interpretation been tested in court?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The particulars of \"actual knowledge\" are addressed in *Viacom v.

The [ruling from the appeals court](http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/ad840309-cbc2-47e1-95bb-73e8784e413c/1/doc/10-3270_10-3342_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/ad840309-cbc2-47e1-95bb-73e8784e413c/1/hilite/) states (emphasis mine):\n\n> Under \u00a7 512(c)(1\\)(A), knowledge or awareness alone does not disqualify the service provider; rather, the provider that gains knowledge or awareness of infringing activity retains safe\\-harbor protection if it \u201cacts expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1\\)(A)(iii). Thus, the nature of the removal obligation itself contemplates knowledge or awareness of **specific infringing material**, because **expeditious removal is possible only if the service provider knows with particularity which items to remove**...\n\nThus, *actual knowledge* must be knowledge that is specific enough to allow a service provider to take action against specific infringing content. \"General\" knowledge of infringement is not specific enough to be actionable, so it cannot qualify as \"actual knowledge\". (e.g., The general knowledge, \"In the past, about 5% of the videos uploaded to our site were infringing, and we expect that trend continues into the present, so some of our videos right now are probably infringing,\" is not actionable to specific videos, so it does not quality as \"actual knowledge\".)\n\nThat ruling also clarifies the distinction between *(i)* and *(ii)*, which are respectively termed the \"actual knowledge\" provision and \"red flag\" provision:\n\n> In other words, the actual knowledge provision turns on whether the provider actually or \u201csubjectively\u201d knew of specific infringement, while the red flag provision turns on whether the provider was subjectively aware of facts that would have made the specific infringement \u201cobjectively\u201d obvious to a reasonable person.\n\n---\n\nActual knowledge is different from a notification, which the service operator must respond to according to section (c)(1\\)(C) (whereas your quote is from (c)(1\\)(A)):\n\n> (C) upon notification of claimed infringement as described in paragraph (3\\), responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.\n\nExpeditious removal is required in *either* event: the operator has actual knowledge of infringement, per (c)(1\\)(A)(i), ***or*** the operator gets a notification, per (c)(1\\)(C). Actual knowledge and notifications are different, but they impose similar responsibilities for the operator.",

I've done some reading and read that essentially I'm not allowed to violate any patents or outright steal the work by copying it but otherwise should be fine if portions of the apps match.\nTo elaborate:\n\n* I'm from Germany, the other developer is from Turkey\n* The app is distributed using the Google Play store (US\\-based)\n* Both apps provide the same core functionality\n* There are about 40 apps providing the same core functionality\n* The app of the other developer was published in 2015, mine in 2017\\.\n* My app was created from the ground up and doesn't use any sources of other apps (I created the layout by myself as well)\n* The other developer seems to hold at least some sort of copyright in Turkey: <https://i.stack.imgur.com/0DKWO.jpg> (blacked out)\n* Both have a very, very similar name. There are 40\\+ apps on Android alone which share this name as well. There was software prior to both apps with this name.\n\nI admit that both apps have a similar main UI (same color, same input elements) which however noticeably differ in design choices, user experience, and scope. But apart from that (the main view), the UI differs completely.\n\nIs there any grounds for copyright infringement, if the apps look similar, but the actual sources aren't derived from any sort of original work?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Disclaimer: I'm from the US and don't claim to know German or Turkish law. So let me discuss some general principles here, but details may well be different in Germany and Turkey.\n\nYou're mixing together three very different things: trademark, copyright, and patent. \n\nCopyright protects the expression of an idea, in this case, the exact computer code, images, etc. If you didn't copy his code, the chance that you would coincidentally write identical code is remote. The fact that you both have a line of code that says `x=x+1` wouldn't give him any grounds for a lawsuit. He'd have to show substantial portions of the code were identical. If you didn't deliberately copy his code, this isn't going to happen. Barring some extraordinary and unbelievable coincidence, you can't violate copyright accidentally.\n\nTrademark protects names and symbols used to identify a company or a product. If you decided to call your software company \"Microsoft\", then that other Microsoft could sue you for trademark infringement. Likewise if you copied somebody else's logo or other distinctive graphics. This is very different from copyright. It is quite possible to violate someone's trademark accidentally. Especially if he gave his company or product a rather generic name. Like if someone called his product, say, \"Password Manager\", someone else might make a product with the same name without ever having heard of the original. Ditto if he has some simple logo or other graphics. If you did accidentally duplicate a name or graphic elements, well, in the US a court would likely order you to change your name or graphics and that would be the end of it, unless you refused, in which case you'd end up in court. US Courts have ruled that very generic names have limited trademark protection. An example I saw recently was \"Main Street Auto Repair\". A court said that the owner of that name could prevent someone else from opening a shop in the same town with the same name, but he couldn't sue someone in another town who happened to use the same name. This is why, by the way, companies often use made\\-up words for their product names. In your case, this should be a trivial issue. If he is claiming trademark to the look of the main menu screen, just change the colors or move some buttons around. If it actually went to court, you should be able to argue that the similarity was accidental and when you were informed you promptly changed it, and that should be the end of it. Depending, I guess, on how hard\\-nosed the judge is, etc.\n\nPatents are different still. A patent gives the owner the exclusive right to use an invention or process for a specified period of time. It doesn't matter if you invented the same thing entirely independently. Whoever filed the patent first has exclusive rights. There have been cases where an inventor lost out to someone with a similar invention because he submitted his patent application one day later. If this other person has patents that you are infringing, you are pretty much out of luck.",

Trademark, however, protects names, logos, and distinctive visual elements, and can potentially be infringed accidentally if similar elements are used. Patents protect functionality and can be infringed even with independent creation, but there's no mention of patents in this scenario. The most accurate statement is that copyright infringement is unlikely without deliberate copying, but trademark issues could potentially arise from similarities in names or visual elements, even if accidental."

Likewise, an adjudication that someone had no will cannot be made without a probate proceeding. There is no exception for a clear an uncontested will. \"Will\" means \"probate\" pretty much by definition.\n\nThis doesn't mean, however, that the closing of the property has to waive until the probate proceeding including a full administration of the probate estate and closing of the probate estate is required. Often, a will can be admitted to probate and an executor can be appointed to manage the estate in a matter of a few weeks to a few months if there is no contest to either the validity of the will or the appointment of a particular person as an executor.\n\nGenerally, once the executor is appointed in the probate case, the real estate closing can go forward, sometimes with some additional uncontested motion practice. Once the property is sold, the proceeds are put in an estate bank account pending further administration of the estate's assets and liabilities. Indeed, even if the will is contested, as long as a consensus can be reached among the interested parties regarding who the executor should be, the real estate closing could go forward despite the fact that the will is contested.\n\nPowers of attorney are sometimes granted to real estate agents to complete a transaction in the event of a seller's incapacity. But powers of attorney are void no later than the point at which the person with the power of attorney learns of the death. (The common law rule was that a power of attorney was void at the moment of death, even if no one involved in the transaction knew that fact yet.)\n\nThe only person with authority to sign the deed to sell the property, if the property is titled in the name of the seller individually, with no co\\-owner (or with a tenant\\-in\\-common co\\-owner), is the probate estate's executor.\n\nThe real estate contract is a claim in the probate estate, which the probate estate is required to carry out if it is able to do so. But a real estate contract, in and of itself, doesn't transfer the property by operation of law at closing. Until the probate estate is opened, the buyer doesn't even have anyone who can be sued to demand that the real estate contract be performed.",

The contract becomes a claim in the probate estate.\nB is incorrect because powers of attorney become void upon the death of the grantor.\nC is incorrect because while probate is necessary, the entire probate process doesn't need to be completed before the sale can proceed.\nD is correct because once an executor is appointed by the probate court, they have the authority to proceed with the sale, even if other aspects of the will are being contested. The executor can sign the deed and complete the transaction, with the proceeds going into the estate account for further administration."

The documentation states that the guidelines do not form part of any Mozilla employee's contract of employment, but it also mentions that Mozilla staff who violate these guidelines may face consequences, including disciplinary action or termination. This suggests that while the guidelines apply to employees, the specific consequences and procedures for addressing violations are determined by the employee's contract or other internal policies, not by the guidelines themselves. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the document explicitly states that the policy does not form part of any employee's contract. \n\nOption B is incorrect because while employees are governed by additional policies, they are not exempt from following the guidelines. \n\nOption D is incorrect as the document implies that employees are expected to adhere to current versions of the guidelines, not just the version in effect when they were hired."

I am not the original asker and I don\u2019t know which US state.\n\nSupposedly, there is a tech company that has instituted a rule that, when making decisions about hiring or promoting, they will only consider degrees that were obtained within the last 10 years. Is this legal?\n\nI can certainly see an argument for this being age discrimination, but could there also be a counterargument that anyone can always go back to school, and in the tech industry there are legitimate reasons why a more recent diploma would be more valuable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This policy would appear to have a [disparate impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disparate_impact) on workers age 40 and older, given that most workers obtain degrees in their 20s and few obtain a second degree later. Workers age 40 and older are protected from employment discrimination under the [ADEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_Discrimination_in_Employment_Act_of_1967).\n\nPolicies with a disparate impact may be considered discriminatory, but not necessarily. The [EEOC rule](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/regulations/adea_rfoa_qa_final_rule.cfm#_ftn1) as of 2012 is that such a policy is not illegal if it is based on a \"reasonable factor other than age\". It is not clear to me whether the 10\\-year degree policy would pass this test, and it might depend on how the employer justified the rule.\n\nHere is the discussion from the EEOC's FAQ:\n\n> 8\\.What determines whether an employment practice is based on Reasonable Factors Other than Age? \n> \n> \n> An employment practice is based on an RFOA when it was reasonably\n>  designed and administered to achieve a legitimate business purpose in\n>  light of the circumstances, including its potential harm to older\n>  workers. \n> \n> \n> Example 1:\n> \n> \n> If a police department decided to require applicants for patrol\n>  positions to pass a physical fitness test to be sure that the officers\n>  were physically able to pursue and apprehend suspects, it should know\n>  that such a test might exclude older workers more than younger ones. \n>  Nevertheless, the department's actions would likely be based on an\n>  RFOA if it reasonably believed that the test measured the speed and\n>  strength appropriate to the job, and if it did not know, or should not\n>  have known, of steps that it could have taken to reduce harm to older\n>  workers without unduly burdening the department.\n> \n> \n> The rule emphasizes the need for an individualized consideration of\n>  the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular situation. It\n>  includes the following list of considerations relevant to assessing\n>  reasonableness:\n> \n> \n> * The extent to which the factor is related to the employer's stated business purpose;\n> * The extent to which the employer defined the factor accurately and applied the factor fairly and accurately, including the extent to\n>  which managers and supervisors were given guidance or training about\n>  how to apply the factor and avoid discrimination;\n> * The extent to which the employer limited supervisors' discretion to assess employees subjectively, particularly where the criteria that\n>  the supervisors were asked to evaluate are known to be subject to\n>  negative age\\-based stereotypes;\n> * The extent to which the employer assessed the adverse impact of its employment practice on older workers; and\n> * The degree of the harm to individuals within the protected age group, in terms of both the extent of injury and the numbers of\n>  persons adversely affected, and the extent to which the employer took\n>  steps to reduce the harm, in light of the burden of undertaking such\n>  steps.\n\n[Here](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/03/30/2012-5896/disparate-impact-and-reasonable-factors-other-than-age-under-the-age-discrimination-in-employment) is the full text of the rule, 77 FR 19080\\.",

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications of this policy under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)?\n\nA) The policy is automatically illegal due to its disparate impact on workers over 40.\n\nB) The policy is legal as long as it applies equally to all employees regardless of age.\n\nC) The policy may be legal if the company can demonstrate it is based on a reasonable factor other than age (RFOA) and is reasonably designed to achieve a legitimate business purpose.\n\nD) The policy is legal because the tech industry changes rapidly, making recent degrees more valuable.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The policy likely has a disparate impact on workers over 40, who are protected under the ADEA. However, policies with disparate impact are not automatically illegal. According to the EEOC rule, such policies can be legal if based on a \"reasonable factor other than age\" (RFOA) and are reasonably designed and administered to achieve a legitimate business purpose. The company would need to justify the policy using the considerations outlined by the EEOC, such as its relation to business purposes, fair application, and steps taken to reduce harm to older workers.

Would there be any resident\\-of\\-same state property tax benefit gain or loss depending on which one has their name on the deed when the property sells?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> The will further states property shall be sold and offspring are to\n> split the proceeds. However, the will does not specifically designate\n> who inherits the property/deed.\n\nThis is an instruction regarding who inherits the property. It means that the executor of the probate estate (in an official capacity), who takes title by operation of law upon appointment, is directed to sell the property rather than to distributed it in kind.\n\n> Will there be legal or financial problems with a foreign executor?\n\nNot necessarily. Generally, the main issue is that a foreign executor must sign a document expressly submitting to the jurisdiction of the probate court when appointed in addition to other documents that are signed by all executors.\n\n> Pre\\-death, in the will, would it be better to designate the American\n> resident offspring as executor?\n\nNot necessarily. Hands on administration of the estate and dealing face to face with a local probate lawyer is easier for a resident of the state where the assets are located and the decedent resides, but in these days of telecommunications this isn't a decisive factor. The relative competencies of the prospective executors is more important.\n\n> If both offspring agreed, can the overseas offspring easily transfer\n> executorship to the American offspring, or will there be legal or\n> financial consequences?\n\nAssuming that they are the only interested parties in the estate, they can do so. You can't be compelled to serve as an executor just because you are nominated by a will to do so. If one person declines to serve, the person with next highest priority which would likely be the other sibling, may apply to the probate court to be appointed. The main financial consequence is that typically, whoever does the job is entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate for their services.\n\n> Would there be legal or financial deed ownership issues, since neither\n> offspring specifically inherited the property?\n\nNo.\n\n> Could a court order the property to be auctioned out from under the\n> offspring?\n\nIf all interested parties agree, they can defy the will. The normal process, however, is for the executor to follow the will and to sell the property in a commercially reasonable manner, typically by engaging a real estate agent to handle the sale. If the executor fails to take action, and an interested party objects, it would be more common for a probate court to remove the executor and appoint another one, than to order a sale at auction, which would typically be a course of last resort.\n\nThis said, under appropriate circumstances, the court of probate jurisdiction would have authority to order an auction of the house. Most commonly, a court order to sell a decedent's house at auction would arise when the decedent (i.e. the dead guy) only owned an undivided partial interest in the house (called a tenancy in common interest) and the non\\-deceased third party co\\-owner of the house (perhaps a brother or ex\\-wife of the decedent) declined to cooperate in selling it.\n\n> If a court determines the overseas executor offspring receives the\n> property deed, the overseas executor wants to remain executor but give\n> deed to American offspring for easier selling of the property, would\n> the property have to go through titling and closing costs for the\n> transfer, and then again for property sale to a third party?\n\nThis question reflects a fundamental misunderstanding about how probate works. Title to the property vests in the estate by operation of law upon the death of the decedent. The executor has authority, once appointed, to take actions such as signing a deed to a third\\-party buyer, on behalf of the estate. There is no intermediate closing and transfer of title to vest title to the property of the decedent in the name of the estate before it goes from the estate to the third party. The net proceeds of the sale to the third party (after costs of sale and prorations of things like property taxes and prepaid insurance) are then placed in a bank account for the estate and paid to the heirs after expenses of administration are paid.\n\nThere is nothing that makes it significantly harder for an overseas executor to close than a domestic one. The title company handling the sale emails the deed (and any other paperwork that needs to be signed) to the executor. The executor prints the documents to be signed, signs the non\\-notarized documents, and signs the deed in the presence of his friendly neighborhood notary in the foreign country where the executor lives, who notarizes the deed. The executed deed, together with a document called an apostille proving that the notary is really a notary, is sent back to the title company (probably with a scanned copy by email and a hard paper copy following by express delivery). Coordinating time zones may be a pain depending on the location of the particular foreign country in question (but the closing does not have to happen for all parties at exact the same time), and if the overseas executor is someplace primitive and remote with no internet access or computers or printers or faxes and no notaries, that could be a problem. But there are increasingly few places like that in the world.",

The will names the overseas child as executor. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the execution of this will?\n\nA) The court must appoint the American child as executor due to residency requirements.\nB) The overseas child, as named executor, must personally take ownership of the house before selling it.\nC) The executor, once appointed, can sell the house directly on behalf of the estate without intermediate transfer of ownership.\nD) The will is invalid because it doesn't specifically designate who inherits the property deed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As explained in the documentation, the executor, once appointed by the probate court, has the authority to act on behalf of the estate. This includes selling the house directly to a third party without any intermediate transfer of ownership. The estate takes ownership of the property by operation of law upon the death of the decedent.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there's no strict requirement that the executor must be a resident of the same state. While it might be more convenient, a foreign executor can be appointed with some additional paperwork.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because the executor doesn't need to take personal ownership of the house. They act on behalf of the estate, not as a personal owner.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the will's instruction to sell the property and split the proceeds is considered a valid designation of how the property should be handled. The will doesn't need to explicitly state who inherits the deed."

See [this article](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/200845E) for some information about the treaty making process:\n\n> In Canada, the treaty\\-making process is controlled by the executive branch of the federal government, while the Parliament of Canada (\u201cParliament\u201d) is often responsible for passing legislation to implement international treaties at the federal level.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Although this entire process is controlled by the executive branch, the federal government does involve Parliament in this stage of the treaty\\-making process by tabling treaties and relevant explanatory documents for debate in the House of Commons.\n\nSo while the executive branch can enter into treaties at will, they can't create or alter domestic laws without legislative approval. For example, if a treaty required that Canada make certain things illegal, then the legislature would have to pass legislation making that thing illegal to make Canada compliant with its treaty obligations.\n\nApproving a new NATO member wouldn't affect domestic law at all, as there is no bill the legislature would need to pass to implement it. It would effect military operations, but the executive branch already has the power to decide military strategy (the King is the commander\\-in\\-chief of the military, he delegated those powers to the governor general, and the governor general by convention only acts on the advice of the Cabinet).\n\nNote that unlike many other countries (such as the US), the Canadian constitution is mostly silent on the topic of international treaties, only mentioning treaties agreed to by the UK on behalf of Canada (at the time the constitution was written, Canada couldn't agree to treaties itself), so there are no constitutional requirements for the legislative branch to approve any treaties.\n\nAlso note that treaty implementing legislation is almost always passed, since the executive branch needs to maintain the support of a majority of the legislature. If the legislature doesn't pass implementing legislation, then the legislature would also be very likely to pass a no\\-confidence motion, which would usually trigger a new election.",

In Canada, the executive branch (the government) has the authority to enter into international treaties without requiring formal ratification from the legislative branch (Parliament). However, if a treaty requires changes to domestic law for implementation, the legislative branch would need to pass the necessary legislation. This system allows the executive to act swiftly in international affairs while maintaining the legislature's role in shaping domestic law. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest mandatory legislative involvement in all treaty-making, which is not the case in Canada. Option B is incorrect as it reverses the roles, giving primary control to the legislative branch, which is not accurate in the Canadian system."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that a software developer (April) living in the UK,has created a simple browser plug\\-in that takes screenshots of a user's browser windows and allows the user to enhance and \"prettify\" these screenshots in various ways.\n\nThe \"enhancing\" part of the screenshot processing is done on April's server, which means that all screenshots are uploaded from people's computers to April's over the internet. April has no control over the data that people take screenshots of: it can be their personal email messages, or some copyrighted material, or even their nude pictures. And all this data ends up on the web server that April owns and contrtols.\n\nAre there some specific kinds of data processing agreement or privacy policy that April needs to offer to users so that she doesn't end up in any kind of legal trouble (with GDPR or any other privacy laws)? Maybe a disclaimer saying something like \"by installing this plug\\-in, you agree not to take screenshots of any illegal/copyrighted material\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since the developer is also said to be running the website where screen shots to be edited are stored, and is resident in the UK, it would seem that the GDPR\\-UK applies. (The EU version may also apply when a user is in the EU.) This means that the Data Controller (DC) must have a lawful basis under [Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)\n\nThe most plausible basis would seem to be point (b) of article 6 paragraph 1\\. That reads:\n\n> (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\n\nFor this to apply, the DC would need to include in a ToS document or in some other relevant document that a user must accept, contractual language in which the Data Subject (DS) agrees to submit data for processing, and the DC agrees to recive, process, and return it. There would probably be other provisions as well. One of them might be that the content could not itself be unlawful, another that the DS has all needed rights to submit the content for creation of a modified version, yet another that the service could not be used for any unlawful purpose.\n\nHowever, other GDPR provisions would also apply. In particular, [Article 5](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/), paragraph 1 point (e) reads in relevant part\n\n> \\[Personal data shall be] kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed ...\n\nthis suggest that such screen shots should not be retained indefinitely, but rather deleted securely as soon as the modified versions have been transmuted to ther users who have requested them. While 5\\. (b) does permit retention for archiving purposes, it is better practice to retain no more thasn needed. Furthermore, if such information is to be retained as an archive, that should be disclosed to the user under [Article 13](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-13-gdpr/) specifically 13\\.1(c) and 13\\.2(a). Those require disclosing the purpose and lawful basis of procession, and the expected time of retention or the criteria used to determine the retention period.\n\nOthre disclosures liosted in article 13 would also apply.\n\nThe idea of consent on the basis of \"by using this app/site you consent to ...\" is not valid consent under the GDPR. Specifically [Article 7](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/) requires that consent can be withdrawn at any time, and be easy to withdraw. [Recital 32](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-32/) states:\n\n> Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\u2019s agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. ... Silence, pre\\-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent.\n\nThus contractual language, explicitly agreed to by the DS, is a much better basis than such implied consent.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: April, a UK-based software developer, creates a browser plugin that allows users to enhance screenshots. The plugin uploads screenshots to April's server for processing. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding April's legal obligations under GDPR?\n\nA) April only needs to include a disclaimer stating \"by installing this plugin, you agree not to take screenshots of any illegal/copyrighted material\" to be compliant with GDPR.\n\nB) April must obtain explicit consent from users each time they upload a screenshot, as implied consent through usage of the plugin is not sufficient under GDPR.\n\nC) April should establish a contractual agreement with users, outlining data processing terms, retention periods, and user rights, while ensuring a lawful basis for processing under Article 6 of GDPR.\n\nD) April has no GDPR obligations as long as she deletes all screenshots immediately after processing, regardless of user agreements or disclosures.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it most accurately reflects the GDPR requirements outlined in the documentation. April needs to establish a contractual agreement with users, which serves as a lawful basis for processing under Article 6(1)(b) of GDPR. This agreement should include terms about data submission, processing, and return, as well as any restrictions on content. \n\nAdditionally, April must comply with Article 5 regarding data retention, Article 13 for disclosure requirements, and Article 7 for consent standards. Simply using a disclaimer (A) is insufficient. While explicit consent for each upload (B) isn't necessary if there's a contractual basis, implied consent through usage alone isn't compliant. Option D is incorrect because while prompt deletion is good practice, it doesn't negate the need for user agreements and proper disclosures under GDPR."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in Massachusetts pays their rent 10 days late. The landlord wants to charge a late fee. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the landlord's ability to impose a late fee in this situation?\n\nA) The landlord can charge a late fee immediately, but the tenant doesn't have to pay it until 30 days after the original due date.\n\nB) The landlord cannot charge any late fee since the rent was paid before 30 days had elapsed from the original due date.\n\nC) The landlord can charge a late fee, but must wait until 30 days after the original due date to do so, even if the rent has already been paid.\n\nD) The landlord can charge a prorated late fee based on the number of days the rent was late, as long as it's imposed after the 30-day mark.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to Massachusetts General Law Chapter 186, Section 15B(1)(a)(iii), no lease or rental agreement can impose any interest or penalty for failure to pay rent until thirty days after the rent was due. The interpretation provided suggests that if the rent is fully paid before the thirty days are up, there is no longer a \"failure to pay rent\" and thus no late fee can be charged. In this scenario, since the tenant paid the rent 10 days late, which is before the 30-day mark, the landlord cannot impose a late fee. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they all assume that a late fee can be charged in some form, which contradicts the interpretation of the law for this specific situation."

Additionally, parody, pastiche, and caricature are permitted, observing the rules of the genre.

(A constitutional issue may arise in a case that a PD might handle, but you can't e.g. call on the public defender to sue the government for infringing your 2nd Amendment rights.) A state attorney general could file suit against the US government over a constitutional issue, as Washington's AG did in the case of the Trump travel executive order, where the underlying issues were constitutional.

Later one of the houses got pulled out of the market which was listed by another agent. I later learned that the seller was going to advertise the home as 'Sale by Owner'.

However, in general, an agent is entitled to their commission if they introduce the buyer to the vendor even if they are no longer the agent when the sale takes place \\- the agent clearly did this.\n\nIt appears that the agent has pointed this out to the vendor and the vendor has decided to pass this cost on to you. It\u2019s up to you whether you accept this new asking price.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: In the Arizona real estate scenario described, what is the most accurate statement regarding the agent's entitlement to commission?\n\nA) The agent is not entitled to any commission because the house was pulled off the market and became a \"For Sale by Owner\" property.\n\nB) The agent is entitled to commission only if the buyer signed a formal agreement to work with them.\n\nC) The agent is likely entitled to commission because they introduced the buyer to the property, even if the sale occurs later without their direct involvement.\n\nD) The agent can legally increase the negotiated price to include their commission without the buyer's consent.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In real estate transactions, the concept of \"procuring cause\" often applies. This means that if an agent introduces a buyer to a property that the buyer eventually purchases, the agent may be entitled to a commission, even if the property was later pulled from the market or became a \"For Sale by Owner\" listing. This is true even without a signed agreement, as long as the agent can prove they were the procuring cause of the sale.\n\nOption A is incorrect because pulling the house off the market doesn't necessarily negate the agent's right to commission if they were the procuring cause.\n\nOption B is incorrect because formal agreements aren't always necessary for an agent to claim commission, especially if they can prove they were the procuring cause.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the agent may be entitled to commission, they cannot unilaterally increase the negotiated price without the consent of both the buyer and seller.\n\nThis question tests understanding of real estate commission rules, the concept of procuring cause, and the ethical considerations in such transactions."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the US, what are the steps that lead to prosecution (or otherwise)?\n\n**By way of example**\n\n> Rep. Maxine Waters (D\\-Calif. ) traveled to Minnesota this weekend,\n> urging protesters to \"stay in the street\" and to even become \"more\n> confrontational\" if former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is\n> acquitted of killing resident George Floyd this week.\n> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=we7ikgSeABU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we7ikgSeABU)\n\nSome people believe that the above is incitement to violence and perhaps more. They say that Waters 'should' be brought to trial for this.\n\n**Question**\n\nIn such a case, what are the steps? As a non\\-lawyer, non\\-US\\-citizen, my guess is the following:\n\n1. Someone (anyone?) complains to the police.\n2. The police are obliged to investigate (?)\n3. The police seek evidence, such as the accused person talking on video\n4. They forward this evidence to someone for a decision on whether the case is strong enough\n5. The case is brought or dropped\n\nAre my guesses correct? What details have I missed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The steps listed in the question are not far off, but not quite correct. A more correct list would be:\n\n1. Indications that a crime has been committed, or is in progress or planned come to the attention of the police. This might be via a complaint, or the report of an informant, or through the police's own observations.\n2. The police decide whether the matter warrants investigation. They are never **required** to investigate, although credible allegations of serious crime will usually be investigated. The police may consult the office of the prosecutor.\n3. The police seek for and assemble evidence, if possible. They may interview suspects and possible witnesses. This may last anywhere from hours to years. They may seek warrants for searches or wiretaps or arrests.\n4. The police decide whether or not to forward evidence to the prosecutor's office, seeking a charge. They may choose not to do so.\n5. The prosecutor's office reviews evidence submitted by the police, and decides whether to file charges. A prosecutor has wide discretion to proceed with or drop a case. The prosecutor may direct the police to make further investigation if additional evidence is needed or wanted. The decision to file charges will be based on the seriousness of the matter, and on the prosecutor's judgement as to whether a conviction can be obtained, and the available resource of the office. Political factors may come into play.\n6. There may be a grand jury proceeding to review the evidence and produce an indictment. The Grand Jury can hear witnesses. Usually its proceedings and the list of witnesses are tightly controlled by the prosecutor. It has been famously said that any half\\-way competent prosecutor can get a Grand jury to \"indite a ham sandwich\". However, the Grand Jury has the power to push inquiry in directions not approved by the prosecutor, although this is quite rarely done in practice. In some states a \"preliminary hearing\" may be held instead. In either case the question is whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed, and that the defendant(s) committed it. If the crime is a misdemeanor then the prosecutor can file charges without a Grand Jury or a preliminary hearing.\n7. Charges are filed with the court that has jurisdiction. The defendant(s) may be arrested, or agree to attend court. The defendant(s) will appear to respond to the formal charges, usually with a \"Guilty\" or \"Not Guilty\" plea.\n8. The Judge of the court will set the schedule for further proceedings, including a trial if things get that far. The defense may ask the Judge to dismiss the charges, which the Judge may do if they do not appear to be legally well founded.\n\nThis process could stop at any stage, and several people have authority to determine if it proceeds or not. The senior police officer(s), involved, the prosecutor, and eventually the judge all can halt the process, at one point or another.\n\nAs was mentioned in a comment by Paul Johnson , the supreme court in the case of [*Brandenburg v. Ohio*, 395 U.S. 444 (1969\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio) has significantly limited prosecutions for incitement to situations involving speech that is \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action\". Otherwise the protections under the First Amendment to the US Federal Constitution protect the speech and prevent any prosecution. Prior to that case the case of [*Schenck v. United States*, 249 U.S. 47 (1919\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States) allowed prosecution for speech that \"creates a clear and present danger\". The very well\\-known passage is:\n\n> The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. ... The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.\n\nWhether prosecution in a given case is allowed under the First Amendment is a question of law for the Judge and perhaps for an appeals court. But I doubt that the reported speech would pass the *Brandenburg* test or even the earlier \"clear and present danger\" test. If not, no valid prosecution could be brought.",

Police can choose whether to investigate and forward evidence, prosecutors decide whether to file charges, and judges can dismiss charges if they appear legally unfounded.\n\nOption A is incorrect because police are not legally obligated to investigate all complaints, and they have discretion in forwarding evidence to prosecutors.\n\nOption B is false because grand jury indictments are not required for misdemeanors, and some states use preliminary hearings instead for certain cases.\n\nOption D is incorrect because judges do have the authority to dismiss charges before trial if they determine the charges are not legally well-founded.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the multi-step nature of the criminal justice process and the discretionary powers held by various authorities within that process."

The fact that a third party overheard and misinterpreted the statement, leading to negative consequences, does not change the fundamental truth of the original statement in its intended context. The law generally does not hold someone liable for defamation when their statement is truthful, even if others misunderstand or overgeneralize its meaning."

However, you don't need permission to use a trademark outside the context of trade and commerce. For example, despite the fact that the Wi\\-Fi Alliance's own name is a trademark, you didn't need permission to use it in your question.
