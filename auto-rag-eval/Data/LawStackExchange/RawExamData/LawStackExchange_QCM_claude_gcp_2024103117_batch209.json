At the end of last year I had enough of waiting for him to respond to all the issues we have in the property, and I've sent him a letter of claim. After that he came to inspect the property (with his father posing as a building expert) and he was very arrogant, threatened me with eviction and skyrocketing rent if he does any repairs. He talked down to me and in general his visit was extremely unpleasant.\n\nI recorded it all on my iPhone voice recorder and made a transcript of this conversation, but I didn't tell him that I'm recording it as I know that the only way to show his true colours is to do it without his knowledge (example: he phoned my solicitor after she contacted him to tell him, that we will commence legal proceedings against him and said to her, that he is an innocent victim here, that I was very happy with everything until 6 months ago and he didn't know about any problems in the property, which is a lie as I have tons of evidence to prove otherwise).\n\nSo my question is: can I ask for admission of this recording in a court, as I believe it is highly relevant and probative?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, you can ask permission from the court.

The tenant wants to use this recording as evidence in court. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the admissibility of this secret recording?\n\nA) The recording is automatically admissible in court since it was made for personal use.\nB) The recording cannot be used as evidence because it was made without the landlord's consent.\nC) The recording can be submitted as evidence, but only if the court grants permission and it is shared with other parties before the hearing.\nD) The recording can be presented as a surprise piece of evidence during the court hearing for maximum impact.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, a private recording can be submitted as evidence in court, but certain conditions must be met. The court must give permission for the recording to be used, and an application for this permission should be made on a specific form (Form C2). Additionally, the recording must be made available to other parties involved in the case before any hearing to consider its admissibility. This ensures that all parties have a fair opportunity to review and respond to the evidence.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while recording a conversation for personal use is not illegal, it doesn't automatically make it admissible in court. Option B is wrong because consent is not required for personal recordings, and they can potentially be used as evidence. Option D is incorrect as surprising the court with new evidence is not allowed; all evidence must be properly disclosed and approved before being presented in court."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77562/is-signing-a-contract-addressed-for-someone-else-enforceable", "docs_id": 77562, "title": "Is signing a contract addressed for someone else enforceable?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently had to sign an NDA and non\\-compete.

As explained in the LawStackExchange answer, the contract itself is the binding legal relationship between the parties, and the document is merely evidence of that relationship. The intent of both parties (the company and the employee who actually signed) is clear, despite the clerical error in the document. Minor errors or misidentifications in contract documents are generally considered immaterial if the true parties to the agreement can be clearly established. In this case, the cover sheet was correctly addressed, and the employee's act of signing demonstrates their intent to be bound by the agreement.

According to Section 216 of CAATSA, before taking any sanctions action, the President must submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership describing the proposed action and the reasons for it. This requirement precludes unilateral or universal declarations of sanctions without proper justification and reporting.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the President cannot unilaterally impose sanctions without Congressional involvement.

See [Deeks v. Wells](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1931/1931canlii157/1931canlii157.html), OR 818\\. Person B is not allowed to copy (including copy and modify, copy modify and reproduce) a work produced by person A, so in the lawsuit, A must establish that B did copy. One form of evidence would be a video of B caught red\\-handed actually copying, but that is not the only way (indeed, it hardly if ever happens). Exact identity could easily establish copying and would be applicable to illegal downloading and other forms of IP piracy. In a case like Deeks, the question is whether two works are similar enough that it constitutes proof of copying.\n\nIn literary texts, the probability of coincidental exact identity in two paragraph of 300 words is effectively zero. Changing two or three words doesn't change that, but changing enough words does (e.g. the simultaneous existence of about 10% of words in any two texts of English is virtually guaranteed). The law doesn't have a fixed formula for distinguishing between coincidence and copy, and in Deeks there is much discussion of the expert testimony surrounding the question of copying. An example of a factor relevant to the coincidence / copy question is that certain writing styles are more templatic (see for example legal pleadings) and therefore a higher degree of similarity will arise because the authors have adopted the same abstract style.\n\nAssuming you mean \"exactly the same text\", and that the text is at least a paragraph of two sentences, it is unreasonable to hold that the two texts are coincidentally the same. However, tweet\\-identity is fairly likely, not only because of the shortness of a tweet, but also because authors draw on recurring literary memes. If it is *possible* that B copied from A (the work could have been available to B) and expert analysis of the texts does not make a coincidence analysis reasonable, A would prevail in an infringement case \u2013 even if in fact B *had* written his work independently. B has no way to prove that theirs was an independent creation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Canadian copyright law, if two individuals independently create identical works without knowledge of each other's creation, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Only the first creator has a valid copyright claim, as they have the \"sole right to produce\" the work.\n\nB) Both creators have valid copyright claims, as long as they can prove independent creation.\n\nC) The second creator automatically loses any copyright claim if the first creator files for copyright first.\n\nD) The first creator would likely prevail in an infringement case against the second creator, even if the second creator truly created the work independently.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While both creators may have independently created the work, Canadian copyright law focuses on the ability to prove independent creation in infringement cases. As stated in the information provided, if it's possible that the second creator (Person B) could have had access to the first creator's (Person A) work, and expert analysis doesn't support a reasonable coincidence argument, Person A would likely prevail in an infringement case. This is true even if Person B did, in fact, create the work independently. The difficulty lies in Person B's ability to prove independent creation, especially if the works are substantially similar or identical. The law doesn't have a fixed formula for distinguishing between coincidence and copying, making it challenging for the second creator to defend against an infringement claim in such cases."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70939/simply-drawn-character-protected-by-copyright", "docs_id": 70939, "title": "simply drawn character protected by copyright?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say someone draws a simply character design for a meme (2min drawing) and then just posts a meme with said character on fb/reddit/etc.\n\nIs this character (or the part of the image where this character is displayed) now protected in any way?

Under copyright law, original artistic works are automatically protected as soon as they are created and fixed in a tangible form, regardless of the time spent creating them or their intended use. The fact that the character was drawn quickly for a meme does not negate its copyright protection. Posting on social media does not place the work in the public domain.

This article does not require that either the initial notification or a subsequent summons and complaint for a parking or standing violation be issued or served as required by this article.\n\nThis section carves out an exemption for parking infractions in that they don't need to be personally served.\n\nIf there is no response to the complaint left on the car, the statute further states:\n\n> If it is necessary to issue a summons and complaint because there is not a satisfactory response to the initial notice of a parking or standing violation, the summons and complaint may be sent by regular mail to the address provided to the department by the individual made responsible for the alleged violation by the applicable statute or ordinance. Service of the summons and complaint is complete on mailing.\n\nWhen service is complete the court of jurisdiction has personal jurisdiction over the defendant and can enter a default judgment.\n\nYou are correct in the rest of your statement regarding moving violations reported by camera systems \\- the violator must be personally served. If personal service is not achieved then the complaint is dismissed with no record.\n\n[This article has a good explanation](http://krazlaw.com/2011/03/personal-jurisdiction-in-photo-radar-cases/) of the process for service for moving violations. The article references precedence established in [Tonner v. Paradise Valley Magistrate's Court](http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/00/68.asp).\n\nArizona requires personal service in order to create personal jurisdiction for the court. Alternatively, the defendant can waive the personal service.\n\nIn Arizona, if one takes an action recorded on a traffic camera that causes a complaint to be issued that person will receive in the mail a form that is a waiver of service. Signing such a form and returning it tells the court that you waive personal service.\n\nRefusal to sign and return the form does not remove the requirement the state has of personal service. If the state wishes to pursue the case they will need to provide personal service. If the state does successfully conclude personal service then the defendant will be liable for the initial fine as well as the cost of service.\n\nFrom the article and the case:\n\n> Without completed service, the court does not obtain jurisdiction. \u201cThe incomplete service left the trial court without jurisdiction, i.e., without authority to enter the judgment.\u201d Id., Supplemental Opinion, 187 Ariz. 487, 488, 930 P.2d 1001, 1002\\.\n\nIgnoring a personally served citation, i.e., a ticket, allows the court to enter a default judgement. In the case of a citation that was not personally served and where personal service was not waived means the court never had jurisdiction in order to render a default judgment.\n\nThere is a time limit within which personal service must be completed for a complaint. I've found sources that claim both 120 days and 180 days from when the court was made aware of the complaint. Some sources also claim that the court must be notified and processes started within 10 days of the date of the infraction. If service is not completed within that time frame then the complaint is dropped and no record is retained.\n\nSo, yes, parking tickets do not have to be personally served according to statute and, yes, a person in Arizona has to be personally served with a moving violation citation.

They can be left on the windshield and if there's no response, a summons can be sent by regular mail. However, for moving violations captured by cameras, personal service is required for the court to have jurisdiction.

Suspect is pulled over for speeding. He has no outstanding warrant for his arrest in any crime and is not currently serving time for a crime. This is legal.\n2. The suspect's cell phone is in plain view of the officer when he approaches the suspect. As there is no evidence of contraband otherwise, the officer has no need to look at the cellphone.\n3. The police officer performs a warrentless search of the car without the suspect's approval. He has no probable cause to do this. The suspect has not given permission to do this. From here on out, the officer is no performing an illegal search and seizure of evidence against the suspect.\n4. The officer finds the illegal fire arm under the suspects seat, which is not in plane view. The nature of why the fire arm is illegal is not applicable at this point. Possession of this evidence is probable cause to arrest the suspect.\n5. The officer continues the search of the car and siezes it and its contents for evidence processing.\n6. The phone is now evidence and is unlocked against the suspect's will and cataloged for any further evidence of possible crimes.\n\nThe case relies on the information in parts 3 and 4 being true. If this is not the case, the an illegal search was performed. First, there was nothing in plain view that would lead the officer to suspect that there was any contraband or criminal evidence within the car (the gun was fully concealed from view of the officer as he was giving the ticket to the suspect). If he did not receive affirmative permission from the suspect, the gun would thus be a product of an illegal search, and thus would be removed from evidence in pre\\-trial motions.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: But I'm asking about the phone, not the gun. Not only is the gun gone, but any evidence that was discovered by the gun is now a product of an illegal search and seizure. The phone is what's called \"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree\" and is just as dirty evidence against the suspect as the gun was. As is any evidence of a crime found on the phone. So yes, the digital contents search is illegal, but not because of the ruling on it being digital contents but because the reason for it's seizure was because the illegal search took place to get the suspect arrested and find probable cause to seize the phone.\n\nNow, this all assumes that the suspect didn't meet a few criteria... if he was a paroled convict of another crime OR on probation for another crime, the officer may have probable cause to perform the search, even if the weapon wasn't in plain view.\n\nAdditionally, for argument's sake, lets say that the suspect was speeding because he had just shot someone with the illegal gun and the police were aware of his connection to the crime in some way, because the last text to the deceased was from this guy and it asked the deceased to meet at the spot the body was found. This means that the cops would at the least be looking for him for questioning, if not already filing a warrant for the contents of his cellphone and possible search of his property for evidence. The cops could argue that they were already looking to for this guy in connection to the crime and they were looking for the phone and evidence on the phone would provide probable cause to search his property and would have found the gun that way. Because they were already looking for these specific items on this specific person, they could established discovery of them would have happened during the course of due process of the law and then the items would be back in play.\n\nGiven your story, it's likely that all evidence of the gun charge would be tossed out as valid to your case, and without evidence of a crime, the suspect will go free. The gun will not be returned as he cannot lawfully posses it, but his phone would be returned and all date the police took from it would be destroyed.\n\nIf you would like to change the circumstances of the situation, give me a heads up.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the scenario described, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of the evidence obtained from the suspect's smartphone?\n\nA) The evidence from the smartphone is admissible because it was found during a routine inventory search of the vehicle.\n\nB) The evidence is inadmissible due to the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine, as it resulted from an initial illegal search of the vehicle.\n\nC) The evidence is admissible because smartphones are not protected under the Fourth Amendment's \"papers and effects\" clause.\n\nD) The evidence is admissible because the suspect was arrested for possession of an illegal firearm, giving police the right to search all contents of the vehicle.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

They decide to issue 150,000 shares at $1 per share, split equally among them. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the tax implications of this company formation?\n\nA) Alice will owe taxes on $50,000 of income for selling her idea to the company, while Bob and Charlie will not face any immediate tax consequences.\n\nB) Charlie will need to report the sale of his truck to the company on his taxes, potentially realizing a gain or loss, while Alice and Bob will not face any immediate tax consequences.\n\nC) All three partners will owe income taxes on their newly acquired shares, as they received them at below fair market value.\n\nD) None of the partners will face any immediate tax consequences from the issuance of shares, but Charlie may need to report the sale of his truck if it was previously a business asset.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The issuance of shares in a newly founded company does not create a taxable event for the founders, regardless of the value assigned to the shares. However, when non-cash assets are contributed to the company in exchange for shares, those transactions may have tax implications. In this case, Charlie's contribution of a truck could be a taxable event if the truck was previously used as a business asset, potentially resulting in a gain or loss depending on its written-down value.

It dictates:\n\n> An accessory after the fact is any person who, after the commission of a felony, shall harbor, conceal, or aid the offender, knowing or having reasonable ground to believe that he has committed the felony, **and** with the intent that he may avoid or escape from arrest, trial, conviction, or punishment.\n\nThe first part is purely fact\\-based, and the second is the required state of mind. You need both for a conviction. The required intent makes it not a crime if for example a bank robber presses a gun against the taxi driver's head and forces them to get them to the airport.\n\n[Theft is a felony in Louisiana](https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78605), as it can be punished by hard labor, which is meeting the [definition of a felony in Louisiana](https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78337). That is, if one does cross certain bars of value or repeat offenses.\n\nSo, for simplicity let's say our felon positively robbed a bank and stole 25001 USD. Now he stops a taxi and tells the driver to get somewhere...\n\nWhere is the line between the taxi driver helpfully offering to drive the robber to safety and the robber forcing them at which point the driver no longer has the required state of mind? **That** is up to the trier of fact to decide.\n\nNow, it can be really important what is done by the taxi driver after the act of assisting. Such behavior can prove the intent or lack thereof. Let's stay with the example of the taxi driver and the bank robber:\n\n* The taxi driver, once dropping off the robber and being in a somewhat safe distance calls the police to tell them truthfully \"Your robber was at \\[that location] when I dropped him off 2 minutes ago! He was threatening me with a gun!\" \\- He clearly doesn't have the intent of having the robber avoid justice, he actually shows that he wants the robber caught. The driver even is a valuable witness!\n* The taxi driver instead calls the cops and tells them he's at an entirely different place from where he dropped him off. This might be a genuine mistake, though unlikely. More likely it is the intent to have the robber get away, the intent might be proven to a trier of facts.\n* The taxi driver vanishes into the night, and never reports anything. This is quite tricky and might or might not be seen as trying to get the robber to evade justice, but that depends on the circumstances quite a lot more.\n\nSo, to reiterate: the question for the prosecution is not just \"did the person help the felony\" but also \"did they have the intent to protect the felon?\" If they believe they can satisfy both prongs, then they might press charges. If they have trouble with the intent, then they might want them as a witness against the felon, not as an accessory to the crime.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Louisiana, under what circumstances could a person who drives a shoplifter away from the scene of the crime be considered an accessory after the fact?\n\nA) If they knew about the theft and drove the shoplifter away, regardless of their intent\nB) Only if they received payment or other benefits for driving the shoplifter\nC) If they knew about the theft, drove the shoplifter away, AND intended to help the shoplifter avoid arrest or punishment\nD) If they drove the shoplifter away, even if they were unaware of the theft\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Louisiana law, to be considered an accessory after the fact, two conditions must be met:\n1. The person must aid the offender after the commission of a felony, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that a felony was committed.\n2. The person must have the specific intent to help the offender avoid arrest, trial, conviction, or punishment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't include the element of intent. Option B is incorrect because receiving payment is not a requirement. Option D is incorrect because knowledge of the crime is necessary. Option C correctly combines both the action of aiding the offender and the intent to help them avoid justice, which are the two key components required by Louisiana law to be considered an accessory after the fact."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/91837/who-would-actually-have-claim-on-the-buried-treasure-in-the-film-holes", "docs_id": 91837, "title": "Who would actually have claim on the buried treasure in the film Holes?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> In the film *Holes*\\*, in the early 1900s, a man named Stanley Yelnats was robbed of a chest full of treasure. The bandit later buried the treasure on the property of a man named Trout Walker in Texas. Years later, in the late 90s or early 00s, Stanley Yelnats' great\\-grandson (also named Stanley Yelnats) found the treasure.\n\n> In the scene where the treasure is found, the owner of the property (Trout Walker's grand\\-daughter) insists that the chest belongs to her because it was found on her property. But the chest has Stanley Yelnats'name on it, so Stanley's lawyer takes it and it goes to Stanley's family.\n\nI have two questions, assuming real\\-life Texas inheritance and property law:\n\n1. Who is the rightful owner of the chest of treasure?\n2. Regardless of who the ultimate rightful owner is, did Stanley's lawyer have the right to take something off of the Walker's property just because it had Stanley's name on it?\n\n\\* *I think this is all same in the book as well, but I haven't read it, so I'm not sure*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In all likelihood, the property would have gone to Stanley. Keep in mind that Warden Walker and her family owned the remains of the town of Green Lake, which had become a ghost town in the 20 years between Kissin' Kate's crimes and her death. The books likely take place in the year of the release. In all likelihood, the state owned the lake proper, and thus the lake bed, even if Trout bought all the buildings as the town population dwindled. In all likelihood, the loot was abandoned property on public land (the dried lakebed). As such, it was Hector and Zeroni opperating on their own, who discovered the treasure and thus would be able to claim it as their property. As we do not see the deed to the land, this is an assumption. However, the lack of any fencing around a juvenile detention facility probably hints that they were operating on land that the camp could not legally fence off and used the threat of dehydration to deter escape.\n\nIf it was on the property, there might be a legal dispute as it was stolen property in the first place and the estate of Stanley Yelnats would be able to make a claim against Warden Walker that they need to return the goods that were not theirs. This is complicated by the fact that Warden Walker and her employees are knowingly violating the law by using Juvenile Offenders as unpaid labor, despite the fact that they are private state contractors and advertise themselves as a counseling service and are engaging in computer crimes to cover up two offenders running off into the desert as well as fraud. This results in the state seizing control of the facility to properly dispose of those in it's custody and the property itself. This means that even if Warden Walker rightly owned the land, the state felt it like it was in everyone's interest to back the Yelnats' claim to the contents of the chest (In all likelihood, they could have included it as a settlement to prevent a lawsuit as the state would be a party to any case (at the least, they failed to properly inspect the facility and it's operations) and the Yelnats and Zeroni's are the victims who were impacted the most. It could also have been used to incentivize or thank them for testimony against the Walker operation.).\n\nIt could also be the case that the book ended prior to the treasurer's ownership being rightfully decided by the law. The Yelnats were independently wealthy thanks to Yelnats III's discovery of a cure for foot oder (Sploosh), which was so successful that they were able to advertise it with a Superbowl commercial with a celebrity endorsement from a Major League Baseball player no less. While the baseball player likely was doing it at a significant discount because his testimony lead to Yelnats IV's wrongful conviction and abuse at Camp Green Lake, the price for a 30 second spot in Super Bowl XXXIII (1999\\) was $1\\.6 million dollars and was likely payed for from (Sploosh's) own income as an advertising expense is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that Holes is not a story about the law (this comes as early as Stanley IV's trial, where he is not given an lawyer and his family cannot afford one, along with some testimony that would not have been allowed being allowed to be heard.). The point of the treasure being found was symbolic of the family curse being lifted, a result of Stanley carrying Zero up the mount where they found water, and allowing him to drink while he sang the fabled song (The terms that Stanley's No good pig stealing Great\\-Great\\-Grandfather failed to oblige to Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni's Great\\-Great\\-Grandmother that brought the curse upon the family.). As a major theme of the book is the choices of the past affecting the present, the treasure is a symbolic victory. Stanley IV is rewarded for fulfilling his ancestor's promise out of the goodness of his own heart and no idea that he was doing this. When Zero reveal his real name as Zeroni, Stanley has no idea of the relation to the gypsy woman who cursed his family (if I recall the book spells it out for the reader. I remember in my first read, I forgot Madam Zeroni's name by the time we learn it's Zero's name.). As such, the legality of do they own it because it was stolen and their name was on it wasn't considered. Green Lake is also recieves the first rain it has in 100 years after the treasure is found and Zero is taken with Stanley's lawyers out of Green Lake (it's implied that Sam, Kissin' Kate's lover, whose death at the hands of the towns folk brought about the cursed drought, had also been broken.).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the film \"Holes\" and its legal implications, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the ownership and retrieval of the treasure chest?\n\nA) The Warden (Trout Walker's granddaughter) has the strongest legal claim to the chest because it was found on her property, regardless of the name on it.\n\nB) Stanley Yelnats IV has an uncontestable right to the chest solely because it bears his great-grandfather's name, and his lawyer was justified in immediately removing it from the property.\n\nC) The ownership of the chest is legally complex, potentially involving claims from the Yelnats family, the state, and the property owner, with the final decision likely influenced by factors beyond simple property law.\n\nD) Zero (Hector Zeroni) has the strongest claim to the chest as the person who physically discovered it, regardless of its location or the name inscribed on it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the ownership of the chest involves multiple legal considerations. While the chest bears Stanley Yelnats' name, it was found on property owned by the Warden, which complicates ownership claims. Additionally, the chest's contents were originally stolen property, adding another layer of legal complexity. The state's involvement due to the illegal operations at Camp Green Lake further complicates matters. The final decision would likely consider various factors including the original theft, the location of discovery, the name on the chest, and potential settlements to avoid lawsuits.

The term \"interstate commerce\" merely refers to the movement of property from one U.S. state into another; and it is sufficient if the property has recently moved interstate as a result of a transaction or a series of related transactions that have not been fully completed or consummated at the time of the person's acts as alleged.\n\nAll US states also have laws regarding receipt of stolen property; however, there usually is no minimum dollar amount in many jurisdictions, and, of course, the requirement in Federal law regarding interstate commerce does not apply. Also, in many states (Ohio, for example), the burden to prove criminal intent is not as stringent or is nonexistent. This means that one can be charged with the crime \\- usually a minor degree of felony \\- even if the person did not know the item in question was stolen. In the Ohio case of State v. Awad, the goods did not need to actually be stolen, just represented as such.\n\nReceiving stolen property and possession of stolen property are treated as separate offenses in some jurisdictions. The distinguishing element is when the person knew that the property was stolen. If the person knew that the property was stolen at the time he received it, the crime is receiving stolen property. If the person did not know the property was stolen at the time she received it but found out after receiving possession, the crime is possession of stolen property.\n\nThe state must prove that the defendant received or possessed the property for a dishonest purpose. If, for example, the person acquired possession for the purpose of returning the property to its lawful owner, no crime has been committed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John receives a valuable painting from his friend Mike, who obtained it through illegal drug sales. John is unaware of the painting's origin at the time he receives it, but later discovers its illicit source. The painting is worth $10,000 and was transported across state lines. Under which circumstances could John potentially be charged with a crime?\n\nA) John can only be charged with receipt of stolen property under federal law, as the painting's value exceeds $5,000 and crossed state lines.\n\nB) John cannot be charged with any crime, as he was unaware of the painting's illegal origin when he received it.\n\nC) John can be charged with possession of stolen property under state law, but not under federal law due to his initial lack of knowledge.\n\nD) John could potentially face charges under both federal and state laws, depending on specific statutes and the timing of his knowledge acquisition.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of multiple aspects of laws regarding stolen property:\n\n1. Federal law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2315) requires knowledge that the property was stolen, a value over $5,000, and interstate commerce. While John didn't know initially, he later became aware, potentially meeting the knowledge requirement. The painting's value and interstate transport satisfy the other conditions.\n\n2. State laws vary, but many don't require knowledge at the time of receipt, and some distinguish between \"receiving\" and \"possessing\" stolen property based on when knowledge was acquired.\n\n3. The painting's origin from drug sales complicates matters, as it's not directly stolen but obtained through illegal means.\n\n4. John's lack of initial knowledge doesn't automatically protect him from all charges, especially under varying state laws.\n\nTherefore, John could potentially face charges under both federal and state laws, depending on specific statutes and how his acquisition of knowledge is interpreted.

Since they are no longer allowed to discuss anything with you once you give them the go\\-away notice, one should probably hire an attorney to exercise the nuclear option. \nYou can also request proof that you owe the money: they are suppose to notify you of the right to dispute the debt with 5 days of first contact, which gives you 30 days to dispute the debt.

The [RICO statutes](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1961) (18 USC 1961 (3\\)) states that a person \u2018includes any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property\u2019. A corporation is a person for the purposes of access to the federal courts, for purposes of forming contracts, and enjoyment of First and Fourth Amendment rights, but not for purposes of voting or 5th Amendment immunity. [1 USC 8(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/8) states that \n\n> the words \u201cperson\u201d, \u201chuman being\u201d, \u201cchild\u201d, and \u201cindividual\u201d, shall\n>  include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born\n>  alive at any stage of development\n\nwhich states a sufficient condition, but not a necessary one.\n\nIn Washington state, [RCW 1\\.16\\.080](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=1.16.080) says that \n\n> The term \u201cperson\u201d may be construed to include the United States, this\n>  state, or any state or territory, or any public or private corporation\n>  or limited liability company, as well as an individual.\n\nWashington does not define \u2018individual\u2019, but we can call on Black\u2019s Law Dictionary to learn that\n\n> this term denotes a single person as distinguished from a group or\n>  class, and also, very commonly, a private or natural person as\n>  distinguished from a partnership, corporation, or association; but it\n>  is said that this restrictive signification is not necessarily\n>  inherent in the word, and that it may, in proper cases, include\n>  artificial persons.\n\nAnd finally, Roe v. Wade 410 U.S. 113, 157 holds that an unborn instance of *homo sapiens* is not a person for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. In short, there is no clear and settled answer to the question.\n\nCourts do not always refuse to hear ground\\-breaking cases, and in case this issue is ever realized, I am confident that cert. will be granted. The point of law is, after all, to state general principles regarding what is forbidden or allowed in a society, thus it must be capable of addressing novel situations. We will have to await that case, but the prospects for your client are good. It is obvious that \u201cpersons\u201d have a special position under the law, it is recognised that they have both rights and responsibilities that other things do not have. Summarizing over millenia of jurisprudential thinking, we can see that the special status of persons (when not reduced to divine gift: not applicable under current US law) derives from the fact that persons have a capacity to reason, and to choose actions based on their reasoning. In the context of our current knowledge, this is mostly coextensive with being an instance of *homo sapiens*, though in case of severe or complete limitation of those faculties, an instance of *homo sapiens* may not be legally accorded the full set of rights and responsibilities of *homo sapiens*.\n\nIn fact, the law does not have a definition of *homo sapiens*. Before objecting that science teaches us that only earthlings can be *homo sapiens*, we should be remember that courts do not always hold that terms as defined in a scientific discipline are to be interpreted that way under the law, which is how SCOTUS in [Nix v. Hedden 149 U.S. 304](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/149/304/case.html) was able to hold that a tomato is not a legal fruit. The plain meaning of *homo sapiens* is completely consistent with extending legal coverage to Kryptonians.\n\nThus it will be the finding of the court that petitioner, not a member of the species *homo sapiens* but endowed with the faculty of reason and free will, has all of the rights and responsibilities of a \u2018person\u2019 under Kansas law, and has the right to be adopted.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the legal analysis provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential legal status of an extra-terrestrial entity in the United States?\n\nA) Extra-terrestrial entities are explicitly excluded from the definition of \"person\" under U.S. law.\n\nB) The legal definition of \"person\" is uniformly applied across all U.S. statutes and court rulings.\n\nC) An extra-terrestrial entity with the capacity to reason could potentially be considered a \"person\" under U.S. law, despite not being Homo sapiens.\n\nD) Only members of the species Homo sapiens can be legally considered \"persons\" under U.S. law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The text exchange between John and Sarah could potentially create a binding agreement for a new lease, as it contains an offer from John and an acceptance from Sarah. However, the enforceability of this agreement depends on Ohio's specific real estate regulations. Real estate contracts are often subject to additional requirements, such as needing to be in writing or in a particular form.

In this case, C would only face additional charges if it could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew or had reason to know A was an undercover officer. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the charges are not automatic and depend on the perpetrator's knowledge. \nOption C, while partially true due to the self-defense argument, doesn't address the specific question about additional charges related to A's status as an officer. \nOption D is incorrect because undercover officers are not always protected by special statutes, especially when the perpetrator has no knowledge of their status."}, "38": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/65306/new-york-city-tenant-rights", "docs_id": 65306, "title": "New York City- Tenant Rights", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a question regarding tenant's rights under a leased property; I can't seem to find the answer anywhere online.\n\n***What are the obligations of a tenant in a 1yr lease to provide notice of vacating the premises by the end of the lease, if there is no language in the lease describing such a notice?

Should this person be researching all local county and city\nordinances to see if this is legal in his area, or should this be\nconsidered fine anywhere within the USA?\n8. Does it matter what size the billboard is? For instance, does a 7'x7' billboard carry less lawful risk than a 30'x30' billboard?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Laws regarding billboards and advertising are very local in nature and are typically handled under city/county zoning ordinances. Start with calling your local county zoning office. They will tell you the city/county laws regarding your particular residential zoning overlay, if city or state laws supersede county laws, and recent changes in law that might matter and if the sign might be grandfathered.\n\nThere can be different types of \"residential\" zoning and the city/county will tell you this; some allow limited commercial use and signage, and some don't. The housing subdivision you are in may also have covenants; you'll know if there are covenants if you received information when you bought property in that subdivision.\n\n**1,2,3,4,8:** These depend on local laws.\n\n**5:** Very generally speaking, land owners typically do not have absolute rights to land usage; that is the rationale behind zoning laws (among others, like health and public safety, building codes, national defense, etc.), because some types of land usage impact adjacent users and the general public.\n\n**6, 7:** Potential consequences include fines and requirements to take the billboard down, but again, those possibilities are very localized. The size of the billboard could come into play; again, this will be very localized. Some signage may be grandfathered, too.\n\nIn order for the city/county to look at the situation and possibly take action, you may have to file a written protest with the zoning office; they would help with the process. You may have to present your case at a public city council or county commission meeting, but that basically involves saying such and such is happening and you want the city/county attorney to look into relevant laws. It would help your case if you had a list of names of others in the area who are also unhappy about the billboard. I doubt you will need legal representation to lodge a protest, but if it comes to that, Google for free legal aid in your area.\n\nIf the city/county attorney *won't* take action (which is possible, as this involves prosecutorial discretion as to if the city/county wants to press the issue with the landowner), you can look for free legal aid in your area and consider your options.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner in a residential area has erected a large billboard on their property visible from a main road without obtaining any permits.

Billboard regulations are primarily handled at the local level through city and county zoning ordinances. The local county zoning office is the best starting point to determine the legality of the billboard. They can provide information on specific residential zoning rules, any applicable city or state laws, and whether the billboard violates local ordinances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because property rights are not absolute and are subject to zoning laws and local regulations.\n\nOption B is wrong because billboard regulations can vary significantly between counties and cities within the same state.\n\nOption C is incorrect because local ordinances do indeed apply to personal property use, especially in residential areas, and are often more relevant than federal or state laws in these matters."}, "40": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5140/is-there-a-polite-and-thorough-way-to-request-disclosures-from-my-dentist-about", "docs_id": 5140, "title": "Is there a polite and thorough way to request disclosures from my dentist about who is profiting from certain products or services?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I had a dental appointment this morning, and the dentist (as per usual) insisted that I get an NTI night guard and a Philips Sonicare.

In it, I talk about how I see it as problematic that the identities of LEOs investigating an active case can be publicized. If that case concerns a serial killer, or perhaps members of organized crime, it seems like the investigators could become the target of assassination, threats, blackmail and bribery.\n\nAccording to [this article](https://www.lawfareblog.com/can-law-enforcement-officers-refuse-identify-themselves), LEOs are not mandated by federal or state law to disclose their identity, though this may be mandated at a municipal level.

A plainclothes officer, not so much.\n\nIn most circumstances, a police officer is not required to identify themselves as such. This includes normal interactions, like buying a sandwich for lunch and actions that might be thought of as \"police work\": investigation, surveillance, and undercover work. However, when they are executing a \"police power\", like entering premises subject to a warrant or probable cause, making an arrest, or issuing an order they need to identify themselves as a police officer \\- not doing so can lead to confusion: always a bad thing where firearms might be involved.\n\nAs to lying, a police officer has no general duty to be truthful except in very narrow circumstances. They must tell you if you are under arrest if you ask and they must read you your rights if they place you under arrest.

If background information is in order, who provides it. What is the role of the Guadian ad Litem (GAL) in a mediation meeting? Does the GAL take an active role on behalf of the offspring or just reply to inquiries.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Usually and ideally, a GAL would take an active role in parenting questions, while taking a secondary role in property division and maintenance with the primary concern being that the economic arrangements are sustainable and don't subject the child to hardship when with the other parent (e.g. many divorcing parents fail to realize that maintaining two households will result in more child related expenses than one).\n\nI will assume that you are asking from the perspective of a party to the divorce and not from the perspective of a mediator, although the phrasing is not entirely clear. Some basics:\n\n1. Have a good command of the facts about your finances, your ex's finances, and the children's schedules and needs (assuming that there are children). For example, it would be good to have school calendars as far forward as they are available, to know the children's medical providers, and to have a firm command of their extracurricular activities, their friends and the requirements of any childcare providers. Often child support worksheets will be mandatory for a settlement to be approved, so get those worksheets and fill in the facts you know already. Bring a calculator so you can consider new assumptions and evaluate financial proposals accurately.\n\nIf you think you have received inaccurate disclosures, be prepared to explain in detail what you think is inaccurate and why you think that this is the case.\n\nIf domestic violence has been an issue, there are restraining orders that are or have been in place, there are abuse or neglect allegations present (including emotional abuse of a spouse or children), or the co\\-parents have had trouble coordinating and reaching decisions without outside assistance, be prepared to explain these situations in factual detail so you can avoid summarizing the situation in a vague way.\n\nBring anything you might need to refresh your recollection about relevant facts with you to mediation.\n\n2. If you haven't received full disclosure of your spouse's finances, insist on receiving that, ideally before going to mediation and absolutely before reaching a deal.\n3. Spend time considering possible resolutions of property, maintenance and parenting matters in advance. Very early on in mediation each of you will be asked what you want and mediation shouldn't be the first time that you have thoughtfully considered the question.\n4. Spend time thinking about what you need on a non\\-negotiable basis to survive \\- to be able to meet basic needs for food, shelter, clothing, health care, etc. for you and your children, and also about what your ex needs and how your ex can achieve it. Proposing ways to achieve objectives that your ex hasn't considered that are viable is a good way to get a resolution.\n5. Ideally, attend a parenting class (mandatory in many jurisdictions before getting a divorce that involves children) before attending mediation. Keep in mind that children are not prizes or bargaining chips and that you need to consider their needs as well as your own. Your kids love both of you even though you can no longer manage to live with each other.\n6. Do not utilize the children as sounding boards for mediation stances and do not try to use them as decision makers or conduits for communication between the co\\-parents.\n7. Recognize that in most states, marital fault is irrelevant, and that starting a new relationship is natural and routine, even if it makes your skin crawl that your ex is starting a new relationship. Take an attitude of focusing on what the deal does for you rather than what the deal does for your ex. This is about you getting what you need, not about making your ex worse off.\n8. Be prepared to walk away from mediation without a deal if necessary, because your ex won't accept a reasonable deal. Maybe half of mediations end without a settlement.\n9. Recognize that it may be possible to reach partial resolution (e.g. splitting up tangible personal property; figuring out how holidays will be handled with the children; agreeing on schools that children will attend; figuring out who, if anyone, will continue to live in a marital residence; stipulating to the value of particular assets; stipulating regarding each party's income; stipulating regarding what is and isn't separate property where you can agree; agreements to disclose information), without resolving all issues. Partial resolutions reduce uncertainty and make it easier to prepare for and conduct a permanent orders hearing on the remaining issues.\n10. Even if you can't afford to hire a lawyer to represent you in the entire case, pay for an hour or two of a lawyer's time to evaluate what kind of property division, maintenance award and parenting arrangements are within the range of the possible and likely if you go forward to a permanent orders hearing.\n11. Be prepared to put the terms of anything that is agreed to at mediation in writing.\n12. Mediators will usually tell you if they need forms signed, payments made, or a \"mediation statement\" in advance. Do everything required on time. A \"mediation statement\" is a summary of the key facts and your position on a fair resolution and could be a couple to a dozen pages depending upon the complexity of the case. Be clear in a mediation statement about what is O.K. to share with the other side and what is for the mediator's information only. When a mediator asks for a mediation statement the main reason for doing so is to save time that the mediator is charging you per hour for 50\\-50\\. A mediation statement can make getting the mediator up to speed on the facts more efficient and less likely to omit important facts and the mediator needs to learn the key facts to be effective.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the role of a Guardian ad Litem (GAL) in a divorce mediation meeting?\n\nA) The GAL should focus primarily on property division and maintenance issues.\nB) The GAL should take an active role in parenting questions and a secondary role in financial matters.\nC) The GAL should remain completely neutral and only respond when directly asked for input.\nD) The GAL should advocate equally for both parents' positions regarding child-related matters.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, the Guardian ad Litem (GAL) should take an active role in parenting questions while taking a secondary role in property division and maintenance issues.

What's the purpose of indicting Mr. Trump if indictments are only an accusation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> 1. How many indictments does it take for Donald Trump to be imprisoned?\n\nAn unlimited amount. Imprisonment is usually authorized as a result of a conviction rather than from an indictment.\n\nPretrial detention following an indictment but prior to a conviction is permitted, but discretionary in the judgment of the judge. Also, there is a right to post a judicially determined reasonable bond to obtain release from pretrial detention after one is indicted and before one is convicted in the vast majority of cases (including the ones that President Trump is facing).\n\n> 2. Can a person who is indicted, before running for president, become president?\n\nYes. Indeed, the majority view of legal scholars (it is has never been tested in a real case) is that someone who is convicted and serving prison sentence can still become President if that is who the voters choose.\n\n> 3. What's the purpose of indicting Mr. Trump if indictments are only an accusation?\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gzUnW.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gzUnW.png)\n\nAn indictment is a pre\\-requisite to trying someone for a felony in federal court. To convict someone of a crime one needs to first indict them, then have a jury trial, and then have a jury unanimously vote to convict a person, before they can be convicted of a crime and sentenced for it. Even after conviction, there is a statutory (but not a constitutional) right to a direct appeal of that conviction to an appellate court.\n\nAlso, an indictment is more than a mere accusation. An indictment in a determination of a [grand jury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States#Rubber_stamp_for_the_prosecution) that probable cause exists to believe that the person indicted committed the crime charged. In the federal court system grand juries are composed of 16 to 23 members and 12 members of the grand jury must concur in a decision to indict a defendant on a charge for there to be an indictment on that charge.\n\nThis prevents people from enduring criminal prosecutions on charges that a majority of a grand jury finds are so baseless that there is not sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that the defendant committed that crime. The grand jury must base its decision to indict or not on actual evidence in support of the charges in the form of sworn witness testimony and exhibits, not just the allegations of the prosecutor.\n\nAs a practical matter, the standards of professionalism in federal criminal prosecutions is so high that [almost all charges sought by federal prosecutors from grand juries result in indictments on those charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/11/24/the-rarity-of-a-federal-grand-jury-not-indicting-visualized/) (federal grand juries refuse to indict approximately one in 16,000 times).\n\nBut, in state courts that use grand juries, which can't pick and choose only the best cases to prosecute, grand juries routinely refuse to indict defendants on a substantial share of charges brought to them by prosecutors (on the order of one in 20\\). One source [notes](http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2020/b2019_20/committees/ctte_s_jud_1/documents/testimony/20200123_04.pdf):\n\n> Statistical figures showing a higher prevalence of grand jury\n> reluctance to follow the government in ages past are almost\n> nonexistent. However, a table of felony arrests in New York County\n> between 1900 and 1907 found on page 111 of the 1926 book The Prisoner\n> at the Bar by Arthur Train provides some rare illumination. In those\n> seven years, some 5,214 out of 57,241 people were arrested by the\n> police on felony charges whom New York state grand jurors decided not\n> to indict.\n\nGrand juries are especially likely to decline to indict defendants in cases involving [celebrities](https://www.nfl.com/news/second-texas-grand-jury-declines-to-indict-browns-qb-deshaun-watson-on-criminal-), [politicians](http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2020/b2019_20/committees/ctte_s_jud_1/documents/testimony/20200123_04.pdf), [law enforcement officers](https://abcnews.go.com/US/breonna-taylor-case-sparks-renewed-scrutiny-grand-juries/story?id=73438566), and other [high profile cases with political implications](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mississippi-grand-jury-declines-indict-woman-emmett-killing-rcna42274). *See also* Kaeleigh Wiliams, \"[Grand Juries Should Not Hear Police Misconduct Cases: Grand Juries will Indict Anything, but a Police Officer](https://scholarship.law.slu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&context=lawjournalonline)\" *SLU Law Journal Online* 79 (2021\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the role and implications of indictments in the U.S. legal system, particularly in high-profile cases?\n\nA) Indictments automatically result in imprisonment, with the number of indictments directly correlating to the length of incarceration.\n\nB) Grand juries always indict in federal cases, making the process a mere formality for prosecutors.\n\nC) Indictments prevent individuals from running for or becoming president, acting as a constitutional safeguard against potentially criminal candidates.\n\nD) Indictments represent a finding of probable cause by a grand jury, but do not guarantee conviction, and their effectiveness may vary in cases involving high-profile individuals.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate representation of indictments based on the provided information. Indictments are indeed a finding of probable cause by a grand jury, not a conviction. They are a necessary step in the legal process for felony charges but do not guarantee conviction. The information also suggests that grand juries may be less likely to indict in high-profile cases involving celebrities, politicians, or law enforcement officers, indicating that the effectiveness of indictments can vary in such instances. \n\nOption A is incorrect because indictments do not automatically result in imprisonment; conviction is required for that. \n\nOption B is misleading; while federal grand juries indict in the vast majority of cases (refusing only about 1 in 16,000), it's not always the case, and state grand juries refuse to indict more frequently. \n\nOption C is false; the information clearly states that indicted individuals can still run for and become president, with some legal scholars arguing this applies even to convicted individuals."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8618/outside-of-regular-self-defence-when-is-fighting-legal", "docs_id": 8618, "title": "Outside of regular self defence, when is fighting legal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know this is a weird question. I'm curious as to what counts as assault, in the sense a person would be likely found guilty of it in court. Generally assault is considered fighting someone who did not want to fight you. So does this mean if two people agree to a fight, it's legal? This seems to be the case with MMA where they wear virtually no safety equipment.\n\nWhat if an aggressor gets up in another persons face, then would the person be able to hit first? I saw this in a YouTube video: a police officer responded to a 911 call. The person who he called was a army drill sergeant and started yelling at the police officer and getting up in his face (like in movies like *Full Metal Jacket*). Though the drill sergeant technically didn't touch the police officer, the officer hit him in the face, pinned him and arrested him. Though there were other factors like the drill instructor seemed to be on drugs.\n\nIf a person does something minor like throws water at a person or shoves a person would that count as assault? For example in sports games you occasionally see a player or coach shove someone. If there was a prank like shoot someone with a water gun, could this be assault if they didn't agree to it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> An [assault](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault) is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm.\n\nThere is no need for physical contact in an assault, all that is needed is the *threat* and the *apparent, present ability*. The drill sergeant was behaving in a threatening manner and had an apparent, present ability to cause harm; he was guilty of assault.\n\nConsensually engaging in a *legal* contact sport lacks the threat of bodily harm; that is to say that the bodily harm is a risk of the sport but it is not the object of it. Of course, an *illegal* sport where death or maiming is an inherent part would leave the participants open to assault (and battery) charges \\- you cannot agree to do illegal things.\n\nWhat is necessary to constitute the threat and the apparent means depends on the whole of the circumstances. A person throwing water when they had threatened the victim with acid is most certainly assault. Pointing a replica pistol at someone who doesn't know it is a replica constituted the threat and apparent means in one action.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John and Mike are arguing in a bar.

John's actions of yelling in Mike's face and standing very close with clenched fists constitute a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause harm, which meets the definition of assault even without physical contact. Mike's action of forcefully pushing John is a clear physical act that goes beyond what might be considered necessary for self-defense in this situation, thus also constituting assault. While Mike might claim self-defense, the use of force in response to a non-physical threat could be seen as disproportionate.

Anyway I explained the situation at the court house and I was forgiven without any penalties but they did declare a mistrial on the case I was involved in \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The potential problem is if there is a form which you had to sign which says \"I am a US citizen\", and you signed the form (who reads the fine print, anyhow?). Unfortunately, that statement is false, and there are consequences for making a [false statement](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.37.htm). However, that law penalizes false statements with the intent to deceive, not mistaken statements. Nevertheless, this is a matter that a professional really needs to deal with. If there was no form and they didn't verbally ask you to assert that you are a citizen, then there is less of a problem (for you), but still one needs to be extremely cautious in dealing with the court.\n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nIt is highly likely that the form contained wording like \"swear\" or \"certify\" and mentions \"perjury\", so the error would be in the ballpark of perjury. Perjury is making \"a false statement under oath or swears to the truth of a false statement previously made and the statement is required or authorized by law to be made under oath\". Aggravated perjury is perjury which \"is made during or in connection with an official proceeding and is material\". The term \"material\" means \"matters; is not inconsequential\". The consequence of a non\\-citizen improperly serving on a jury is that a mistrial has occurred, which is not inconsequential. Aggravated felony is a third degree felony. The [penal code](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/docs/PE/htm/PE.12.htm) says that\n\n> An individual adjudged guilty of a felony of the third degree shall be\n>  punished by imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\n>  for any term of not more than 10 years or less than 2 years.\n> \n> \n> (b) In addition to imprisonment, an individual adjudged guilty of a\n>  felony of the third degree may be punished by a fine not to exceed\n>  $10,000\\.\n\nI must emphasize that an essential element is \"intent to deceive and with knowledge of the statement's meaning\", an element that cannot be present if there is no awareness of such a statement. Thus an innocent mistake could be legally excused. When you become aware that a statement made under oath was false (assuming such a statement was made), then in maintaining the falsehood, that would be intentional deceit. This is why it is necessary to consult with a lawyer.\n\nOn the Houston form, you would have to check the \"are a US citizen\" box. The Fort Bend county form has you certify and sign on the front page: it does not require you to certify that you are a US citizen, only to certify (and sign) if you are *not* \u2013 so if you failed to read the back side, that isn't a literally false statement.

[(Source.)](http://hitchwiki.org/en/Hitchhiking_at_night)\n\nBut buses can be infrequent at night. It may sometimes be faster to hitchhike. Also, hitchhiking is free.\n\nAt a traffic light, the [standard hitchhiking strategy](http://hitchwiki.org/en/Traffic_light_hitchhiking) is to get drivers to open their window a tiny bit, then to ask them for a lift. If there's an empty bike lane between you and the car, this is probably more difficult.\n\nIt may not be wise to step into the bike lane. (Bicycles are fairly quiet, and a cyclist may be text messaging instead of watching for pedestrians in his lane.)\n\nBut I still wonder whether or not it's legal to step into the lane, in order to ask for a ride.\n\nThe relevant laws\n=================\n\nHere are the relevant excerpts from the Ontario [Highway Traffic Act](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/rso-1990-c-h8/latest/):\n\n* 1 (1\\).

The usage that is normal for a bicycle lane is to ride bicycles in it. That remains true even if no bicycles are ever actually ridden on it.\n\nThe law you quote directly states that it **is** part of the roadway. The definition doesn't require the bicycle lane to meet all of the conditions listed, just at least one of them.\n\nSince a bike lane is designed not just for vehicular traffic but a specific kind of vehicular traffic, it would be considered roadway \u2014 again, even if nobody ever used it for cycling at all.\n\nSince doing so is explicitly disallowed, it would be a breach of law to do it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Ontario, Canada, under what circumstances would it be legal to step into a bike lane to solicit a ride from a car driver?\n\nA) When the bike lane is empty and no cyclists are present\nB) During late night hours when bike lanes are rarely used\nC) On snowy days when fewer cyclists are on the road\nD) It is never legal to do so\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, a bike lane is considered part of the roadway, as it is \"improved, designed or ordinarily used for vehicular traffic.\" The Act explicitly states that \"No person, while on the roadway, shall solicit a ride from the driver of a motor vehicle other than a public passenger conveyance.\" This prohibition applies regardless of the time of day, weather conditions, or current usage of the bike lane.

She has said she cannot look into the evidence or she has so many other work to do. How can a judge behave like this to public?\n2. Is she a public servant?\n3. How can a judge say what ever they want and nobody can react? Is that the law? Nobody over the judge in the court?\n\nI saw another real court video, a girl said \"adios\" to the judge and the fine amount was doubled.\n\n4. Any where written how to behave in the court and what all things anyone can say?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, Judge Judy is not a real court. Judith Sheindlin *was* a real judge, but then she retired to be on TV. The show depicts arbitration proceedings, which both parties agreed to. If both parties want it, and if he agrees, you can have arbitration proceedings where R. Lee Ermey presides and keeps order by means of screaming at you and ordering calisthenics on the spot (where failure to comply means you lose automatically). Judge Judy is not a public servant on the show; she's a TV personality.\n\nThat said, real judges have *substantial* power to keep order in the courtroom and to enforce proper decorum. Part of proper courtroom decorum is that you respect the authority of the court, and that you respect the judge. Failure to do so can be criminal contempt of court. Contempt of court in the presence of the judge is the only situation I'm aware of in American law where you can do something wrong and be pronounced guilty of a crime and sentenced to jail on the spot without the ability to even say anything in your own defense beforehand (some places require opportunity to be heard before sentence is imposed or the order becomes final, but not all do). Part of the point of this is that courts only have authority because people are willing to obey them; one of the actual reasons for summary direct criminal contempt is to vindicate the authority of the court. If you're acting like the court can't tell you what to do, the court can send you to jail to make the point that they absolutely can tell you what to do (in practice, jail sentences are often commuted when the contemnor apologizes).\n\nWith the \"Adios\" thing, that wasn't a fine: it was *bail*. Bail is the amount you pay to guarantee you'll show up in court later (if you show up you get it back; if you don't the court keeps it). Disrespecting the court means they're less convinced you will show up because of a sense of obligation, so they can increase bail to add financial incentive.\n\nIn his personal capacity, a judge can be criticized like anyone else. In his courtroom, a judge is *not* the peer of anyone else in the room. The judge is the court; he represents the law (judges used to be stand\\-ins for the King; now that the US is based on the rule of law rather than the rule of a King, judges are stand\\-ins for the law). A phrase sometimes used is that you may or may not respect the judge, but you respect the robe.\n\nSo, yes. If you think a judge is disrespecting you, you are expected to take it and not show disrespect right back. You are expected to show respect to the judge, to the proceedings, and to the other people in the courtroom. Judges occasionally abuse this; there are stories of \"black robe fever,\" in which a judge goes off on someone in the courtroom for no good reason.

The government has a well\\-documented history of human right abuses towards our social group, this includes torture, discrimination in jobs, unfair trials and so on. All of that is well documented by independent human right organizations that are recognized internationally like Amnesty International for instance. Of course, naturally I'm counted as a member of this social group and thus what the government is doing to them applies to me as well.

The proposed law's vague requirement to \"behave ethically\" without further definition fails to meet this standard.\n\nOption A is incorrect because promoting general welfare is not sufficient to overcome constitutional requirements for specificity in laws.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the law applies to all citizens, not just licensed professionals, and even for professionals, such a vague standard would likely be unconstitutional.\n\nOption D is incorrect because courts generally do not rewrite laws to make them constitutional; they can only interpret existing laws or strike them down if found unconstitutional.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the void-for-vagueness doctrine and its application to overly broad or vague laws, particularly in the context of ethical behavior requirements."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51267/is-it-legal-for-a-company-to-not-allow-me-to-download-my-data-unless-i-pay-for-t", "docs_id": 51267, "title": "Is it legal for a company to not allow me to download my data unless I pay for the premium plan?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I started using a website on the free version knowing it was somewhat locked down.

Read the Terms of Service for the site; it is a legally binding contract. The TOS will outline what you agree to when opening an account and using the site. When signing up for the free plan, you agreed to the TOS, and you probably agreed to a stipulation that the site owners are only obligated to release your data when you pay for a premium plan. \n\nYou could try and take them to court and protest the contract, but \\#1, you signed the contract; and \\#2, going to court costs a lot of money.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A user creates a free account on a website and uploads personal data. Later, they discover they can't download their data without upgrading to a paid plan. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the user's rights and ownership of their data?\n\nA) The user automatically owns all data they upload and can demand its return at any time, regardless of the website's terms of service.\n\nB) The user's ownership and access rights to their data depend entirely on whether they are using a free or paid plan.\n\nC) The user's rights regarding their data are primarily governed by the website's terms of service, which they agreed to when creating their account.\n\nD) The user can easily challenge the website's data policies in court without significant financial risk.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the user's rights and access to their data are primarily determined by the website's terms of service (TOS), which the user agreed to when creating their account. The TOS is a legally binding contract that outlines the conditions of use, including data access and ownership. While it may seem unfair, if the TOS stipulates that data download is only available for paid plans, the user has legally agreed to this condition. Options A and B are incorrect because data ownership isn't automatically guaranteed to the user, nor is it solely determined by the type of plan. Option D is misleading because challenging such policies in court can be costly and time-consuming, with no guarantee of success, especially when the user has agreed to the TOS."}}
