According to Section 17(8) of the Computer Misuse Act 1990, an act is unauthorized if the person doing it is not responsible for the computer and entitled to determine whether the act may be done, and does not have consent from such a person. While Alice was given login credentials, this doesn't automatically authorize her to access all parts of the system. Her authorization is likely limited to the specific tasks she was hired to perform. Accessing additional data, even with good intentions, may exceed the scope of her implied consent. The lack of a formal contract doesn't necessarily make her actions unauthorized (ruling out B), but neither does having login credentials automatically authorize all actions (ruling out A).

They can employ agents, such as security guards, to enforce these restrictions. This includes asking skateboarders to leave the premises.

The credit card brand could theoretically go after them, however, as names of credit networks are trademarks, so claiming to accept a card but not doing so is trademark infringement.\n\nFor the second, the answer is \"pretty much\". Since they misrepresented their establishment, there is no mutual assent and therefore no contract. If they try to use \"defrauding the innkeeper statutes\", those require fraudulent intent. If you fully intended to pay for you meal by a credit card, and it was their choice to refuse payment, then you have no fraudulent intent. The only avenue I can see for them is some sort of equity argument, but that would be problematic, especially if they ask for the retail, rather than wholesale, price, and not worth the hassle of collecting.

A recent case, [*Attorney General v Crosland* \\[2021] UKSC 58](https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2021-0160-judgment.pdf), further explains:\n\n> it is a very common feature of appeals in the UK generally that the\n> appellate court consists of a larger panel than the court appealed from.

In\n> such a case the practice is for the appeal to be heard by an enlarged panel of seven or\n> more justices, precisely to clothe it with that greater authority\n\nThe statute establishing this Court [provides](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/4/section/42):\n\n> The Supreme Court is duly constituted in any proceedings only if all of the following conditions are met\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) the Court consists of an uneven number of judges;  \n> \n> (b) the Court consists of at least three judges;  \n> \n> (c) more than half of those judges are permanent judges.\n\n(with the possibility of some deviation in special circumstances). This practice was previously followed in the House of Lords, before being made statutory when the Supreme Court was formed. The UK court does not sit *en banc*, partly because there are twelve permanent judges and that is an even number, and partly because the legal tradition hasn't held it to be worthwhile. An exceptional case was [*R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union* \\[2017] UKSC 5](https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0196-judgment.pdf), heard by eleven judges \\- a record! \\- which happened to be the entire Supreme Court at the time, since there was one vacancy.

Smaller numbers are more typical, such as five.\n\nFor the Supreme Court of the United States, there are nine judges but they do not use panels. It is fairly common for some judges to recuse themselves because they had been involved with proceedings at a lower stage, or if there is a vacancy, and so there are cases where there are an even number of judges actually involved. The US court also has a practice of fairly complex patterns of concurring and dissenting opinions, with justices potentially joining more than one opinion, so it can be subtle to identify where the majority position really lies. It is therefore possible for there to be a tie. If there is a tie on appeal, then the lower court's decision stands, without precedential effect.

The content of the email is always related to specific legal changes that have occurred. The users are not being \"sold\" anything from the content of the email, it contains factual information only.\n\nThe application is subscription based, i.e. you have to pay for an account and using it is a choice. Any email addresses for accounts we hold are active users and we do not harvest this data from anywhere. So all email addresses we have are for real users who actively use the software.\n\nWe are designing a setup wizard which allows users to set preferences on what information they receive.\n\nOne of the settings is **yes or no** as to whether the application should send notifications via email. This raised debate as to what the default setting should be.\n\nThe argument for \"no\" was that users should explicitly give their permission to receive automated emails and therefore this was the correct default.\n\nThe argument for \"yes\" was that the users have implied consent because they are using an application whose sole purpose is to inform them about changes, and email delivery is the primary way of doing this.\n\nThe application is still usable if the user doesn't receive emails because the data which is present in the emails is visible inside a web\\-based interface. The disadvantage of using the application in this way is that \\- unless the user logs in \\- they will not necessarily be aware of any updates. Therefore defaulting email opt\\-in is preferable.\n\nThe pre\\-sale marketing material for the application makes it clear that email delivery is the main delivery method for the information and getting it directly to your inbox is an advantage of using the system.\n\nThe application allows the user to change their settings at any time. So if they opt\\-in to receive emails today, they can opt\\-out tomorrow, and vice versa. They can change their preferences at any time.\n\nWhat are people's thoughts on this? We are based in the UK but deal with customers worldwide. Is this covered or referred to by GDPR?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: GDPR does not require consent. It requires a legal basis. Consent is only one legal basis among many. Some other legal bases are:\n\n* legitimate interest (implying an opt out solution)\n* necessity for performance of a contract\n\nIf your customers pay you to deliver email updates, that contract is the legal basis for sending email updates. The only wrinkle is that as you describe your service, the emails aren't an essential part of the service.\n\nAlternatively, you might assert that there's a legitimate interest to deliver updates via email so that updates aren't missed. In that case you must allow the users to object, e.g. via ab unsubscribe link in the email and via their account settings. Because a prior business relationship exists, there's a strong case for legitimate interest \u2013 even if this were marketing emails (!). Legitimate interest requires you to balance the legitimate interest with the data subject's rights and freedoms though.\n\nYour updates are most likely not marketing, so any advice you might read relating to marketing emailings is irrelevant.\n\nGDPR applies because you are established in the EU. The regulation applies in relation to all your users, not just EU users. If and when Brexit happens you will still be covered by the Data Protection Act, which transcribes the GDPR's requirements into UK law. However, processing data from EU users will then count as an international transfer which requires extra compliance work, at least until the EU issues an adequacy decision for the UK."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A UK-based company offers a subscription-based web application that notifies users about regulatory changes in a specific industry via email.

One of these defences, is the defence of [Diminished Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_responsibility_in_English_law).\n\n> The defence is set out in s.2 of the Homicide Act 1957, and it\n>  provides that a Defendant is not guilty of murder if, during the\n>  murder, he suffered from an abnormality in mental functioning, where:\n> \n> \n> 1.

Specifically, the court held that she suffered \"battered woman syndrome\" as the result of 10\\+ years of emotional abuse and beatings by her husband, .\n\nThe reason why this is relevant to the question is because when giving her reasons for killing her husband, she stated:\n\n> \"She wrote to her mother\\-in\\-law from prison saying, amongst other things, that the deceased had committed so many sins, \"so I gave him a fire bath to wash away his sins\". However, in the course of interview she repeated a number of times that she did not intend to kill the deceased, but only to give him pain.\"\n\nIt is certainly arguable that her actions fall within the meaning of retribution.\n\nOf course, not just any kind of provocation will raise this defense, you need to be suffering a mental condition, but it is clear that this condition may arise directly from the actions of the victim. I highly recommend reading the full judgment, as the court goes in depth through the law on provocation (since here, on the day of the killing, the husband told the Defendant that he would beat her the following day), and whether the pre\\-meditated nature of the killing (she bought the ingredients for the fire beforehand, having already decided to set the victim on fire) meant that the defence could not apply."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK case of R v Ahluwalia, the defendant was found not guilty of murder after killing her abusive husband.

This condition was recognized as an abnormality of mental functioning that substantially impaired her ability to form rational judgment or exercise self-control, meeting the criteria for diminished responsibility under Section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the killing was not an act of immediate self-defense, but rather a premeditated act.\nOption B is incorrect because temporary insanity was not the basis of the defense; the condition was long-term.\nOption D is incorrect because justifiable homicide is not a recognized defense in UK law in these circumstances.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the specific legal principle applied in the case, as well as the ability to distinguish between different legal defenses in criminal law."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37025/is-it-legal-to-unlock-artificially-limited-hardware-yourself", "docs_id": 37025, "title": "Is it legal to unlock artificially limited hardware yourself?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Some companies sell hardware that is limited by some means, so that they can charge for upgrades.\n\nFor example some Tesla cars have batteries with some capacity unavailable to the user unless they pay for an upgrade, which involves sending a command to the car.

So, the manufacturer can sue you for money damages probably equal to the difference in value between the limited and unlimited hardware in the marketplace. The manufacturer might also be able to obtain an injunction against this practice, which could result in the incarceration of someone who knowingly violated this court order for contempt of court, once an injunction is secured from a court to enforce the contract.\n\nThere is also an anti\\-hacking statute in the United States, whose plain language appears to prohibit taking actions that override a digital system's security features. Unlocking these hardware features would appear to violate this statute. This is part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and is codified at United States Code Title 17, Section 1201\\.

But, none of that legislation has passed in the United States, to the best of my knowledge and belief.\n\nBut, I am not aware of any high profile legal precedent that has addressed this point but I wouldn't rule out the possibility that there is one. The closest case I could find on point (from the High Court in Australia) is *[Stevens v.

(TLDR\\-skip to bold)\n\nI am a clerk at a retail establishment that sales cigarettes, as well as food and home products. My main job duty is cashier. In between customers I also stock and do other retail related tasks.\n\nThe cigarettes are in a cabinet that requires a key to open. When I first started working there a few months ago the key for the cabinet was on a set of keys which had other keys for retail displays like cell phones as well. Since then there has been a change in management. And one of the changes was that only key\\-holders and managers can open the cigarette cabinet.\n\nThis change has been very inconvenient for customers and the store has lost many sales over people not wanting to wait for a key holder to come open the cabinet. It's very frustrating for me to stand there and wait for them to come up especially since customers generally ask for cigarettes after I have scanned the items so it's all wait time. I have to page them on the in store phone and wait for them to finish what they are doing in the back of the store and come up and then the customer has to repeat what they wanted again. \n\nI've continually complained about the change to the assistant manager and lead key holder but they always kind of change the subject. I asked the assistant manager one day if the change was because of missing cigarettes and he said that wasn't it and alluded to knowing what it was but wouldn't say. At that point I began to realize it was probably because I am a cigarette smoker. I wasn't sure though. Then a few days later talking to another employee and I found out that he and I are the only regular clerks without any key\\-holder status and he also smokes and came to the same conclusion as me independently.\n\nI've never stolen cigarettes or had any mishaps with cigarettes or lost any cigarettes or anything at this job or any other. Now unless the other guy has had some shadiness with the cigarettes or something in his past and they are just using this general rule to keep him from using it but it's affecting me then I could kind of understand but nobody has told me anything along the lines that it's because of the other employee. I think I need to talk to that guy a little bit more.\n\n**Is it discrimination if they have revoked me of a responsibility because I smoke?**\n\nIf that is the reason for the change it doesn't make any sense to me. They sell all kinds of things that I use. I'm more addicted to food than cigarettes. Why do they let me stock food?\n\nI'm nearly 30, I'm an adult, I'm a serious man. Why would they regard me as a thief. I've never felt so demoralized and I was previously a dishwasher. What's odd about this whole situation is I rarely interact with the manager that has been making these changes. So it's like these invisible webs pulling at me from a distance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It may be discrimination; not all discrimination is illegal.\n\nDetails vary by jurisdiction, for example discrimination on the following bases is illegal in Australia:\n\n* race\n* colour\n* sex\n* sexual preference\n* age\n* physical or mental disability\n* marital status\n* family or carer\u2019s responsibilities\n* pregnancy\n* religion\n* political opinion\n* national extraction\n* social origin\n\nTobacco use or non\\-use doesn't make the list.\n\nThat's the legal position; if you want advice on how to handle the workplace stuff post your question on the [Workplace Stack Exchange](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A retail clerk who smokes cigarettes believes they are being discriminated against because they are no longer allowed to access the cigarette cabinet at work.

However, not all forms of discrimination are illegal. In most jurisdictions, including the example given for Australia, smoking or tobacco use is not listed as a protected characteristic. Therefore, while it may be unfair or poor management practice, it is likely not illegal discrimination.

In legal terms, this approach is often described as being \"too clever by half.\" Even though the student claims to be selling paper towels and giving away sandwiches for free, the reality is that they are selling a package of paper towels and a sandwich together. The intent to sell food without proper authorization is still present, and the attempt to create a loophole doesn't change the fundamental nature of the transaction.

I have a question on the meaning of the rules and especially the difference between public and private office buildings.\nFirst \u00a76 reads:\n\n> (1\\) Im Arbeitsraum in einem \u00f6ffentlichen Nichtwohngeb\u00e4ude darf die Lufttemperatur\n> h\u00f6chstens auf die folgenden H\u00f6chstwerte geheizt werden:\n> \n> \n> 1. f\u00fcr k\u00f6rperlich leichte und \u00fcberwiegend sitzende T\u00e4tigkeit 19 Grad Celsius\n\nMy translation:\n\n> (1\\) In working spaces in a public non\\-residential building the air temperature may be heated to a maximum of:\n> \n> \n> 1. 19 degree Celsius for light and predominantly sitting work\n\n\u00a712 referring to private companies then reads\n\n> F\u00fcr Arbeitsr\u00e4ume in Arbeitsst\u00e4tten gelten die in \u00a7 6 Absatz 1 Satz 1 festgelegten\n> H\u00f6chstwerte f\u00fcr die Lufttemperatur als Mindesttemperaturwerte.\n\nMy translation:\n\n> For work places the maximal values from \u00a7 6 sentence 1 for air temperature are minimal temperature values.\n\nI would read that as meaning that a public office building can be heated to at most 19 degrees but can be heated to lower temperatures or even not at all. A private office building needs be heated to at least 19 degrees but can be heated to higher temperatures if they want to.\n\nThe latter part seems very strange because it would imply that private companies are not allowed to save as much energy as they want to or feel able to which seems in direct contradiction to the stated goals of the law. Is that what this regulation means?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Employers \u2013 whether public or private \u2013 have a duty of care. They must provide a safe working environment that does not endanger the health of employees, which includes appropriate heating/cooling. Too low temperatures must be prevented to protect the health of employees. Therefore, existing regulations in form of ASR A 3\\.5 require minimum temperatures:\n\n| how strenuous \u2192 | light | medium | heavy |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| seated | \\+20\u00b0C | \\+19\u00b0C | \\- |\n| standing, walking | \\+19\u00b0C | \\+17\u00b0C | \\+12\u00b0C |\n\nEnSikuMaV reduces these minimum temperatures for light and medium work by 1\u00b0C:\n\n| how strenuous \u2192 | light | medium | heavy |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| seated | \\+19\u00b0C | \\+18\u00b0C | \\- |\n| standing, walking | \\+18\u00b0C | \\+16\u00b0C | \\+12\u00b0C |\n\nThe EnSikuMaV wants to ensure that the public sector serves as a role model, and therefore requires that public buildings are heated to exactly the minimum allowed levels (these levels are maximums per \u00a7 6 but also minimums per \u00a7 12\\). Public sector employers can nevertheless keep higher temperatures in individual cases if they consider this necessary for their duty of care. See explanations on page 22 of the document.\n\nThe private sector is not *forced* to reduce heating, but now has legally safe grounds to reduce heating somewhat, if they so wish. This Verordnung does not *introduce* minimum heating levels, but *lowers* existing temperature requirements. Reducing heating reduces costs, and will therefore generally be in the interest of (profit\\-maximizing) private industry. Some minimum temperature is necessary to protect the health and rights of workers.

Public offices are expected to heat to exactly these new minimum levels (using them as maximum values) to serve as role models for energy conservation, although they can exceed these in individual cases if necessary for their duty of care. Private offices are not forced to reduce heating but now have a legal basis to do so if they wish, with the new 19\u00b0C serving as a minimum requirement.

The trial court said no, reasoning that if they did so, then they should **also** enforce specific performance against C, i.e. ordering C to perform the renovations himself \\- and they won't do that because that is a personal obligation.\n\n(It seems to be a standard tenet of law that specific performance is generally not used when \"performance consists of a personal service\". [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_performance) confirms this, though without explanation. I don't know exactly why this is the practice; maybe it would be a good separate question. I might speculate that courts feel that to order a person to perform a particular service would be a little too much like involuntary servitude.)\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeals said that there was no need to order C to perform the renovations, because C had already done some of them and agreed to pay for the rest.

The burden of proof is on the claimant.\n2. The case will be decided \u2018on the balance of probabilities\u2019.\n\nAre these assertions consistent? Based on the second statement, one might think that the outcome of a case will depend on whether it is more likely than not (\\>50%) or less likely than not (\\<50%) that the claimant\u2019s allegation is correct (based on the relevant evidence). But if that is true, I don\u2019t see how the claimant has any special \u2018burden\u2019 that they need to discharge. Sure, in order for the claimant to win, the relevant decision maker (let\u2019s say it is a judge) needs to think that it is more likely than not that the claimant is right. But equally, in order for the defendant to win, the judge needs to think that it is more likely than not that they (the defendant) are right. So the situation is entirely symmetric!\n\nUpdate: as some have commented, the claimant may lose if the judge thinks that the probability is *exactly* 50%. If you think, for example, that the judge\u2019s assessments should be restricted to integer percentages (0%, 1%, 2%, etc.), this means that the claimant wins if the probability is 51% or higher, and loses if the probability is 50% or lower. This situation is very slightly asymmetric; but only very slightly! And if the judge can make more nuanced judgments (no longer restricted to integers), the asymmetry shrinks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, law is not mathematics and it is futile to try to assign an \"exact\" statistical percentage or apply Bayes' theorem in any specific case unless the facts of the case are particular enough. In the end, judges or juries (most often) do not apply a statistical model to their cases, what matters is if the evidences (by both parties) presented on one claim convince them that the claim is more likely to be true than not, that is, what they \"feel\" or \"think\" about the probability.\n\nMore probable than not means \\> 50%; if the fact finder finds scenarios leading to different outcomes equally likely, the claim is not proven and the party bearing the burden of proof fails.\n\nIf you want to analyze it mathematically, the burden of proof does not necessarily means that the probability of a claim favourable to the burdened party to be true in the absence of evidence is zero. Since only two values are possible as an outcome on any particular claim (as far as the burden of proof is concerned), a step function must be used to convert the probability to a judgement. The burden of proof represents the choice of that *unsymmetric* step function.\n\nThe burden of proof also represents the **legal** (not necessarily \"factual\" or statistical) assumption (an *imposed*, unquantifiable prior \"probability\").\n\nHere I use the word \"claim\" generally, for a case to succeed there can be multiple elements or claims that all need to be proven to be more likely than not to be true, e.g. if you want to sue someone for medical bills because they crashed into you and you have a broken leg, you need to prove both that they were responsible for the crash and that the medical bills are for the broken leg, and the broken leg is a result of that crash.\n\nThe burden of proof means that if you do not provide any evidence that the leg was broken as a result of that crash, or if your evidence is very weak, or if your evidence is not stronger than the other party's counter\\-evidence, your case must fail; the defendant does not have to prove that the crash did not cause your broken feet."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In UK civil trials, which of the following best describes the relationship between the burden of proof and the \"balance of probabilities\" standard?\n\nA) The burden of proof is on the claimant, but the judge must be 100% certain of the claimant's case for them to win.\n\nB) The burden of proof is equally shared between the claimant and defendant, with the judge deciding based on whichever side presents more convincing evidence.\n\nC) The burden of proof is on the claimant, who must demonstrate that their claim is more likely than not to be true (>50% probability), but if the judge finds the probability to be exactly 50%, the claimant loses.\n\nD) The burden of proof is on the defendant, who must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the claimant's allegations are false.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately represents the interplay between the burden of proof and the \"balance of probabilities\" standard in UK civil trials. The burden of proof rests on the claimant, meaning they must present evidence to support their claim. The \"balance of probabilities\" standard means that the judge or jury must find it more likely than not (>50% probability) that the claimant's allegation is true based on the evidence presented. However, if the judge finds the probability to be exactly 50% (equally likely to be true or false), the claimant fails to meet their burden of proof and loses the case. This creates a slight asymmetry in favor of the defendant, as the claimant must surpass the 50% threshold to win.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests a much higher standard of proof (100% certainty) than what is actually required in civil cases. Option B is incorrect because it implies an equal burden on both parties, which is not the case. Option D is incorrect because it reverses the burden of proof and applies a criminal law standard (\"beyond reasonable doubt\") to a civil case."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18290/is-this-passive-induction-of-suicide", "docs_id": 18290, "title": "Is this passive induction of suicide?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Today we were arguing about induction of suicide, the theme was the following: if you pretend to commit suicide and your girlfriend\\\\boyfriend didn't know it was fake and consequently commits suicide themselves, are you liable for any legal penalties?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, taking an action which causes someone to commit suicide does not give rise to civil or criminal liability unless it was intended to cause someone's death.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, \"a person commits manslaughter if: . . .

In this scenario, Alex did not intend for Beth to commit suicide, so he would likely not face criminal charges unless it could be proven that he had such intent.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because manslaughter generally requires recklessly causing death, and faking one's own suicide without the intent to cause another's death would likely not meet this threshold.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct in that Alex might face civil liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress, but it's not the most accurate answer. The question primarily focuses on criminal liability, which is addressed more directly in option C.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while faking suicide itself may not be illegal, there could still be potential legal consequences depending on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction.

Prohibiting an assembly because of viewpoint is illegal. Banning a group is illegal (regardless of the reason for such a ban). A group cannot be banned because they don't have a permit (this too is a First Amendment issue): however, an *assembly* can be prohibited if there is no permit. An event can be disbanded if it causes violence or unreasonable disruption, but if others engage in violence in response to a demonstration, that does not invalidate your First Amendment rights (\"The police must permit the speech and control the crowd; there is no heckler\u2019s veto\", [Cox v. Louisiana](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/379/536/) 379 U.S. 536\\). Even if a past event by the organization has resulted in violence, a subsequent event cannot be prohibited ([U.S. v. Baugh](https://openjurist.org/187/f3d/1037/united-states-of-america-v-pamela-baugh), 187 F.3d 1037\\). The constitutional right to assembly is an individual right, not a collective right: an individual cannot lose his First Amendment rights, so a city cannot ban particular individuals.\n\nThere is a huge difference between what the city may do with respect to public property and private property. Compelled speech is also unconstitutional. When an individual unlawfully take possession of the property of another in order to express himself, that is trespassing. The government cannot compel an individual to involuntarily support a viewpoint, thus a protester does not have a constitutional right to protest on my private property. They *do* have that right with respect to public places. (Not absolutely *all* places, e.g. not on a military base).\n\nAny limits on time and place have to be narrowly constructed and clearly stated in the law, and arbitrarily limiting an assembly to some location miles from the intended audience is illegal ([Bay Area Peace Navy v. U.S](https://openjurist.org/914/f2d/1224/bay-area-peace-navy-v-united-states), 914 F.2d 1224\\). Limitations have to be reasonably and narrowly related to safety and disruption concerns, or to regulate competing uses ([Forsyth County, Ga. v. Nat\u2019list Movement](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/123/), 505 U.S. 123\\).

Implementing a content-neutral permit system with reasonable restrictions that apply equally to all groups is allowed, as long as the restrictions are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest.\n\nOption A is unconstitutional because banning a specific group based on past events violates First Amendment rights. Even if a past event resulted in violence, subsequent events cannot be prohibited solely on that basis.\n\nOption B would likely be deemed unconstitutional as it unreasonably restricts the protesters' ability to reach their intended audience.

Assume that the police officer punches/kicks/grabs first, and you are not guilty of any crime before the attack. To what extend can you do so?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **The General Rule**\n\nIn practice, the only time when self\\-defense against a police officer is legal is when you do not know and have no reasonable way that you could have known that the person attacking you is a police officer. (And arguably, a police officer acting in an official capacity in furtherance of his or her duties, rather than in a personal capacity as an individual.)\n\nFor example, if the police do a no knock raid in the dark of night, and don't announce themselves, and you shoot police officers reasonably believing them to be home invasion burglars, you would not have criminal or civil liability for doing so.\n\nA similar valid self\\-defense claim might arise when someone has an objectively reasonable reason to think that someone claiming to be a police officer is really just a criminal impersonating a police officer, even if that belief is, in fact, mistaken.\n\nIn almost all other circumstances, you need to submit to the officers, and you are pretty much required by law to bear the risk that excessive force by the officer will harm you. If you don't, you will probably be guilty of the crime of resisting arrest and will not be entitled to a self\\-defense defense.\n\nThe fact that you are not actually guilty of a crime is irrelevant. This is often the case and police officers are not omniscient. If the officer lacked probable cause for an arrest (which there is often no way that the person being arrested or attacked can know at the time), the remedy is a civil rights suit after the fact, not self\\-defense.\n\nIn theory, there might be other isolated circumstances where self\\-defense against a police officer is legal, but they involve fact patterns so quirky that they would almost never happen in real life, or would almost never be possible to prove in a manner that the courts would believe.\n\n**Officer Liability For Harming Someone Legitimately Acting In Self Defense**\n\nWhether the officers had civil liability to you if you were harmed by the officers while exercising your right to self\\-defense would depend upon their state of mind, even if you were rightfully using self\\-defense. \n\nFor example, a U.S. Supreme Court case decided in January of 2017 ([*White v. Pauly*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-67_2c8f.pdf)) involved this fact pattern. In *White v. Pauly* an officer arrived late on the scene and had no reason to believe that the officers who arrived there before him and were being shot at by citizens in a house that they were approaching, lacked probable cause, or had not announced themselves. The court held that as a result, he had no civil liability to a citizen he shot, even if the person who the late arriving officer shot while that citizen was shooting back at the police officers on the scene was actually engaging in good faith self\\-defense.\n\nThe citizen's self\\-defense in the case had a valid defense to criminal or civil liability for firing on the officers, because the citizen shooting back didn't actually know that the people approaching his house were police officers. But, because the late arriving officer reasonably believed under the circumstances that the citizen had no right to engage in self\\-defense, because he thought that the early arriving officers had probable cause and had announced themselves, the late arriving officer had no civil liability to the citizens he shot."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Officer Smith responds to a disturbance call at night.

According to the documentation, self-defense against a police officer is legal when the person has no reasonable way of knowing that their attacker is a police officer. In this scenario, Officer Smith did not announce himself and tackled the suspect without warning. The suspect, therefore, had no way of knowing Smith was a police officer and believed he was being attacked by a second assailant.

The last owner had lived in that house from the time it was built in 1964 until four years ago. When the owner passed on, the bank took ownership of the house (under a reverse mortgage) and hired an agent to sell it. The house was bought with an FHA loan.\n\nAfter three years of living in the house, A discovered that, even though city sewer runs on the street, the house has a septic tank instead of being connected to the city sewer. The cost of connecting the house to the city sewer system is $25K. Emptying the septic tank will run about $3k to $4k since they have to dig up to reach the hatch.\n\nAll public websites such as Zillow and Redfin say that the house is connected to city sewer. A received no disclosure from the real estate agent that the house has a septic system. Perhaps the agent didn't know either. A paid for inspection when A bought the house. Inspection didn't mention anything about a septic tank.\n\nIn terms of real estate law, does A have a valid claim against the bank, the agent, the inspector, or anyone else for failure to disclose the use of a septic system instead of the listed sewer connection?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on what state this is. In Washington state, [there is a form](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/Rcw/default.aspx?cite=64.06.020) that sellers must fill out, and section 3 addresses sewer connections. This matter could have been disclosed \u2013 the allowed answers are \"yes; no; don't know\" (or NA). These are *sellers* disclosures, and Zillow / Redfin are free to be unreliable (I personally know that they are wrong about square footage).

Assuming your state has this or analogous question, \"No\" means that you were told (doesn't matter if you didn't notice it), and \"Don't know\" means you're gambling.\n\nLet's say that the answer was \"Yes\".

But, the attorney might plausibly argue that given the fact that the case was clearly prejudged, that the advice he gave you wouldn't have made a difference in any case.\n\n> My current trial attorney had, unfortunately, neglected to enter the\n>  exhibit that supported this conclusion as evidence.

He probably could have made a motion to reconsider that could have remedied this failure to introduce evidence, or an appeal that might have been successful. On the other hand, he can argue that but for the first attorneys' malpractice, this wouldn't have been an issue, so liability should at least be shared if not entirely transferred to the first attorney, and that subsequent uncertain litigation options not exercised shouldn't count against you (or him).\n\n> my current trial attorney , the one who neglected to admit the\n>  exhibit, wants to go after the original attorney for those fees on a\n>  contingency basis, his fee to be 50% of the recovered money.

Attorney malpractice cases are almost always of this variety, since you generally can't recover your attorneys' fees in an attorney malpractice case, only your damages. Someone, whether the current attorney or a third attorney, is going to charge a fee to sue someone for malpractice.\n\nThe benefit of going with the current attorney is that he is up to speed and is willing to take the case on a contingency basis, albeit a steep one. The downside is that the current attorney will not sue himself and may have liability as well, that the current attorney has made a key mistake once and could do so again, and that the current attorney may be conflicted out of the case as a potentially responsible party and as a potential witness at some point. \n\nSo, if you could find someone other than your current attorney to bring a malpractice case on a contingent basis, that would probably be better for you. Suing two attorneys instead of one also increases the likelihood that you can collect whatever judgments you secure. But, it may be hard to find someone to represent you in a case like that since the amount of time involved in a case like this for a plaintiff's attorney is very substantial and also requires considerable outlays for expert witness fees.\n\nAll of this said, however, attorney malpractice cases are very difficult to prevail in since you must prove not only malpractice but also a \"case within a case\" to show that you would have gotten a different and better result but for the malpractice. \n\nMost of the time, you will end up settling for only a portion of your damages prior to trial to avoid the cost of litigation and the risk of a defense verdict. So with a 33% to 50% contingent fee, your net recovery might realistically often be in the 1/4 to 1/3 of your losses in a decent settlement equal to half of your actual losses.\n\nA settlement like this is better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, but no attorney malpractice case is going to make you whole. And, you may decide that the time and distraction involved in litigating an attorney malpractice case may not be worth the trouble to you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A trustee of a moderate-sized trust is removed from their position and surcharged a high five-figure amount due to a series of legal complications.

(3\\) shall be designated in a writing signed by the voter under\n> penalty of perjury; and\n> \n> \n> (4\\) shall execute an affidavit under penalty of perjury that the\n> ballot was:\n> \n> \n> (i) delivered to the voter who submitted the application;\n> \n> \n> (ii) marked and placed in an envelope by the voter, or with assistance\n> as allowed by regulation, in the agent's presence;\n> \n> \n> (iii) returned to the local board by the agent.\n\nA person asked to deliver a ballot would be such an \"agent\". An agent who failed to make the required affidavit would be in violation of section 9\\-307\\. One who made the affidavit and saying that the ballot was properly delivered but did so falsely would be guilty of perjury. Similar laws exist in all US states, as I understand things.\n\nIn addition this may be mail theft under [18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1708](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1708) or under another provision or under USPS regulation, I am not sure."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a hypothetical situation, you agree to mail a sealed absentee ballot for a family member but decide to \"lose\" it intentionally due to disagreement with their vote.

Most states have specific election laws governing the handling of absentee ballots, often requiring agents to sign affidavits confirming proper delivery. Intentionally failing to deliver the ballot would violate these state laws. Additionally, deliberately \"losing\" mail intended for delivery could be considered mail theft under federal law (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1708). Therefore, option D is correct as it encompasses both state and federal offenses. Option A is incorrect as the action is illegal regardless of whether the envelope is opened. Option B overlooks potential federal charges. Option C is partially correct but incomplete, as perjury would only apply if an affidavit was signed, and it doesn't account for the federal mail theft aspect."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4465/company-advertising-something-100-cheaper-than-it-is", "docs_id": 4465, "title": "Company advertising something $100 cheaper than it is", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A company is advertising a product on Google for $44\\.

However in the United Kingdom there is another interesting system with its own traditions, procedures, terminology \u2013 Scots Law (Scottish Law).\n\nI wonder if there is any significant influence of Scots Law anywhere outside Scotland itself, particularly in the US? Are there any elements in any US legal system, or parts of it, that can be traced to Scots Law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nI really can't think of any influences of Scots Law on U.S. law. In all of the areas where I know Scots law to be distinctive vis\\-a\\-vis English common law, the U.S. has not followed the Scots law model, and I have never seen a Scottish precedent cited in a court opinion in the U.S. while I have seen many English ones cited (with one narrow exception noted below).\n\nFor example, while the Scots Law concept of a criminal trial verdict of \"not proven\" rather than \"not guilty\" has been discussed by academics and policymakers, to the best of my knowledge, no U.S. jurisdiction has adopted a \"not proven\" verdict option.\n\nTwo U.S. states experimented with non\\-unanimous verdicts, something that U.S. law has since disavowed, but so far as I know, this decision was not borrowed from Scottish practice. In Louisiana, it was a calculated strategy to make it easier to convict black defendants after slavery was abolished.\n\nNo U.S. jurisdiction has ever had petite juries of 15 in any kind of case.\n\nScotland and the U.S. are now aligned in being jurisdictions that have [jury trials of ordinary personal injury cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_jury_in_Scotland), something that very few countries do, but in the U.S. case, the right to a jury trial in personal injury cases flows from English law practice that England later modified while the U.S. did not, rather than from copying Scots law.\n\nScotland still has many [common law crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_criminal_law), which U.S. jurisdictions are in the final stages of completely abolishing (most have done so, but there are a few partial stragglers). Similarly, U.S. criminal law, unlike Scots Law, has never required corroboration for a criminal conviction, although, of course, it is desirable to have it if possible.\n\nThe [Scottish Court system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_Scotland) has much more specialization of court jurisdiction than almost all U.S. jurisdictions do, although U.S. jurisdictions vary in the extent to which they have specialized courts, and of course, no U.S. jurisdiction has had religious courts since the early 1800s before the church was disestablished in New England.\n\nWhile the U.S. merged law and equity for the most part, as did most common law jurisdictions, the distinction still has a significant residual effect that differs from [Scots law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law) which never fully separated the two. Equity is still taught as a distinct elective class in many U.S. law schools to this day.\n\nPerhaps the only area I can think of where there has arguably been some borrowing from Scots Law has been in the jurisdiction and choice of law analysis applied to marriage and divorce questions. It used to be easier to get married in Scotland than in England, and in cases of parental or religious opposition, couples sometimes went to Scotland to get married and left courts to sort out whether that was legitimate after the fact. This is an area where U.S. case law sometimes referred to how those issues were resolved in the cases of disputes over whether English or Scottish laws related to marriage formation and marriage dissolution should apply.\n\nI don't know the law of mineral rights well enough to describe the provenance of some of its doctrines accurately, but there are some similarities between the Scottish concepts applicable to the structure of mineral rights, when they are reserved in a patent from the sovereign of the surface rights to property (as many key mineral rights in Scotland were starting in the early modern period), that may have some Scots Law influence.\n\nThe lack of Scots Law impact on U.S. law despite significant Scottish immigration to the U.S. is to some extent a function of U.S. immigration history.\n\nScottish immigration that was early enough to have an impact on the legal system's larger outlines was mostly \"Scotch\\-Irish\" (i.e. Protestants from the Scottish borderlands, often traditionally herders or subsistence farmers, who were ancestral to the current Irish Protestants of Northern Ireland), who were lower to middle class, who engaged mostly in rural subsistence farming in Appalachia and the rural American South, and were not prominent in commerce and were subordinate to an English elite (the Episcopal Church of English origins has always a higher socioeconomic status church in the U.S. than the Presbyterian Church which has Scottish roots).\n\nBy the time middle class Scottish people engaged in commerce and inclined to participate in formal law and politics arrived in the U.S., a wave of migration reflected in the American West mostly from the mid\\-1800s as part of the gold rush and homesteading movements, the die was largely already cast with respect to major framework level issues in the U.S. legal system. The map below partially obscures this history to some extent, however, because [many people with Scotch\\-Irish ancestry now identify for census purposes as \"American.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch-Irish_Americans)\n\nMany anthropologists attribute the \"[culture of honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_honor_(Southern_United_States))\" of the American South and Appalachia to a Scotch\\-Irish ancestral source, and this culture of honor surely did influence the character of various U.S. legal doctrines and legislative developments in the U.S., but it did not involve direct borrowings from Scots Law, and indeed, it can be seen as deriving from a subculture of people for whom formal legal institutions in Scotland were sufficiently weak in practical application that they had little impact on their lives.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cKhrL.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cKhrL.jpg)\n\nHonestly, if I had to hazard a guess, I would say that there have been more borrowings from Australian legal innovations (especially in probate and real property), and from civil law systems (for example, the law of good faith and fair dealing, and the law of unjust enrichment), than there have been from Scots law.\n\nI would be happy to be corrected if someone is aware of a counterexample, however."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the influence of Scots Law on the United States legal system is most accurate?\n\nA) The concept of a \"not proven\" verdict in criminal trials has been widely adopted in U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nB) The structure of mineral rights in some U.S. states may have been influenced by Scottish concepts.\n\nC) The U.S. legal system has extensively borrowed from Scots Law, particularly in areas of criminal procedure.\n\nD) The use of 15-person juries in civil cases in some U.S. states can be traced back to Scottish legal traditions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because while the \"not proven\" verdict has been discussed, no U.S. jurisdiction has adopted it.\nB is correct.

In particular, in Articles 173 \\[modern TFEU 263] and 184 \\[TFEU 277], on the one hand, and in Article 177 \\[TFEU 267], on the other, the Treaty established a complete system of legal remedies and procedures designed to permit the Court of Justice to review the legality of measures adopted by the institutions. \\[...]\n\nFor modern restatements see for example [C\u2011583/11](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=142607&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=884022) paragraph 92 or [C\u201172/15](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=189262&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=885613) paragraph 66\\.\n\nUltimately, all EU acts must be consistent with the \"basic constitutional charter,\" these days that's the [Treaty on European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty) (TEU), the [Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union) (TFEU) and by reference, the [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union).\n\nWhile Regulations and Directives could only be declared invalid on the basis that they violate the treaties, secondary legislation or actions could additionally be declared invalid under whatever Regulation or Directive they were adopted.\n\nFor a Directive invalidity example, see *Digital Rights Ireland and Seitlinger and Others* ([Joined Cases C\u2011293/12 and C\u2011594/12](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=150642&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=888650)) where the Data Retention Directive was declared invalid1, being contrary to Charter Articles 7, 8 and 52(1\\).\n\nAs to \"validity\" versus \"legality\", there appears to be no real difference, as the court is very much stating the equivalence of the two Articles in this respect.\n\n---\n\n1.

The details of the case are not generally known, but [see this paper](https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1136717) for a bit more information. Basically, they used public genetic databases to arrive at a tree of about 1,000 persons related to the suspect, and used other investigative techniques to narrow it down further.

There have been attempts to limit police access to genetic databases at the state level, and no laws have been passed. The Dept. of Justice has limited restrictions on the use of forensic genetic data in cases that it is involved with in certain ways, [see here](https://www.justice.gov/olp/page/file/1204386/download). Basically, what they say is\n\n> A suspect shall not be arrested based solely on a genetic association\n> generated by a GG service.

Jones](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/565/400/), 565 U.S. 400\\. Conceivably, such testing could fall within the scope of 4th Amendment privacy constraints, given a suitable ruling (or argument that results in such ruling). At present, there is no legal impediment to that kind of testing."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal status and limitations of using genetic genealogy databases for criminal investigations?\n\nA) Investigators can arrest suspects based solely on genetic associations generated by genealogy services.\n\nB) There are strict federal laws prohibiting the use of genetic genealogy databases in criminal investigations.\n\nC) Genetic genealogy can be used to generate leads, but additional evidence and DNA confirmation are required for arrest and prosecution.\n\nD) The Supreme Court has ruled that using genetic genealogy databases violates the Fourth Amendment in all cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Department of Justice guidelines mentioned in the documentation, genetic genealogy can be used as an investigative tool, but it has limitations. Suspects cannot be arrested based solely on genetic associations from genealogy services. Additional investigation is required, and any suspect identified through this method must have their DNA directly compared to the forensic profile using STR DNA typing. This approach allows genetic genealogy to generate leads while ensuring that additional evidence and confirmation are necessary for arrest and prosecution.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the DOJ explicitly states that arrests cannot be made solely on genetic associations from genealogy services.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as there are currently no strict federal laws prohibiting the use of genetic genealogy databases in criminal investigations. The DOJ has issued guidelines, but these are not federal laws.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the Supreme Court has shown some shift in privacy expectations regarding information given to third parties, it has not made a ruling that using genetic genealogy databases violates the Fourth Amendment in all cases."}}
