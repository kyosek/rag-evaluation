Some customers say to me if you didn't do it now, we're going to sue the company. My reply is like I should follow the instructions of the company and you should wait for few days. So I just follow the instructions regardless of what the customers will do as a consequence.\n\nToday, a customer told me that he will sue me personally as a part of the company. He was also recording my voice to have an evidence. I had to flow the restrictions and the instructions of the company as usual. My question is: **Can someone really sue me because I'm an employee in a company?** I'm not the owner. I'm just a representative. I'm an intermediate stage between (the owners, the managers, and the different departments) and (the customers). \n\nLet's make things more complicated. I'm not responsible only for delivering the correct message. In the beginning, I said to the customer wrong info because I made a typo while entering his ID into the system (the software). Then, I realized and corrected the info. Now, he has the recording that contains both wrong and correct info. Can he sue me for saying some wrong info to him in the beginning? \n\nI'm giving this case as an example but I'd like to know what happens to something like that in general.

However, for the court to accept their claim/charge for processing it needs to fall in one of these buckets:\n\n* They had a contract with *you personally* and you were in breach of it \u2014 obviously this does not apply in your situation;\n* You committed a crime \u2014 looks like this is not the case either;\n* You had a duty of care towards them and committed the tort of negligence.

This falls under the concept of negligence and duty of care. While employees are generally protected from personal liability when following company procedures, if their actions (even unintentional ones like a typo) result in actual harm or losses to a customer, there might be grounds for a claim. Options A and B describe situations where the employee is acting responsibly within their role, which typically doesn't lead to personal liability.

There is no longer any access possible to the data by the developer. Is the app creator liable for Google's use of the data?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A data controller is whoever determines the means and purposes of processing. It is possible that multiple controllers jointly determine the means and purposes. However, someone can only be controller over processing activities where they actually have the ability to influence these decisions (see e.g. the Fashion ID case).\n\nThe provider of an app does not have any control over what Google does on its servers with the collected data, unless Google were a data processor for that particular processing activity. Thus, the app provider is not a data controller for Google's subsequent processing, and is not responsible for Google's GDPR compliance.\n\nHOWEVER, the app provider is a data controller regarding what happens within the app (including any SDKs, libraries, or frameworks). The app provider is data controller for processing activities such as \u201ccollecting data\u201d and \u201csending data to Google\u201d. These processing activities must comply with the GDPR (if GDPR applies), for example they need a legal basis. Under some circumstances there might be a legitimate interest for sending data to another data controller. But in the context of behavioural advertising, such a legitimate interest would be very weak and would not pass the required balancing test. Instead, the app provider would likely have to collect consent.\n\nThis is very similar to the question of whether a website can embed content from Google services such as YouTube videos, which would necessarily share data with Google. I have written related answers [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/55926/20476) and [there](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56006/20476).\n\nYou are correct that many apps do not collect valid consent before showing ads. GDPR/ePrivacy enforcement in this space is rather lacking, especially since many offenders are outside of the EU. However, this doesn't mean such illegal data processing by apps would be OK."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An app developer implements AdMob in their mobile application. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the developer's responsibilities under GDPR?\n\nA) The developer is only responsible for collecting user consent before implementing AdMob, but bears no responsibility for data processing once it's transferred to Google.\n\nB) The developer is not considered a data controller at any point, as all data processing is handled by Google through AdMob.\n\nC) The developer is a joint controller with Google for all data processing activities, including those that occur after data is transferred to Google's servers.\n\nD) The developer is a data controller for the collection and transfer of data to Google within the app, but not for Google's subsequent processing of that data on its servers.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The app developer is considered a data controller for the processing activities that occur within the app, including the collection of data and its transfer to Google via AdMob. This means the developer is responsible for ensuring GDPR compliance for these activities, such as having a legal basis (likely requiring user consent for behavioral advertising). However, the developer is not responsible for or able to control Google's subsequent processing of the data on its servers, and thus is not a controller or liable for those activities. Option A is incorrect because the developer's responsibilities extend beyond just collecting consent. Option B is wrong because the developer is a controller for in-app processing. Option C overstates the developer's role, incorrectly extending it to Google's server-side processing."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38985/why-elizabeth-warren-effective-tax-rate-is-22-and-not-30-on-900k-income", "docs_id": 38985, "title": "Why Elizabeth Warren effective tax rate is 22% and not 30% on $900k income", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Today US Senator Elizabeth Warren released her family's tax returns, as [reported here by LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-elizabeth-warren-tax-return-20190410-story.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter). Article says that:\n\n> Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has released her\n>  tax return for 2018, reporting that she and her husband paid more than\n>  $200,000 in taxes on a joint income of about $900,000 last year.\n\nThat comes down to about 22% tax rate. When I take into account marginal tax rate total tax comes up to about $275k \\= $164k\\+0\\.37\\*$300k which is effectively 30%, following [this table](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2018/11/15/irs-announces-2019-tax-rates-standard-deduction-amounts-and-more/#3b321e6d2081):\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/soM5t.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/soM5t.png)\n\nIs that calculation correct? Does it mean Senator's family got deductions worth $75k in taxes?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not all income is taxed at the rates you cite. Special rates apply to long term capital gain and qualified dividends (maximum rate 20%). There are $1,349 of qualified dividends in this case and $3000 of capital losses that can be taken in the current year (this is the cap for capital losses against ordinary income).\n\nThe benefit the Warren receives from these special tax rates is negligible.\n\nThere are also above the line deductions ($59,348\\) and itemized deductions (they claimed $60,128 of them that reduce their taxable income), credits (which reduce taxes dollar for dollar of which they claimed $13,936\\) and the carry forward of losses that couldn't be claimed in full in a prior year for some reason (which is functionally similar to a deduction) of which the Warrens have $102,276 but could only use $3,000 in the current year.\n\nWhile they doesn't appear to be included in the $905,742 of gross income figure cited, certain kinds of income are also exempt from inclusion on a tax return such as qualified municipal bond interest, certain income in the form of wages and salaries earned abroad, certain disability payments, personal injury settlements (exclusive of interest components) and alimony received under a post\\-2017 divorce decree, to name a few. None of these items are relevant for Warren.\n\nAccording to @JackFleeting in his answer:\n\n> they had gross income of $905,742, AGI of $846,394, taxable income of\n>  $786,266 and tax liability of $230,965\n\nPer the chart, the tax due on ordinary income of $786,266 is $229,058 by my calculation. This is reduced by a $13,936 residential energy credit (because she installed solar panels on her home), and $8,696 of additional federal tax as self\\-employment taxation, and $6,137 of self\\-employment and Obamacare taxes netted against overwitholding of Medicare taxes.\n\nThe itemized deductions were $60,128 which consists of state and local income tax payments (limited to $10,000 of $78,086 incurred in 2018\\) and charitable deductions of $50,128 (about 5\\.5% of her income).\n\nWarren herself, like most middle and upper middle class people in the Northeast, fares very badly with respect to deductions in 2018 compared to all prior years when they were not subject to a $10,000 cap. \n\nFor reference purposes, the disallowed itemized deductions increased her tax bill by $25,192 (itemized deductions don't impact the amount of FICA, self\\-employment tax and Obamacare tax due). On the other hand, she benefits from the lower tax brackets in 2018 compared to those [in 2017](https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-brackets/). Overall the 2017 tax law reduced Warren's taxes by about $2,713 (a little more than 1\\.1% of her total tax bill and about 0\\.3% of her family's gross income).\n\nThere are \"above the line\" adjustments to income in the amount of $59,348, there is a self\\-employment adjustment to correct for the self\\-employed paying both employee and employer FICA ($4,348\\) and adjustment for a retirement plan contribution in the maximum allowed amount of $55,000\\. Notably, she took no business expenses as deductions against her writing income. Her husband had a whopping $18 of self\\-employment income and took $803 of professional organization dues as a business expense.\n\nHer self\\-employment income does not qualify for the pass though entity tax break created by the 2017 tax law.\n\nAbove the line deductions simply convert your self\\-employment income to the numbers they were be if you were an employee of someone else with the same benefits.\n\nThe marginal tax rate that Warren pays on each additional dollar of self\\-employment income (e.g. writing) is about 40\\.94% from all applicable taxes combined."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Senator Elizabeth Warren released her 2018 tax returns, showing a joint income with her husband of about $900,000.

It is not at all easy to just casually declare some address as your own, or a PO Box. It must be a dwelling the government considers official in all ways, not just meeting various habitability codes, but also I think an address that in general has a kind of residential \u201czoning\u201d, like some addresses are simply not even considered residential, regardless of what\u2019s actually there.\n\nThe part that makes this seem like a regrettable bureaucracy is that in all of these three countries, the converse is true for maintaining residence status: matters of citizenship, criminal activity, deportation and so on aside, there is (I think) basically no formal concept of needing to maintain your residence status. Basically, the second the government has accepted your residence application at some address, you could immediately move out and become homeless for the next ten years, but you will have officially gotten your foot in the door, and will be entitled to all of the rights of someone residing in that country. But before that initial registration happens, the opposite, where you are barred from a number of civil services and provisions because you\u2019re basically just a foreigner, visitor or illegal alien there.\n\nIt seems that this type of law is far more geared towards a certain practical effect then it is meant to have a particular intrinsic meaning, an actual necessary condition for some reason. They just need to make it slightly hard for anyone in the world to move there unrestricted and self\\-declare as residents.\n\nBut given how trivial one\u2019s evasion of that condition can be \\- I have registered at a hostel I spent a month at and have not been there in several months; I can easily register with a friend on a whim, who simply says \u201cmi casa es tu casa\u201d even though I maybe have never even set foot inside of their home \\- it opens the genuinely important question to me of whether people should ultimately have the legal right to declare themselves a resident of a certain country, under certain conditions, without needing to have a specific home, address or apartment that you live at.\n\nI think it\u2019s very important because it is a fundamental and natural human right to not have to pay money to spend time inside of a building every night. You absolutely have the right to be \u201chomeless\u201d, to sleep on the ground, in a van, to camp, to be a drifter, to move around from place to place.\n\nSo, is there any legal avenue for a person to declare residence in Denmark, openly communicating that they do not have any home or personal address? For example, could there be any claim to fulfilling the essential role of a resident but who simply asserts their right to be a part of Denmark without having to have a home? Is there any even tiny legal opening for such an idea? And if not, isn\u2019t that a pretty major violation of human rights, that it\u2019s effectively illegal to not pay money to live inside of an apartment, that it mandatorily costs money just to have a place to sleep at night, that you have to pay money just for being alive?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nIt is not a fundamental human right to be able to become a resident of Denmark.\n\nEvery country has the right to decide who is and who is not a resident and what criteria need to be satisfied. Having a residence is usually a pretty fundamental criterion for being a resident.\n\nAt the same time, most countries have laws that state what areas and types of structures can be used as residences. There may be zoning requirements and building codes. You may argue that you should be able to decide what you will accept as your living quarters but that presumes, wrongly, that your decision doesn\u2019t affect other people. As a simple counter example, emergency services might need to enter your \u201cdwelling\u201d and it must be, among other things, structurally sound enough for them to do so safely.\n\nSo given that becoming a resident of Denmark is not a fundamental human right stated anywhere, Denmark can decide who is and is not.\n\nOf course, you can lie and say you have a residence when you don\u2019t but lying to the government in order to obtain something you are not actually entitled to is likely to solve all your Danish residence problems; they\u2019ll deport you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to Danish law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding residency requirements?\n\nA) Having a specific home address is optional for obtaining residency status in Denmark.\nB) Sleeping in a van or camping regularly qualifies as having a residence for Danish residency purposes.\nC) Denmark's requirement of a fixed address for residency violates fundamental human rights.\nD) Having an actual residence is a key criterion for obtaining residency status and a CPR number in Denmark.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is D.

Amending the Constitution requires a much more complex process involving two-thirds approval in both houses of Congress (or a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of state legislatures) and ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures.

Therefore, a trademark for \"Cocaine Cola\" would likely be rejected on these grounds, regardless of the product's actual contents or safety approvals.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the approval is not automatic and depends on more than just the absence of cocaine in the product. Answer C is incorrect because regulatory approval for safety does not override trademark law concerns about public policy and morality. Answer D is incorrect because the rejection would be based on the reference to an illegal drug, not on infringement of existing trademarks."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6225/when-a-contract-is-being-analyzed-in-court-is-it-the-understanding-of-the-parti", "docs_id": 6225, "title": "When a contract is being analyzed in court, is it the understanding of the parties or the written contract that is to be established?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is a difficult question to phrase so bare with me. From reading questions on this site, I understand that a written contract (e.g. a lease) is only a written record of the actual contract, that is to say the understood \"abstract\" contract takes precedence. So someone can't argue something silly like \"the contract said I must pay them $100 but never specified the currency\". But in complex situations, different parties may have different interpretations of the contract, even after signing it in writing. Just because something is in writing doesn't mean it's clear.\n\nMy question is, isn't it wrong to think that in court the judge and jury are trying to establish the actual understood contract? It is very well possible that the parties were not on the same page when the contract was formed. If this were the case, then what is the job of the judge/jury?\n\nFor example if Bob and Joe are going to court because Bob believes Joe owes him $100 in accordance with a contract they both signed, but Joe believes he doesn't, if the contract really is ambiguous and both Joe and Bob really do believe they are in the right, what is the job of the Judge and Jury? You can't really say it's to find out who was right because there was a misunderstanding when the contract was formed \\- but I don't think that invalidates the contract because businesses do this all the time to rip people off for money :P\n\nIs it possible the a judge/jury actually decides who wins the case based on the judge's/jury's own interpretation of the contract and not the plantiff's or defendant's? \n\nUPDATE: sorry for the confusing question, I think what I was trying to get at is what happens when a party finds an \"alternative\" interpretation to a clause before agreeing to it, so they can find a loophole if/when a dispute arises. I think large corporations do this a lot.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The court's job is to resolve the **dispute**.\n\nThe parties are in court specifically because there **isn't** agreement on what the terms of the contract were or even if there is a contract at all.\n\nIf one of the parties contends that there is no contract then the court will have to determine if there is or isn't. Even if both parties agree there is a contract the court will need to satisfy itself that there is. This is a jurisdictional matter; in the absence of a contract the court **can't** make a ruling.\n\nHaving decided there is a contract, there is **something** about the contract they don't agree on \\- if they agree then why are they in court? Each party will state their position on the dispute and provide evidence that supports that position. The court will decide based on the evidence and on the balance of probabilities which version is more correct.\n\nIt is a given that the parties are in dispute about the exact terms of the contract, whether this was because of an initial misunderstanding, someone didn't read it or someone saw an opportunity to screw someone else doesn't matter. The court will decide what it *thinks* the parties *thought* (or should have thought) at the time on the basis of the evidence and the law."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a contract dispute case, what is the primary role of the court when both parties have differing interpretations of an ambiguous contract clause?\n\nA) To determine which party's interpretation is morally right\nB) To establish the exact thoughts of both parties at the time of signing\nC) To resolve the dispute by determining the most reasonable interpretation based on evidence and law\nD) To invalidate the contract due to the misunderstanding\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The court's primary role in a contract dispute is to resolve the disagreement between the parties. When faced with ambiguous contract terms and differing interpretations, the court doesn't try to determine which party is morally right or establish the exact thoughts of the parties at signing. Instead, it aims to resolve the dispute by determining the most reasonable interpretation of the contract based on the evidence presented and applicable law. \n\nThe court will consider what it thinks the parties thought (or should have thought) at the time of signing, based on the evidence and legal principles. It's not about invalidating the contract due to misunderstanding, as option D suggests, because misunderstandings or differing interpretations are common reasons for contract disputes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because moral rightness is not the standard used in contract law.

Code \u00a7 5\\-351\\.01](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/5-351.01.html) governing when the use of deadly force by a law enforcement officer is justified, which is an affirmative defense to criminal homicide and battery charges. The D.C.

The documentation indicates that there is a typical division of labor where the Department of Justice investigates civil rights violations through its dedicated division, while local authorities handle ordinary homicide charges. This explains why the DOJ focused on potential violations of civil rights law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242) rather than homicide statutes.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the DOJ does have jurisdiction in D.C., although local authorities typically handle homicide cases.\n\nAnswer B is false; the severity of the crime doesn't determine which agency investigates it.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because there is no automatic immunity for federal law enforcement officers.

North Carolina follows a \"pure contributory negligence\" rule, which means that if a driver is found to be even slightly at fault for an incident, they may be held fully responsible. In this case, even though the circumstances are unusual, the insurance company could argue that the driver should have been aware of the soft ground and taken precautions. This strict interpretation of fault aligns with North Carolina's laws, even if the incident occurred in another state. While the driver might feel the decision is unfair, it is consistent with how North Carolina typically approaches fault in accidents.

After the county, state and federal courts reconvene, Grandpa (or his lawyer) gets to work on collecting evidence and filing paperwork for a lawsuit against Santa. On what level(s) will jurisdiction over the case lie?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Based on some quick searching, this would likely be a wrongful death action. I have to pick a state, so I'll pick Nevada.\n\nThe first question is what damages could be. I don't know offhand what is typical in wrongful death suits, but this appears to be beyond mere negligence: there was a hit and run involved. I have no trouble believing the claim would reach at least six figures. This is important, because federal diversity jurisdiction only includes lawsuits with over $75,000 at stake. Now, Santa Claus's citizenship matters; if he were stateless it'd be an issue, but he is a [citizen of Canada](http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2008/12/23/7839591.html).\n\nThat means that federal court has diversity jurisdiction: because the lawsuit is between a citizen of one state on one side and a foreign citizen on the other (no state has citizens on both sides of the lawsuit), and meets Congress's extra requirements (enough money at stake), it can be in federal court. The way diversity jurisdiction works is that the plaintiff can file in federal court, but if they choose to file in Nevada court then the defendant can *remove* the case to federal court. Either party can get it into federal court.\n\nConventional wisdom is that federal court is more defendant\\-friendly than state court on state law claims. It is likely that if Grandpa files the case in any court in Nevada, the case will end up in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada.\n\nBut suppose it is in state court? Most states don't have separate \"county court\" and \"state court\" systems; county courts are a thing, but they're a specialized thing and the serious stuff is not in those. A six\\-figure wrongful death claim won't go in Nevada's equivalent of small claims court. It'd go in Nevada district court, if it's in state courts.\n\nBut what about other courts? Grandma was walking home, so it can be assumed she was a Nevada resident. Assuming Grandpa lived with her (which is rather likely), so is he. They then can't sue in any US state *other* than Nevada without being laughed out of court \\-\\- a lawsuit needs to have *something* to do with where you're suing.

[Here is Washington's](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.16&full=true). RCW 9A.16\\.020 says when use of force is lawful, and there are different \"public officer\" vs. \"person\" related provisions. Generally, public officers may use force\n\n> (1\\) Whenever necessarily used by a public officer in the performance\n> of a legal duty, or a person assisting the officer and acting under\n> the officer's direction;\n\nbut persons (other than those assisting an officer) may only use force\n\n> (3\\) Whenever used by a party about to be injured, or by another\n> lawfully aiding him or her, in preventing or attempting to prevent an\n> offense against his or her person, or a malicious trespass, or other\n> malicious interference with real or personal property lawfully in his\n> or her possession, in case the force is not more than is necessary;\n\nAdditionally, RCW 9A.16\\.040 is a long section specifically about officers, the most germane parts of which are that use of deadly force is justifiable\n\n> (a) When a public officer applies deadly force in obedience to the\n> judgment of a competent court; or (b) When necessarily used by a peace\n> officer meeting the good faith standard of this section to overcome\n> actual resistance to the execution of the legal process, mandate, or\n> order of a court or officer, or in the discharge of a legal duty; or\n> (c) When necessarily used by a peace officer meeting the good faith\n> standard of this section or person acting under the officer's command\n> and in the officer's aid: (i) To arrest or apprehend a person who the\n> officer reasonably believes has committed, has attempted to commit, is\n> committing, or is attempting to commit a felony;\n\nRCW 9A.16\\.050 has more limited circumstances when homicide is justifiable by others (not in self\\-defense):\n\n> (1\\) In the lawful defense of the slayer, or his or her husband, wife,\n> parent, child, brother, or sister, or of any other person in his or\n> her presence or company, when there is reasonable ground to apprehend\n> a design on the part of the person slain to commit a felony or to do\n> some great personal injury to the slayer or to any such person, and\n> there is imminent danger of such design being accomplished; or (2\\) In\n> the actual resistance of an attempt to commit a felony upon the\n> slayer, in his or her presence, or upon or in a dwelling, or other\n> place of abode, in which he or she is\n\nIn other words, the box for police officers is bigger: they can use deadly force to do their job, your plumber cannot.\n\nRCW 9A.16\\.040 is not a general license to kill: the rest of the section details the conditions under which one can consider such use of force to be lawful. The officer must have \"probable cause to believe that the suspect, if not apprehended, poses a threat of serious physical harm to the officer or a threat of serious physical harm to others\". If that is so, \"deadly force may also be used if necessary to prevent escape from the officer\". Also, as usual, the fact\\-finders do not make that judgment post hoc, the officer at the scene does and he \"shall not be held criminally liable for using deadly force without malice and with a good faith belief that such act is justifiable pursuant to this section\".\n\nIn enacting this law (in case the courts wondered, years later, the legislature declared\n\n> The legislature recognizes that RCW 9A.16\\.040 establishes a dual\n> standard with respect to the use of deadly force by peace officers and\n> private citizens, and further recognizes that private citizens'\n> permissible use of deadly force under the authority of [RCW 9\\.01\\.200](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.110) \\[since recodified],\n> 9A.16\\.020, or 9A.16\\.050 is not restricted and remains broader than the\n> limitations imposed on peace officers\n\nThere do not appear to be statutory defenses for federal murder statutes, instead this results from common law interpretation, implemented in [federal rules of criminal procedure](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp) (discussed [here](https://txw.fd.org/sites/txw.fd.org/files/Materials%20Angelas%20Updated%20Federal%20Defenses%2012.30.10.pdf) w.r.t. defenses) and jury instructions in the various circuits."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under Washington state law, which of the following statements is true regarding the use of deadly force by law enforcement officers compared to civilians?\n\nA) Law enforcement officers and civilians have the same legal justifications for using deadly force.\n\nB) Civilians have broader legal justifications for using deadly force than law enforcement officers.\n\nC) Law enforcement officers have more extensive legal justifications for using deadly force, including preventing the escape of a suspect who poses a serious threat.\n\nD) The use of deadly force is never legally justified for either law enforcement officers or civilians.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Washington state law (RCW 9A.16.040), law enforcement officers have broader justifications for using deadly force compared to civilians. Officers can use deadly force to perform their legal duties, overcome resistance, and apprehend felony suspects. They can also use it to prevent escape if there's probable cause to believe the suspect poses a serious threat. Civilians, on the other hand, have more limited circumstances where they can legally use deadly force, primarily in self-defense or defense of others when there's an imminent threat of serious harm or to resist certain felonies.

However, subsections (1\\) limit the application of the law, stating \"Whoever, not being a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe\", which means that the restrictions only apply to those who are not a member of an SC or ST. The listed acts are not prohibited in the case of a Sentinelese person is forced by another Sentinelese person to eat an obnoxious substance, regardless of whether the two people are related. Moreover, because the law is stated as exempting *any* member of a SC/ST, a Toda may force a Sentinelese person to eat an obnoxious substance without violating the law. However, a Tamil person may not do so.\n\nAssuming in a given case that the family member is not a member of an SC/ST, then we have to turn to the nature of the prohibited acts. \"Disrespecting\" a person is pretty open\\-ended: certainly forcing a person to eat an obnoxious substance is one way of disrespecting them. Normal usage of \"disrespect\" would limit that term to actions like insulting. The Act probits force\\-feeding, excreting, stripping, dispossessing from land, enslaving, interfering with voting, vexatious litigation, false reports etc. Item (x) identifies \"intentionally insult\\[ing] or intimidat\\[ing]\nwith intent to humiliate a member of\na Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe\nin any place within public view\", which might qualify (the law does not say that the \"public view\" must be composed of non\\-SC/ST persons, so local humiliation would count). This is the closest that one can come to a prohibition against \"disrespecting\".\n\nThe [2014 Amendment](https://tribal.nic.in/DivisionsFiles/mj/10-preventionofAtrocities.pdf)\n\n> (u) by words either written or spoken or by signs or by visible\n> representation or otherwise promotes or attempts to promote feelings\n> of enmity, hatred or ill\\-will against members of the Scheduled Castes\n> or the Scheduled Tribes;\n> \n> \n> (v) by words either written or spoken or by any other means disrespects\n> any late person held in high esteem by members of the Scheduled Castes\n> or the Scheduled Tribes;\n\nAs you can see, (v) has limited applicability. Promoting feelings of enmity, hatred or ill\\-will goes beyond simple disrespect.\n\nIn short, in some instances, a prohibited act may constitute disrespecting, but not all acts of disrespecting are prohibited. Moreover, the actor would have to be outside the SC/ST part of the population. There is no \"family members are exempt\" exemption to the legal requirements, and the \"not SC/ST\" exemption grants immunity to *any* SC/ST member, and does not grant immunity to a member of an OBC."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, which of the following scenarios would be considered a punishable offense?\n\nA) A person from the Toda tribe (a Scheduled Tribe) insulting a person from the Sentinelese tribe (another Scheduled Tribe) in public view\nB) A person from a non-scheduled caste forcing a Scheduled Caste member to eat an obnoxious substance\nC) A Scheduled Caste person promoting feelings of enmity against members of their own caste\nD) A non-scheduled caste person disrespecting a living person held in high esteem by Scheduled Tribe members\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because the Act specifically exempts members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from its provisions, even if they belong to different tribes.\nB) is correct as it involves a non-SC/ST person committing a prohibited act (force-feeding an obnoxious substance) against an SC member, which is explicitly covered under the Act.\nC) is incorrect because the Act does not apply to SC/ST members, even if they promote enmity against their own caste.\nD) is incorrect because the Act only specifically mentions disrespecting \"late\" (deceased) persons held in high esteem by SC/ST members, not living persons."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74562/why-is-marriage-with-a-minor-legal-in-the-us-while-sex-with-a-minor-is-not", "docs_id": 74562, "title": "Why is marriage with a minor legal in the US while sex with a minor is not?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It seems that marriage with minor is legal in many states.\n\nYet sex with a minor is not.\n\nSo they can't consummate the marriage before the child is of legal age?\n\nIn most cases, minimum marriage age is lower than minimum age of consent.\n\nStates vary.\n\n[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/child\\-marriage\\-us\\-states\\-america\\-minimum\\-age\\-bride\\-girls\\-a9467121\\.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/child-marriage-us-states-america-minimum-age-bride-girls-a9467121.html)\n\nIt seems to me that sex by itself is a relatively minor issue compared to marriage, being pregnant, and losing virginity (which is a non\\-issue for a boy).

Law is a human institution, and is not always logical or consistent.\n\nHowever, in this particular case, prohibitions on sex with a person under a given age (not always the age of majority, often known as the \"age of consent\") have a long history as a part of the law, which can be discussed here.\n\nThe question seems to be missing a key detail. Where marriage is legal below the age of consent, sex within a legal marriage is normally an exception to statutory rape laws, that is laws against sex with a person under the age of consent.\n\nFor example, the Arizona Criminal Code [\u00a7 13\\-1405](https://law.justia.com/codes/arizona/2013/title-13/section-13-1405/) provides in pertinent part that:\n\n> A.

It is not a defense to a prosecution pursuant to section 13\\-1406 that the defendant was the spouse of the victim at the time of commission of the act. \\[*\u00a7 13\\-1406 prohibits sexual assault, defined as sex without the other party's consent.

(a) Unlawful sexual intercourse is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person **who is not the spouse of the perpetrator**, if the person is a minor. For the purposes of this section, a minor is a person under the age of 18 years and an adult is a person who is at least 18 years of age. \\[*emphasis added*]\n\nColorado Code \\[\u00a7 18\\-3\\-402] provides in pertinent part that:\n\n> (1\\) Any actor who knowingly inflicts sexual intrusion or sexual penetration on a victim commits sexual assault if:\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (d) At the time of the commission of the act, the victim is less than fifteen years of age and the actor is at least four years older than the victim **and is not the spouse of the victim**; or \\[*emphasis added*]\n> \n> \n> (e) At the time of the commission of the act, the victim is at least fifteen years of age but less than seventeen years of age and the actor is at least ten years older than the victim **and is not the spouse of the victim**; \\[*emphasis added*]\n\nThe Wikipedia article [\"Statutory rape\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_rape) lists several reasons that have been given for such laws. It states:\n\n> The original purpose of statutory rape laws was to protect young, unwed females from males who might impregnate them and not take responsibility by providing support for the child. In the past, the solution to such problems was often a shotgun wedding, a forced marriage called for by the parents of the girl in question. This rationale aims to preserve the marriageability of the girl and to prevent unwanted teenage pregnancy. \\[*citations omitted*]\n\nObviously, this rationale does not apply if the parties are married, and the man is legally obliged to support his wife and child, as was the usual practice before modern times.\n\nThe Wikipedia article also states:\n\n> Statutory rape laws are based on the premise that an individual is legally incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse until that person reaches a certain age. The law mandates that even if he or she willingly engages in sexual intercourse, the sex is not consensual.\n\nWhen an underage marriage requires parental consent, as it does in some US states, this rationale is less applicable.\n\n> Another rationale comes from the fact that minors are generally economically, socially, and legally unequal to adults. By making it illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor, statutory rape laws aim to give the minor some protection against adults in a position of power over the youth.\n\nAgain parental consent provides some protection against this concern, and as the classic adult predator would not be willing to marry the victim, an exception for marriage does not enable such predators a free pass.\n\nIn general social policy and public opinion have treated sex within marriage differently, and more favorably, than sex outside of marriage. Rules in the common\\-law system reflect this. The legal requirements of a marriage have been thought to offer protection (both for the underage person and for society) against the problems that underage sex would otherwise cause, and so consensual sex with a person under the age of consent within a lawful marriage is generally legal. It might be debated whether this is good reasoning, and one might argue that laws on this point should be changed. There have been changes, piecemeal, state by state, not all in the same direction. One common, although not invariable, change is so\\-called \"Romeo and Juliet\" laws, which remove or reduce criminal penalties when the \"adult\" is not that much older than the \"child\" (often within 3 years of age, although laws vary by state within the US) and the sex was consensual. These are described at greater length in the Wikipedia article. Note that the AZ and CO laws quoted above have such provisions, and that CA reduces penalties in such cases in a section not quoted.\n\nDetails of the various statutory rape laws within the US as of 2003 can be found at [\"Statutory Rape Laws By State\"](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2003/olrdata/jud/rpt/2003-r-0376.htm). This gives specific legal citations to the laws involved.

Is this legal? Would such a person need to be given warning or severance? I guess an employer who signs a union agreement could agree not to employee any person listed on a black list.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A union cannot fire an employee (except a person who is an employee of the union), but an employer can. Section 246\\.1(1\\) of the [Canada Labour Code](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/l-2/) prohibits a federally regulated employer from taking an adverse action against an employee, if they exercising specific rights granted under Part III.

There are also labo(u)r laws for [provinces and territories](https://www.adp.ca/en/resources/compliance-and-legislation/employment-standards-in-canada/provinces-and-territories.aspx), but it is unlikely that retaliation is a protected right in any part of Canada.

According to the information provided, Canadian labor laws do not protect an employee's right to retaliate against union members. The Canada Labour Code prohibits employers from taking adverse actions against employees for exercising specific rights related to wages, scheduling, and leaves, but retaliating against union members is not one of these protected rights. Therefore, an employer can legally take action, including termination, against an employee who has retaliated against a union member without facing legal consequences related to union protection.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the right to freedom of association protects joining a union, not retaliating against union members.

Stating how you voted, by itself, is fine; however, taking a photo of your ballot instead of just saying how you voted is illegal in some states, especially if the photo was taken within a polling place. Laws banning these so\\-called \"ballot selfies\" may be unconstitutional, and have been successfully challenged under the first amendment in some cases.\n\n---\n\nThere is not a general ban on simply *saying* who you voted for. This is an extremely common practice, and it is the basis for \"exit polling,\" where voters leaving a polling place are asked whom they voted for in order to collect voting statistics to predict the winner of the election. This type of polling has been [upheld by courts](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1108/exit-polling), and it sounds like laws banning it were primarily concerned with voter intimidation rather than vote\\-buying.\n\nAs of 2016, [18 states banned sharing any photograph of a ballot, while an additional 6 ban photography in polling places](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/where-can-you-take-a-selfie-with-your-ballot/). The rationale for such laws is to prevent vote\\-buying, because if you can't take a photo of your ballot, you can't prove whom you voted for (whereas without the photo, you could simply vote however you like, then lie). However, at least one such law has been [challenged in federal court and invalidated as a violation of the first amendment](http://www.nhd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Opinions/15/15NH154P.pdf) (in Rideout v.

Uruguayan legal citizenship has special characteristics. A person who acquires it retains their nationality of origin, which is determined by Uruguayan law to be that of their country of birth and therefore, is immutable. Legal citizens acquire political rights but do not acquire Uruguayan nationality as natural citizens do. According to Uruguayan law, those born in Uruguay or whose parents or grandparents are Uruguayan natural citizens are considered to be Uruguayan nationals.\n\nThe Uruguayan State defined nationality in this way based on an interpretation of the Constitution made by the jurist Justino Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga in the mid\\-twentieth century. Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga's interpretation, found in one of Uruguay's fundamental academic interpretative texts, states: *\"In the first place, nationality is presented to us as a natural bond, derived from birth, from blood\"*. Likewise, this jurist believed that *\"nationality corresponds to a certain sociological or psychological reality\"*. Speaking on behalf of the drafters of the Constitution of 1830, this jurist concluded: *\"The quality of nationality thus depends on one fact: birth in the territory of the State\". Finally, \"nationality is irrevocable\"*.\n\nAccording to Uruguayan law, the concepts of nationality and citizenship are distinguishable, the first being of a real or sociological nature and the second of a legal nature.\n\nHe argued that nationality and citizenship are two completely different individual conditions. According to Ar\u00e9chaga's view nationality is a permanent state of the individual, which does not suffer any alteration whatever the point of the earth they inhabit, and citizenship is, on the contrary, variable and alters with the different domiciles that men acquire in the different societies into which mankind is divided.\n\nThe source of citizenship, he added, is in the actual domicile and not in nationality.\n\nTherefore, he says: *\"each state feels who its nationals are, and declares it by its law; on the other hand, each state decides who its citizens are, and it disposes of them by its law, for nationality corresponds to a certain sociological or psychological reality.\"* (JUSTINO JIM\u00c9NEZ DE ARECHAGA, La Constituci\u00f3n Nacional. Volume II pg. 186\\)\n\nAs a result of Uruguay's unusual distinction between citizenship and nationality (it's the only country in the world that recognizes the right to citizenship without being a national), legal citizens have encountered problems with their Uruguayan passports at airports around the world since 2015\\. This is due to recommendations in the seventh edition of Doc. 9303 of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which requires that travel documents issued by participating states include the \"Nationality\" field. The lack of a naturalization path means that the Nationality field in legal citizens' passports indicates their country of birth, which Uruguay assumes to be their nationality of origin. Many countries do not accept passports issued by a country that declares the holder to be a national of another country. As a consequence, it has severely curtailed legal citizens' exercise of the right to free movement, as their travel abroad is often difficult or downright impossible.\n\nDue to its current and narrow definition of nationality, Uruguay could be violating the sovereignty of other countries by assigning foreign nationalities in its official documents, thus overriding their powers. Some Uruguayan legal citizens may even, as a result of the application of a national law of a third nation and this Uruguayan interpretation, become de facto stateless.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This seems similar to a lot of other countries. For example, in U.S. Law, only natural born U.S. Citizens can be President or Vice President, whereas immigrant Citizens can hold any other elected or appointed office in the U.S. Government.\n\nIn New Zealand, New Zealand Citizens living aboard cannot vote in New Zealand election, because living aboard means they have no stake in elections.\n\nAs to your passport concerns, it's generally accepted that a nation that a validly issued passport by a nation is a validly issued passport for the point of crossing the boarder. In nations that allow dual citizenship, people who have dual citizenships may own passports from both nations and nations may issue passports to non\\-citizens for numerous reasons (One famous example was [Canadian Caper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Caper), in which Canada issued valid Canadian passports to six American diplomats who managed to flee the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the Iranian Hostage Crisis and were being hidden within the residents of the Canadian Ambassador to Iran. While the CIA managed to bring the passports to the escapees, it was only the six ambassadors who received valid Canadian Passports, while the CIA agent on the mission had to forge a Canadian Passport.)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to Uruguayan law and the interpretation by Justino Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga, which of the following statements is correct regarding the distinction between nationality and citizenship in Uruguay?\n\nA) Nationality is variable and changes based on an individual's domicile, while citizenship is a permanent state.\n\nB) Nationality and citizenship are interchangeable terms in Uruguayan law, with no legal distinction between them.\n\nC) Nationality is determined by birth or blood ties and is immutable, while citizenship is a legal status that can be acquired.\n\nD) Both nationality and citizenship in Uruguay can be obtained through a naturalization process for immigrants.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

[Wikipedia's article on South Korean nationality law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korean_nationality_law#Acquisition_of_nationality) says that one way to automatically acquire South Korean nationality is \u201cBy being born to either a South Korean national father or South Korean national mother after 13 June 1998, or to a South Korean national father before then.\u201d Does this require any registration on the part of your parents/relatives, or is it truly automatic?\n\n[An article by Seattle Pi from 2004](https://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/The-accidental-citizen-soldier-1141729.php) gives an example of someone who was drafted because \u201cit appears a family member \\-\\- maybe his paternal grandfather or his father, who is divorced from Chun's mother and lives in South Korea \\-\\- entered his name in the nation's family census registry, the hojok.\u201d However, according to [the Wikipedia article on hoju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoju), it was abolished on January 1, 2008\\.\n\nIt seems that before 2010, South Korean dual citizenship was impossible, so if one were born before 2010 and had ethnically Korean parents who were both American citizens at the time of their birth, that child wouldn't have any chance of automatically being a South Korean citizen?\n\nIs it still true that one would have to rescind their South Korean nationality before the age of 18, and one is unable to do so later?\n\nDoes visiting Korea for a short period of time (I've heard 30 days) eliminate the risk of being drafted? Is there any paperwork you can fill out beforehand like you can with Israel?\n\nThe relevant laws have been changing quite a bit in the past few decades apparently, so it's hard to tell what information is still true or what's outdated.

If you have a Korean lational parent, you are automatically Korean. Before March 31 of the year you turn 18, you must renounce your Korean citizenship, lest you be then subject to the military service law. If you were a Korean citizen and then gained another citizenship, you automatically lose your Korean citizenship, and if you did not complete your military obligation and did not obtain an overseas travel permit, you may be punished if you ever return to Korea. The travel permit lets you postpone military service until age 37, so if you are living overseas, by January 15 of the year you turn 25 you must apply for a travel permit.\n\nThe laws are set up so that you must enlist by age 28, but must have obtained a travel permit by age 25\\. That means if you are abiding by the law, there is no risk of sudden conscription if you're there for a short period (e.g. as a tourist). The risk seems to come from not obtaining a travel permit."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A 24-year-old Korean-American male, born in the US to a Korean national father and American mother, wants to visit South Korea for a two-week vacation.

I suppose this is something similar to the use of cigarettes, how does this work in these cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a saying that you can't sue city hall: that is applicable here. Governments enjoy sovereign immunity, and cannot be sued for their errors of judgment unless they specifically allow it. Safety regulations are an example of a situation where the government hold all of the power and shoulders none of the responsibility. If a government forbids sale or use of a substance on some grounds (could be safety, could be economic impact, could be something about preventing the moral decay of society), and the grounds later turns to be false, you cannot sue the government because of lost business opportunities.\n\nGenerally speaking, that which is not prohibited is allowed, so there would have to be an affirmative duty for the government to prevent all forms of harm. If there were such a legal duty, there is a miniscule legal foundation for suing the government for shirking its duty. That is not a completely hypothetical possibility, in that the state of Washington imposes a constitutional duty on the legislature to provide public education, and the Supreme Court has done things to enforce this duty (the contempt of court fines are up in the realm of $80 million).\n\nSince there is no jurisdiction that imposes a duty on the government to absolutely prevent all harm, you won't be able to sue the government if they fail to outlaw a thing that is eventually proven to harm someone."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A government agency approves a food preservative for use, which is later discovered to be carcinogenic.

The concept of sovereign immunity, as explained in the provided information, protects governments from being sued for errors in judgment or policy decisions, including those related to safety regulations. The passage specifically states that \"Governments enjoy sovereign immunity, and cannot be sued for their errors of judgment unless they specifically allow it.\" This means that citizens cannot sue the government for approving a substance that later turns out to be harmful, unless there is a specific law or provision that allows for such lawsuits in this particular situation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it goes against the principle of sovereign immunity.

The details of the law, including the rules on damages and other remidies, will vary from country to country.\n\nIn the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") those rules are contained in [Chapter 5 of title 17 USC](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html) particularly sections 502\\-505\\. Section 504 provides for possible money damages. Section 502 provides for a possible injunction (court order to stop infringing). Section 503 provides for for infringing works to be seized. Section 505 provides for possible awards of costs and legal fees to a successful plaintiff (copyright holder).\n\nSection 502 allows injunctions to \"prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright\" on \"reasonable\" terms. But when the infringement has already been stopped, no such injunction is needed and a court is not likely to impose one.\n\nSection 503 allows the court to order the impoundment of infringing copies and \"plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, or other articles by means of which such copies or phonorecords may be reproduced\". This is largely obsolete for digital content.\n\nSection 504 is the key. It offers the plaintiff a choice between actual damages plus profits and statutory damages. The rule for the first is:\n\n> The copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement, and any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.\n\nThis means money made by use of the unauthorized content, plus any loss of sales or other losses suffered by the owner. Money mad by the infringing work but not made by use of the infringing content is not included, if this can be proven. Income obtained after the infringing content was removed would probably not be included in the infringer's profits.\n\nStatutory damages can be any amount between $750 and $30,000 that the count thinks is just, but id the infringement is proved to be \"innocent\" the lower limit is $200\\. The exact provision reads:\n\n> In a case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200\\.\n\nAn award of costs and fees under section 505 is entirely up to the discretion of the court.\n\nIf the maximum possible award of infringer's profits is $10,000, and a defense of innocent infringement is plausible, a plaintiff might well find such a suit unprofitable, given the legal expenses involved in preparing an carrying through such a suit. But that is entirely up to the copyright owner. An owner may choose to file even an unprofitable suit in an effort to deter others.\n\nA person who has discovered that s/he has innocently infringed a copyright and made some money in the process would be wise to document the prompt removal of the infringing content form any publication, and efforts to notify the copyright owner. Ther is no way to be sure what actions the owner will take, if any, within those that the law allows.\n\nOften a owner in such a case will not bring suit if the infringement was apparently innocent, resulting profits were small, the infringement has been halted, and future infringement by that infringer seems unlikely. But different owners have different policies on such matters.\n\nAn owner can delay in deciding whether to file suit or not."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Czech developer unknowingly used a 3D model in their game that was stolen from a AAA game and uploaded to Sketchfab under a CC Attribution license.

According to the documentation, even though the developer acted in good faith, they could still face legal action for copyright infringement. The copyright owner (AAA game studio) could potentially sue for statutory damages, which range from $750 to $30,000, or as low as $200 if the infringement is proven to be innocent. Additionally, the studio could seek to recover any profits attributable to the infringement. While the developer's quick action to remove the model and attempt to contact the studio may work in their favor, it does not completely eliminate the possibility of legal consequences.

How does subjective application differ from objective application of an OS?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The next part of the sentence (after the bolded text) explains how an objective standard may be applied subjectively: \n\n> there are no clear criteria from the cases indicating how errors of judgment are to be identified.\n\nEssentially, my view of whether an error is the kind of error a competent professional might make may differ from your view of whether that same error is the kind a competent professional might make. Because there are no criteria established, the application is subjective. \n\nConversely, if there were criteria that you and I were both bound to apply in making this determination, then you and I would be using an objective standard to determine if that error was the type a competent professional might make."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Canadian tort law, the distinction between incompetence and \"errors in judgment\" for professionals is described as \"an objective standard which is subjectively applied.\" Which of the following best explains this concept?\n\nA) The standard is based on clear criteria established by case law, but judges have discretion in how they interpret these criteria.\n\nB) The standard is determined by what the individual professional believes to be competent practice in their field.\n\nC) The standard is based on what a competent professional might do, but there are no clear criteria for identifying errors of judgment, leading to subjective interpretation.\n\nD) The standard is entirely subjective and varies from case to case based on the judge's personal opinion.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states there are \"no clear criteria from the cases.\"\nOption B is incorrect as it describes a purely subjective standard, not an objective one applied subjectively.\nOption C is correct. It captures the essence of an objective standard (what a competent professional might do) being applied subjectively due to the lack of clear criteria for identifying errors of judgment.\nOption D is incorrect because while there is subjectivity in the application, the standard itself is not entirely subjective. It's still based on the concept of what a competent professional might do."}}
