For example, if the blurred portion says \"Call now, operators waiting\" or \"Don't do this at home!\", that is not copyright management information.

According to Section 1202 of the U.S. Copyright Act, it is illegal to intentionally remove or alter any copyright management information without the authority of the copyright owner. Watermarks often contain such information (e.g., copyright holder's name or logo). Blurring these watermarks could be considered alteration of copyright management information, potentially violating this law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fair use does not automatically make watermark alteration legal. Option B is false because explicit forbiddance isn't necessary; the law protects copyright management information by default. Option D is incorrect because the duration of clip use is not relevant to the legality of altering copyright management information."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84420/citizens-united-applicability-to-100-foreign-owned-us-corporations", "docs_id": 84420, "title": "Citizens United applicability to 100% foreign owned US corporations?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Citizens United said that US corporations can spend unlimited \"independent expenditures for political campaigns\".\n\nHowever, foreign natural persons and foreign corporations are not allowed to spend any independent expenditures for US political campaigns.

From what I've learnt, they only get the evidence by investigating your computer. Is that right?\n\nOr do they really need to investigate the hacker's computer? And if they do have to investigate the hacker's computer what exactly would they need to \"Find\" to convict him?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Anyone can be arrested, as long as the police (and in some cases, anyone) have probable cause to do so. This generally includes two points:\n\n* You are in the process of committing a criminal act\n* The police have probable cause, generally through evidence, that you are in the process of, about to, or have committed a criminal act. This usually requires obtaining a warrant for the arrest.\n\nHowever, it's important not to conflate searches with arrest. Arrests are when you are being taken into custody for the reasons mentioned above. Searches are when your personal belongings (i.e. property), are searched to collect evidence.\n\nIt is not up to police to *convict* someone. This is the job of the judicial system. There's a bit of terminology here: *convictions* basically mean being found guilty of an offence. Police don't have the ability to convict someone of an offence. They do have the ability to arrest, and *charge* with an offence. To charge someone with a crime basically means to accuse them of having done something.\n\n---\n\nNow let's get to the actual crime. Since you haven't mentioned a specific jurisdiction, I'm going to use Canadian cases and law, but in general, it should apply worldwide.\n\nIf the police have reason to believe that you are engaging in unlawful hacking\\-related behaviour, then they have the authority to arrest you. They simply need to have a reasonable belief that you are engaged in the crime. Something such as connecting you with an IP address and connecting that you were online at the time is enough.\n\nIf the police need to find out more information (which they generally do, to investigate further into the matter) \\- they can obtain a search warrant afterwards. With this, they can legally search into your computer, and investigate. Any evidence that they collect can be used in court.\n\nI've recently done some research into cyber crimes. One rather infamous case involved the attack on multiple large scale websites, including Dell, Yahoo, and Amazon, in 2000\\. This sparked a large scale investigations, between the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) and the FBI. The attacks were claimed by some to cause nearly 1\\.7 billion dollars of damage.

According to the documentation, law enforcement does not need to have enough evidence to convict before making an arrest. They only need probable cause, which can be established by evidence such as an IP address connecting the suspect to the crime. The police can make an arrest based on this probable cause and then obtain a search warrant to investigate the suspect's computer for further evidence. This process is illustrated in the example of the \"Mafiaboy\" case, where the suspect was arrested before his computer was searched.

They buy license at bulk and sell it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are many aspect to this.\n\nFirst of all, there is a license which is a deal between a manufacturer of the software and the entity who bought those keys (assuming that key dealer bought them lawfully). This license often directly forbids further sale of such keys. So according to manufacturer they can be \"pirated\".\n\nSecondly, there is a law applicable to your jurisdiction. Eg in EU resale of used software is always legal and cannot be taken away by the license. So according to the law they may be legal.\n\nAnother issue here is what proof of purchase you'll get from the key dealer? Your local jurisdiction may not recognize this transaction at all without a proper receipt or invoice.\n\nThis only skims the surface, because later you might want to exercise rights from the license (eg right to tech support or updates), however the license might be already violated. So you might end up in situation in which the software is legal to poses but not fully\\-functional (or perhaps not functional at all).\n\nFinally, there is the question of good faith.

However, this legality doesn't guarantee that the buyer will receive full support or updates from the software company. The original license agreement may have been violated by the resale, potentially limiting the buyer's rights to certain services or features. Additionally, while the purchase itself is legal under EU law, the buyer may face practical issues such as lack of proper documentation or difficulty in obtaining support from the manufacturer. It's important to note that while the purchase is legal, it may come with limitations that wouldn't exist if buying directly from the manufacturer or an authorized reseller."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/39135/how-will-changes-to-section-21-affect-me", "docs_id": 39135, "title": "How will changes to section 21 affect me?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The following question relates to *English* housing law.\n\nFollowing on from the news today that the government plans to [abolish section 21](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/15/short-notice-evictions-face-axe-in-tenant-rights-victory) evictions I was wondering how this affects my current circumstances.\n\nFor the last 4 years I have lived in a property which I rent.

While the exact details were not finalized at the time of the question, it's most likely that tenancies would transition to a statutory periodic arrangement after the fixed term ends. This would allow tenants to remain in the property without necessarily signing a new fixed-term contract, but landlords would still have grounds for eviction under specific circumstances (such as wanting to sell the property or move in themselves). Options A and B are too extreme, as indefinite occupation without any new agreement is unlikely, and allowing eviction without reason would defeat the purpose of abolishing Section 21.

The \"Reserved\" paragraph is likely a placeholder used to maintain consistent paragraph numbering across different engagement letters. This practice allows attorneys to customize the letter for individual clients by removing or adding specific clauses without altering the overall structure and numbering of the document. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because attorneys cannot unilaterally insert terms after an agreement has been signed. This would be unethical and likely unenforceable.\n\nAnswer C is plausible but incorrect in this context. If terms were still being negotiated, it would typically be indicated more explicitly or left blank for later completion, rather than marked as \"Reserved.\"\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as there is no general legal requirement to include a \"Reserved\" section in engagement letters.

The office agreed to cover the cost of the repairs in order to facilitate her coming to work as well.\n\nThe offer was made in May, and with the pandemic delays the repair work was finished in June and I was able to order a duplicate title in July. I was working remotely so I brought the title in and signed it, however we did not agree on date, etc. At that point and she was to leave the title at the office until things had been ironed out.\n\nShe had multiple reasons why she was unable to take possession of the vehicle and kept putting it off. I continued to pay for insurance on the vehicle as it physically remained in my possession. She finally told me that she got insurance on the vehicle at the end of August, although at this point her behavior was getting more erratic and her attendance at work was not consistent or reliable for months. I did not believe her and to be safe continued to pay for insurance on the car.\n\nI asked her multiple times when she would take the vehicle and always was told later dates. This past week, she once again called out at the last minute for 3 days straight and then told our office that she would no longer be able to work during the week and wanted to only work on weekends (we are a law office so this was not what she was hired for). After much consideration, we decided we still wanted to help her and agreed that we would come in on the weekends and allow her to work so that she would at least be able to make some money.\n\nHowever, at this point I informed her that the vehicle was off the table as she had yet to use it to come to work which was the condition of the gift and now she would not be coming to work on the weekdays as previously agreed. She was unhappy about this and told me the car was hers as she had removed the title from the office already. In addition, she never showed up for her shifts the following Saturday and Sunday and also never responded to multiple texts confirming her new schedule and asking her where she was when she was a no show.\n\nAt this point we accepted her lack of communication and absences as a resignation and sent her a letter outlining all the facts regarding her employment with us and stating that she was no longer with the company due to her actions.

The mere fact that one consideration entails a permanent effect (i.e., she would not have to return the vehicle) does not change the fact that the parties' ascertainable intent was an *exchange* of considerations.\n\nNow termination of her employment frustrates the purpose of *that* contract. Moreover, since (1\\) she kept postponing the picking up of the vehicle till you informed her of the withdrawal of your offer, and (2\\) her attendance did not improve significantly, the contract was voidable *by you* to the extent that her prior acts (i.e., incurring Uber expenses) misled and induced you to make that offer.\n\nEven if she were in possession of the vehicle already, her erraticism and unreliability suggests that she breached the *covenant of good faith and fair dealing* that is inherent to all contracts.

The arrangement between the employer and employee regarding the vehicle has the characteristics of a contract rather than a simple gift. There were mutual considerations: the employee was to receive the vehicle in exchange for using it to come to work. This creates a contractual obligation.\n\nThe contract can be voided for several reasons:\n1.

Are these two notions completely synonymous?\n\nNo. they aren't even that similar in meaning.\n\n> If not then what\u2019s the difference between them?\n\n**Frivolous** means not having a basis in the law or a sincere and reasonable effort to extend the law. Sometimes the term frivolous is also used in a broader sense to include not having a factual basis, even though it would be a valid lawsuit if the facts alleged were true. But a narrower definition calls something without a factual basis **groundless** and calls something without a legal basis **frivolous**.\n\nFor example, a lawsuit for breach of contract in circumstances where you are suing over a contract you wanted to enter into with someone even though you acknowledge that they didn't agree to that contract would be frivolous. You can only sue for breaches of contracts that are actually entered into and it is frivolous to bring a lawsuit when you don't argue that a contract was formed.\n\nA lawsuit alleging that a contract was entered into with someone and breached when, in fact, the other party to the alleged contract never interacted with the person bringing the lawsuit would be groundless, and within a broader sense of the term, frivolous as well.\n\n**De minimis** means that the magnitude of the harm is so small that the courts won't entertain a lawsuit to address the wrong even though the harm would otherwise be something that someone could bring a lawsuit over.\n\nFor example, if you sued someone for negligence for slightly bumping into when you were walking down a crowded sidewalk, even though you suffered no physical injury, and you weren't even made to fall or drop something as a result, that might be a lawsuit that is dismissed because the harm was *de minimis*.\n\nWhether a claim can be dismissed for alleging only *de minimis* harm varies by the nature of the cause of action. Some legal theories will award nominal damages (e.g. $1\\), if you prevail on the other elements of the claim but show only nothing more than *de minimis* harm.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, proof of damages are not necessary to prevail on a claim for breach of contract or negligence *per se*, and nominal damages will be awarded even if you fail to show damages.\n\nOther legal theories make a showing of more than *de minimis* harm one of the elements that must be proved as part of the cause of action for there to be any legal liability at all.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, a showing of more than *de minimis* damages is necessary in a negligence claim.\n\nThis is a distinction which matters a lot in cases where an award of costs and/or attorney fees depends upon which party prevails on particular causes of action.\n\nIn the federal courts, there is an additional subject\\-matter jurisdictional threshold of \"standing\", as a matter of constitutional law, which requires a showing that the person bringing a claim suffered \"actual injury\" which arguably involved more than a *de minimis* harm.

The question presents a situation where there is technically a legal basis for a battery claim (unwanted touching), but the harm is so trivial that it falls below the threshold that courts typically consider worthy of judicial attention. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the claim is not frivolous - it has a legal basis in the tort of battery, even if weakly supported.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while some jurisdictions might allow nominal damages for technical violations, most courts would likely dismiss this case due to the trivial nature of the alleged harm.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the case is not groundless - the facts as presented could technically support a battery claim, but the harm is too insignificant.\n\nThe correct answer is C because de minimis refers to harms that are too small or insignificant for the court to entertain, even if they might technically fit within a legal framework.

The players and timeline below. \n\nPlaintiff (victim) is a female of a different race of the jury as was her attorney. The victims had an attorney who asked her to increase the percent of the award under the contract because he needed help getting the case settled. That lawyer told her she would have a team of two working on the case. The first lawyer wound up not working on the case after she agreed to the increase and he essentially handed the case to the other attorney. The victim had documents proving medical visits, lost wages, and medical bills. \n\nThe defendant (drunk driver) had numerous attorneys appointed by the insurance agency that extended the case out over six years. The last lawyer was a female of the same race as the jury. The defendant, the drunk driver, did not appear in court. The defendant never spent a dime on legal fees and never showed up in court. The insurance company paid for an attorney to represent her; the insurance company could not be mentioned during the hearing.\n\nThe attorney for the victim offers a settlement to the insurance company. The settlement was for the legal limit of $25K under GA law. At the hearing, he requested a judgement of $80k.\n\nThe defendant's insurance company attorney counters the offer for $12K in writing before the hearing and $15k the day of trial. The first written offer refers to a legal code that would make the plaintiff pay the legal fees if the Jury does not award at least 75% of the offer. \n\nNeither party accepted the other's offer to settle.\n\nThe jury was composed entirely of a different race than the plaintiff; it had all women except for one male and was not a diversified group. \n\nThe jury asked a question because some invoices were not attached to a statement and wanted to impeach the victim's testimony. (Note: the total amount of the medical expenses and individual bills were listed on the statement.) Victim's attorney objected and motioned jury bias based on that question, which was denied by the judge. The jury ruled in favor for the victim with an award of only $500\\. My research shows that investigate questions by a jury and trying to impeach a witness does show bias but I could not find the code, only legal articles.\n\nThe victim felt that was an inadequate amount and wanted to appeal the decision. The victim's attorney refused to file an appeal or any motions that the victim requested stating that judges almost never overturn a jury's verdict. The victim wanted to file a motion on her behalf. She was not able to file the motion because she was under contract with her attorney and if she fired him she was liable for all of his fees. The lawyer informed her that the verdict has made her obligated to pay the insurance company back their legal fees. (Note: The victim did not file a lawsuit against the insurance company she filed a lawsuit against the drunk driver.)\n\nMy research shows that you can file a motion for the judge to give a Judgement notwithstanding a verdict and additur the amount of the award. There were numerous reasons this would be allowed jury bias was one of them. Jury prejudice is another.\n\nThe final settlement was the victim take the $500 and not file an appeal; both attorneys threatened her with the obligation to pay their legal fees if she did anything else. I could not find anything that allowed the victim out of the contract with her attorney and to act on her own behalf without being obligated to pay her lawyer his legal fees.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no legal requirement that a jury be composed of people demographically like the defendant (or the plaintiff), there is simply a requirement that the selection process give all kinds of people an equal chance at being empaneled. So being a different race or gender from one of the parties is not prima facie evidence of a biased jury.\n\nThe statement that \"The jury asked a question because some invoices were not attached to a statement and wanted to impeach the victim's testimony\" is somewhat puzzling, since Georgia is widely cited as a state where jurors are forbidden to ask questions. Let us suppose though that jurors manage to communicate an interest in knowing a fact, such as \"Do you have an invoice for X?\", then the judge could decide whether that is a proper question. At that point, it moves from being a jury matter to a legal judge matter, and if the question was itself highly prejudicial, the case could be overturned on appeal. Alternatively, the way in which the question was framed by the jury could be proof of bias, e.g. \"Please ask that lying %@!^\\* defendant to prove her ridiculous story\". The defense attorney has entered an objection (if you don't object, you can't appeal), and perhaps if the question was legally improper then the verdict could be set aside. If the attorney failed to move for mistrial (if the question proves blatant bias) then that's the end of the matter, except for a possible action against the attorney.\n\nThe implied questions about attorney conduct are hard to understand. An attorney may refuse to engage in a futile legal act, but this does not preclude an individual from seeking another attorney to file a motion or even attempting to file a motion on one's own (which is probably a futile act). However, I also assume that the victim did not have her own attorney and that this was a case between two insurance companies *about* individuals \u2013 a third party claim. In this case, the attorney represents the insurance company, not the victim, and has to be responsible to the interests of the insurance company. The attorney thus is obligated to not cost the insurance company a packet of money if there is no realistic chance of getting anything in return. The alternative would have been be to engage (and pay) your (her) own attorney.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A plaintiff in a civil case believes the jury's verdict was biased due to racial differences between herself and the jury.

This is a recognized legal procedure that doesn't solely rely on the racial composition of the jury, which by itself is not grounds for overturning a verdict (eliminating options A and B).

The parties are free to negotiate terms which govern their past behaviour.\n\nIf instead you mean that the contract purports to have been entered into in the past then no, that is not legitimate. Depending on the circumstances this can amount to fraud or forgery.\n\nIn practice it is common for people to misunderstand the difference and so you will often find contracts backdated by inserting the past date as the date of the contract (the 2nd type) when the correct approach is to have a clause which specifies that the terms apply from an earlier date (the 1st type).\n\nThere is also an implied question here about what those terms should be for the backdated period.

It is my understanding that Powell's First Amendment right is not tested as the plaintiff is Dominion Voting Systems and not the government. Assume Dominion has actually suffered quantifiable damages (loss of business), caused by the Powell assertions.\n\nIf plaintiff were to assert that Powell's statements were the extremist \"dog whistle\" that summoned unreasonable persons to cause said damages: How, if in any way, does the defense's reasonable person standard shield Powell? IANAL\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Some simplified points of basic defamation law as background:\n\n* A critical element of defamation law is that the defendant said something false.\n* You therefore can't win a defamation case if it's based on a statement that can't be proven false: \"You are annoying.\" \"You are ugly.\" \"You are a bad lawyer.\"\n* If a statement can't be proven false, it is considered opinion.\n* Statments of opinion are virtually always protected by the First Amendment.\n\n[Powell's brief](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20519858/3-22-21-sidney-powell-defending-the-republic-motion-to-dismiss-dominion.pdf) relies on this framework to argue that because her statements were statements of opinion, no defamation could have occurred. It's like defending against a murder charge by saying that no one died. Although it isn't generally referred to as the \"reasonable person standard,\" reasonableness comes into this question because part of the calculus in assessing whether a statement is fact or opinion is to ask whether a reasonable person would understand the statement to be making an assertion of fact. [*Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.*, 497 U.S. 1 (1990\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/497/1).\n\nBy leaning into that language, Powell is not saying that reasonable people would not have any reaction or would not have any specific reaction to her statements; instead, she is saying that reasonable people would not have understood her statements to be assertions of fact. Her argument seems to turn on the fact that she was speaking as an attorney representing a political candidate in a lawsuit, and that reasonable people understand statements made in that context to be \"inherently prone to exaggeration and hyperbole\u201d and \"view them only as claims that await testing by the courts through the adversary process.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, that seems to me like a pretty weak argument. While people expect a certain amount of puffery from their candidates, they also expect that lawyers representing the President of the United States aren't going into court with frivolous allegations.\n\nMore importantly, though, I think she's running the analysis incorrectly. Rather than asking whether a reasonable person would understand her statements to assertions of fact, she's asking whether a reasonable person would think that she was prone to exaggerate in the setting in which she made those statements. As I understand it, a speaker cannot cloak statements of fact from liability by merely refraining from uttering them until she finds herself in a context where people expect some amount of loose speech. Even if you're a partisan hack with no credibility appearing on a TV show hosted by another partisan hack with no credibility, you generally can't accuse your opponent of being a murderer or child molester or something like that. Those are still assertions of fact, even if they're bookended with statements that \"Donald Trump is the greatest president this country will ever have.\"\n\nThe brief does not rely at all on *Hustler* or the First Amendment protections for parody that were discussed in the previous answer.

In defamation cases, particularly those involving political speech, the \"reasonable person standard\" is applied to determine whether a statement should be considered an assertion of fact (which can be defamatory if false) or a protected opinion. The key is whether a reasonable person would understand the statement to be making an factual assertion, not merely whether exaggeration might be expected in a given context.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the context of a statement is relevant, it's not the primary factor.

Whether or not you can get such a court order and get it enforced is up in the air right now (July 6 is one day when things might change). In the normal case, you would file a holdover case, because the lease expired. [This document](https://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/pdfs/TenantsGuide_holdover.pdf) from the NY Courts is addressed to tenants, but the information contained in it tells you what a landlord has to do. Notice of Termination is not required for a holdover eviction. Notice to Quit requires 10 days notice.\n\nYou do not collect rent in this case, unless you want to start all over (this is one of the defenses against holdover eviction). By collecting rent, you agree (by actions) to let the tenant continue, and the essence of a holdover case is that they are holding over without permission. While the case is going on, the judge may order the tenant to pay \"use and occupation\". Given the distinct possibility that the situation is going to continue for a long time, you may be in novel legal territory, therefore you should get an attorney. The premise of holdover evictions is that it is not an arduous process, you simply establish that the tenant overstayed the lease, and you won;t have to wait months without payment to get your (first) day in court. However, a holdover tenant is treated as a month\\-to\\-month tenant, so you can accept rent under those conditions while waiting for the legal situation to change.

Accepting rent could be seen as agreeing to let the tenant continue occupancy, which would undermine the eviction case. The landlord cannot evict without a court order, even with a family medical situation. There is no legal requirement to renew the lease due to tenant hardship or the pandemic.

Could a judge cancel his own or (without requiring court appearance)\nhis relatives traffic ticket?\n2. Could a judge declare an individual as guilty simply because they\nwant to, esp. if the case does not have much direct evidence either\nfor or against an indictment?\n\n(I am not interested in what they are expected to do, or how they are expected to behave in their position, but what they are able to do without accountability.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the proper immediate action is to \\- while not leaving the judicial branch \\- appeal up to the next higher court. In federal courts, the lowest levels are district courts, which issues decisions appealable to the circuit courts, whose decisions are sometimes able to make their way to the Supreme Court by submitting a Petition for Writ of Certiorari. Then the Supreme Court meets and decides which appeals it will hear for the year ahead. \n\nThis works similarly on a state level, except the levels of the courts may have different names (for example, Washington, DC\u2019s trial level court is not the District Court, but the Superior Court. In Virginia, one trial court is the General District Court, which hears claims up to $25,000 and another trial court is the Virginia Circuit Court which hears other claims, and some felonies while also serving as an appellate court for the General District Court).\n\nAssuming those options have been exhausted, the reality is yeah, sometimes there are judges who will act that way. Sometimes they will get away with it because they are maintaining enough discretion, they are powerful enough, or because someone else is corrupt, too. \n\nA number of options and variables may come into play at this point. What, if any, laws exist to prevent the behavior in question? What ethics standard does the jurisdiction have (this would likely be developed by the local bar association)? Are there any other organizations he or she is affiliated with professionally? Who else knows about it, how serious is it, will anyone else speak up, etc...? Each of those variables \\- and likely a number of others not mentioned here \\- may play into the outcome. They each can serve to make one\u2019s actions more or less easy or desirable to perform, whether by exposing and embarrassing an actor, reminding him or her of the potential legal liability associated with such actions, etc. \n\nAll that said, there are limits on what a judge may or may not do. For example, in federal criminal cases, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, rules assembled by the US Sentencing Commission that are, of course, non\\-binding, set a floor and ceiling on the years in prison one should be sentenced to in various circumstances with a formula used to make the calculation. It is rare (and sometimes controversial and subject to scrutiny) if a judge grossly or unreasonable deviates from the Guidelines. The intent of the Guidelines is to remove judicial bias from the doling out of prison sentences. Results have arguably been mixed. \n\nFinally, I\u2019d be remiss not to mention that in general judicial discretion in many aspects of litigation is a desirable and useful occurrence, whether it manifests itself in the dismissal of a frivolous case or appointing counsel to an indigent defendant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A federal judge has consistently given harsher sentences to defendants of a particular racial group, deviating significantly from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.

As stated in the documentation, \"the proper immediate action is to - while not leaving the judicial branch - appeal up to the next higher court.\" In the federal court system, decisions from district courts can be appealed to circuit courts. This process allows for review of the judge's decisions within the judicial system itself before pursuing other options. While other actions like filing complaints or organizing protests may be considered later, appealing to a higher court is the standard first step in addressing potential judicial misconduct or errors in sentencing."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59005/impersonating-account-holder-with-perfectly-good-intentions-and-the-person-him", "docs_id": 59005, "title": "Impersonating account holder, with perfectly good intentions, and the person himself willingly assisting.

In Scotland, generally speaking, at least one party must either be domiciled in Scotland or must have been a \"habitual resident\" of Scotland for at least a year.\n\nIn Europe, international jurisdiction over divorce cases is governed by the [Brussels II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_II) regulation enacted in 2003 (text [here](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R2201:EN:HTML)), and different bodies of law allocate jurisdiction between different divorce regimes within federal states like the U.K. as explained [here](http://www.brodies.com/blog/what-are-the-rules-of-jurisdiction-for-family-cases-in-scotland/). The basic rule of Brussels II for divorces is set forth in Article 3 which states:\n\n> 1. In matters relating to divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment, jurisdiction shall lie with the courts of the Member State\n> \n> \n> (a) in whose territory:\n> \n> \n> * the spouses are habitually resident, or\n> * the spouses were last habitually resident, insofar as one of them still resides there, or\n> * the respondent is habitually resident, or\n> * in the event of a joint application, either of the spouses is habitually resident, or\n> * the applicant is habitually resident if he or she resided there for at least a year immediately before the application was made, or\n> * the applicant is habitually resident if he or she resided there for at least six months immediately before the application was made and is\n>  either a national of the Member State in question or, in the case of\n>  the United Kingdom and Ireland, has his or her \"domicile\" there;\n> \n> \n> (b) of the nationality of both spouses or, in the case of the United\n>  Kingdom and Ireland, of the \"domicile\" of both spouses.\n> \n> \n> 2. For the purpose of this Regulation, \"domicile\" shall have the same meaning as it has under the legal systems of the United Kingdom and\n>  Ireland.\n\nA handful of countries do not and in the days when a divorce was hard to get in the absence of proof of fault, there was a huge amount of litigation over whether a couple could either unilaterally, or by mutual agreement, dissolve their marriage in a place that had loose jurisdictional requirements for obtaining a divorce. But, Scotland and other countries whose law follows the European Union rules are not such jurisdictions. (Historically, Mexico had more liberal divorce rules and weaker residency requirements and was on such jurisdiction although I do not know if that remains the case today.)\n\nAlso, while it is often possible for parties by control to choose a governing law and venue for disputes between them, generally speaking, the parties must have some meaningful connection to the venue for that principle to apply. The only way I can see that some court, somewhere might find a connection to jurisdiction when neither party has ever lived there would be if the wedding took place in there, but Scotland does not recognize this exception.\n\n**The Impact Of Children On The Question**\n\nFurthermore, if there were children involved in a divorce, there are international treaties that govern jurisdiction over child custody matters which generally require proceedings to be brought in the jurisdiction that is the child's \"habitual residence\" and a place where a child has never lived would almost certainly not qualify. The [most notable of these treaties](http://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/oct99cro.html) is the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, a treaty with approximately 45 member countries.\n\n> The Hague Convention encompasses nearly all European countries,\n>  including some of the former Soviet and Yugoslav republics, and other\n>  westernized countries around the world. Members also include a very\n>  few countries in Africa, South America, and the pro\\-western margins of\n>  the Middle East.\n\nIn general, rights and responsibilities related to children, who cannot be parties to any binding agreement, may not be set forth in a marital agreement.\n\nSo, even if a Scottish court was willing to entertain the termination of marriage, property division, name change, and maintenance part of the divorce, and other jurisdictions chose to recognize the Scottish court's ruling, this would not give the Scottish court authority to issue orders related to children.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A British couple, John (English) and Sarah (Welsh), got married in London and signed a prenuptial agreement stating that any potential divorce proceedings would take place in Scotland.

The prenuptial agreement specifying Scotland as the venue for divorce does not override these jurisdictional requirements. The couple's lack of connection to Scotland (never having lived there) means they cannot simply choose it as a divorce venue without meeting the residency criteria.

Taking them in order:\n\nBecause of how HTTP/HTML works, there are essentially two ways for a server operator to know what software you are running.\n\n1. Your browser announces that it's running something. This usually takes the form of a modified [User\\-Agent header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent#User_agent_identification). I'm not aware of any privacy laws that consider \"Person A told me something\" to be an invasion of Person A's privacy.\n2. They guess it based on the actions your browser takes. For example, if the website gets a request for a page, and the site's ad network does not get a matching request for an ad, the server deduces that the user is running an ad blocker.

(If at least one party consents, it is allowed, though [some states require all parties to consent](http://www.rcfp.org/reporters-recording-guide).) There are a number of special cases, starting in subsection (2\\), where party consent is not required. Court orders would be one of those conditions. Another is if the Attorney General certifies in writing that the tap is legal and necessary to catch a spy. (2\\)(e) says, in particular:\n\n> it shall not be unlawful for an officer, employee, or agent of the\n>  United States in the normal course of his official duty to conduct\n>  electronic surveillance, as defined in [section 101 of the Foreign\n>  Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801), as authorized by that Act.\n\nwhere electronic surveillance is defined (partially) as \n\n> the acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance\n>  device of the contents of any wire or radio communication sent by or\n>  intended to be received by a particular, known United States person\n>  who is in the United States, if the contents are acquired by\n>  intentionally targeting that United States person, under circumstances\n>  in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a\n>  warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes\n\nThis seems to satisfy the circumstances described in the question \u2013 the act would be \"electronic surveillance\" as defined in that section of the law. But the wiretap law also says \"as authorized by that Act\", so now we have to turn to authorization (without court order). [50 USC 1802](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1802) says\n\n> Notwithstanding any other law, the President, through the Attorney\n>  General, may authorize electronic surveillance without a court order\n>  under this subchapter to acquire foreign intelligence information for\n>  periods of up to one year if the Attorney General certifies in writing\n>  under oath that...\n\nThere are three conditions that have to be met.

This is an [equitable remedy](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85675/what-are-equity-and-equitable-remedies). Whether a personal right of action or a derivative action is appropriate generally depends on the nature of the loss. See e.g. *Anthony v. NPV Management Ltd.*, 2003 NLCA 41 at para. 14, quoting McGinness, *The Law and Practice of Canadian Business Corporations*:\n\n> Derivative actions must be distinguished from personal rights of action belonging to a shareholder. In deciding whether a particular cause of action is derivative or personal, the question to resolve is whether the essence of the action is the violation of some right of the corporation or some personal right to which the shareholder is entitled. Either one can produce a loss to the shareholder. **The difference is whether the loss is suffered by the shareholder directly or by the reduction in the value of his or her shares.**\n\nI am not sure that this reflects the exact boundaries of the availability of this action in other jurisdictions and I would expect there to be jurisdiction\\-specific thresholds/tests/procedures to establish a valid derivative action.\n\n### Dissipation of assets\n\nCommonly, a derivative action will claim that a defendant has dissipated assets of the corporation. E.g. in *Anthony v. NPV Management Ltd.*, the claim was (among other things) that\n\n* \"the Defendants dissipated or permitted the dissipation of the assets and transferred business of Conpak Seafoods Inc. to Daley Brothers Limited\" and that\n* one defendant \"acted in such a manner to serve his personal objectives to the detriment of Conpak Seafoods Inc. and its Shareholders.\"\n\nIn this [overview article](https://www.mondaq.com/pdf/clients/87654.pdf), Aronson et al. describe a derivative action as follows:\n\n> \u2018the action is derivative, i.e., in the\n> corporate right, if the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the\n> corporation, or to the whole body of its stock or property without\n> any severance or distribution among individual holders, or if it seeks\n> to recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of\n> its assets.\n\n[This answer by ohwilleke](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56345/46948) presents another good description.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a closely-held corporation where the majority shareholder (70% ownership) is using company profits to fund a competing business, what legal action might the minority shareholder (30% ownership) consider to address this issue?\n\nA) A personal lawsuit against the majority shareholder for breach of contract\nB) A derivative action on behalf of the corporation against the majority shareholder\nC) A direct action against the corporation for unfair business practices\nD) An arbitration claim based on the shareholder agreement\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B, a derivative action. This type of legal action is appropriate when the essence of the complaint is injury to the corporation or dissipation of corporate assets, which aligns with the scenario described. The majority shareholder using company profits for a competing business could be seen as dissipating assets to the detriment of the corporation and its shareholders.\n\nA is incorrect because a personal lawsuit would typically be for a direct injury to the shareholder, not for harm to the corporation. C is incorrect because a direct action against the corporation itself wouldn't address the majority shareholder's actions. D might be plausible if there was a specific arbitration clause in a shareholder agreement, but based on the information given, a derivative action is the most appropriate remedy for addressing the misuse of corporate assets by a controlling shareholder."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48434/text-about-a-deposit-held-by-the-landlord", "docs_id": 48434, "title": "text about a deposit held by the landlord", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the hope of salvaging some of the deposit held by the landlord, my husband exchanged texts with the landlord.

Will that hold in a small claims court where I am suing her for the full deposit?\n\nThat seems unlikely. Lease contracts typically establish that tenants are jointly and severally liable. If your lease does not establish that, you would need to prove the landlord's agreement that your husband's acts with respect to the contract are not binding to you.\n\nEven if you prove the aforementioned issue, the security deposit to be reimbursed would be prorated if the court decides that your husband essentially desisted from his portion of the deposit by saying to the landlord \"*you can keep your money*\".\n\n> Do we have a chance of winning the case?\n\nYes. It is unclear from your post whether the landlord's pretexts are tantamount to complying with her statutory obligation of timely notification of an itemized list of damages. Landlord\\-tenant statutes give a deadline (such as 30 days) for sending that notification. Non\\-compliance forfeits whatever entitlement the landlord would otherwise have as to the security deposit.\n\nIn case of landlord's compliance regarding that itemized list, you as tenants may dispute the legitimacy of the damages alleged therein.\n\nHere the intricacy stems from your husband's statement \"*you can keep your money*\", which a reasonable person might construe as your husband's waiver \\-\\-notwithstanding the contentious context\\-\\- of reimbursement. A waiver may be cognizable even if made reluctantly or under apparent reluctance. In fact, it is common for people to reluctantly waive their rights because they deem the matter not worth the hassle that court or quasi\\-judicial proceedings as well as extra\\-judicial disputes entail.\n\nIf necessary, you as tenants might want to posit that \"*your money*\" in that expression literally refers to the amount \\-\\-if any\\-\\- that legitimately belongs to the landlord, and that the expression ought not to be confused with \"*you can keep the\\|that\\|my money*\". Your husband's expression literally reflects that he was not overreaching into landlord's funds, but that your husband's purpose simply was to recover \\[nothing more than] the security deposit.\n\nUnless impracticable, I encourage you to litigate this matter *in pro per* because in doing so you would gain some exposure to legal proceedings. The amount involved is not too high, whence the matter would be litigated in Small Claims court (hence without being represented by a lawyer) anyway. With that exposure you will not be easily intimidated by lawyers/charlatans if your rights are violated in the future. But one lesson here is that that type of expressions can backfire because such expressions don't truly reflect the person's ultimate purpose and thus may be construed to that person's detriment.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A married couple is suing their landlord in small claims court for the return of their security deposit.

Which of the following is most likely to be true regarding their case?\n\nA) The wife can successfully sue for her full share of the deposit since she didn't agree to the husband's statement.\nB) The husband's statement is legally binding and the couple has forfeited their right to the entire deposit.\nC) The couple may still have a case, but the husband's statement could complicate their claim and potentially reduce the amount they can recover.\nD) The husband's statement has no legal bearing on the case since it was made in frustration and not in a formal agreement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most likely scenario based on the information provided. While the couple still has a chance of winning their case, especially if the landlord failed to provide a timely, itemized list of damages, the husband's statement \"you can keep your money\" could be interpreted as a waiver of his rights to the deposit. This complicates the case and may lead to a reduced recovery amount.\n\nOption A is incorrect because lease contracts typically establish joint liability, making it unlikely that the wife can successfully sue for only her share. Option B is too extreme, as the statement alone doesn't necessarily forfeit all rights to the deposit, especially considering the context of frustration. Option D underestimates the potential legal impact of the husband's statement, even if made in frustration, as courts may consider it a form of waiver."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26426/what-can-i-do-about-an-employer-witholding-my-final-paycheck-for-damages", "docs_id": 26426, "title": "What can I do about an employer witholding my final paycheck for &quot;damages&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So I accepted a 2nd job about 8 months ago as an elderly care taker for my landlord's parents.

Even if they had 100% evidence that you caused damage and were responsible for that damage, they still can't withhold your pay. They have to pay you, and *then* they can try to take you to court. The reason for this law is exactly cases like yours, where people try to avoid payment. \n\nIf the \"powerful attorney\" tells you that you are not getting paid, then that \"powerful attorney\" is making a big mistake, because any lawyer would *love* to take your case to court and see the judge cutting the \"powerful attorney\" down to size. \n\nIf you don't want a lawyer now, then you can write a letter by registered mail telling them that you worked for them, how much the payment due is, that they are legally required to make that payment, and that you will take them to court if they are not paying.

The employer's actions of withholding the final paycheck are illegal, regardless of any alleged damages. Labor laws strictly prohibit employers from withholding earned wages, even if they believe the employee owes them money. The employee should either seek legal assistance or formally demand payment in writing, possibly through registered mail. The fact that the employer is a \"powerful attorney\" does not change the law, which is on the employee's side in this situation. Options A and D are incorrect because they misstate the legal rights of the employee. Option B is inadvisable as it suggests the employee should accept responsibility for something they may not be liable for, potentially harming their own interests."}}
