Not having a phone line does not make a dwelling uninhabitable (unless your locale specifically says so). In [California](http://housing.ucsc.edu/cro/pdf/telephone.pdf), it is required that the landlord maintain at least one jack and working lines (this is a direct requirement, not expressed in terms of habitability). Not in [Chicago](http://www.tenants-rights.org/residential-landlord-tenant-ordinance/) (warning: obnoxious talk occurs on that page). Lease terms generally indicate that the owner is responsible for maintaining the \"infrastructure\" such as wiring.\n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nGiven the added information about locale, we can turn to relevant [Colorado law](http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/colorado-landlord-and-tenant-duties.aspx). \u00a738\\-12\\-505 does not suggest that broken phone lines render a residence uninhabitable. \u00a738\\-12\\-212\\.3 states that\n\n> (1\\) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a landlord shall\n>  be responsible for and pay the cost of the maintenance and repair of:\n> \n> \n> (I) Any sewer lines, **utility service lines**, or related connections\n>  owned and provided by the landlord to the utility pedestal or pad\n>  space for a mobile home sited in the park\n\nbut it's not clear on the face of it if that helps. There are two reasons why it doesn't. First, the typical understanding of \"utility line\" pertains to wires or pipes outside the building, which does not help you. The other problem is that this section is under the Mobile Home Park Act, meaning that the clause is intended to apply only to mobile home parks.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Denver, Colorado, a tenant discovers that the phone lines in their rented apartment are not functioning. The landlord refuses to repair them. Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenant's legal rights and the landlord's responsibilities?\n\nA) The tenant has a strong legal case to compel the landlord to repair the phone lines, as they are considered essential for emergency services.\n\nB) Colorado law explicitly requires landlords to maintain working phone lines in all rental properties as part of habitability standards.\n\nC) The tenant likely has limited legal recourse to force the landlord to repair the phone lines, as they are generally not considered essential for habitability under Colorado law.\n\nD) The Mobile Home Park Act in Colorado requires the landlord to repair utility service lines, which would include internal phone lines in apartments.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, Colorado law (\u00a738-12-505) does not suggest that broken phone lines render a residence uninhabitable. While the presence of phone jacks might imply functionality, there's no explicit mention in the lease or state law requiring landlords to maintain working phone lines. The Mobile Home Park Act (\u00a738-12-212.3) does mention landlord responsibility for utility service lines, but this applies specifically to mobile home parks and typically refers to external connections, not internal wiring. Additionally, the lack of a working landline is not generally considered to make a dwelling uninhabitable, especially given the prevalence of mobile phones for emergency services. Therefore, the tenant likely has limited legal recourse to force the landlord to repair the internal phone lines."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/89940/is-it-legal-for-one-email-service-provider-to-send-emails-using-the-exact-identi", "docs_id": 89940, "title": "Is it legal for one email-service-provider to send emails using the exact identical email-address of another email-service-provider?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Question \\-  \n\nIs it legal for one email\\-service\\-provider to send emails using the exact identical email\\-address of another email\\-service\\-provider ?\n\n* This happened to me in the last 3 days, **the two companies are not connected**.\n* I have an email\\-account with company\\-A, and used it to make an account with company\\-B, and when I tried the email\\-service of company\\-B it uses the completely identical email\\-address as my account with company\\-A.\n* I have replicated the problem ( with company\\-B ) by using a 2nd account from company\\-A.\n\n**More Detail** \\-\nOutlook.com apparently can send emails using gmail addresses, if you go through the steps.

One can write anything into the \"From\" or \"Reply\\-To\" field. But that's for sending. To receive mail, the technical address has to be resolved.\n\nAn email address can consist of [two parts](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.4), the *optional* display name and the *actual* address. Say Alice registers *\"Alice and Bob\" \\<alice@example.test\\>* and Bob registers *\"Alice and Bob\" \\<bob@other.sample\\>*. Those are different emails. One gets resolved at *example* in the *test* top level domain, the other gets resolved at *other* in the *sample* top level domain.\n\nIf two different companies can operate mailboxes with the same actual address, someone has \"broken the internet\" in a rather serious way, either locally on your network or globally.

Most commonly it refers to someone who owns something losing it because of their actions. In particular, a would\\-be buyer who puts down a deposit but breaches the conditions of the contract may forfeit the deposit, with it becoming the property of the would\\-be seller. This is perhaps the most common usage.\n\nA person who does not own something, but expects to, may forfeit that expectation. When a would\\-be buyer puts down a deposit as before, but the seller breaches the contract, the seller may forfeit the deposit, that is may lose the right to retain the deposit, with it going back to the would\\-be buyer instead.\n\nOne may also forfeit a right or privilege. Under the older US copyright law, for example, when a copyright holder failed to renew a copyright, the holder was said to forfeit the copyright. When a criminal defendant fails to assert a privilege, such as the privilege of medical confidentiality, the defendant is said to forfeit that privilege.\n\nA thing lost because of incorrect or improper conduct can be called a forfeit, in this case the word is a noun.\n\nIf a person does not pay property tax, the property may be forfeit to the state for lack of proper tax payments.\n\nAnd \"forfeit\" may be used as a verb to describe the legal process of causing someone to undergo a forfeiture. In this case it is a bit like \"foreclose\". In the first example above where a buyer puts down a deposit but breaches the contract, the seller may \"forfeit the deposit\" that is take legal action to secure legal ownership of the deposit, because of the buyer's failure to comply with the contract.\n\nIn all these cases something of value is lost because of some failure or improper act on the part of the person who loses it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In a real estate transaction, Seller S agrees to sell a property to Buyer B for $500,000.

Whatever \"revenue\" means, it almost certainly doesn't mean \"profits\".\n\nRevenue makes more sense than profits in any case in this circumstance.

Why are they so closely associated with each other as to have just one tag on the site, but Northern Ireland and Scotland each seem to be their own worlds?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What Do England And Wales Share Legally?\n========================================\n\n> Why are they so closely associated with each other as to have just one\n> tag on the site, but Northern Ireland and Scotland each seem to be\n> their own worlds?\n\nMost laws of general applicability, such as criminal law, and private law (i.e. the law governing the interactions of private parties like property law, contract law, landlord\\-tenant law, employment law, etc.) are enacted by the National Parliament at Westminster (or effective as part of a shared English common law of case precedents) and shared by England and Wales which have a uniform integrated court system.\n\nIn contrast, Scotland and Northern Ireland have greater autonomy to enact laws of general application because more authority has been devolved to those regional governments than to the National Assembly of Wales. They also have their own court systems.\n\nHistoric Causes\n===============\n\nWales was basically fully integrated into England starting in the 1200s and subsequently restored some autonomy.\n\nScotland never lost its high level of autonomy and was initially joined to England only by virtue of having the same monarch, rather than being the same country. The United Kingdom was formed first by the personal union of monarchs from 1603 (under King James VI of Scotland a.k.a. King James I of England) followed by a federal style merger of governments approved by the Scottish and English parliaments in 1706\\-1707, rather than by conquest and it has much more government autonomy in generally applicable legislation and its judicial system than Wales does, and more than Ireland had when it was ruled by England. On the other hand, Scottish sentiment towards independence was not exactly unanimous in support of staying with the U.K. in the last referendum in 2014 when 44\\.7% of votes cast were for independence with 84\\.6% voter turnout (including voters as young as age 16\\).\n\nNorthern Ireland's story is a bit more complicated as Ireland had a legal status similar to Wales from a similar medieval era, but this was complicated by the Irish independence struggle ultimately leading to the creation of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The fine line and complexity of the situation in Northern Ireland is illustrated by this map, and strong autonomy was necessary to allow it to maintain the fragile Protestant\\-Roman Catholic balance in a divided society there:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdKM6.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdKM6.png)\n\nEach of the components of the United Kingdom has a separate and historically determined status that is not exactly parallel to any of the others. England has no national assembly of its own, sufficing to use the national parliament for its laws despite the fact that some seats in that parliament that govern it are selected in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Likewise, before the U.S. gained independence, different parts of the U.S. had distinct relationships to the U.K., as did the various colonial possessions of the U.K. (e.g. India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Kenya, Tanzania, Hong Kong).\n\nThe U.K. is an exemplary example of the philosophy that consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. To pluck out just one more random example of the English tendency, \"Scotland Yard\", the national police force headquarters in the City of Westminster within the City of Greater London in England, has jurisdiction over England and Wales, but not over Scotland.\n\nLegal Distinctions Between England And Wales\n============================================\n\nTo provide a few other examples in addition to the example of language related laws noted by @WeatherVane (noted on my recent visit to England and Wales) and to embellish on that point a little further, the Welsh language is resurgent in Wales where it is a mandatory subject in public schools (often in the North with Welsh as the primary language of instruction) with about 30% of the population (more than 800,000 people) who either speak it as a first language (which is common among the very old and among young people in Northern Wales) by people who are mostly bilingual with English (but may reach for an English word or two now and then) or as a fluent second language.\n\n* The Anglican Church is the established church in England, but not in Wales where it was disestablished in 1916\\. The legal implications of this are subtle, but not non\\-existent.\n* Government agencies are not required to hoist the British flag with primacy over the Welsh flag, and indeed, the British flag is rarely seen there.\n* Primary and secondary education are administered separately in England and Wales with attendant laws on issues like truancy, dress codes, financial arrangements, testing, and certain holidays. This distinction primarily exists to facilitate Welsh language instruction, which is the primary language of instruction in some schools, and a secondary language in others.\n* More generally, the manner in which many government services (e.g. public housing) is administered, and in which tax dollars are expended is not precisely the same between England and Wales.\n* Certain laws regulating immigrants (related to immigrant financial security and leases to immigrants, more or less) differ between England and Wales, although this is a temporary matter and the long term plan is for these laws to be integrated across the United Kingdom.\n* The Welsh Senedd (a.k.a. National Assembly for Wales, i.e. the regional parliament) has some independent legislative power, although honestly, the scope of its legislation is typically closer to what you might see in a U.S. home rule city or a school board, than in a U.S. state government. In [particular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government):\n\n> The 20 areas of responsibility devolved to the National Assembly for\n> Wales (and within which Welsh ministers exercise executive functions)\n> are:\n> \n> \n> * Agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development\n> * Ancient monuments and historical buildings\n> * Culture\n> * Economic development\n> * Education and training\n> * Environment\n> * Fire and rescue services and promotion of fire safety\n> * Food\n> * Health and social services\n> * Highways and transport\n> * Housing\n> * Local government\n> * National Assembly for Wales\n> * Public administration\n> * Social welfare\n> * Sport and recreation\n> * Tourism\n> * Town and country planning\n> * Water and flood defences\n> * Welsh language\n\n* I suspect, but do not know, that land use regulation and occupational and business licensing in Wales is less favorable to big businesses and franchises, based upon the fact that such businesses are far more common in England than in Wales, even controlling for places that are similar in population density.

Amazon chooses to do so under contract and subject to the conditions of that contract.\n\nThe gadget was faulty and you are entitled to (and are getting) a full refund. The charger is not faulty and so you must comply with the contract which requires you to pay shipping for the return (or keep it).\n\nIf the products were sold by Amazon as a complete unit or you had made known to Amazon that the charger was \"for\" the gadget, then you would be entitled to a refund for both.

It includes (emphasis mine):\n\n> 3. \"Firearm\" means (a) any pistol or revolver; or (b) a shotgun having\n> one or more barrels less than eighteen inches in length; or (c) a rifle\n> having one or more barrels less than sixteen inches in length; or (d)\n> any weapon made from a shotgun or rifle whether by alteration,\n> modification, or otherwise if such weapon as altered, modified, or\n> otherwise has an overall length of less than twenty\\-six inches; or (e)\n> an assault weapon.

The key point is that it must be unloaded to be considered an antique. Once loaded, it would be treated as a regular firearm subject to normal firearms regulations, including registration and licensing requirements. This made antique firearms potentially attractive for criminal use, as they could be owned without registration when unloaded, but could become functional weapons when loaded.

Thus, you could pursue the recovery of unpaid wages under two legal theories. One of them is the aforementioned statute, since your *implied* contract \\-\\-pertaining to the excess of 20 weekly hours\\-\\- constitutes an *agreement to work for a lesser wage than the legal minimum wage*.\n\nThe other theory or claim under which you may proceed is *breach of contract*. Again, this refers to the *implied* agreements regarding any unpaid wages in excess of 20 weekly hours. Under this theory you would recover just the full wages (rather than only the minimum wage), whereas the statutory provision entitles you to *reasonable attorney's fees*.\n\nYou might want to get some acquaintance with the [California Labor Code](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?tocCode=LAB&division=2.&title=&part=&chapter=&article=), since it describes how to proceed and might also touch on other issues which might be applicable to your situation (and not mentioned in your post).\n\nIf your matter is filed in court, there is always a chance that your case might be presided by some [sick judge](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/2018/11/judge-carol-kuhnkes-imbecile.html) telling you [in court](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ck7HHqFkIaE/Wsoe0CGdR0I/AAAAAAAAARg/e0PQf_Llz44zb7yky476nU9rV7IVHYO9QCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/employers.jpg) that \"*The state loves insurance companies and it employers \\[...] and you have to \\[...] stay out of the way*\".

Suppose you are good at sleight of hand, i.e. dextrous illusion\\-making like a magician. Using a product or good you actually own that looks to an outsider's eyes just like one in the store, but which you've marked in a discreet place so you are assured you don't accidentally actually take the one that isn't yours, and using your magician skills, you make it look like you were pocketing the wares when you actually didn't.

It seems to be not unlike the GDPR or CCPA, althoguh different in detail. It requires consent for the collection and retention of personal information, requires that collection not be excessive, and requires that individuals be able to see what information a company holds about that person, and in many cases have it deleted.\n\nSpecifically, Rule 5 (1\\) provides that:\n\n> Body corporate or any person on its behalf shall obtain consent in writing through letter or Fax or email from the provider of the sensitive personal data or information regarding purpose of usage before collection of such information.\n\n(A \"body corporate\" appears to be simply a company or business firm.)\n\n\"sensitive personal data\" is defined in rule 3 to be any of a list of nine kinds of information, of which the first is a password.\n\nRule 5 (7\\) provides that:\n\n> Body corporate or any person on its behalf shall, prior to the collection of information including sensitive personal data or information, provide an option to the provider of the information to not to provide the data or information sought to be collected.

Such withdrawal of the consent shall be sent in writing to the body corporate.\n\nIt is not clear to me whether \"letter or Fax or email from the provider\" \\[from the information provider (aka the Data Subject)] could include a message automatically sent when a person using a web site clicks a button clearly indicating consent to collection of such information. It certainly does not require a letter mailed in the post. The provisions of sub\\-rule (7\\) clearly contemplate collection of information online as long as there is active consent and an option to withdraw consent.\n\nI find it hard to imagine that a separate, manual, communication mu8st be sent in advance under rule 5 (1\\), and that does not seem to be how this rule has been enforced over the past 10 years.

While copyright is reserved by default, copyright law contains many exceptions, and a disclaimer in a book's imprint cannot override them. What exceptions are available depends on national laws. The *fair use* exception is famous, but specific to U.S. law. German law instead provides a number of exceptions for specific situations. For example:\n\n* \u00a7 51 UrhG: publication of citations is legal, if the amount of cited material is justified by the specific context. In particular, including citations is justified in academic works that discuss the cited work.\n* \u00a7 53 Abs 1 UrhG: private copies are allowed, as long as the original was acquired in a manner that was not obviously illegal, and as long as the copy is not used directly or indirectly for commercial purposes. See the German Wikipedia Article [*Privatkopie*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie) for context. Limitation: entire books may only be duplicated by manual transcription.\n* \u00a7 53 Abs 2 UrhG: analogue (non\\-digital) copies for personal purposes are allowed in some additional circumstances.\n* And some specific exceptions for schools, teaching, research, and data mining.\n\nWhat does this mean for taking notes?\n\n* Notes that capture your own thoughts, or a summary of the copyrighted material in your own words, are not derivatives in the sense of copyright. (However, German copyright law doesn't have a 1:1 equivalent to the term \u201cderivative\u201d. Instead, \u201cadaptation\u201d might be a better fit for the German *Bearbeitung*.)\n* If these notes are purely personal, you can likely copy parts of the book into your notes. For example, this might cover a diary in which you write down poems that you like.\n* Quotes/citations can be allowed when necessary to discuss the book in your notes.

For academic purposes, including citations is justified when discussing the cited work. Additionally, while \u00a7 53 Abs 1 UrhG allows for private copies, entire books may only be duplicated by manual transcription, ruling out option A. The \"no part of this work may be copied\" disclaimer cannot override legal exceptions, making option B incorrect. Lastly, digital note-taking is not prohibited, so option D is too restrictive.

There is no constitutional or statutory definition of \"Officer of the United States\", so we have to figure it out from case law. As noted in [Morrison v. Olson](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/487/654/case.html) 487 U.S. 654\n\n> The line between \"inferior\" and \"principal\" officers is one that is\n>  far from clear, and the Framers provided little guidance into where it\n>  should be drawn.\n\nOfficers of the US cannot be appointed by Congress ([Buckley v.

That court also said that\n\n> We think that the term \"Officers of the United States,\" as used in\n>  Art. II, defined to include \"all persons who can be said to hold an\n>  office under the government\" in United States v. Germaine, supra, is a\n>  term intended to have substantive meaning.

We know they are officers, because [Freytag v. Commissioner](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/868/case.html) 501 U.S. 868 says so (since they read Buckley):\n\n> A special trial judge is an \"inferior Office\\[r]\" whose appointment\n>  must conform to the Appointments Clause.

The fact that in subsection\n>  (b)(4\\) cases he performs duties that may be performed by an employee\n>  not subject to the Appointments Clause does not transform his status.\n\nThe Dept. of Justice offers [an analysis](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2015/05/29/op-olc-v031-p0083.pdf) of \"Officer of the United States\". The main elements in their opinion are that the position must possess delegated sovereign authority of the Federal government, and the position must be continuing. There are other criteria possibly applicable (things that were invokes at some time) including method of appointment, having been established by law, taking an oath of office, an emolument (not a volunteer), and receiving a commission. Still, Congress authorizes (by law) the hiring of federal employees, and not all employees are \"officers\".\n\nAn earlier memorandum on the topic is [here](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/1996/05/31/op-olc-v020-p0124_0.pdf). Footnote 54 notes that \n\n> It is at least arguable, however, that the authority \n>  exercised by second lieutenants and ensigns is so limited and\n>  subordinate that their analogues in the civil sphere clearly \n>  would be employees.\n\nWarrant officers and non\\-commisioned officers would likewise have quite limited authority.\n\nSince the definition of \"Officer of the United States\" is up for grabs, there can't be a complete list of inferior officers, especially if all military officers are included. There is a long list of civilian officers under the executive branch published in [United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Government_Policy_and_Supporting_Positions), after each presidential election.

Driving  on  roadways  laned for traffic. Whenever any roadway\nhas been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for  traffic  the\nfollowing  rules  in  addition  to  all others consistent herewith shall\napply:\n  (a) A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within\na single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has\nfirst ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\n\n```\n\n(b and c are not relevant)\n\n```\n   (d)  When  official markings are in place indicating those portions of\nany roadway where crossing such markings would be especially  hazardous,\nno  driver  of a vehicle proceeding along such highway shall at any time\ndrive across such markings.\n\n```\n\nThe last bit, (d), is of interest. Basically, you are allowed to change into the correct lane as long as the pavement markings permit it. The pavement markings at an intersection with a sign like the one you posted are generally solid white lines. These details are governed by the [Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ser-pubs.htm), published by the Federal Highway Administration. Their information on pavement markings is available both in PDF and [HTML format](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/services/publications/fhwaop02090/index.htm). Pertinently, it says:\n\n> A double white line indicates that lane changes are prohibited. A single white line indicates that lane changes are discouraged. A dashed white line indicates that lane changes are allowed.\n\nTherefore, if the lines separating the lanes are, as usual, solid white lines, you are encouraged to get into the correct lane before the beginning of the solid white line, but you are permitted to change lanes across the solid lines. An example of such marking is in the right\\-hand example in the given image:\n\n[![Intersection marking examples from the US Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KZRT.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KZRT.gif)\n\nOne point of possible contention is that the [New York State Driver's Manual](http://dmv.ny.gov/about-dmv/chapter-4-traffic-control-2#pav-mar) describes the meaning of the solid white line somewhat differently:\n\n> **One solid line:** You can pass other vehicles or change lanes, but you can only do so when obstructions in the road or traffic conditions make it necessary.\n\nI don't see any statutory basis for that description, but I may well have overlooked something.\n\nI suppose you know where the signs are specified, since you probably got the image from there, but for anyone reading this who does not know, they are specified in the publication [Standard Highway Signs](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ser-shs_millennium_eng.htm). This is available as a set of PDF files; the relevant file is the one containing [regulatory signs](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/SHSe/Regulatory.pdf); the sign in the question is 1\\-33, and it is in the midst of several similar signs.\n\nIf a police officer ticketed you for getting into the lane too late, I suppose you should find a lawyer who specializes in fighting traffic tickets, and ask whether there really is such a thing as \"too late.\" By my reading of the law, there isn't. (Of course, if it's dangerous to change lanes because of other vehicles, you shouldn't change lanes, but if you had, I would suppose the officer should have written a ticket for some other violation, like reckless driving.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In New York City, when approaching an intersection with lanes marked for specific directions (e.g., \"straight only\" and \"right turn only\"), what is the legal stance on changing lanes across a solid white line?\n\nA) It is strictly prohibited and will always result in a ticket.\nB) It is discouraged but legally permissible if done safely.\nC) It is only allowed if there are obstructions or traffic conditions that make it necessary.\nD) It is freely permitted at any time before reaching the intersection.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, a single solid white line indicates that lane changes are discouraged, but not prohibited. The New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law does not explicitly forbid crossing a solid white line. While the New York State Driver's Manual suggests a more restrictive interpretation, saying changes are only allowed when necessary due to obstructions or traffic conditions, this doesn't appear to have a clear statutory basis. Therefore, while changing lanes across a solid white line is discouraged, it is legally permissible if done safely. Drivers should exercise caution and good judgment when making such lane changes, especially near intersections."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79803/is-blocking-users-to-take-phone-backups-on-external-harddrive-by-apple-not-unlaw", "docs_id": 79803, "title": "Is blocking users to take phone backups on external harddrive by Apple not unlawful?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Over the past few weeks I am having some hard time restoring my backups from external harddrive after my iphone got bricked.\n\nI am using a new iPhone 12 Pro with 512gb space and I keep backing up my phone on external harddrive (since these phone comes with huge space \\- I have not enough space on my MacBook Pro to hold that much data).

What is the nature of obligation at international law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Austin's view: the command theory of law\u2014rules of a superior sovereign backed by force\n\nThe idea that law exists only if the rules are those of a superior sovereign and backed by force is an outdated conception whose most prominant proponent was [John Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Austin_(legal_philosopher)). This is known as the \"command\" theory of law. This clearly cannot explain obligation at international law. But nor can it explain many of the rules in domestic legal systems that we have no problem conceiving of as law (e.g. the law\\-making process itself, the system of adjudication, rules that confer power, etc.).\n\n### Modern views: internal sense of obligation\n\nThe command theory of law has largely been supplanted by other theories of obligation such as that of [H.L.A. Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._A._Hart). In this view, law does not require rules to be backed by threats of force, or to be imposed by a superior sovereign. Law can exist and sustain itself purely through a group's internal point of view: do the participants (states, in the case of international law) \"*use* the rules as standards for the appraisal of their own and others' behaviour\" and do they see them as imposing obligations?\n\nThis focus on the internal viewpoint is actually part of the test for recognizing a norm as customary international law. For something to be customary international law, it must be accomanied by *opinio juris*. This is a \"'psychological' element'\" (John H. Currie, *Public International Law*, p. 195\\). States need to behave as if a rule has legal obligation. International judicial bodies will look to evidence about how states explain their motives, including how they explain deviations from the rule.\n\nH.L.A. Hart explicitly noted the common question, \"How can international law be binding?\" (*The Concept of Law*, \"Chapter X: International Law\"). His answer:\n\n> there is something very confusing in this favourite form of question; and before we can deal with it we must face a prior question to which the answer is by no means clear. This prior question is: what is meant by saying of a whole system of law that it is 'binding'? The statement that a particular rule of a system is binding on a particular person is one familiar to lawyers and tolerably clear in meaning. We may paraphrase it by the assertion that the rule in question is a valid rule, and under it the person in question *has some obligation or duty*.\n\nHe recognizes that \"one source of doubt on this point is simply the absense from the system of centrally organized sanctions.\" But for all the reasons that this is not the criteria of what makes law law or creates the internal view of obligation, even in domestic systems, this fact does not undercut international law's status as law.\n\nHe describes nation states' expressed attitude towards the rules of international law:\n\n> Yet what these rules require is thought and spoken of as obligatory; there is general pressure for conformity to the rules; claims and admissions are based on them and their breach is held to justify not only insistent demands for compensation, but reprisals and counter\\-measures. When the rules are disregarded, *it is not on the footing that they are not binding; instead efforts are made to conceal the facts*.\n\n### In what sense is international law binding?\n\nWhen one makes the assertion that a rule is *binding* at international law, they are simply describing or predicting that the participants view the rule as generating obligation and duty, likely due to the rule's basis in treaty or customary international law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the modern view of what makes international law binding, according to H.L.A.

Hart's theory, which focuses on the internal viewpoint of participants (states) in international law. According to this view, law exists and sustains itself through the group's internal point of view, where participants use the rules as standards for appraising their own and others' behavior, and see them as imposing obligations.\n\nA is incorrect as it reflects the outdated \"command theory\" of law associated with John Austin, which Hart's theory supersedes.\n\nC is incorrect because Hart explicitly notes that the absence of centrally organized sanctions does not undermine international law's status as law.\n\nD is incorrect as it overstates the role of international courts.

While this is still somehow acceptable (you also would want the ones who are best for the task, not just everyone) the tax for those who are not allowed (!) to do the service in my eyes is not.\n\nLike in my situation, it was that I went to military, but during service I got rejected because of my health. I am not even allowed to do civil service.\n\nLaw now requires me to pay 3% of my income, but at least 400USD every year \u2013 no matter if I live in this country or not. If I were not earning enough, I still would have to pay at least 400USD to my country every year. You could say that it is illegal for me to be poor.\n\n**1\\. Do this laws contradict human rights?**\n(Note: Many people went to the human rights court because of this, sometimes they agreed that it does, sometimes it does not. In the end it doesn't matters as my country doesn't care about decisions of the human rights court.)\n\n---\n\nYou have different possibilities to be expelled from that tax.\nThe most famous one is being a woman.\nThe second one is being disabled by at least 40%.\n\nSince males and females have the same rights and duties, I come up with this equation in this particular situation:\n\n> male \\+ 40% disabled \\= female\n\nAs mentioned both genders have the same law applied to the according to human rights and constitution. Does this empathize that ALL woman are at least disabled by 40%?\n\n> male \\+ 40% disabled \\= female (who are all disabled).\n\nI know this sounds salty but somehow I cannot get rid of this equation.\n\nAnyway, we have a law for transsexuals that states that you don\u2019t need to pay anymore if you switched gender and:\n\n> A psychiatrist and a\n> endocrinologist\n> confirmed that you're not a male anymore and don't have a male body.\n\nIf you need to switch gender it is considered an illness (living the wrong body) and healthcare pays for your therapy and operations.\n\nThis makes becoming female free, staying male costs.

Also, as noted in a comment, your school may have obtained express permission to cover the work:\n\n> Your music school may have a license with a [PRO (performing rights\n> organization](https://blog.songtrust.com/guide-to-usa-pros)) that covers your song.

They may, however, have an institutional obligation to act in a particular way, which might include always email questions, or never emailing questions (the latter is most likely). Assuming someone filed an institutional grievance against you, you have some right to answer these charges \u2013 it will be spelled out in the institution's rules. The federal regulations are between the institution and the government, and the institution then creates rules to keep themselves in compliance.\n\nThe usual worst\\-case scenario is that someone files a grievance, which is reviewed by the institution. As the accused, you will be informed of the charges against you, and will have the opportunity to defend yourself at least by the \"committee decision\" phase. Prior to that point, the institution can gather any data deemed relevant, and may well require that all questioning be conducted in a face\\-to\\-face meeting. Universities generally have minimal specification of procedural requirements, until they run into a problem and impose rules. To determine a person's authority to require something of you, you can ask them to tell you the university rules that give them that authority. Your attorney can then compare their demand with their authority and advise you whether you must comply, or perhaps strategically should comply, or should refuse.\n\nThe federal regulation which drives this is [34 CFR 105 subpart A](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d94e05d2e1f31c95c2387b077955a23&mc=true&node=sp34.1.106.a&rgn=div6). The logic of this is that the institution cannot discriminate on the basis of sex, if they do, they can be punished, but they can also \"erase\" the discrimination if they \"overcome the effects\" of the discrimination. [\u00a7106\\.8](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d94e05d2e1f31c95c2387b077955a23&mc=true&node=sp34.1.106.a&rgn=div6#se34.1.106_18) requires the institution to have a coordinator who assures compliance and does what is necessary including investigating. There must also be a grievance procedure:\n\n> (b) A recipient shall adopt and publish grievance procedures providing\n>  for prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee complaints\n>  alleging any action which would be prohibited by this part.\n\nThere is absolutely no further federal specification as to what this coordinator can do, instead the government leaves it up the the institution to come up with procedures.

Their actions are more likely based on institutional policies or procedures. Federal regulations give institutions flexibility in creating their own grievance procedures, as long as they provide \"prompt and equitable resolution\" of complaints.

Is the rule simply that any such charts must be introduced into evidence before the trial, or can explanatory charts be used in final arguments without having submitted them beforehand?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The kind of chart you are talking about is called a \"demonstrative exhibit\". The rule governing the use of demonstrative exhibits in states that follow the numbering scheme of the federal rules of evidence (which most states do) is Rule 1006 (Summaries) which states:\n\n> The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs which\n>  cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form\n>  of a chart, summary, or calculation. The originals or duplicates,\n>  shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other\n>  parties at reasonable time and place. The court may order that they be\n>  produced in court.\n\nBasically, this means that demonstrative exhibits are fine as long as they are supported by the evidence offered at trial, or are admitted in circumstances when the opposing party has an opportunity to review at trial their factual basis. A demonstrative exhibit for use in closing doesn't necessarily have to be introduced into evidence at trial, although it often would be used first in opening, then during trial and again in closing, as a matter of good trial litigation practice.\n\nA complication is that many state court rules (and federal courts) require that demonstrative exhibits be disclosed a certain number of days before trial as part of a trial management order designed to prevent undue surprise. This provisions are sometimes contained in Rules 16 or 26 of rules numbered similarly to the federal rules of civil procedure, and are sometimes set forth in a court specific case management order or trial management order tailored to a particular case or a particular judge's preferences. This would vary considerably from court to court, sometimes even within the same state. These disclosure requirements are less common in courts with limited civil jurisdiction, but are sometimes found even in those courts.\n\nAlso, while advanced arrangements would ordinarily not need to be made with respect to a chart in terms of court facilities, one would want to make sure that an easel was available to put the chart on as one was talking about it. \n\nSome discussion of the use of visual aids in a closing argument can be found [here](http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/judges/Inns%20Presentation--Closing%20Arguments.pdf), although that source is light on the technical steps that must be taken to use them.\n\nIf a more sophisticated arrangement (e.g. a power point presentation or a video) is desired, this can generally be permitted as well, but advanced consultation with the court and opposing counsel to arrange the logistics of getting the projector and screen set up, etc. must usually be made usually via the court's division clerk (i.e. the court clerk assigned to the particular courtroom or judge).\n\nThe main objection to a demonstrative exhibit is that it is not supported by facts offered at trial (if it was not itself admitted as an exhibit at trial with an offer to disclose the underlying facts), either because the facts were not introduced into evidence, or because it inaccurately states the facts offered at trial. Also, certain kinds of statements (e.g. an attorney stating that a particular witness was lying, rather than listing facts that show that the witness was lying, or referring to evidence that was kept out of the record at trial) are prohibited completely in an closing statement in any format.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a civil trial, attorney Smith wants to use a chart during closing arguments that summarizes complex financial transactions presented throughout the trial.

While some jurisdictions do require pre-trial disclosure, the exact timeframe can vary and is not universally set at 30 days.\n\nOption C is overly restrictive. Demonstrative exhibits for closing arguments don't necessarily need to be formally admitted as evidence during the trial, though they often are used throughout the proceedings.\n\nOption D is correct because it acknowledges both the federal Rule 1006, which allows for summaries of voluminous information, and the fact that local rules may require pre-trial disclosure of demonstrative exhibits.

I want use a friend who has no legal training as my \"counsel,\" do the police have any legal recourse from allowing me to talk to him prior to interrogation? E.g., can they insist that my counsel be a member of the bar in the state where I have been arrested?**\n\nYes. If they don't want you to, you cannot talk to a friend, only a lawyer. If you got an OUI, and you're not being a jerk, they will probably let you talk to whomever you want (within reason \u2013 it's not social hour). However, *they can* keep you from speaking to anyone but a lawyer as that person could gain information from you that can corrupt their investigation. (E.g., they arrest you with 10 lbs. of methamphetamine. They know it's \"fresh\" and likely came from a local lab that they suspect you of running. You cannot be allowed to talk to just anyone, as they could help get the lab broke down, moved, destroyed). In TV shows you see attorneys doing this type of illicit thing, but in reality that is very rare. When you enter the police station to speak with a client, you must present your bar card (license to practice). Friends are not allowed in, even if you value their counsel \u2013 they are not counselors!\n\n**2\\. I want to consult a \"team\" of qualified counselors. Are there legal grounds or regulations to limit the number of individuals I consult prior to interrogation, and who I have present during interrogation?** \n\nNo. You can have your entire legal team with you, while preparing for court, or while being questioned, within reason. They do not need to rent a conference room to fit your 30 person legal team, but if you want 3 or so lawyers in with you, and you can afford paying each $250\\-$500 per hour, then have at it. Most lawyers would counsel you against this, as it creates an undue impression of limitless (hence likely illegal) funds. (But if you're a hedge fund manager, and you can show your money is legally earned, it's really your choice.) I have had occasion to go in to meet a client with co\\-counsel numerous times (especially in early years of practice when there is a lead attorney and second chair, so to speak, even for interrogation (which means silence by the client).\n\nThey can \"impede\" access to some extent, though they typically don't. They can play games with your lawyer and make them wait and make you wait, but not while they are in with you, and only for so long. Once your lawyer arrives they should leave you alone. (Some courts say once you ask for counsel they need to leave you alone, but this only really matters if they get a confession from you (or any evidence) before you've (and this is what they're hoping for) recant your request for counsel and your right to remain silent.)\n\n**3\\. Can my contact with counsel be proscribed in any way? E.g., can the police limit the duration or schedule of contact with counsel? Can they impede or delay access to me by someone who claims to be my counsel?**\n\nOnce you've called your lawyer, they need to to let him or her meet with you for a reasonable amount of time before questioning. This is typically a quick meeting, just long enough to make sure you will not say a word. *Even completely innocent people should keep their mouth shut \u2013 innocent people do occasionally get arrested and convicted!* \n\nNo matter what the police say, there is *no* benefit, ever, from talking to them. Some police, who know it's their last shot to get a confession and know once your lawyer gets there will never talk to you again (and they have enough to go forward without your confession in the event you just start blabbing \"you did it\" before they can get you to invoke your rights) will keep talking to you and tell you not to comment, just to listen, even while your lawyer sits outside. They can say you're being processed, or there's a security issue, any number of reasons for short delays if they need it. They will then go on and on about \"how they can maybe *help you out* if you talk now, but once your lawyer arrives all bets are off.\" These are just tricks to get you to recant/revoke your rights and to obtain your confession. You will usually see your lawyer shortly after arrival.\n\n**Can they impede or delay access to me by someone who claims to be my counsel?** Yes, if your lawyer doesn't have adequate ID or cannot verify he is licensed in that state, or in another state and with local counsel. The police do not have a duty to research your lawyer's credentials, and don't have to go online and look your attorney up in the bar directory to make it easier for him or her to get to you. However, if they know the attorney, and he or she forgot his bar card, they would probably lose the confession if you confessed while they make him go get it. Most lawyers carry their bar card in their wallet, so this is not a typical problem.\n\n**4\\. What do police have to do to facilitate my access to my desired counselor(s)? E.g., how long can I be held after requesting an attorney without being allowed to attempt to contact one?**\n\nYou have a right to contact a lawyer. There is no explicit right to a phone call, although some form of contact is implied. Hence, you can usually be held 3 hours before they have to let you \"contact\" someone, and this is after processing. You can be held until your lawyer gets there or until your arraignment, whatever comes first. If your lawyer doesn't show up, you will be given another opportunity by the court to get your lawyer of choice there for arraignment. If you can't, and you don't want to go forward, a public defender will move to waive your right to a speedy trial and seek a continuance until you can get your counsel of choice there. If this happens, consider getting a new lawyer.\n\n**What means must I be granted to find and contact the counsel of my choice?**\n\nThis actually differs depending on where you are and what you did. Again, you have a right to counsel but they can determine how you get this done. Sometimes there are local laws that say you get any number, or 3, or 1 completed phone call to reach your counsel of choice. If there is an overriding risk that you will call someone to communicate information that could put the investigation in jeopardy or would be adversely impact their evidentiary value in some way, even when these laws exist the police can refuse you direct contact with anyone and may implement a strict \"they call\" policy, where they will call the lawyer and tell them, or call your family to let them know, and they can call the lawyer. They cannot hold you for a protracted amount of time without giving you some way to get word to a lawyer; it must be reasonable. There is not a lot of law out there about what *is not* reasonable, because the police know, and for the most part accept, that once right to counsel has been invoked they are done. There is case law saying that 3 hours is reasonable. What is not reasonable?

However, it may be lawful if the government has a proper legal basis, such as compliance with a legal obligation or performance of a task in the public interest. The government would need to ensure compliance with GDPR principles, including data minimization and transparency. They should also implement safeguards, particularly if using AI for decision-making that produces legal effects (e.g., tax assessments).

As seen in the example from Australia, a month is typically defined as a calendar month, but this may not be universal. The question of whether 4 weeks constitutes a month for employment purposes can differ based on local laws and regulations.
