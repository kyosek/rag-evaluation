I've tried reading the Wikipedia article on it, and while it does give a small amount of explanation, it essentially is 2 double\\-stub length paragraphs based around various jurisdictions, with a bunch of links to specific types of murder and methods of murder.\n\nWhat's the difference between first degree, second degree and third degree murder?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The definition of different degrees of murder and how severely they are punished varies from state to state, so an exact answer would require to list the definitions of all 50 states. So this answer is just a generalization.\n\nThe main difference between first degree and second degree murder is *typically* that first degree murder requires that the perpetrator planned the murder in advance while a second degree murder was committed spontaneously. But the exact definition varies from state to state. In some states, certain ways of killing people are always first degree murder, no matter if they were planned or not. Some states do not even have different \"degrees\" of murder but use other classifications for different kinds of homicide.\n\n[Third degree murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-degree_murder) only exists in 3 states (Florida, Minesota and Pensylvania) and means something very different in each of them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States legal system, which of the following statements about degrees of murder is most accurate?\n\nA) First degree murder always requires premeditation, while second degree murder is always spontaneous in all 50 states.\n\nB) Third degree murder is a universally recognized classification across all U.S. states, typically referring to unintentional killings.\n\nC) The distinction between first and second degree murder is consistent across all state jurisdictions, with clear and uniform definitions.\n\nD) The classification and definition of murder degrees can vary significantly between different states, with some states not using the degree system at all.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. The documentation emphasizes that the definition and classification of murder degrees vary from state to state. It notes that while first degree murder typically involves premeditation and second degree is often spontaneous, these definitions are not universal and can differ between jurisdictions. Additionally, it mentions that some states don't use the degree system at all, opting for other classifications of homicide. The information also highlights that third degree murder only exists in three states and has different meanings in each, contradicting the idea of it being a universal classification. This variability in murder classifications across different states makes option D the most comprehensive and accurate choice."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/50748/registering-a-copyright-for-a-web-app-what-type", "docs_id": 50748, "title": "Registering a copyright for a web-app: what type?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm registering a copyright for a draft of a web\\-application I'm developing.

They wanted the people to write a new constitution like they do with the States constitution.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Was the Constitution of the United States meant to be perpetual?\n\nYes, the Constitution of the United States was meant to be perpetual, subject to the amendment procedure contained in the Constitution itself.\n\nThere are two possibilities, either it was perpetual, or it was intended to cease to be effective at some point in time that is defined somewhere.\n\nNo court or legal scholar has ever seriously suggested that the Constitution had an expiration date. Neither does any legislation ever adopted (apart from the efforts of the former Confederate States to leave the Union without its consent which was repudiated by the U.S. Civil War and related legal and political proceedings).\n\nAs Nate Eldredge noted in a comment, the preamble of the United States Constitution states that it was adopted \"secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves **and our Posterity**\".\n\nThe fact that the Constitution contained a transition provision in relation to its \"natural born citizen\" requirement for a country that didn't exist prior to 1776 does nothing to change any of this analysis.\n\n> The founding fathers had no authority to bind anybody but themselves.\n\nThe assumed rule that someone has no authority to bind anyone but themselves is not now, and never has been, the law.\n\nThe authority of people to bind people other than themselves, including successors who aren't even born yet, to legal documents, is long standing in both Western and Eastern legal systems.\n\nAgents can bind principals. Employees can bind employers. Union officials can bind their members. Partners can unilaterally bind each other. People creating trusts can bind the trustees and beneficiaries of the trust long after they are dead; charitable trusts can be perpetual. Military officers can bind their subordinates. Parents can bind their children in many jurisdictions. Guardians and conservators can bind their wards. Executors of estates can bind a decedent's heir and devisees. Home owners associations can bind member property owners and their guests. Governments can bind their residents. Sovereigns can bind their subjects.\n\nBefore the modern concept of property arose in the early modern period (i.e. prior to around 1500 CE), real estate ownership was primarily hereditary and inalienable, as was the serf\\-lord relationship. Transfers of property are not undone when the person who makes them ceases to exist. Real estate covenants routinely \"run with the land\" after they are created by the current owners.\n\nThe legal obligations you enter into while you are alive are binding upon your estate at death. In the civil law countries with legal systems based upon those of Continental Europe (derived in turn from Roman law), the default rule is still that the obligations of a decedent are binding upon the decedent's next of kin, although it is not terribly difficult to opt out of that default rule in the heir's discretion after death if they elect to do so (and many do). Until not long before the Industrial Revolution, in the late early modern period of history, most Western legal systems, and East Asian legal systems, provided that your descendants continued to be bound by your debts and could not opt out of that obligation.\n\nWhen a legal entity is bound, all successor owners, directors, officers, managers, and partners of the entity are bound perpetually by anything done by someone with apparent authority to do so and by judgments entered against the entity.\n\nThe United States of America is, of course, a legal entity which is not operated for profit, so the ability of its founders to bind successive generations is a pedestrian principle that follows from ordinary non\\-constitutional law anyway.\n\nA treaty between nations are binding long after every single person who signed of on it is dead.\n\nThe assumed rule that someone can bind only themselves simply does not pass even casual examination.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best reflects the intended duration of the United States Constitution according to legal interpretation and historical context?\n\nA) The Constitution was meant to expire once all the founding fathers had passed away.\nB) The Constitution was intended to be temporary, with each generation expected to draft a new one.\nC) The Constitution was designed to be perpetual, subject only to its own amendment procedures.\nD) The Constitution's duration was left intentionally ambiguous by the founding fathers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. The Constitution was indeed designed to be perpetual, subject only to its own amendment procedures. This is supported by several key points from the provided information:\n\n1. No court or legal scholar has ever seriously suggested that the Constitution had an expiration date.\n2. The preamble of the Constitution states it was adopted to \"secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,\" indicating an intent for it to apply to future generations.\n3. The document contains no explicit expiration date or provision for automatic replacement.\n4. The principle that founders can bind future generations is well-established in legal traditions, contrary to the misconception that they could only bind themselves.\n5. The transition provision regarding the \"natural born citizen\" requirement does not imply a limited lifespan for the Constitution, but rather addresses the unique circumstances of the newly formed nation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Constitution's validity was never tied to the lifespan of the founding fathers. Option B contradicts the historical and legal understanding of the Constitution's intended permanence. Option D is not supported by the evidence, which strongly indicates a clear intent for perpetuity rather than ambiguity."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32473/for-a-politician-is-a-lunch-outing-with-warren-buffet-considered-a-650-000-gif", "docs_id": 32473, "title": "For a politician, is a lunch outing with Warren Buffet considered a $650,000 gift?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is a story in the news about Nikki Haley (now former US ambassador to the UN) taking trips in a friend's (and political supporter's) private jet.\n\nSee story: **[Watchdog wants investigation of Nikki Haley\u2019s private jet flights to SC](https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/watchdog-wants-investigation-of-nikki-haley-s-private-jet-flights/article_d32bcbb0-cb2e-11e8-8c2a-076e4f7ad7a1.html)**\n\nAccording to the article, Haley declared these trips, but rather than declaring the true market value of a private plane ride from New York to South Carolina (\\~$24,000\\), she declared the value to be that of a first class flight on a commercial airline (\\~$3200\\).\n\nThis actually makes perfect sense to me. She didn't receive $24,000 of value. She can't sell the flight she got on eBay. All she got was a free trip, which saved her about $3200\\.

Whatever FMV is in the context of a meeting with Warren Buffet purchased by investors, it's probably different in the context of the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nBuffett has little to gain from a meeting with people whose job he's been doing more successfully for half a century. He has more to gain from meeting with high\\-ranking government officials; this is why political donors frequently drop thousands of dollars to attend a dinner where such officials are speaking, even when there's only an off chance of so much as a handshake.\n2. Assuming that a campaign\\-finance calculation of fair market value is roughly equivalent to that in the tax context, FMV for a lunch with Warren Buffett probably isn't $650,000\\.\n\nBecause the Buffet lunch was purchased at a *charitable* auction, tax law would generally recognize that the price paid was not necessarily an accurate reflection of FMV. Instead, it would acknowledge that some portion of the price \\-\\- the amount in excess of FMV \\-\\- was actually a charitable gift.\n\nThat of course still leaves the question of what FMV actually is for a lunch with Warren Buffet.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A high-ranking government official receives a private jet flight from a political supporter. The market value of the flight is $24,000, but the official declares it as $3,200 (the cost of a first-class commercial ticket) on their disclosure forms. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal and ethical considerations in this situation?\n\nA) The official's declaration is appropriate because they only received the value equivalent to a first-class ticket, not the full cost of operating a private jet.\n\nB) The official should declare the full $24,000 market value, as this represents the actual cost of the service provided.\n\nC) The official should not have to declare anything, as the flight was provided by a personal friend.\n\nD) The official should declare a value between $3,200 and $24,000, based on a fair market value assessment specific to their position and the circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most appropriate answer because it recognizes the complexity of valuing such gifts for high-ranking officials. While the official did receive a service worth $24,000 in the open market (option B), this doesn't necessarily reflect the value to the official or the ethical implications. Simply declaring the cost of a first-class ticket (option A) likely undervalues the gift, given the additional benefits of private travel. Declaring nothing (option C) would be inappropriate given the potential for conflicts of interest.\n\nThe correct approach would be to determine a fair market value that takes into account the official's position, the nature of the gift, and potential ethical considerations. This value might be higher than a commercial ticket but lower than the full cost of operating a private jet. This approach aligns with the nuanced understanding of value discussed in the context of the Warren Buffett lunch example, where the actual value may differ from both the cost to the provider and the general market rate."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64093/how-much-can-i-see-of-a-dissolution-of-marriage-filed-in-alameda-county-califo", "docs_id": 64093, "title": "How much can I see, of a dissolution of marriage filed in Alameda County, California?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live far away from California, but want to know more about this divorce.\n\n1.

The police often destroy records decades before the courts will.\n\nEven if the court has no such record, I would be concerned about a record of your conviction existing in the national databases like [NCIC](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ncic).

This clause is not obviously unconscionable.\n\nIn addition, some jurisdictions prohibit [unfair contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_contract) terms in consumer contracts.

The indemnity clause, as described, is not automatically void or universally enforceable. Its enforceability can vary depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances. The clause may be challenged on grounds of unconscionability (if it's deemed extremely unfair at the time the contract was made) or as an unfair contract term in jurisdictions with consumer protection laws. Additionally, while the clause appears to cover a broad range of scenarios, including unauthorized access, it's important to note that indemnity clauses typically cannot protect against deliberate acts, fraud, or crimes committed by the beneficiary (in this case, the website). The enforceability of the clause regarding the website's own negligence may also be limited by proportionate liability laws in some jurisdictions.

As part of this, they have sent around an update to the employment contract which basically nullifies the flexible working hours which previously has been in effect. Many people I work with vary their working hours to fit in with their lives, and has been accepted \\- up to this point.\n\nThe business operated a core working hours of 10am to 4pm, but are changing this to 9am \\- 5pm, with a 30 minute \"flexible start/end\" that employees can start and end their working day (e.g; 8\\.30am to 5pm, or 9am to 5\\.30pm) \\- effectively removing the concept of flexible working hours completely. This affects many people's lives, and some of my colleagues are petitioning to retain their flexible working hours, of which are being met with strict rules surrounding a mandatory lunch hour/half hour, no option to work less than this to make up the time (despite being willing to), and one has been forced to drop their hours to 36/week.\n\nThey also put in a clause to the portion that they're wanting everyone to sign which says that everyone must specify when, between the hours to 12pm to 2pm, they will take their lunch, and must be rigid over this (unless a meeting is occurring, in which case that overrides your lunch hour and you must take it later). This was also met with protest, and they eventually caved and relaxed this rigidity slightly, then sent across some minutes from that meeting ratifying this. They will not, however, update the contract to reflect this as they've said that the meeting minutes ratifies it. However, we don't believe this would ever stand up in court if a dispute ever arose. Is this true?\n\nThe final part of this demands flexibility from the employee for the business's requirements (e.g; if a meeting runs late/starts early, the employee is expected to be there), but will not offer the same level of flexibilities to staff who currently have lives (unless they offer a rigid, business\\-valid justification for doing so).

What are the options for employees if they disagree to the new rigid rules and will (or have) get a formal request for flexible working hours rejected because their reasons are not \"valid\" in the eyes of the business?

According to the information provided, there is no federal law that specifically prohibits banks from foreclosing on properties of kidnapped individuals. For private mortgages, foreclosure processes are primarily governed by state laws. These laws typically require banks to follow certain notice procedures, such as sending letters and making phone calls, but do not mandate that the homeowner must physically receive or be aware of these notices. The bank can proceed with foreclosure after missed payments, following the required notification process, even if the homeowner is kidnapped and unable to respond.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no general requirement to wait for the homeowner to be freed or declared deceased.\n\nOption B is incorrect as there is no such federal law mentioned in the provided information.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while specific procedures vary by state, there's no indication that a special court order is universally required for foreclosing on a kidnapped person's property."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/56132/what-powers-do-transport-for-london-revenue-inspectors-have-for-example-compar", "docs_id": 56132, "title": "What powers do Transport for London revenue inspectors have (for example, compared with British Transport Police)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can they arrest or otherwise apprehend you, or demand to search your belongings?

Wikipedia summarises the general common law rule in these terms:\n\n> A finder of property acquires no rights in mislaid property, is entitled to possession of lost property against everyone except the true owner, and is entitled to keep abandoned property.\n\nPerson A's property meets Wikipedia's definition of **lost** property:\n\n> Property is generally deemed to have been lost if it is found in a place where the true owner likely did not intend to set it down, and where it is not likely to be found by the true owner.\n\nPerson A's property may also meet the definition of **abandoned**:\n\n> Property is generally deemed to have been abandoned if it is found in a place where the true owner likely intended to leave it, but is in such a condition that it is apparent that he or she has no intention of returning to claim it.\n\nIn this case, the objective circumstances strongly suggest that the ring is **abandoned**.

However, the correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. The watch is more likely to be considered lost property rather than abandoned. Lost property is typically found in a place where the owner did not intend to leave it, which applies here as Person A accidentally dropped the watch.\n\n2. While the presence of the \"Free\" note might suggest abandonment, the fact that Person A did not intend to give away the watch is crucial. Intent is a key factor in determining whether property is abandoned.\n\n3. As lost property, the true owner (Person A) retains superior rights to the property against everyone except a potential good faith purchaser.\n\n4. Person A, as the true owner, has the right to sue Person B to recover the lost property.\n\n5.

Such is known as the \"dual sovereignty\" or \"separate sovereigns\" doctrine\n\nIn [*United States v. Lanza*, 260 U.S. 377 (1922\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/260/377/) the US Supreme Court wrote:\n\n> The defendants insist that two punishments for the same act, one under the National Prohibition Act and the other under a state law, constitute double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment, and, in support of this position, it is argued that both laws derive their force from the same authority \\-\\- the second section of the amendment \\-\\- and therefore that, in principle, it is as if both punishments were in prosecutions by the United States in its courts.\n\n...\n\n> It follows that an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both, and may be punished by each. The Fifth Amendment, like all the other guaranties in the first eight amendments, applies only to proceedings by the federal government, Barron v. City of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, and the double jeopardy therein forbidden is a second prosecution under authority of the federal government after a first trial for the same offense under the same authority. Here, the same act was an offense against the state of Washington, because a violation of its law, and also an offense against the United States under the National Prohibition Act. The defendants thus committed two different offenses by the same act, and a conviction by a court of Washington of the offense against that state is not a conviction of the different offense against the United States, and so is not double jeopardy\n\nIt is interesting to note that as late as 1922 this court seemed to think that none of the bill of rights had been incorporated into the 14th amendment and thus made applicable to the states.

This does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because they are considered separate offenses against different sovereigns. Additionally, a guilty plea in state court can typically be used as evidence in a federal prosecution, as it is considered an admission of guilt.

These are illegal because they contain the melodies of famous songs and are sold without paying royalties to the songwriters. Until 2004 there was no legal version of these books available anywhere, yet it was impossible to be a professional jazz musician without one. So people copied and/or sold them illegally. Hal Leanord and Sher Music now publish legal versions that do pay royalties where required (which includes more than 95% of the tunes). \n\nI am looking for a way to legalize an old (originally illegal) copy of a Real Book, but I don't want to pay as much as one penny to either publisher because they are part of a \"music industry\" that I do not want to support. There are many reasons, for example the \"industry\" artificially narrows the focus of popular music to increase profit while reducing production costs. There are also practical reasons, for example the publishers changed the repertoire in the new legal versions of the books, so some of the old tunes are missing. Is there a way I can pay royalties where they are due, without conceding any benefit to these publication companies?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Before you assume that the books are illegal, you need to inspect the terms of the agreement between author and publisher, if any. Very many publications are completely legal and give no royalties to the author (95% of mine are royalty\\-free). An author may transfer copyright to a publisher, or he may license its publication. An actual transfer needs to be in writing, but a license can be implicit (and often was, again most of my earlier papers). When you see a copyright sign and the name of the publisher, that does not mean that the publisher has the copyright to the entire content: it may only have copyright in the arrangement of works, and individual authors control their own works.\n\nA truly illegal work would be one where the publisher takes the author's work and copies it without permission. Publishers don't break into authors' property and steal manuscripts. The burden of proof does rest on the publisher to show that they have permission, which could be in the form of letters saying that a work was to be published in some compilation; corrected page proofs; and various other ways of signalling agreement.\n\nA likely source of truly illegal copying would be re\\-publishing previously published works, e.g. Smith licenses the right to re\\-print a work from original publisher Jones. In that case, (1\\) it matters whether Jones got a transfer of copyright, vs. relied on licensing and (2\\) whether in the latter case the original license prohibits sub\\-licensing. If Jones relies on implicit licensing, they would have a hard time establishing that sub\\-licensing was part of the implicit sub\\-license.\n\nSupposing that your copy is truly illegal, there is no way to make it legal, because the illegality is copying without permission, and the copying is a *fait accompli*. Permission would have to be granted by the rights\\-holder to the publisher: the owner of the book does not need permission from the author to own the book, they need the permission of the publisher or publisher's agent (e.g. the bookstore). And you have that, in the form of a standard sales contract (assuming you didn't steal the book).\n\nThe foregoing is general stuff about copyright: there is a second concern not about the book, but the right to publicly perform. [17 USC 106(4\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) gives the author the exclusive right\n\n> in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,\n>  pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to\n>  perform the copyrighted work publicly\n\nSupposing that you don't just want to own the book, you want to use it in performances, then you need a license to do so. You might directly contact an author and attempt to negotiate permission to perform, but this would be quite a burden (especially if the author is deceased), and also not foolproof. The problem is that the author may not actually know what the legal status of his copyright is \\-\\- he may have just signed a form without thinking about what he was signing, and might have transferred his copyright to the publisher.\n\nRegardless of the license / transfer question about the author and original publisher, the fact that you have acquired a copy of the book does not mean that you have a right to publicly perform. Presumably you know that, and have a performance license.\n\n[ASCAP claims](https://www.ascap.com/~/media/655449c494b748ba89edc4864655e1b6.pdf) that it rewards songwriters; [BMI](https://www.bmi.com/licensing/entry/business_using_music_bmi_and_performing_rights) and [SESAC](https://www.sesac.com/Repertory/Terms.aspx) do likewise. I have no idea how true that is and especially how vigorously they trace the legal history of a work. You can identify individual authors and directly compensate them for their work (assuming you can locate the author; then figure out a just reward).

Recently, he was literally escorted out of the campus building on the premise that it was winter break.\n\nIt is a common notion that the university remains closed during the winter break, but he is a full\\-time student and was on the campus for more than 24 hours. The university is heavily guarded and is always monitored by a Public Safety department which is actually run by a multinational security corporation (originally based in the US). The presence of my friend was already known and he has been a student for more than 3 years. He was working on a project, and is a kind of person who gets lost very easily in work. First night, he crashed in during the night because he lives in a far away city (in his case, Dubai) and continued working on his project the next day as well. The university is a very student\\-focused Liberal Arts university, and he was in no way ready for what was to happen.\n\nWhile he was working in one of the labs which is usually 24x7 for student use, two security guards approached him and asked him to leave the campus immediately. The demeanor of the guards was very rough and they kicked out this student and asked him actually to leave the campus (entirely) at around midnight. Now, my friend is literally left devastated by this act which they carried out on him at midnight. He now hates his university and is scared of the Public Safety officers (who are supposed to protect him). He immediately wrote to them asking what the actual protocol was for some student who would come to campus during a break, but hasn't received a response since (almost ten days now).\n\nCan he sue the company managing the Public Safety department (for the psychological damage he received)?

So all the places my friend accessed were done so using his university issued RFID\\-based ID card.

The law is great for pursuing financial compensation, but does not handle abstract concepts. Has your friend used psychological counselling services, and what was the cost? What additional financial costs has your friend borne?\n* If your friend has written to the University and has expected a response, what is the evidence of diminished trust? (The letter suggests otherwise.)\n* Would a reasonable person (the proverbial \"man in the street\") be psychologically damaged by the events experienced by your friend?\n* Is there evidence of a pre\\-existing condition?\n\nYou've also mentioned yourself as a witness. Did you witness the eviction, or would you be attesting to your friend's state of mind? If the latter, what are your psychological qualifications?\n\nIn the main Western jurisdictions, the answer to the question \"can my friend sue?\" is usually \"yes\", but whether they stood a chance of winning the suit would probably be a better question to ask.\n\nYour friend would only be likely to win a case against the University or the Security company if they could demonstrate unlawful or counter\\-contractual activity by staff, and were able to demonstrate financial damages that had been caused by that activity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information provided about the student's experience at the American university in the UAE, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal action?\n\nA) The student has strong grounds to sue the security company for psychological damage, as being escorted off campus during a break is clearly unlawful.\n\nB) The student cannot sue because the incident occurred in the UAE, where American laws do not apply.\n\nC) The student can sue but is unlikely to win unless they can demonstrate unlawful activity by staff and provide evidence of quantifiable financial damages.\n\nD) The student should immediately file a lawsuit against both the university and the security company, as witnesses can attest to the psychological harm caused.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. While the student can technically sue (as is often possible in Western jurisdictions), winning the case would be challenging. To have a chance of success, the student would need to prove that the staff's actions were unlawful or violated contractual agreements.

I've lived in Japan for the first 15 years of my life, and I've never visited Iran. Since Japan doesn't recognize dual citizenship status, I needed to renounce Iranian citizenship, which I obtained by birth from my father of Iranian origin and is almost impossible to renounce. However, Japan recognizes renouncement of foreign citizenship just through a short paperwork, which is processed only within Japanese legal system. However, this renouncement system is local and not necessarily considered valid oversea. Does the U.S. have a similar system? If not, does this Japanese system of renouncement of citizenship have any effect in the U.S.? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We do not have a law requiring you to renounce citizenships that you might hold, like the [Nationality Law](http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tnl-01.html). I am not sure what you mean saying that renouncement is processed only within the Japanese legal system \\-\\- that is how it is everywhere, and there is no international authority or clearing house that handles citizenship renunciations. The effect of renouncing Japanese citizenship would be that you are then no longer a citizen of Japan: I can't find an explicit law prohibiting an exclusively\\-Japanese citizen from renouncing his citizenship and becoming stateless. A dual citizen would then be exclusively a citizen if \"the other country\", thus you would become strictly an Iranian citizen.\n\nAccording to the [Civil Code of Iran](http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf) you would be an Iranian citizen under clause 2 of Article 976\\. Article 977 allows accept a different citizenship but that would not apply if you have an Iranian father (and I guess does not actually get rid of your Iranian citizenship). Article 988 sets conditions for Iranians to abandon their nationality: you must be 25 or older, have renounced all property rights in Iran by transfer to Iranian nationals, have done your military service, and, have approval of the [Council of Ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Iranian_officials#Council_of_Ministers). So yeah, not possible.\n\nArticle 14 of the Japanese Nationality Law requires you to \"choose either of the nationalities\" before reaching 22, and furthermore\n\n> Choice of Japanese nationality shall be made either by depriving\n>  himself or herself of the foreign nationality or **by the declaration\n>  provided for in the Family Registration Law in which he or she swears\n>  that he or she chooses to be a Japanese national and that he or she\n>  renounces the foreign nationality** (hereinafter referred to as\n>  \u201cdeclaration of choice \u201d)\n\nArticle 16 says \"A Japanese national who has made the declaration of choice shall **endeavour** to deprive himself or herself of the foreign nationality\". \n\nThe bold part above seems to resolve that paradox, although that is based on a US\\-style interpretation of law and working from a translation of the law. That is, the requirement is that you try, not that you succeed (which is impossible in the case of a person with an Iranian father).\n\nThere would be an effect in the US. If you renounce Japanese citizenship, you're strictly an Iranian national, and that has one consequence. What is not clear is whether the US recognizes, in any way, a renunciation which Iran doesn't recognize. [This case](http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/doha/industrial/06-25183.h1.pdf) features a person with renounced Iranian citizenship (he is also a US citizen), who was approved for a security clearance based in part on his renounciation.

According to the Japanese Nationality Law, a dual citizen can make a \"declaration of choice\" in which they swear to choose Japanese nationality and renounce their foreign nationality. This satisfies Japanese legal requirements, even if the actual renunciation of Iranian citizenship is nearly impossible due to Iran's strict laws. The Japanese law recognizes the effort to renounce, rather than the actual success of renunciation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Iran makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for individuals with Iranian fathers to renounce their citizenship.

One video dealt with a group that had kicked out their DM and gotten another DM, and DM1 had then gone after DM2 for \"stealing his campaign\". No actual legal threats were made, but this got me wondering if DM1 might have had some sort of standing.\n\nAs a quick overview, in a tabletop RPG, the Dungeon Master (exact nomenclature varies between rpg systems) creates an outline for a narrative he wants the players' characters to participate in. This outline is generally called a campaign. The players, for their part, design their characters with more or less input from the DM. They players and DM then get together to flesh out the outline of the narrative through basically improv theater and combat simulation using polyhedral dice.\n\nSo, clearly this is a group effort and the players have a great deal of input in the creative process of fleshing out the storyline. Ergo, they'd have some degree of copyright to the ongoing story outlined by the DM.\n\nMy question is, do the players have enough copyright to ask someone else to pick up from where the previous DM left off and essentially create a derivative work? Or, can an ousted DM pretty much vindicate the group's decision by taking the new DM to court to prevent them from continuing the story?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That is going to depend on the details of exactly who does what, and how much is written down. It will also depend on the agreements between the people involved, which may well be verbal or implied. I don't know of any actual cases where such a dispute came to a copyright lawsuit. As copyright suits largely deal with **financial** harms and damages, and in most individual game there is little or no financial impact, a suit might be unlikely in most cases. But lets look at some possibilities.\n\nIn the typical case, the game organizer or DM creates a setting and outline for a series of sessions. This is likely to include maps, descriptions of rooms or locations, descriptions of artifacts, descriptions of non\\-player characters, locations and types of monsters and other hazards, and other such background. This is probably mostly or fully written down (which includes being recorded on some sort of computer file.) It is therefore protected by copyright, and the initial owner of that copyright is its creator, probably the DM. (In some cases the DM uses a published \"module\" and makes only limited changes, in which case the DM would only hold copyright on those changes, if anything.)\n\nThen the players create characters, in a process that may be supervised by the DM, and possibly participated in by other players. Each player would probably hold copyright to the description of his or her own character, but the DM or other players might be considered to be co\\-authors of that, depending on their degree of participation.\n\nThen the players start having playing sessions, each player controlling the actions of a character (or perhaps more than one), and the DM more\\-or\\-less controlling the rest of the world, guided by the pre\\-created maps and descriptions. Some of those will be shared with the players, or modified (partial) versions of them will be. Events of the sessions may or may not be written down (or otherwise preserved in a tangible form). If they are not, there is no copyright on them. If they are, there is a copyright, and all the players and the DM are probably co\\-authors.\n\nNow lets look and agreements and ownership. The DM probably owns his or her notes, S/he has at least permitted players to use any that have been revealed to the players. The group has probably agreed (implicitly) to co\\-create the adventure as it happens. There probably are no written agreements about any of this.\n\nIf a dispute arises, the DM is legally free to withhold the campaign notes, maps, etc that have not been shared with the players. Whether s/he can legally demand that the players not further use the parts of the setting that had been previously revealed is not so clear. It would depend on what the agreement between the DM and the players said; on, in effect, what license the DM had granted to the players. And since there was probably no written agreement, and quite likely not even an explicit verbal agreement, it would depend on what a court found they had agreed on by implication, based on their actions, and the usual customs of such groups. Sorting that out would be loads of fun. It might involve significant legal fees.\n\nThe DM is unlikely to hold any exclusive copyright on the previous events of the campaign. Most likely everyone who participates would be a co\\-author of those. Unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary, any co\\-author of any shared work has the right to use, and license the use of, the shared work, although s/he must account to the others for any profits.\n\nThe DM certainly has no legal right to forbid the same group from playing together with a different DM (absent a very improbable contract giving such a right). The DM can only control the maps and notes s/he created independently.\n\nIf a professional DM is involved, as a comment mentions is possible, it might be more likely that an explicit wri9tten contract between the players and the DM will have been agreed to, If so, its terms will control, whatever they are, unless they are somehow contrary to law. Such a pro DM might be more defensive of copyrights, but would not have any more rights than any DM, except as a specific contract might have provided them.\n\nI doubt that the courts will see many actual lawsuits over such issues.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a tabletop roleplaying game, a dispute arises between the original Dungeon Master (DM1) and a new Dungeon Master (DM2) over the continuation of a campaign.

The original DM (DM1) likely holds copyright on their original, unpublished campaign materials such as maps, descriptions, and other background elements they created. However, the events that occurred during play sessions, if recorded, would likely be considered co-authored works with the players.

This means that in a divorce marital property is divided, not automatically 50\\-50, but in a way that seems financially fair to the supervising judge, or according to an agreement entered into by both spouses. This also means that the state considers a car bought during the course of the marriage \"marital property\". There are also special rules for property bought before May 28 1980, which do not seem to apply in the case in the question. \n\nHowever, \"marital property\" mostly applies when a marriage ends which the question says is not in view here. NJ does allow for a car to be titled to only one, or to both. A title with both names may read \"John Doe OR Mary Doe\" or \"John Doe AND Mary Doe\". In the AND case both spouses must sign to sell or borrow against the car, in the OR case either signature will do.

Going back and forth could easily get ugly. \n\nIf both names are on the 'sporty' car's title with an OR, the husband could sell it without consulting the wife. if there is an AND he would need her to agree.\n\nIf the older car is in the husband's name alone, he could deny the wife or the son the right to drive it.\n\nThe wife could, of course, buy a different older (used) car and allow the son to use it.\n\nObviously it would be a good idea if the husband and wife came to a voluntary agreement about all this, but no law requires them to do so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In New Jersey, a couple has been married for 25 years.

In this case, since only the husband's name is on the title, he has the right to decide who can use the car while the marriage is intact, even though it would be considered marital property in the event of a divorce.

In particular, if your doctor or pharmacist told you not to drive while taking it, then that would seem to say that you were *not* using the substance as prescribed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Minnesota, a driver is pulled over and tests positive for methamphetamine in their system.

However, there is an affirmative defense if the driver can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they were using the controlled substance according to the terms of a valid prescription. This defense puts the burden of proof on the driver to demonstrate they were using the substance as prescribed, including following any instructions about not driving while taking the medication.

Is this ruling justified?\n\nThis is somewhat related to [this answer](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/36852/44006) since it addresses the health risk of acrylamide which is the court's argument for why coffee should have the cancer risk warning. Given the convincing data in the answer I linked, I'm finding it hard to see how the court justified this ruling.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From a legal perspective, I think the ruling is *reductio ad absurdum* correct. California voters passed Proposition 65\\. Consequently, [CA Health and Safety Code 25249\\.6](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&sectionNum=25249.6.) says \"No person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual, except as provided in [Section 25249\\.10](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&sectionNum=25249.10)\". [Section 25249\\.8](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&sectionNum=25249.8) mandates a list, and defines \"known to the state\"\n\n> A chemical is known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive\n>  toxicity within the meaning of this chapter if in the opinion of the\n>  state\u2019s qualified experts it has been clearly shown through\n>  scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted\n>  principles to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity, or if a body\n>  considered to be authoritative by such experts has formally identified\n>  it as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity, or if an agency of the\n>  state or federal government has formally required it to be labeled or\n>  identified as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity.\n\nAcrylamide is [so listed](https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/chemicals/acrylamide), and has been for 18 years, reason code listed as \"AB\\-IARC, AB\\-US EPA\". The law does not say that \"the benefits may outweigh the risks\", nor does the law say anything about usual doses. There is an \"escape clause\", if one (the defendant) can prove that there is no effect (25249\\.8(b)):\n\n> An exposure for which the person responsible can show that the\n>  exposure poses no significant risk assuming lifetime exposure at the\n>  level in question for substances known to the state to cause cancer,\n>  and that the exposure will have no observable effect assuming exposure\n>  at one thousand (1000\\) times the level in question for substances\n>  known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity, based on evidence\n>  and standards of comparable scientific validity to the evidence and\n>  standards which form the scientific basis for the listing of such\n>  chemical pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 25249\\.8\\. In any action\n>  brought to enforce Section 25249\\.6, the burden of showing that an\n>  exposure meets the criteria of this subdivision shall be on the\n>  defendant.\n\nThe answer on Skeptics does not address [the EPA finding](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/acrylamide.pdf) (and the science underlying it). At this point we can only conjecture about the defense's scientific argument (the ruling is still in the works, pending feedback from parties), but the judge said \"While plaintiff offered evidence that consumption of coffee increases the risk of harm to the fetus, to infants, to children and to adults, defendants' medical and epidemiology experts testified that they had no opinion on causation\" and that the coffee makers hadn't presented the proper grounds at trial to prevail. \n\nInsofar as human subjects testing of suspected carcinogens is illegal, any argument that \"but this only shows that it causes cancer in rats\" is legally empty: rats are a suitable proxy for humans. [This](https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/proposition-65/chemicals/1007114meifindings.pdf) is a state report addressing a potential carcinogen, 4\\-Methylimidazole. The report notes that to have a No Significant Risk Level finding, the substance must have less than a \"daily intake level posing a 10^\\-5 lifetime risk of cancer\". A further requirement is that \"risk analysis shall be based on the most sensitive study \ndeemed to be of sufficient quality\" (whatever that is). This study mentions a previous study which was rejected because \"these studies do not meet the criteria specified in Section 25703(a) because the experiments were not designed to adequately control for and examine the potential carcinogenicity of 4\\-MEI\". Basically, Spiegelhalter's argument is too meta, and doesn't constitute a proof that acrylamide poses no risk of cancer.\n\nIf the defendants commissioned an independent scientific study to overcome earlier carcinogen findings, perhaps the study failed on technical grounds. The bar that has to be cleared is very high. The [EPA regulation](https://safewater.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211403878-4-What-are-EPA-s-drinking-water-regulations-for-acrylamide-) says that the maximum contaminant level goal for acrylamide is zero.

The coffee companies did not successfully present evidence to meet this high standard. Option A is incorrect because the companies did not successfully prove this.

A company must have some capital, and Bob receives the shares in exchange. So it is not free (the exact minimum would depend of the requirements for incorporating).\n\nIn both cases, Bob is not only a shareholder but **the manager** of `Bob Limited`. Bob will not incur liabilities for being a shareholder, but he can be at fault for his actions as a manager (for example, if he gives false financial data about `Bob Limited` in order to get credit for investing). Do not confuse `Bob the Manager`and `Bob the Shareholder`, as they are different roles.\n\nOf course, if you are a trading company and Bob the Manager approachs you asking for credit for `Bob Limited`, you will have to consider which assets `Bob Limited` has to cover possible debts, and you will ask him the books or other proof. If Bob the Manager provides you the correct information about `Bob Limited` and does nothing \"funny\"1, Bob the Manager is off the hook; you did provide credit hoping to get profits but you knew that there was a risk, and you were given the data needed to evaluate that risk. \n\nIf Bob the Manager did things the wrong way (he did \"cook\" the books, he did provide false data or he did appropiate `Bob Limited` money) then Bob the Manager will probably be prosecuted. But Bob the Shareholder will not be liable for this, he will only lose the assets he did put forward as capital as the `Bob Limited` value will drop to zero.\n\nB) does not change much the situation, Matt still only loses his part of the company2.

In a limited liability company, shareholders are generally only liable up to the amount they invested in the company. However, Bob has two distinct roles here - shareholder and manager. As a shareholder, his liability is limited to his capital investment. But as the manager, Bob could face separate liability if he mismanaged the company, provided false information to creditors, or engaged in other forms of misconduct in his managerial role. It's crucial to distinguish between Bob's roles as shareholder and manager when considering potential liability. Options A and B are incorrect because they don't account for this distinction. Option D is incorrect because selling shares doesn't fundamentally change the nature of Bob's potential liability, though it might introduce additional complexities."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38297/is-attorney-client-privilege-extended-to-a-person-not-paying-for-the-service", "docs_id": 38297, "title": "Is attorney client privilege extended to a person not paying for the service?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Consider this hypothetical situation:\n\nSay you commit a hit and run and a friend takes the blame for you so you don't lose your career.

Please read the answer to [this question on this site](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o). \n\nThe question is whether the use of the song except would constitute \"fair use\". Several questions need to be asked:\n\n1. Would the use of the song in the film make it less likely to be purchased? That is, would someone who watched the film have 'satisfied\" any desire for the song, and not be as willing to pay money for it? If so that weighs against fair use. If not it weighs for it.\n2. How much of the song is used? the closer to the whole song, or the \"essential core\" is used, that weighs against fair use. If a song consisits of a verse plus a chorus repeated several times, and the film uses the verse plus one instance of the chorus, then the essential core of the song has pretty clearly been used. In the well\\-known *Harper vs Nation* case, a quote of 300 words was held to be the \"essential core\" of a book\\-length biography of President George H. W. Bush, and to be too much to count as fair use.\n3. What is the purpose of the use? is it trasformative? That is, is the film using the song in pretty much the same way that the singer would have? or is it there as an example of its genre, or perhaps it is used satirically. The more different the purpose from the original, the stronger the case for fair use.\n4. The character of the work being used. Since a song is a creative work, rather than a factual work like a news article, its protection is stronger, and the case for fair use weaker.\n\nNote that fair use is always a case\\-by\\-case, fact driven decision, and no one can say for sure if a particular use is a fair use unless and until a court has ruled on it. It is also a very specifically US legal concept, and does not apply elsewhere.\n\nAssuming that the use does not qualify as a fair use, permission would be needed for the copyright holder on the cover recording, **and** from the copyright holder on the song itself. The copyright on the cover recording might well be held by the cover singer, or by the (cover) recording company. The copyright on the song might well be held by the creator (shared by composer and lyrics authors if they are not the same person), or by the recording company that the creator has signed with. Or either copyright might be held by some other person or firm, as copyrights can be sold or assigned.\n\nThe film maker would need to contact these copyright holders and ask for permission to use the except. The holders might say yes or no, or ask for a fee. If there is no answer, that must be treated as a \"NO\". \n\nIf the film maker uses the song without getting permission, s/he could be sued for copyright infringement by the copyright holder, and possibly subjected to a court judgement for damages. This is true even if no money is made from the film, although damages will probably be larger is significant money is made. If the copyright holder does not choose to sue, nothing will happen.\n\n**EDIT**: \nAs a comment by @Dale M points out, the US has \"Mandatory licensing\" for music. This is provided under Section 115 of the Copyright law ([17 USC 115](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#115)). This means that if someone wants to record and distribute a cover version of a song, this can be done without the permission of the copyright holder. Instead, a \"Notice of Intention\" (NOI) is sent to the copyright holder and filed with the copyright office, describing what music is to be used and how. Then royalties are paid at a statutory rate (which may be higher than the current market rate). This process is described in [Copyright Office circular 73](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ73.pdf) and in \"[Learn What a Compulsory License Is in Music](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-a-compulsory-license-in-music-2460357)\" from *The Balance*.\n\nHowever, a compulsory license is **not** available for the kind of use described in the question. A compulsory license permits making a new recording of a new performance of an existing non\\-dramatic musical composition. It does **not** permit distributing an existing recording without permission. And a compulsory license does **not** permit use of a musical work as part of an audio\\-visual work, such as a film or video.\n\n> A phonorecord does not include sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work.\n\n...\n\n> Section 115 does not cover sound recordings. Rather, it covers the reproduction and distribution of nondramatic musical compositions.\n\n...\n\n> You cannot engage in the following activities with the compulsory license. You will need to seek permission from the copyright owner to:\n>  ... \n>  Make, reproduce, or distribute a sound recording publicly distributed in phonorecords\n\n(From Copyright office circular 73, linked above)\n\nSo to use a published recording of a cover version of a publisahed song in a film, permission would need to be obtained from **both** the copyright holder of the recording (usually the performer), **and** from the copyright holder of the song itself (the creator or whoever the copyright might have been transferred to).\n\nThe general process of obtaining such permisison, not specifically for music, is described in \"[The Basics of Getting Permission](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/introduction/getting-permission/)\" from Stanford University.\n\nAlso, US compulsory licenses apply only to music of US origin. They do not apply to music originally published outside the US.

The filmmaker needs permission from both copyright holders to use the clip legally.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overlooks the need for permission from the original songwriter.
