In summary, he had an early termination fee of $1,775 debited from his bank account, which shouldn't have happened because it was past the term of his two\\-year contract. Comcast do not dispute those facts, and have repeatedly told him that a check was on its way but, two years later, the man has still not been unable to get a refund. At one point, he was told by a company representative that refunds are not issued in these circumstances, and that he should instead dispute the charge with his bank.\n\nI am interested in the potential criminal liability in a situation like this (not necessarily this one) where a company knowingly takes money it is not due from someone's bank account and clearly has no intention of returning it.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1.

A criminal conviction would require intent on the part of the company or an employee, and that will probably be difficult to prove. In a big system like this, individuals can usually claim misunderstandings and errors of omission, which makes such a proof difficult. They could try to establish criminal [corporate liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_liability), but again this is difficult to prove. So while possible, it's probably not worth it.\n\n> Would the answer to the previous question differ based on whether the\n>  victim was eventually able to recover the money through litigation or\n>  by disputing the charge with their bank?\n\nProbably not. For a criminal conviction, it's necessary to prove that the company or an employee deliberately took money they knew was not theirs. Whether they later gave it back is not relevant for determining guilt (though it may reduce the sentence).\n\n> Would the company itself or the specific employees involved be liable?\n\nIn principle, both could be held liable. Again, this depends on what can be proved in court.\n\n> Would a binding arbitration clause in the contract have any effect on\n>  criminal liability\n\nNo, arbitration clauses cannot protect from criminal liability, only from civil liability (within limits).\n\n---\n\nOff\\-topic: The fastest way to resolve such situations is usually to write one stern letter explaining why you are owed the money. If that does not work, sue them \\- if the situation is clear\\-cut, you will most likely win, or the company will settle.\n\nMany jurisdictions have simplified court proceedings for clear cases like this, for example the *Mahnverfahren* in Germany.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a situation where a company incorrectly debits money from a customer's account and fails to refund it despite acknowledging the error, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential criminal liability?\n\nA) The company can be easily convicted of fraud if the customer reports it to the police, regardless of whether the money is eventually refunded.\n\nB) A binding arbitration clause in the contract would prevent any criminal charges from being filed against the company.\n\nC) Criminal liability would be difficult to establish, as it requires proving intentional wrongdoing by the company or its employees.\n\nD) The company cannot be held criminally liable if the customer eventually recovers the money through litigation or by disputing the charge with their bank.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because, as stated in the documentation, establishing criminal liability in such cases is challenging. It requires proving that the company or its employees intentionally took money they knew wasn't theirs, which is often difficult in large systems where individuals can claim misunderstandings or errors. While reporting it as fraud or theft is possible, successfully prosecuting it as a crime would be unlikely without clear evidence of intent. Options A and D are incorrect because the eventual refund or recovery of funds doesn't negate potential criminal liability if intent can be proven.

For example, here's the Illinois statute, [735 ILCS 5/2\\-203(a)](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?ActID=2017&ChapterID=56&SeqStart=2200000&SeqEnd=3900000):\n\n> Except as otherwise expressly provided, service of summons upon an individual defendant shall be made (1\\) by leaving a copy of the summons with the defendant personally, (2\\) by leaving a copy at the defendant's usual place of abode, with some person of the family or a person residing there, of the age of 13 years or upwards, and informing that person of the contents of the summons, provided the officer or other person making service shall also send a copy of the summons in a sealed envelope with postage fully prepaid, addressed to the defendant at his or her usual place of abode, or (3\\) as provided in Section 1\\-2\\-9\\.2 of the Illinois Municipal Code with respect to violation of an ordinance governing parking or standing of vehicles in cities with a population over 500,000\\. The certificate of the officer or affidavit of the person that he or she has sent the copy in pursuance of this Section is evidence that he or she has done so.\n\nThe key is that the service of process be *completed*. Legally, this implies that the server will file an affidavit that describes the circumstances of the legal completion of service.

The documentation emphasizes that the critical legal requirement for serving process is that it be completed, rather than any specific wording being used. This completion is typically evidenced by an affidavit filed by the server describing the circumstances of the service.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because saying \"You've been served\" is not a legal requirement, but rather a dramatization often seen in movies and TV shows.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the documentation states that specific phrasing isn't typically specified by statute.

The courts have consistently protected the right to advance arguments in support of ideas, even controversial ones. While there are restrictions on speech that directly incites violence, merely justifying or presenting reasons for past violent acts is generally protected under free speech. The key distinction is between \"justification\" of an action, which is typically protected, and \"incitement\" to commit an act, which may be restricted under certain circumstances. Therefore, justifying communal violence, while morally questionable, is likely to be legally protected speech as long as it doesn't cross the line into direct incitement of immediate violent action."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38065/as-a-customer-am-i-liable-for-messaging-another-customer-found-on-a-facebook-bu", "docs_id": 38065, "title": "As a customer, am i liable for messaging another customer found on a Facebook business page?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am a customer for a Wedding dress shop, and I messaged another customer with a warning about the shops impending closure because of issues with lack of contact from the company.\n\nI have received a warning from the Company who have stated a serious complaint has been made, using GDPR within their warning message. \n\nHave I broken any laws/rules in contacting another customer through Facebook?

They work on revenue share. If there is not enough revenue to where their share would be greater than or equal to minimum wage, is the company required to cover the difference? What if this is a full\\-time employee, opposed to a contractor?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Anyone who is an employee as defined in the federal [Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf) (FLSA), 29 USC 201 et seq.(or parallel state minimum wage laws) and is not within the scope of an exemption to the minimum wage law, must be paid minimum wage.\n\nThe relevant question is whether or not the person is an employee who is not exempt from the minimum wage requirement as defined in the FLSA. The question is a mixed issue of fact and law in which the characterization given to the relationship by the company and the person doing the work is one factor, but not the only or the controlling factor, in determining employee status.\n\nThe exact nature of the work governs whether the FLSA's minimum wage requirement applies or not. For example, \"employee\" is defined for puroses of the FLSA at 29 USC 203(e) to exclude \"any individual employed by an employer engaged in agriculture if such individual is the parent, spouse, child, or other member of the employer\u2019s immediate family\" and certain kinds of volunteers. Piecework pay is allows under certain limited circumstances by 29 USC 207(g) when the usual result is that reasonable workers earn the minimum wage. Tipped employees (which is a form of revenue sharing) also receive special treatment. Most of the exemptions are found at 29 USC 213\\. Most relevant to your question is 29 USC 213(a)(1\\) which includes an exception for an \"outside saleman\" who is paid on a straight commission basis, and 29 USC 213(a)(5\\) and (a)(6\\) which contain exclusions for certain farming and fishing occupations.\n\nStraight commission compensation without regard to the minimum wage is generally not permitted with regard to an employee who is an \"inside salesman\" (e.g. someone who works at a retail store in a mall or at a phone bank for a telemarketing company), or for anyone other than an outside saleman in non\\-agricultural jobs.\n\nIndependent contractor status generally depends upon the degree of control that the company has over the manner in which the work is performed, the assignability of the contract to do the work, and the extent to which the worker does work for many different companies on a contract basis while complying with employment related laws for the contactor's own employees (e.g. worker's compensation). The working for many different companies on a contract basis prong of the test is frequently controlling in practice. Six of the main factors considered by the Labor Department in determining independent contractor status are discussed in [Fact Sheet \\#13](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs13.htm).\n\nA true independent contractor may be paid on a revenue sharing basis without regard to minimum wage, although in practice, if this results in the independent contractor earning less than minimum wage, there will be strict scrutiny of the practice. Typical independent contractor arrangements that would be allowed would include an attorney working on a contingent fee basis, or an independent broker or realtor working on a straight commission bais. More often than not, a true independent contractor is someone you couldn't even imagine being an employee subject to minimum wage laws of the company in light of the overall relationship and often this will involve a business to business contract, rather than a business to a non\\-professional individual contract with only personal services involved.\n\nThere are some safe harbor provisions that if met can insure independent contract status, but it is very common for someone who legally is an employee to be misclassified as an independent contractor in an attempt (often futile if the matter is pressed by regulatory or tax officials) to avoid compliance with laws incident to the employment relationship.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Company X hires Sarah to work as a salesperson.

The key factors here are Sarah's classification (employee vs. independent contractor) and her specific role (inside vs. outside salesperson). \n\nIf Sarah is classified as an employee and works as an inside salesperson (e.g., in a retail store or call center), she would be covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and entitled to at least minimum wage.

Like if you burn your mom a CD. Or gift your girlfriend a mix tape. Or copy a page of the book and hand out the excercise to your two study buddies.\n\nSo there was a [court decision](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie#Anzahl_der_Kopien) that \"more than seven\" was more than what you would normally consider a private copy covered by this fee.

Even if you type it into an app, manually copying something into another medium is not lossless. Ever. It is also for your very personal use, you don't give it to anyone, not even close friends.\n\nSo yes, you can make as many copies as you like, for yourself. If one breaks, and you make another, that is fine. If one breaks every day and you need 700 over the course of two years? Fine. But if you made 700 exact copies to give them to your \"700 closest friends\", that is not how the law thinks \"closest friends\" work.

But when using Google Analytics configured in the way explained in my other post, the visitor is not tracked. At least not in a way which violates the GDPR.\n\nYou worry about the cookies. I also found [this article](https://www.humix.be/blog/configure-google-analytics-for-gdpr/) which also does and suggests to either:\n\n* change the `_ga` cookie to a session cookie, so it will be removed when the browser is closed. To do this, set the Cookie Expiration variable in your Google Analytics Settings to 0\\.\n* completely disable cookies. (GA does not require cookies). To do this, set the `storage` field to `none`:\n\n```\nga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', {\n  'storage': 'none'\n});\n\n```\n\nIf you do not disable cookies, cookies can be used for tracking, which is more general defined in the GDPR as profiling. Profiling is defined in [Art. 4 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) as:\n\n> \u2018profiling\u2019 means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;\n\n[Art. 22(1\\) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/) disallows profiling. Therefore in the settings menu from Google Analytics you have to disable data sharing and data collection.\n\nSo data will only be used for the analytics function. But because you have configured to Anonymize your visitors IP Address, the part of the IP address used for this, is no longer considered personal data. This is because approx. 250 other users share the same part of the ip address which is stored, so data is not distinguishable between those 250 users. \n\nThe anonymisation used by google is currently considered good enough. At least by the Dutch DPA. This might change if someone proves it is not good enough anonymized. \n\nNote that I am not a lawyer either, but I have read from multiple experts that analytics can be a \"legitimate interest\", the same way marketing can be a legitimate interest. This way configured the privacy impact is considered very low.\n\nIt is also very important to note that a [DPA](https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-6/) consideres GA Google Analytics compliant.

When someone borrows a car primarily for their own benefit, they owe a high standard of care to the lender. They are responsible for the car's upkeep and should return it in as close to its original condition as possible. If they fail to do so, they could be liable for providing a replacement car of equal value and condition or for fully restoring the borrowed car to its original state. This high standard of care means the borrower is responsible for all damage, not just major issues, and not just a percentage of the costs.

He immediately made a u\\-turn across a solid double yellow line and began following me with his lights on. Upon pulling me over the police officer immediately had an aggressive body language, manner of speech and eye contact. I had a 7 month old infant in the car and my wife, and I became nervous that he would further lose control of his emotions. He asked if I knew what speed I was going at the time that I was pulled over I said I couldn't recall what my exact speed was at the time he pulled me over. He then repeatedly asked said \"well that means you were either purposely driving over the speed limit or you were carelessly driving\". Not wanting to incriminate myself I kept repeating that I was not doing either of those things. He then said \"there are three options, I can take you to jail, write you a citation or give you a warning\".

Only a small minority of states actually do so.\n\nIncidentally, an attorney, such as a deputy district attorney, is not allowed to lie about the consequences of a traffic violation, or anything else (even in extreme circumstances like a hostage situation).

The original recording is not made\n> available to the public but transcripts are. When, where, and why is\n> this done?\n\nIn Colorado this is done in all limited jurisdiction court proceedings (i.e. the courts where misdemeanors and smaller money claims and evictions involving premises with fairly low rents are tried), and in most general jurisdiction court proceedings unless the parties pay for live transcription at their own expense. Transcripts are made when there is a sound recording only upon a request submitted to the court that then outsources the request to independent contractor transcriptionists.\n\nThis is a fairly recent development and there may be live stenographers (also known as court reporters) in some general jurisdiction courts still today in Colorado, but it is profoundly less expensive to tape record a hearing or trial and just transcribe them upon request at the expense of a party, than it is to have a live stenographer make a verbatim record of every hearing or trial. In limited jurisdiction courts typically only about one in a hundred cases is appealed, and in general jurisdiction courts typically about one in ten cases are appealed. The marginal cost of an audio recording that isn't transcribed, once the courtrooms are wired for sound, is negligible (perhaps $10 per day (or less) for storage media). The marginal costs of a live stenographer or transcriptionist per day is on the order of $240\\+, which adds up over the course of a year. In the limited jurisdiction court, live court reporting would cost about $24,000 per day of trial *in cases that are actually appealed* (since only about 1% of cases are appealed and those cases would have to bear the entire cost of the transcription system). In general jurisdiction courts, live court reporting would cost about $2,400 per day of trial *in cases that are actually appealed* (since only about 10% of cases are appealed and those cases would have to bear the entire cost of the transcription system).\n\nIn contrast, with sound recordings, the cost per day of trial actually appealed in limited jurisdiction courts would cost $1,240, and in general jurisdiction courts it would cost $340\\. These are judicial branch expenses small enough to be financed with court filing fees.\n\nDepositions prior to a trial are often handled by a live stenographer and sometimes handled by a videographer as well, but almost never conducted with sound only recordings in the absence of extreme circumstances like a blizzard that makes it impossible to secure the court reporter's attendance (in part because there is almost always a desire to have a transcript made and because the stenographer can confirm spellings and ambiguous sounding words with the deponents and counsel during breaks avoiding errors in the final product).\n\n> Are court proceedings ever filmed or otherwise visually recorded?\n\nDepositions and court proceedings are sometimes filmed. A video of a deposition can be presented to a judge or jury in lieu of testimony when the witness is not available or to impeach the testimony of the witness.\n\nIt is unusual in Colorado for court proceedings to be visually recorded. But, in Alaska, there is a state constitutional right to participate in most kinds of court proceedings and legislative hearings by video conference (because geographically, Alaska is about a third the size of the continental U.S. and thinly populated with large roadless areas), so I presume that in Alaska, court proceedings are routinely videotaped.\n\nSome courts in the U.S. do initial appearances and arraignments in many criminal cases by closed circuit television from the jail, before a judge in the court house, in order to reduce the need to transport prisoners from the jail to the court house for a perfunctory five minute hearing which is not evidentiary, and there may be video recordings of those proceedings as well.\n\nMany federal courts and some state courts do status conferences and similar minor procedural hearings by telephone conference call and those are usually audio recorded without a live court reporter.\n\nIn Colorado, all oral arguments in appeals (except those rare cases that are secret such as juvenile cases and rare cases involving the details of trade secrets) are live streamed and podcast over the Internet. Many other appellate courts (but not the U.S. Supreme Court) do this as well. But, transcripts of oral arguments at the appellate level are rarely considered in further appeals. The video (or in the case of U.S. Supreme Court hearings, previously transcripts only and now audio as well) are released for PR reasons and for public transparency, reflecting appellate court's role as law making institutions, not for the litigants themselves.\n\n> It seems that facial expression, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc.\n> are part of the body of evidence on which a judge or jury decides a\n> case. So is this type of record ever made available, and if so, when?\n\nA deposition or other videotape provided as evidence in a case at trial is part of the record on appeal that an appellate court may consider. And, a judge or jury may consider things like facial expressions, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc. in those cases.\n\nBut, video of the court proceeding itself is simply a basis for preparing a transcript that will become part of the court record. Appellate courts in common law systems are forbidden from considering things like facial expressions, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc. of witnesses testifying in a trial. This is part of the credibility evaluation function that is reserved entirely to the judge or jury who is the trier of fact in a case.\n\nThe only time a video of a trial court proceeding itself would be considered would be as evidence in a different trial arising out of events that took place in the courtroom itself.\n\nFor example, suppose that a court bailiff goes berserk and starts shooting jurors for no reason in the middle of a trial that was being videotaped. That videotape could be considered in a criminal trial of the court bailiff for assault with a deadly weapon or murder, or in a civil case brought by the jurors or their surviving next of kin, for battery or wrongful death. The appellate court of the criminal or civil trial of the bailiff could consider the videotape, but an appellate court considering an appeal of the proceeding that was being videotaped could not.\n\nThis is basically just a historical artifact. If videotape had been in existence at the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 CE, appellate courts in common law countries would no doubt have the right to review questions of both fact and law, rather than merely law as they do today.\n\nIn civil law countries, such as those of continental Europe, judges take notes regarding evidence, but there is no verbatim record of the proceedings and any assertion that the judge was mistaken about the facts is resolved by retrying the disputed facts over again in a second instance court proceeding, a process reflecting even more rudimentary court resources than those existing prior to tape and video recording were invented.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Colorado, which of the following statements about court recordings is most accurate?\n\nA) All court proceedings, regardless of jurisdiction, are recorded by live stenographers.\nB) Limited jurisdiction courts use sound recordings, while general jurisdiction courts always use live stenographers.\nC) Both limited and general jurisdiction courts primarily use sound recordings, with live stenographers used only when parties pay for it.\nD) Video recordings are routinely used in all court proceedings to capture facial expressions and body language.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

I don't know why they would, maybe they are angry at Alice for some other legal act and this is their way of bending the laws to punish Alice in some way, maybe someone is putting pressure on Alice as some political maneuver to pressure her important father into something, maybe some prosecutor is just really gung\\-ho in prosecuting crimes for some reason whatever...\n\n\\*Edit:\nLooking back at the law I linked I realized that the definition of illicit sexual encounter, when outside of US territories, is effectively defined as a commercial sexual act, which negates all my examples since no one was being payed. However, I'm not interested in the specific law so much as how any law making activities on foreign territory illegal would be applied to citizens, and only used this law because it was the only one I knew of to reliable reference. For now umm...just pretend that illicit sexual act part of the law was not limited only to commercial acts when answering this question? I think the heart of what I'm trying to understand wouldn't change if that law were slightly different and that's easier then my rewriting all of the above.\n\nps. A US citizen can travel to Angola and have sex with a 12 year old without any repercussion so long as he doesn't pay anyone if I'm reading the law right?

Also the definition of \"any person can be charged with a\n criminal offense\" seems extremely vague since it doesn't specify what country/state laws would apply for deciding if the person could be charged with a criminal offense, and I'm sure if you look far enough countries have outlawed all kind of things as sexual offenses, like being in the presence of a women who isn't wearing a hijab.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Ignorantia juris non excusat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorantia_juris_non_excusat)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can say I didn't know: it won't keep you out of jail.\n\nRather than delving into the specifics of your question, I will keep my answer general.

While price listings themselves are generally not subject to copyright protection (as per Circular 34 from the U.S. Copyright Office), this doesn't guarantee freedom from legal challenges. The documentation mentions that companies have attempted to use DMCA takedown notices for price lists in the past (e.g., Best Buy in 2006).

I spoke with multiple sources including lawyers and can't get a clear answer. The contractor claims they NEVER waive or modify the clause. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A contractor would agree because it basically it comes close to restating the state of the law in the absence of any agreement between the parties.\n\nSo contrary to the answer of ShazamoMorebucks it probably would be enforced. Sometimes contracts that waive liability that would otherwise exist in the absence of an agreement are viewed as objectionable. But, a requirement in a contract that simply places upon a party the liability that they would have in the absence of an agreement is usually enforced.\n\n> The Subcontractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless \\[the\n>  contractor] and the United States Government, and their respective\n>  officers, employees and agents (the \"Indemnities\"), from and against\n>  any and all liabilities, of whatsoever kind or nature, arising out of\n>  or in any way connected with the Subcontractor's performance under\n>  this Agreement, excepting only (i) liability arising from affirmative\n>  acts, done with intent to cause loss, damage or injury, by the\n>  Indemnities; (ii) liability arising from the sole negligence of the\n>  Indemnities; or (iii) any express liability as may be specified\n>  elsewhere in this Agreement.\n\nThe big limiting factor here is that the liability must arise out of or be connected with the Subcontractor's performance under the Agreement.\n\nUsually, if liability arises from the Subcontractor's performance, the Subcontractor would be, at least, jointly and severally liable for the liability in any case, where liability does not arise from the other party's intentional acts, or from the other party's sole negligence.\n\nLiability for defects in goods sold is generally a matter of strict liability. \n\nIf the Subcontractor did defective work, and the general contractor simply purchased that work and did nothing else to contribute to the liability, why should it be on the hook?\n\nThe only case where this may modify the default rule is when both the subcontractor and the general contractor are at fault. For example, maybe the subcontractor made a defective good but the defect was so obvious that the general contractor should have noticed a returned the goods before using them in a larger project. This puts full liability on the subcontractor, even when the general contractor is also negligent.\n\nBut, in practice, the general contractor will still be on the hook for most of the liability that the general contractor is forced to pay, because the subcontractor will generally be almost judgment proof and will go bankrupt before it pays a small portion of the amount that it owes to the general contractor in the event of the subcontractor's fault giving rise to a major liability (e.g. if goods it supplied caused a multi\\-million dollar project to have to be done over from scratch).\n\nAlso, subcontractors routinely can and do insure against this risk and figure the cost of the insurance into their prices.

The indemnity clause largely reflects the subcontractor's default legal responsibilities. In most cases, if liability arises from the subcontractor's work, they would already be liable under normal legal principles, except when the other parties are solely at fault. The clause mainly formalizes this arrangement, with the potential exception of cases where both parties are at fault. While the clause may seem broad, it aligns closely with existing legal standards for liability. Businesses might agree to this because it doesn't significantly alter their risk profile beyond what would exist without the clause, and the opportunity for government contract work often outweighs the perceived additional risk.

Both the harmful and offensive contact varieties of battery require a bad intent: \u00a713 \"An actor is subject to liability to another for battery if (a) he acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact...\", and per \u00a716, \"If an act is done with the intention of inflicting upon another an offensive but not a harmful bodily contact...the actor is liable to the other for a battery although the act was not done with the intention of bringing about the resulting bodily harm\". \u00a718 Battery: Offensive Contact says more or less the same thing with \"offensive\" inserted.

The problem is, the description of the interest in freedom from harmful bodily contact only protects against the interest w.r.t. intentional contact, so where does the protection of that interest come from in terms of *unintentional* contact. Specifically: is there a general rule that every protection against an intentional invasion of interest entails a protection against *unintentional* invasion of that interest? (I assume the \"duty\" is a generic and universal one).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is generic negligence. In most United States jurisdictions, Negligence is a tort requiring (1\\) duty, (2\\) breach of that duty, (3\\) but\\-for and proximate causation, and (4\\) harm. In most human interaction, one person has a duty to act as a reasonable person to avoid harming another person. So if you do something a reasonable person would not do, and that causes harm, you can be liable for the resulting harm. The reason for this is that you have the ability to control your activity, and you should be willing to engage in reasonable activities without risking civil liability. Thus it discourages unreasonable behavior if you have to pay for the harm that results from your lack of reasonable care.\n\nBecause negligence requires breach of duty under a reasonable person standard rather than requiring intent, it necessarily creates a sphere of protection around the invasion of interests recognized by intentional torts that also have harm as an element.

We told him that we are 15, and he said that we needed a parent with us, so we ran back to the car and had my friend's dad come back with us and they said he needed to be in the theater with us.

When you are in a movie theater you have what is called a \"license\" from the theater to be present, which is revocable at will without due process (possibly subject to breach of contract damages) and not a property right to be in the theater the way that a tenant who must be evicted does.\n\nAs a practical matter, given that the amount in controversy is, at most, $25 or so, and this is not a situation where the prevailing party would get their attorneys' fees, this is not cost effective to litigate, regardless of who is correct, even in small claims court without an attorney.\n\nWhether or not the theater breached its contract isn't perfectly clear, because usually, the contract between a movie goer and a movie theater is not spelled out in any writing provided to the movie goer, incorporated by reference in something disclosed to the movie goer, or signed by either of the parties, or even with an oral offer and acceptance setting forth all of the terms of the agreement. (Of course, if a written terms of service is actually provided to the movie goer, or a reference to where it can be found is provided to the movie goer, those terms will control and the contract will almost certainly be written to allow the movie theater to do what it did in this case.) In the frequent case where this is not done, the contract between a movie goer an a movie theater is usually a contract implied in fact whose terms at the edges aren't terribly well defined and there is little case law to tell us what the terms of the contract is, because the cases aren't worth litigating up to an appellate court where binding precedents are made.\n\nIndeed, one reason that movie theaters may have declined to put their implied in fact contracts with movie goers in writing is to leave the situation ambiguous so as to discourage someone whose case would be clear even if for a small dollar amount, if the terms of the contact were clear, from suing them over issues like this one. When the stakes are small and the outcome is always uncertain, it almost never makes sense to sue.\n\nThere is certainly a colorable argument that you breached the contract by being present without an adult at an R\\-rating movie when the public statements about an R rating made available to the movie goers says that rated R means only admitted with a person over the age of 17, contrary to the theater's policies on that issue, although it isn't perfectly clear if this is a suggestion or a binding term of the agreement.\n\nAnother fair interpretation of the contract between a movie goer and the movie theater is that a movie goer can be removed from any movie whenever, if in the reasonable opinion of the movie theater management, good cause exists to do so, and that its discretion should be upheld so long as it acts in good faith and in a non\\-discriminatory manner.\n\nI don't agree, however, that the question of whether or not you breached a contract was unambiguously clear, because the terms of the agreement are not well defined.

The theater's actions were not criminal, as they have the right to revoke a patron's \"license\" to be present at will.\n\n2.

I am wondering if this is permitted because these casinos are constructed within the sovereign territory of tribal nations within states, or, if it is because that ruling itself loosened regulations for all gaming institutions, Native or not. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The two general federal restrictions on gambling are in [18 USC ch. 50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-50), against off\\-shore gambling ships, and wire communication for transmitting information that assists interstate / international gambling on sporting events and competitions. Interstate lotteries are legal and internet sales of lottery tickets is legal (until Congress or SCOTUS says otherwise). These laws have the usual commerce clause justificational language.\n\nIn addition, the [Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-120/pdf/STATUTE-120-Pg1884.pdf) says that you can't use the internet to engage in otherwise\\-illegal gambling, so if your state prohibits lotteries or bingo, you can't use the internet to gamble (in\\-state or across state/tribal lines). The definitions section ([31 USC 5362(10\\)(C)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5362)) narrows the term \"unlawful Internet gambling\" so that an online wager is legal if made exclusively within or between the land of one or more tribes, and follows applicable Indian gaming regulations, see below.\n\nGambling on tribal land is covered by [25 USC ch. 29](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-29) which was passed in response to California v. the Cabazon, and there are three classes of gambling. Traditional and social games with minimal reward are unrestricted; bingo, cards (not games where you play against \"the house\") and other stuff is class II which requires tribal approval etc. The broader 3rd class requires a compact to be negotiated between the state in which the venue is located and the tribe. Section [2710(d)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/2710) address the most stringent (and most generally\\-relevant) restrictions. The federal \"take\" on these matters is mediated via the Indian Gaming Commission under Interior (and not, for example, the DOJ), and 2 of the 3 commisioners must be registered tribe members. The law is framed in terms of location on tribal land which is \"within the reservation\" or \"on tribal trust land\", thus an operation owned by a tribe but located on other land is not covered by this act (and would be covered by the relevant state law).\n\nNo specific law is required to permit anything pertaining to gambling, instead a specific law would be necessary to prohibit it. The federal government prohibits very little, leaving that to the states. A state has authority to regulate gambling, but it has no authority to regulate gambling on tribal land, unless Congress gives it such authority (and Congress has not). The Indian Gaming Commission has (apparently) not issued any general regulations to the effect that a casino must disallow out\\-of\\-state gamblers or anything to that effect, although it might technically have the authority to do so.

Monthly **Salary**, by definition, is paid regardless of hours. Your contract doesn't give hours, it just gives a monthly total. That's a contract, and you should be paid according to the contract.

If you did, the first month would be a contract violation, and the second would be a violation of wage \\& labor law. A company can't pay you salary as an exempt (exempt from hourly wage laws, like management) employee and also dock you pay according to hours worked.\n\nSo what can you do? If you are still a contractor and actually want the job, not much more than arguing with payroll. Since you (why?) decided to be a contractor instead of a direct hire, you have exactly zero protections to getting let go.

The employer is committing wage theft by not paying the agreed-upon salary. A salary, by definition, is a fixed amount paid regardless of hours worked. The offer letter specifies an annual salary without mentioning hour requirements, which creates a contract. Docking pay for weeks under 40 hours while not compensating for weeks over 40 hours is inconsistent and likely illegal, especially if the employee has become a direct hire.

The organizer, who provided the original stone, retains ownership of the physical object (the statue) and can sell it or dispose of it as they see fit. However, copyright law typically grants joint ownership of the artistic creation to all contributors. In this case, each participant who struck the stone contributed to the artistic expression, giving them a share in the copyright.

But that does not, in general, prevent the government from nationalizing a good or service and making it an exclusively governmental function. The Postal Service is a governmental entity and/or regulated utility, so this would seem to be proper.\n\nIn the same vein, across Continental Europe, notaries public have transferrable, non\\-exclusive license to a particular territory in the country (that can be bought and sold between licensed notaries) and only a small number are allowed in any jurisdiction. Anyone who wants to do business transactions that require notaries must deal with one of them and in low population areas there may well be a monopoly.\n\nAnti\\-trust law is generally directed at preventing unregulated anti\\-competitive conduct by private firms.\n\nAlso, as noted in the original question, the use of means other than mail to cancel contracts isn't mandated, it is a choice of the parties in the context of laws that allow for alternatives. And, while the statutes disfavor electronic communications, the statutes do not, as a comment notes, state that contracts may not be terminated by a letter delivered by hand, signed in person and in presence, or delivered by another carrier providing traceability. The government post office means is presumably less expensive than a private courier providing hand delivery, but termination by hand delivery or courier of a signed dead tree paper letter appears to be allowed to cancel a contract without counter\\-party consent. So, it isn't a true monopoly.\n\nIn the same vein, the law does not mandate that apartment leases require payment of a security deposit, but the prevailing legal rules create an incentive that makes this practice very widespread.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to European anti-monopoly law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the French government's role in contract cancellation practices?\n\nA) The French government's encouragement of postal cancellations is a clear violation of EU anti-monopoly laws and should be immediately challenged.\n\nB) While the practice may seem unfair, governments are generally allowed to award monopolies or create regulated utilities, which are not typically subject to anti-trust liability.\n\nC) The practice is illegal because it forces consumers to use only one method of contract cancellation, violating EU principles of free market competition.\n\nD) EU anti-monopoly laws strictly prohibit any government involvement in market practices, including postal services for contract cancellations.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the information provided explains that governments are generally allowed to award monopolies or create regulated utilities, which are not typically subject to anti-trust liability.

Sales representatives are specifically mentioned as an example of workers who are typically not considered independent contractors.\n\nAs an employee, the individual would be entitled to at least minimum wage for hours worked, regardless of commission earnings.

And of an authority that recognizes and enforces such.\n\nHistorically, debtor\u2019s prisons with penal labor effectively enabled that in most countries, and which is still the practice in some.\n\nThe clearest rationale for the existence of such a right is in any country with a formal security classification system. A person holding a security clearance becomes subject to certain limits on their future actions, beyond that of that of the regular citizenry, which they cannot unilaterally remove even after leaving the position that required it. This appears to be quite close to contracting oneself into an indefinite, limited, servitude.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **NO** (mostly).\n\nServitude means that the employer, or owner of the indenture, or whatever, can use physical force to make the indentee carry out the work given. If the indentee runs away they can be arrested and forcibly returned.\n\nThis is distinct from the law of contracts. If Alice agrees to provide labour for Bob and subsequently fails to fulfil the contract then Alice may have to pay damages, but that is all.

It distinguishes between contract law, where breaches result in damages but not forced labor, and servitude, where physical force could be used to compel work. The key exception noted is military service, which is described as an \"indenture-style contract\" where desertion is a crime, but this is specifically authorized by government law rather than being a private arrangement. While other examples like security clearances are mentioned, they are not classified as true servitude contracts.

While the Fair Housing Act generally prohibits discrimination based on religion in housing, there are certain exemptions and justifications possible. In this case, the religious organization's practice would likely have a disparate impact on religious groups. However, they may be able to justify this practice if they can prove it serves a substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest (such as fostering a specific educational environment) and that this interest cannot be achieved through less discriminatory means.
