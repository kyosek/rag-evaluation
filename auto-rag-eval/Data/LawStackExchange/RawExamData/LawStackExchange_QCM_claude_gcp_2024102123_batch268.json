We both get a 50% share. All assets have been disposed of and now there is nothing but cash left. Tax returns were filed long ago and likely all expenses have been paid.\n\nThe attorney for the estate does not communicate with me. I think they are stalling to try and get me to accept a smaller settlement to make the ordeal end. Is there any statute in NJ that says how long an estate can go on when there's only cash left, or can they wait me out as long as they like, or wait for me to take legal action?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here's an article on [LegalZoom](http://info.legalzoom.com/long-new-jersey-inheritance-settlement-22499.html) that outlines the minimum time necessary (they say 9 months). Creditors, for example, get 6 months in which to make their claims against the estate and the executor has 3 months to make a decision to dispute a claim. Disputing a claim will extend the time necessary to process the creditor's claims.\n\nAn estate subject to federal estate taxes (valued over $5\\.45 million) can take much longer \\- up to a year after the April following the year of death (based on when an estate tax return is due and how long the IRS is taking to issue a final letter).\n\nFrom this [NoLo](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/new-jersey-estatetax.html) article you can see that NJ estate tax returns are due 9\\-10 months after death and then one has to wait for the state to issue its tax waivers.\n\nHere's another [article](http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2010/08/beneficiaries_have_the_right_t.html) that describes the typical time it takes to process an estate (average of 1 to 2 years) along with the types of issues that can extend the time. It also lists the process beneficiaries can follow in order to get the current status and perhaps nudge things along.\n\nThe executor is required to provide an accounting of the estate to the beneficiaries and will have to provide a final accounting to the probate court before final distribution.

This timeframe accounts for the 6-month period creditors have to make claims against the estate, plus 3 months for the executor to decide on disputing claims. The process can be extended by several factors:\n\n1. Federal estate taxes for estates valued over $5.45 million can extend the process up to a year after the April following the year of death.\n2. New Jersey estate tax returns are due 9-10 months after death, and then there's additional waiting time for the state to issue tax waivers.\n3. The average time to process an estate is 1 to 2 years, depending on various issues that may arise.\n4. The executor must provide an accounting of the estate to beneficiaries and the probate court, which can also add time to the process.\n\nWhile options A, B, and D contain elements that can affect the timeline, they do not accurately represent the minimum time frame and the primary factors that can extend the process as described in the documentation."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59999/can-i-copy-pieces-of-apache-licensed-source-code-if-i-attribute", "docs_id": 59999, "title": "Can I copy pieces of Apache-Licensed source code if I attribute?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that there is a library (Lib A) licensed under Apache 2\\.0\n\nCan a develop\\[er wishing to create a new library (lib B) take pieces of the source code from Lib A and put it into the source for Lib B as it is being written, provided that proper credit is given?\n\nCan a developer instead create a modified version of Lib A (say Lib C).

Would it be different if they were going through their own territory, or a third country's, with permission? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a hard question, but a good question. The following relates to the issue from the perspective of the USA.\n\nYou ask \"...if the US wants to invade France, **can** they officially declare war by...\", You have to make clear what you mean by \"can\". If you mean whether or not the US has the physical ability to do this, then of course they do. If you mean whether they are allowed, then this is another question. When you ask whether something is allowed, then you have to make reference to a moral code or a law that determines what is and what isn't allowed (legal). Normally each country will have laws that govern what is and what isn't legal for it's citizens to do. That hard part is how this applies to nations. There are two sides to the question. (1\\) What are the leaders allowed to do under their own laws, (the domestic laws) (2\\) what are countries as entities allowed to do? (the international laws) It sounds a bit like you are asking about the second thing. Here treaties govern what is and what isn't \"legal\". However, usually when someone breaks a law, other entities have the power to enforce that law and decide (judge) whether the person has broken the law. The question is: who decides whether a country has broken a treaty or an international law? And if a law is broken, what exactly can be done about it? This is hard to answer. \n\nConsider for example the conflict in Ukraine. Here many will argue that Russia has piratically invaded Ukraine. There should be war between the nations. But Russia denies this and other world powers have done little beyond imposing sanctions. This illustrates how hard it is to deal with this question.\n\nOne question that comes up is what the purpose of international treaties are if a country can just violate them without much consequence. Pointing out two points about this. (1\\) If, for example, a president wants to convince his/her own congress that the country *should* engage in war, then it makes a stronger point if you can show how the country you want to engage has violated international trities. (2\\) After you have won a war, you might want to prosecute the leaders of the loosing power. Here you will stand stronger if you can make references to some international law that existed before the conflict started. This second point is illustrated in the [Nuremberg principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_principles). Here it was exactly stated that \"*Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment.*\"\n\n[According to the US constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States) \"Congress shall have power to ... declare War\". That means that historically Congress has the power to decide where to wage war. The [War Powers Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution) says, for example, that \"[The President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities ...](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1542)\".\n\nNote that this doesn't mean that the US has do formally declare war before going to war. Example: [The Iraq War was authorized by Congress, but there never was a formal declaration of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States#Military_engagements_authorized_by_Congress). \n\nIt is interesting that you ask about the timing for when the declaration should be given. The Japanese wanted to [deliver their declaration of war just before](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/world-war-ii/resources/japan-declares-war-1941) the attack on Pearl Harbor. But because of issues with decrypting the message from Japan to the Japanese Embassy, the [declaration wasn't delivered until after the attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_declaration_of_war_on_the_United_States_and_the_British_Empire). \n\nRemember also in all of this that the winning party to a conflict, usually decides what was and wasn't legal!\n\nOne good reference for more on all of this is the report by the Congressional Research Service called \"*[Declarations of War and Authorizations for the Use of Military Force: Historical Background and Legal Implications](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf)*\". Here you can see more on what I have tried (and failed?) to say above."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to the documentation, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the relationship between formal declarations of war and the legality of military actions under U.S. and international law?\n\nA) The U.S. Constitution requires Congress to formally declare war before any military action can be taken.\n\nB) International law strictly prohibits any military action without a formal declaration of war.\n\nC) The U.S. can engage in military actions without a formal declaration of war, but such actions must be authorized by Congress.\n\nD) The President has unlimited authority to engage in military actions without Congressional approval or formal declarations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Presidential pardons can only be applied to past actions, not future ones. Even if a president makes statements encouraging certain behavior, these cannot be considered pardons for actions that have not yet occurred.

Parents also have some level of control over their children spending their own money (not the topic of discussion here).\n\nMy question is: given that once minor children receive a special gift it is theirs and the parents cannot take it, can parents legally *prevent* their minor children from receiving gifts in the first place?\n\nLet's say Grandma wants to give $10,000 to Junior. Could the parents say \u201cNo, Mom. Either give the money to us and we will administer it, or Junior can\u2019t accept the gift at all.\u201d? This is not taking what Junior owns, it's preventing him from owning it in the first place.\n\nIf such prevention can be legally done beforehand, then consider further if the gift has already been accomplished. Perhaps Grandma has *already* placed one hundred crisp 100\\-dollar bills into Junior's hands (or, say she deposits money into his custodial bank account before the parents learn of it). He runs to Mom and displays the cash/balance slip saying, \"look what Grandma gave me!\" Has the gift been irrevocably given at that point, or can the parents require it to be returned or set conditions on the gift at that point, given this is happening the moment they learn of the gift and immediately after the giving?\n\nIf they cannot prevent the ownership against the child's wishes at this point, what if the parents convince the child to give the money back or give the money to them (perhaps operating under a mistaken belief about what is legal, knowingly or unknowingly communicating falsehoods about the situation to their child)? Could the child or the gift\\-giver later claim that the parents stole the money because the child didn't understand his rights at the time? It seems like if the law considers a child competent to receive and own gifted property, the child is competent to also give away such property, and if a child could legally refuse Grandma's gift in the first place (even if foolishly) then he can also give away Grandma's gift after its receipt (even if foolishly).\n\nFocusing more closely on the quoted cases in the original question, one part may be relevant: in [HOBLYN vs. JOHNSON, 2002](https://law.justia.com/cases/wyoming/supreme-court/2002/434232.html) as recorded at law.justia.co (emphasis mine):\n\n> \"As a general rule any property acquired by the child in any way except by its own labor or services belongs to the child, and not to the parent.\" \\[46 C. C. 1314]. . . . It furthermore goes without saying that a parent cannot deprive a child of its property except pursuant to law (31 C. J. 1011\\), and the fact that in this instance the father had the property in question assessed as his property could not affect the title of the children. In Banks v. Conant, 14 Allen (Mass.) 497, it was said: \"In consideration of the duty which the law imposes on a father to furnish adequate support to his child during infancy, the services of the child during that period are due to the father, and, if they are rendered to a third person, the right of the father to recover the value thereof is clear and indisputable. But this is the extent of the father's right. He has no title to the property of the child, **nor is the capacity or right of the latter to take property or receive money by grant, gift or otherwise, except as a compensation for services, in any degree qualified or limited during minority.** Whatever therefore an infant acquires which does not come to him as a compensation for services rendered, belongs absolutely to him, and his father cannot interpose any claim to it, either as against the child, or as against third persons who claim title or possession from or under the infant.\"\n\nRephrasing this more directly, \"the right of the child to receive property by gift is not limited or qualified in any degree during minority.\"\n\nThis would seem to *suggest* that parents may not interfere with gift giving to their children, however it is not clear. Does \"the right to take property or receive money is not limited\" assert that children must be allowed to receive *any* gift at all? Or is this only recognizing that, once given (a process that the parents might legally prevent, but did not), the parents cannot then take the gift after its receipt?\n\nImagine the parents believe all dancing is wrong, and a friend of the child gives him a book on how to breakdance.

For a novel this would mean the right to read it aloud, possibly not of much value. For a musical or dramatic work, this might be of significant value.\n\nUnder [17 USC 203](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#203) a US author has the right to cancel all previous licenses and transfers at any time during a period lasting 5 years, and starting 35 years from the granting of the license, or 35 years from initial publication under the license.\n\n17 USC 293 (b) provides that:\n\n> (b) Effect of Termination.\u2014Upon the effective date of termination, all rights under this title that were covered by the terminated grants revert to the author, authors, and other persons owning termination interests under clauses (1\\) and (2\\) of subsection (a), including those owners who did not join in signing the notice of termination under clause (4\\) of subsection (a), but with the following limitations:\n\nSubsection (b)(4\\) providfes that:\n\n> A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any right covered by a terminated grant is valid **only** if it is made **after** the effective date of the termination.

Option A is incorrect because the exclusive rights granted likely prevent the author from creating derivative works. Option B is incorrect as there's no indication of an at-will termination clause. Option D is incorrect because the agreement covers \"all languages throughout the world.\"\n\nThe correct answer is C. Under 17 USC 203, a US author has the right to terminate transfers and licenses starting 35 years after the grant, with a 5-year window to do so. This provision allows authors to reclaim their rights after a significant period, even if the original agreement didn't include termination clauses.

According to Oregon law (ORS 254.470(6)(a)), voters must mark their own ballots, sign the return identification envelope, and comply with provided instructions. Having someone else mark the ballot is illegal unless the voter has a physical disability or inability to read/write, and even then, specific procedures must be followed. \n\nA is incorrect because it's not just the signing that matters; the act of having someone else mark the ballot is illegal.\n\nB is incorrect because Jane's voting eligibility is irrelevant; it's illegal for her to mark John's ballot regardless of her status.\n\nD is incorrect in this scenario because John's reason for having Jane fill out the ballot is not due to a physical disability, but rather his lack of interest in voting. If John did have a physical disability, there are legal ways to receive assistance, but it would involve two people of different parties or someone of John's choosing, not just handing the ballot to a friend.\n\nFurthermore, this action could potentially be considered perjury if the return envelope includes a statement that the voter filled out the ballot themselves, which would be a class C felony under ORS 260.715(1)."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5597/will-those-in-uk-who-have-had-court-fees-charged-to-them-now-get-it-back", "docs_id": 5597, "title": "Will those in UK who have had court fees charged to them, now get it back?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The UK government is going to stop the payment of Criminal Court Charges for those tried in court.

The Department of Housing and Urban\n> Development (HUD) has published regulations and additional guidance\n> detailing these statutory requirements.\n\nThe occupancy limitations are not clear cut under federal law, however, and [arguably apply only in the case of families with push up against occupancy limits because they have many children](http://www.fhcwm.org/uploads/files/Occupancy%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Final.pdf):\n\n> What is considered a reasonable occupancy standard?

Do all four get convicted (i.e. three innocent people are convicted) or all four get released (i.e. one guilty person goes free)?\n\nI feel like this must have happened in the past, but I'm unable to find any Google results for this. The closest is the [Prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma), which implies that all four are convicted on a lesser charge. However, the Prisoner's dilemma is a thought experiment in game theory so I am not sure if it is legally correct.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Unless there is enough evidence to convict one or more of the suspects, none will be convicted. In general the argument:\n\n> We know it must be one of you, but we don't know whch, so we find you all guilty.\n\nis not allowed in any non\\-dictatorial jurisdiction.\n\nJust how much evidence is needed for a conviction varies by jurisdiction in theory, and by judge or jury in practice.\n\nAlso, it would be possible to charge several of the residents with having acted jointly in the crime, but there would still need to be sufficient evidence against each defendant to obtain a conviction."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal case where an incendiary device was thrown from one house to another, causing a fire, there are four suspects who were present in the house at the time. All four deny involvement, and there's not enough evidence to pin the crime on any single individual. However, it's certain that one of the four is guilty. What is the most likely legal outcome in this situation?\n\nA) All four suspects will be convicted of the crime to ensure the guilty party is punished.\nB) The case will be dismissed due to lack of evidence against any specific individual.\nC) All four suspects will be convicted of a lesser charge as per the Prisoner's Dilemma concept.\nD) The four suspects will be held jointly liable for the crime and share the punishment equally.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the legal principle described in the documentation, unless there is sufficient evidence to convict a specific individual or individuals, no one will be convicted. The legal system generally does not allow for convicting a group of people just because one of them must be guilty. The standard of proof in criminal cases (typically \"beyond reasonable doubt\") must be met for each defendant individually. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they violate this principle of individual culpability and the requirement for sufficient evidence against each defendant.

Presumably the only test of such actions would be for someone to get arrested for violating the \"lockdown\".\n\nOn their face, these actions seem to be extra\\-judicial since in many cases the police are not acting under the penumbra of law, but are essentially creating martial law with no authority.\n\nAnother issue is that such actions could be construed as violating the First Ammendment's guarantee of the right of assembly. [A long essay on a Constitutional law web site discussed some of the issues](http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/curfews-loitering-freedom-of-association/) with regards to curfews.\n\nHave these police lockdowns been challenged in court or been declared unconsitutional by a court?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This speaks specifically to roadblocks, as I am unsure about such \"lockdowns,\" especially when considered in various contexts such as active shooters, terror attacks, etc. \n\nPolice usually need at least *reasonable suspicion* that a law has been violated in order to pull a driver over. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that sometimes there are *special law enforcement needs.* When those needs are present, the Supreme Court has approved of police setting up roadblocks to stop drivers without the police having any suspicion that that drive had violated a law. \n\nThere are two things that must be true for any given roadblock to be deemed appropriate. First, it must stop vehicles on a *neutral, articulable standard*. (An example is: \"all cars\"). Second, the roadblock must be *designed to serve the police officers' efforts closely related to a particular problem regarding vehicles and their mobility.* \n\nA roadblock to test for drunk drivers: valid due to the extent of the problem of drunk drivers. \n\nA roadblock to search cars for illegal drugs: invalid because its only purpose is to detect evidence of a regular crime (in other words, it has nothing to do with driving).\n\n**Addendum to address fixed checkpoints based on comment:**\n\nI came back to this and wanted to expand on the fixed checkpoints, which are checkpoints run by the border patrol inside of the US border. Crossing the checkpoint, a vehicles slow down and officials peer inside. Vehicles may or may not be asked to stop. \n\nBorder officials may operate such checkpoints in order to look inside of crossing vehicles and they may do so [*without a reasonable suspicion*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/428/543/) that the car includes illegal aliens. They also do not have to be approved in advance, so there is [no prior evidence\\-gathering needed](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/387/523/case.html) to put one up. Further, officials can point a car to a secondary pull\\-off location for limited inquiry, also without a reasonable suspicion. It does not require the higher standard because the nature of the secondary pull\\-off search is not as intrusive as that of a roving stop (where the official is part of a roving patrol and may stop vehicles *but does require a reasonable suspicion.*). This decision was justified because of the fact that the nature of smuggling makes finding a \"reasonable suspicion\" standard impractical while not being a great intrusion on Fourth Amendment rights."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A city police department sets up a roadblock to search vehicles for illegal weapons following a recent surge in gun violence.

While this roadblock might meet the first criterion if it stops all vehicles, it fails the second. Searching for illegal weapons is primarily aimed at detecting evidence of a regular crime, unrelated to driving or vehicle mobility. This is similar to the example given of an invalid roadblock to search for illegal drugs.

The correct answer, C, reflects this nuanced reality - electronic submissions may be allowed, but the IRS can set specific requirements. \n\nA is incorrect because while the eSign Act does provide legal validity to electronic signatures, it doesn't mandate acceptance of any format. B is too extreme, contradicting the eSign Act's provisions. D introduces a non-existent follow-up requirement.

The materials were discovered while a potential buyer was touring his house. \n\nAlthough I vehemently condemn the KKK, doesn't this officer have the right to display whatever he wants in his home so long as it doesn't actively and deliberately call for violence? Aren't these articles protected under the first amendment? I realize this is an extreme example, and as a police officer his job requires interacting with all races, but unless it can be shown that he's bigoted and that it negatively affected his job performance, isn't it illegal to fire him? \n\nEmployers can restrict speech according to company policy while at work, but we all have to go home at some point. Can those restrictions follow us after clocking out? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [In general, employers in the United States are free to fire you for your speech.](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/28831/37) The First Amendment does not apply to anyone except the government (other than a narrow set of circumstances where private parties act on behalf of the government or take on government roles, like when private universities employ campus police). If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question \\-\\- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" That\u2019s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off\\-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government *is* involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In [*Pickering v. Board of Education*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/391/563/), the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. *Pickering* imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see [*Pappas v. Giuliani*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1355900.html), where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off\\-duty time.\n\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job *requires* maintaining good relations with the community. In *Pappas*, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A police officer in a public department is found to have KKK materials displayed in his home, which becomes public knowledge.

In cases involving government employees and their speech, the Pickering balancing test applies. This test, established by the Supreme Court, requires weighing the employee's First Amendment rights against the government's interest in efficient operation. For police departments, maintaining public trust and confidence is a significant consideration. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because government employees' speech rights are not absolute and can be limited in certain circumstances.\n\nAnswer B is too narrow. While job performance is relevant, courts have recognized that public perception and community relations are also legitimate concerns, especially for police departments.\n\nAnswer C correctly identifies the Pickering balancing test as the appropriate framework for analyzing this situation.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it oversimplifies the issue.

The government can no more prohibit you from displaying its seals for expressive purposes than it can prohibit you from displaying its flag.\n\nThe questions raised about possible trademark violations and implied endorsement are red herrings.

[*In re City of Houston*, 731 F.3d 1326, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013\\)](https://casetext.com/case/in-re-city-of-hous) (\"As the nature of the mark is not disputed in this appeal \u2014 Houston admits that its city seal is an insignia under \u00a7 2(b) of the Lanham Act \u2014 the Board properly affirmed the examining attorney's refusal to register Houston's city seal.\")\n\nEven if the seal were a protected trademark, the context of its use \\-\\- in an editorial setting rather than for commercial purposes \\-\\- is protected by the First Amendment. For instance, in [*Renna v. Cty. of Union, N.J.*, 88 F. Supp. 3d 310, 323 (D.N.J. 2014\\)](https://casetext.com/case/renna-v-cnty-of-union-6), a county tried to stop a television host from using its seal in advertisements for a show about community affairs. The court noted first that the seal was not protected by trademark law, and that even if it was, the county's efforts to limit the host's expression would run afoul of the First Amendment:\n\n> Consider that the First Amendment prohibits a State from criminalizing the desecration of the United States flag as a form of political protest. ... Should a county, by means of an artful extension of trademark law, be permitted to quash political expression that uses its Seal? I think such an extension would be both unwarranted and Constitutionally risky.\n\nThe same is true of implied endorsements. The First Amendment does not permit the government to limit your expression because it thinks people might mistake it for government speech.\n\nFor instance, [*Rothamel v. Fluvanna Cty.*, 810 F. Supp. 2d 771 (W.D. Va. 2011\\)](https://casetext.com/case/rothamel-v-fluvanna-county), a county government adopted a law \"prohibiting the display of the Fluvanna County seal unless expressly authorized by the Fluvanna County Board of Supervisors.\" The law was prompted by concerns about a blogger who had been using the county's seal in stories about county government, and there were reports that some people thought the seal indicated that the stories were official county publications. When a blogger challenged the law, the federal court entered a permanent injunction against enforcing it:\n\n> The County takes the position that the showing of the seal by private citizens is not a form of expression at all; rather, the seal is government property, like a government vehicle or other form of personal property. ... While the County is correct that Rothamel does not have the right to take possession of a physical seal owned by the County, the County cannot control all privately\\-owned images or representations of the seal simply by declaring an interest in managing its own property.

I've actually  [answered this exact question](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56796/3209) from a pure US point of view, but your EU reference does throw a wrench into that analysis. Briefly summarizing my answer, *Kirtsaeng* does indeed shield the importer from liability under US law.\n\nHowever, here the book is being imported into Poland and so the transaction may not necessarily be legitimate under Polish/EU copyright law. You are correct in assuming that EU first sale doctrine is not as generous as the US counterpart. Per *[Infosoc (Copyright) Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32001L0029&from=EN)* Article 4(2\\), first sale doctrine is only triggered in the EU on first sale within its territory, unlike the US where the doctrine is triggered on first global sale. Therefore, under Article 4(1\\), the distribution rights of importing a book into Poland from outside the EU remains with the copyright holder.\n\nEdit: Though the transaction might itself be illegal from Amazon's perspective, being a commercial violation of distribution rights, even if you're considered the importer, there's a chance you are yourself not in violation of copyright law. EU law allows countries to implement personal use exceptions (Article 5(2\\)(a), Article 5(4\\)). From what I recall, most of continental Europe does indeed implement some form of personal use exception, though details vary by country. I've run out of time for now, but I'll probably later research Polish specific law here (though I don't know the language, so no idea how far I'll get).\n\nNow the reason I said there was some guesswork, is that there are details you wouldn't necessarily be aware of that would make this legal, and Amazon as a large enterprise would generally take into account legal considerations. Just because the book says unauthorized for distribution outside India, doesn't mean the publisher / copyright holder didn't later make separate contractual relations with Amazon to allow it.

The EU has different regulations regarding first sale doctrine.\n\nOption B is the most accurate.

[RCW 9A.56\\.110](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.110) defines \"extortion\" as\n\n> knowingly to obtain or attempt to obtain by threat property or\n>  services of the owner, and specifically includes sexual favors\n\nand second\\-degree extortion relates to the nature of the threat \u2013 it includes \"To reveal any information sought to be concealed by the person threatened\". However, the prosecution would have to establish that B attempted to obtain something from A, which would presumably be the continuation of the relationship.\n\nUnder the comment\\-modified scenario where the spouse knows of the relationship, the threat would be to reveal whatever the criminal activity is that the A's are engaged in. In that case, there is a potential defense under [RCW 9A.56\\.130(2\\)](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.130):\n\n> In any prosecution under this section based on a threat to accuse any\n>  person of a crime or cause criminal charges to be instituted against\n>  any person, it is a defense that the actor reasonably believed the\n>  threatened criminal charge to be true and that his or her sole purpose\n>  was to compel or induce the person threatened to take reasonable\n>  action to make good the wrong which was the subject of such threatened\n>  criminal charge.\n\nThe question then would be, how believable it would be that B's action was solely an attempt to get A to stop their criminal behavior? There is a path leading to a criminal conviction, but whether B is taken down that path depends on a lot of facts (and impressions) to be established at trial. Since A's spouse seems to know about the relationship and is unaffected by the information, giving over the thumb drive would not have any of the consequences outlined under the definition of \"threat\" in the law, such as revealing secrets, or harming a relationship. \n\n\"Threat\" is defined ([RCW 9A.04\\.110(27\\)](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.04.110)) as \"to communicate, directly or indirectly the intent to...\" (list then follows, including \"do any other act which is intended to harm substantially the person threatened or another with respect to his or her health, safety, business, financial condition, or personal relationships\"). That means that a threat is communicating an intent to do something: it is *not* doing the thing. In order to constitute a threat against A, B would have to communicate to A the intent to reveal, rather than just directly revealing. If we assume that that did not happen, the act would not fit the description of a threat.\n\n**Wiretapping**\n\nThere is also [Ch. 9\\.73](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73&full=true#9.73.030), which includes the \"wiretapping\" law. (RCW 9\\.73\\.030, labeled \"Intercepting, recording, or divulging private communication\"). Washington is an all\\-party consent state meaning that all parties have to consent to a recording. Since email is an electronic means of communication and that is all that is required to be within the scope of the law, it might seem that this could be a violation of the wiretapping law. Nevertheless, the law says that\n\n> Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, it shall be unlawful for\n>  any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or the state of\n>  Washington, its agencies, and political subdivisions to intercept, or\n>  record\n\nand notice that the word \"divulge\" is not included in the law. Both parties clearly know that the conversation is being \"recorded\". The section does eventually include \"divulging\" as a permitted (not prohibited) acts:\n\n> (4\\) An employee of any regularly published newspaper, magazine, wire\n>  service, radio station, or television station acting in the course of\n>  bona fide news gathering duties on a full\\-time or contractual or\n>  part\\-time basis, shall be deemed to have consent to record and divulge\n>  communications or conversations otherwise prohibited by this chapter\n>  if the consent is expressly given or if the recording or transmitting\n>  device is readily apparent or obvious to the speakers.\n\nThe section has a number of places where it is specified that one can legally divulge a communication, and nowhere does it prohibit divulging information (recording and intercepting are prohibited, but not divulging). Consequently, those parts of the statutes are without effect. In such a case, the courts are likely to re\\-interpret the wording of the statute so that it is sensible to talk about \"divulging\" (the court always find an intent underlying the words of a legislative body). It might then turn out that the court would find that the statutes also prohibit divulging without consent.

(I don't care if I lose my US citizenship, but I am not willing to naturalize in the UK if it costs my me Irish citizenship)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In summary:\n\n1. Statute law allows Ireland to revoke your naturalisation on the grounds of acquiring another citizenship.\n2. But this law has recently been found unconstitutional.\n3. In practice, the government does not do this anyway.\n4. In the case of the UK, it is particularly unlikely.\n5. As an Irish citizen, there is no particular reason to pursue UK naturalisation.\n\nThe law\n-------\n\nAs of now, the possibility deprivation of Irish nationality for any reason is unclear, because of a ruling of the Supreme Court (*Damache v Minister for Justice* \\[2020] IESC 63\\) that declared the statute allowing for this to be unconstitutional. That was because the law (section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956\\) did not provide enough procedural safeguards. The Minister would initiate the process and make the final decision after expert advice, but was not an \"independent and impartial decision\\-maker\". It is now for the legislature to replace section 19 so as to cure the defect.\n\nUnder section 19, the grounds for revoking a certificate of naturalisation include:\n\n> (b) that the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State\n\nand\n\n> (e) that the person to whom it is granted has by any voluntary act, other than marriage or entry into a civil partnership, acquired another citizenship.\n\nThe issue in *Damache* was (b) following the appellant's conviction for terrorism offences in the United States. Regarding (e), it would seem on its face that acquiring UK nationality might trigger the possibility of revocation. However, in the scenario envisaged, that would leave you without any EU nationality, and in the *Tjebbes* case of 2019 (ECLI:EU:C:2019:189\\) the European Court of Justice found that such deprivation would only be possible after consideration of the specific consequences for the person concerned and their family. This point was not reached in *Damache* but would also tend to rule out any \"automatic\" loss of nationality; it would have to be the result of some longer and more involved process. Whatever replaces section 19 would have to be of this kind.\n\nSpecial considerations also apply if loss of Irish nationality would leave you stateless, but that is not the issue in question.\n\nThe policy\n----------\n\nAside from cases of immigration fraud and terrorism, the State has rarely initiated processes under section 19\\. In fact, official guidance on immigration and nationality admits a policy of dual nationality being allowed.\n\nFor the United Kingdom, there are many people who are dual British and Irish nationals. The understanding between the governments with respect to the Common Travel Area, the Good Friday Agreement, and the general historic situation, would make it very unlikely that Ireland would treat acquisition of British nationality as a problem. The British\\-Irish Agreement of 1998 includes that both governments respect the \"right to hold both British and Irish citizenship\" for the people of Northern Ireland. Even if you are not a person of Northern Ireland, any action by the government of Ireland that would be seen as potentially touching on this right is politically untenable.\n\nIrish citizens have full rights in the UK anyway\n------------------------------------------------\n\nUnder UK law, an Irish citizen can enter without a visa, live there as long as they want, get a job, claim benefits, vote in elections, be elected as an MP, and do everything that a UK citizen can normally do. There may be a vanishingly few exceptions for national security jobs.\n\nBecause of this, there isn't much reason why being naturalised in the UK would be worthwhile. You could do so for sentimental reasons but as far as the UK's concerned, you already hold a status that's just as good.\n\nExtra note: UK honours\n----------------------\n\n(In response to a comment below.)\n\nThe British Crown does grant honours, including knighthoods, to non\\-UK citizens and dual/multiple citizens, in some circumstances. It depends on whether the other nationality has King Charles III as head of state, and the attitude of the foreign government. Therefore, Canadians do not get knighthoods (Charles is King but the Canadian government would rather not), Belizians do (Charles is King and the government is fine with it), and Americans can get it as an honorary award that does not come with the Sir/Dame title.\n\nFor Ireland, Terry Wogan is an example of how this works. He was an Irish citizen who lived and worked in the UK for many years. In order to receive a British knighthood, he had to take up British citizenship (which was granted on an expedited basis), becoming Sir Terry. On the other hand, Bob Geldof is an Irish citizen (only) who holds an honorary British KBE, and is not formally entitled to be Sir Bob \\- much like American recipients such as Rudy Guiliani. The Irish government does not object to either possibility, although some individuals do.\n\nAn American\\-Irish\\-British triple citizen would be able to receive a UK knighthood and use the title Sir, assuming that the British government was willing to grant it, and unless there were some foreign legal blocker (e.g. the U.S. government does not allow federal officeholders to receive overseas decorations)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An individual born in the United States with dual US-Irish citizenship is considering moving to the UK and becoming naturalized as a British citizen.

Those usually include parts about not posting content that goes against the rules or laws. If the user goes against the terms, then they're the one who's responsible; if the forum owner is promoting things that are illegal, then they're the one who's responsible. For example, if they started a thread linking to pirated content and others comment on it, it's still the owner's responsibility for having posted it in the first place even if they didn't know it was pirated at the time. The site owner could change the terms at any time, but changing the terms won't change who was responsible for going against the country's laws. \n\nIn short, if a user posts something against Russian law, it's usually the user who's responsible and if the forum owner wants to moderate those sorts of things it's entirely optional.

Forum owners are typically only held responsible if they actively promote or encourage illegal content. The presence or absence of a license agreement or registration requirement doesn't fundamentally change this dynamic under Russian law. While forum owners may choose to moderate content to maintain a good reputation (like YouTube removing pirated content), they are not inherently responsible for all user-generated content.

If it doesn't apply, then an IP block is superfluous.\n\nWhether GDPR applies is determined by Art 3 GDPR. For this, we must distinguish where the data controller is operating from. It is irrelevant where the site is hosted, but primarily relevant where the data controller (your colleague) has an \u201cestablishment\u201d, e.g. where he resides or typically works from.\n\n* Per Art 3(1\\), GDPR applies to all processing activities in the context of an European establishment, regardless of where the users are.\n\nSo if your colleague were running this site from Europe, they wouldn't be able to circumvent GDPR by blocking European users. However, if your colleague is running this site from outside of Europe, then Art 3(1\\) doesn't trigger.\n* Per Art 3(2\\), GDPR can apply to processing activities where there is no European establishment.\n\nThere is the Art 3(2\\)(a) \u201ctargeting criterion\u201d: if your colleague \u201coffers\u201d goods or services to people who are in Europe, regardless whether paid or gratis, then GDPR applies to all processing activities related to this offer. I'll discuss this more below.\n\nThere is also the Art 3(2\\)(b) criterion: if your colleague monitors the behaviour of people that occurs in Europe, then GDPR applies. For example, an app collecting geolocation information or a website creating interest profiles for ad targeting might trigger this criterion.\n\nAn IP block can help to establish that no offering/monitoring related to people who are in Europe is happening, but it might not be necessary.\n\nIt may be worth talking a bit more about the targeting criterion.\nThe GDPR explicitly says that mere availability of a website in Europe doesn't imply that GDPR would apply. Instead, it is necessary to establish the data controller's *intention* \u2013 are they soliciting users from Europe, or otherwise expecting that people from Europe might use those services? Recital 23 gives a couple of non\\-exhaustive factors that can be considered here, for example:\n\n* the site uses a language or currency used in the EU but not used in the controller's own country\n* the site mentions users or customers from Europe, e.g. in testimonials\n\nThis means that a lot of US websites, written in English or Spanish, only mentioning payment in USD (if any), not mentioning any European countries, will not be subject to GDPR.\n\nThen, occasional European visitors are irrelevant. It wouldn't be necessary to IP\\-block potential European users. However, such an IP\\-based block would help establish that the data controller really doesn't intend for those services to be offered to people who are in Europe. My personal opinion is that it's wasted effort to block users from foreign countries in case their foreign laws claim to apply, but if such a block brings peace of mind that might be worth it.\n\nWhile geoblocking might not be *necessary*, is it *sufficient*? There is no clear guidance on this subject, but it seems to be generally accepted that IP\\-based geoblocking is fine, even though it is trivially circumvented using VPN services. Of course, if a website were to block European IP addresses but were to also advertise that people in Europe can use their services via VPNs, that would probably still be an \u201coffer\u201d and might defeat the point of doing any geoblocking.\n\nThe Art 3(1\\)(a) targeting criterion is most easily applied to things like ecommerce where physical goods are shipped to the customer in return for payment \u2013 so essentially whenever the data controller participates in the EU Single Market. This is roughly similar to the concept of a Nexus in US tax law. But in principle the targeting criterion can also apply to other kinds of websites or apps such as blogs, even if they are gratis. GDPR does not just apply to for\\-profit commercial activity, and doesn't distinguish between controllers that are entities/LLCs and controllers who are natural persons.\n\nThings are slightly more complicated due to the Art 3(2\\)(b) monitoring criterion and the pervasive use of online trackers on websites, but this aspect of the GDPR is difficult to enforce and frequently ignored.\n\nIn this answer, \u201cEurope\u201d means the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), and the United Kingdom (UK). Note that countries like Norway are covered by GDPR, whereas Switzerland is not.

In Australia, for private companies, changes in shareholding require the approval of all existing shareholders. Additionally, the directors need to determine if issuing new shares is in the company's best interest. The issuance of shares must be for something of value to the company, which in turn provides value to existing shareholders. This process ensures fairness and protects the interests of current shareholders.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the board cannot unilaterally decide to issue new shares in a private company without shareholder approval.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, while the value of the shares is important, it doesn't override the requirement for all existing shareholders to approve the issuance.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it's not just a majority vote that's required; all existing shareholders must approve the change in shareholding for a private company in Australia."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67505/can-you-be-prosecuted-for-tax-information-which-would-lead-to-an-overestimate-in", "docs_id": 67505, "title": "Can you be prosecuted for tax information which would lead to an overestimate in the amount of taxes you owe?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose you pay more taxes than you owe, either because you neglect to use a tax credit or deduction that you could claim, you put $0 for charitable giving as a result of forgetfulness, poor record\\-keeping, or wanting to avoid overestimating, etc. The end result is that you end up paying more taxes than what you were required to pay.

That certain people have been known as philosophers, and have put forth particular ideas are facts, not subject to copyright, as long as no one else's description of those ideas is copied or closely imitated. This is true in the US, and also in most of not all ,other countries.\n\nRights in the image and likeness of a person vary among US states, and also between different countries. In most US states any such rights end with the persona's death, or only continue for a few years after death (10 years in some cases). The year of birth is not, as far as I know relevant. The exact length of such rights should be checked if any person being pictured is alive or has died fairly recently. Such rights can protect against the commercial use of even an original (not copied) representation of the person's likeness.\n\nAbout Einstein\n--------------\n\n[Greenlight](http://albert-einstein.org/gotocorbis.html) claims to represent Hebrew University of Jerusalem and to hold marketing rights on images of Einstein for publicity purposes.

However, they ultimately lost. As reported by [CDAS](https://cdas.com/einstein-publicity-rights-deemed-expired-by-california-federal-court/):\n\n> United States District Judge A. Howard Matz rejected Hebrew University\u2019s claim that New Jersey common law provides for an indefinite duration of the postmortem right of publicity, or that it alternatively is coextensive with copyright law and lasts for a minimum of 70 years after a person\u2019s death. Instead, the Court ruled that New Jersey common law postmortem publicity rights endure for no more than 50 years after a person\u2019s death. Because Einstein died in 1955, the Court\u2019s ruling means that Einstein\u2019s publicity rights are now in the public domain.\n\n...\n\n> Judge Matz concluded that the New Jersey Supreme Court would likely limit the postmortem right of publicity under New Jersey common law to endure no more than 50 years after a person\u2019s death. He noted that the New Jersey Legislature has twice declined to enact a statutory postmortem right of publicity, and given the sparse New Jersey case law on the issue, \u201cit is likely that the New Jersey Supreme Court would perceive pitfalls in allowing an unlimited or lengthy term to the right of publicity.\u201d Comparing the right of publicity to New Jersey\u2019s common law right of privacy, the Court recognized that 50 years was a \u201creasonable middle ground\u201d to allow a deceased celebrity\u2019s heir to benefit from the right of publicity, while still respecting the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in free expression.\u201d\n\n[*Mercury News*](https://www.mercurynews.com/2012/10/18/gms-use-of-einstein-image-tasteless-but-not-illegal-judge-says/) reported on the same case, saying:\n\n> But the judge said descendants\u2019 right to control someone\u2019s image after his death must be balanced with the public\u2019s right of expression.\n\n> He also ruled any right Hebrew University had to sue expired in 2005 \u2014 50 years after Einstein\u2019s death \u2014 because that was the limit on copyright law in 1982, when Hebrew University acquired Einstein\u2019s right of publicity."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A game developer is creating an educational card game featuring philosophers, including some born in the last 100 years.

The general rule for interns is that they have \"off-work days\" rather than paid holiday leave. The law doesn't specify what happens to unused paid leave days at the end of an internship contract. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as the intern's entitlement to compensation for unused leave days would depend on the specific terms outlined in their internship contract. The intern should refer to their contract and potentially the \"convention collective\" (collective labor agreement) specific to the company's field of work to determine if they are entitled to compensation for unused leave days."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14572/multiple-claimants-for-a-single-act-of-deceit-in-uk-law", "docs_id": 14572, "title": "Multiple claimants for a single act of deceit in UK law", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A case caught my attention recently:\n\nIn it, person A commits both breach of contract and also the tort of deceit in lying about an asset they fraudulently sold for about 6 figures.

According to the LawStackExchange documentation, a wrongful act may cause damage to multiple parties, and each of those parties has the right to seek compensation independently of others. The settlement between A and B does not automatically preclude C from pursuing their own claim, especially since C was not party to that settlement agreement. While combining claims might be preferable from a procedural standpoint, it is not a legal requirement that would bar C from seeking compensation for their own damages.

While all employees in Australia are covered by state-based Worker's Compensation insurance, the scenario presents several complications. The employee did not follow the required procedures, such as being seen by a registered Australian doctor and receiving a Workers Compensation certificate. Additionally, benefits are typically suspended if the claimant leaves the country. However, the injury did occur at work in Australia, so the employee may still have a valid claim.

What company doesn't have their hand in downloadable software? There is at least one company in every possible industry with some form of downloadable software, like a mobile app. Does the USPTO distinguish between downloadable software?\n\nFor instance, I want to trademark a name for a social network (via mobile app) targeted to a specific segment of consumers. However, that name is trademarked by a video game company for their video\\-game development software.

The USPTO requires specific descriptions for software trademarks, not just broad categories like \"downloadable software.\" The software company should apply for the trademark in IC009 with a detailed description of their social networking app's function and purpose. Additionally, they may need to apply under IC042 (or similar categories) for the social networking services aspect.

We're in Boulder County, Colorado.\n\nA representative from one of those construction companies pointed out some damage and offered to meet with the insurance adjuster, which he did. Our insurance company wrote us a check to cover some of the hail damage.\n\nAfter emphatically explaining how amazing his replacement windows are, he produced an iPad and asked me to \"sign\". I foolishly squiggled on the screen. Here's what it said:\n\n> * Quote is valid until ADD DATE HERE\n> * CCC has a \"no return policy\" on windows, doors, glass, and sashes.\n> * Project time line \\- Window delivery \\- 8 weeks, Prefinish work \\- 2\\-3 weeks, Install \\- 2 weeks.\n> * Standard Payment Terms are 50% down at time of order, 25% due upon delivery to CCC shop, and remainder due upon completion of work.\n> * Pricing based on payment by check or cash. 3% will be added for payment by credit card.\n> * If job cannot be completed (i.e. due to backordered items, remakes, etc) customer will be responsible for full payment for portion of job completed up to that point.\n> * If acceptable, please sign and return along with 50% down payment. Thank you!\n> * I confirm that my action here represents my electronic signature and is binding.\n\nAt the time I did not write him a check because I wanted to discuss the scope of the job with my wife. The windows in our house are a bit old, so it would make sense to replace them all at once, and not just the ones that sustained hail damage.\n\nAdmittedly, I don't know much about windows (or the legal ramifications of squiggling on an iPad screen). That evening, as a sanity check, I looked at Google/Yelp reviews for the window make/model and saw that almost every review had the lowest possible rating. I reached out to the guy and explained that we could not move forward with his recommendation, and I asked him to quote products that rated highly in Consumer Reports, which he did.\n\nAt that time, he had not ordered any windows from his supplier, so things weren't yet set\\-in\\-stone (even though I had stupidly squiggled on the iPad). A few hours later, we received a quote that was almost twice the previous estimate. Because of the large amount of money at stake, I decided to get a second quote. His quote was 76% more expensive than Lowes for exactly the same product. In cash terms, Lowes was $10k cheaper.\n\nSo, regardless of the squiggle on the iPad, I decided *not* to move forward with the exorbitant quote. When I mentioned this, he sent me an email saying:\n\n> in order to break out of the contract we think it would be fair to charge for the time we have put into all of this.

Even though I screwed up by squiggling on the iPad, I think this is a somewhat predatory sales practice. From my perspective, he tried to rip me off and then sent me a bill for the trouble.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, is my position defensible? I did squiggle, after all.\n\nupdate\n------\n\nI took another peek at the electronic document I squiggled on and notice that it's in my wife's name. My name doesn't appear anywhere on the document.

You have agreed, and now you are know the downside of that agreement. However, Colorado law gives you a special privilege to cancel certain contracts, and this may be one: [here is the law](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/crs2017-title-05.pdf).

One exception is that you cannot cancel an agreement for \nan \"emergency requiring immediate remedy\" (there will be paperwork regarding that). A \"home solicitation sale\" is one that\n\n> solicits the sale and the buyer's agreement or offer to purchase is\n>  given to the seller or a person acting for the seller at a residence\n\nwhich matches the facts as you describe them.

Under Colorado law, which of the following statements is correct regarding the homeowner's right to cancel?\n\nA) The homeowner has no right to cancel because they signed an electronic agreement.\n\nB) The homeowner can cancel within three business days, but only if they pay a cancellation fee.\n\nC) The homeowner has an unconditional right to cancel within three business days of signing the agreement.\n\nD) The homeowner can only cancel if they can prove the contractor used fraudulent tactics.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Colorado Revised Statute \u00a75-3-402, in a home solicitation sale, the buyer has the right to cancel the sale until midnight of the third business day after signing an agreement or offer to purchase. This right is unconditional and does not require payment of a fee or proof of fraud. The law specifically applies to situations where a seller solicits a sale at the buyer's residence, which matches the scenario described.
